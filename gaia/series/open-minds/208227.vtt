>>SHERRIE DILLARD: I grew up
seeing and feeling and knowing

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.610 align:middle line:84%
more of an
extrasensory existence.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.700 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I
try to bring to others

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:24.220 align:middle line:84%
is not so much to look at it and
to feel it as groundbreaking,

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.240 align:middle line:84%
shaky, kind of scary, but to
look at it more as a comfort,

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.130 align:middle line:90%
more as a way to find peace.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.480 align:middle line:84%
What brings us the most help in
life, what opens doors for us,

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.692 align:middle line:84%

is an act of courage.

>>REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

>>DILLARD: Listen and act on it.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.200 align:middle line:90%
Be the fool.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.740 align:middle line:84%
The truth of it is that anyone
who's connecting with spirit

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.910 align:middle line:84%
and they know something,
there's a knowing of love.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.240 align:middle line:84%
I have come to the
awareness that there's

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.650 align:middle line:84%
an acceleration happening
with our need to awaken.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.170 align:middle line:84%
Choosing truth, choosing
their authenticity,

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.120 align:middle line:84%
and choosing what they
know in their heart

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.629 align:middle line:84%
is right for them doesn't lead
to the ruin that they think.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.220 align:middle line:84%
It actually-- it leads to
power, it leads to mastery,

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.920 align:middle line:90%
and it leads to abundance.

everything else having

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.550 align:middle line:84%
to do with passing from

especially how we can have

And when I say and
everything in between,

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.630 align:middle line:90%
we've got a lot to talk about.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.590 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Sherrie.

>>REGINA: It's good
to have you here.

00:01:45.702 --> 00:01:47.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DILLARD: I'm
humbled to be here.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So first of all,
I really like for people

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.340 align:middle line:84%
to get to know my
guests beforehand,

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.380 align:middle line:84%
just because people
who are mediums

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.520 align:middle line:84%
always have a trippy
story about their youth.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.580 align:middle line:84%
So tell us just a
little bit about what

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.010 align:middle line:84%
it was like growing up
into the abilities you have

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.320 align:middle line:84%
and kind of how you were
handled by your family

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.840 align:middle line:84%
and such so we just
get to know you a bit.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.050 align:middle line:10%
>>DILLARD: Well, like
quite a few mediums,

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.610 align:middle line:10%
I was aware of spirit
from a very young age.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.680 align:middle line:10%
Part of my story is that I
had a sister who passed over

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.930 align:middle line:10%
at birth right before I was--

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.410 align:middle line:10%
nine months later, nine and
1/2 months later, I was born.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.300 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty impossible to have
happened, but it was very fast.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.870 align:middle line:90%
My mother had me.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.030 align:middle line:90%
And I was always aware of her.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.130 align:middle line:84%
I think that we must
have passed each other.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.590 align:middle line:84%
I was coming in and
she was going out.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And it never seemed to
me to be odd or unusual.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And I grew up seeing and
feeling and knowing kind of more

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.130 align:middle line:90%
of an extrasensory existence.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.400 align:middle line:84%
So I never went through some
of what some people do where

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.200 align:middle line:90%
it seemed to shake my world.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.010 align:middle line:90%
It didn't.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.480 align:middle line:84%
It just seemed
comfortable, normal,

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.550 align:middle line:84%
and I really enjoyed it, so
much so that I almost wanted

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.620 align:middle line:90%
to keep it to myself too.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.740 align:middle line:84%
I would go out into the
woods and I would just

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.010 align:middle line:90%
feel what was there.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.620 align:middle line:84%
I would feel and
I would see, and I

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.640 align:middle line:84%
would be able to have a sense of
peace with that, no matter what

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.570 align:middle line:90%
happened in the day.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.170 align:middle line:84%
Because I came from a family
that was pretty dysfunctional,

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.760 align:middle line:90%
and my mother worked a lot.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.630 align:middle line:84%
My father had left when
all four of us were young.

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.480 align:middle line:84%
And that was my
solace, was spirit.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.202 align:middle line:84%
And I really am so
thankful for that.

00:03:31.202 --> 00:03:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of the
things I try to bring

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.720 align:middle line:84%
to others is not so
much to look at it

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.670 align:middle line:84%
and to feel it as
groundbreaking, shaky,

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.700 align:middle line:84%
kind of scary, but to look
at it more as a comfort,

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:45.893 align:middle line:90%
more as a way to find peace.

00:03:45.893 --> 00:03:48.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And was your
family comfortable with that?

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.250 align:middle line:84%
Because obviously, you would
say things as time went on.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.542 align:middle line:90%
You would share certain things.

00:03:51.542 --> 00:03:54.330 align:middle line:90%
Were they comfortable with you?

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.000 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: Not really, no.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.730 align:middle line:84%
But it was not
because specifically

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:59.720 align:middle line:90%
of that connection.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.920 align:middle line:84%
It was more that I had a
way of seeing and knowing

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.910 align:middle line:84%
things about them that I
didn't really recognize

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.110 align:middle line:90%
at the time was intuitive.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.180 align:middle line:84%
To me it was just
obvious, and I thought

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.910 align:middle line:84%
everybody was aware of
it, and they did not

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.140 align:middle line:90%
like a lot of what I said.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.800 align:middle line:90%
They were naked.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.640 align:middle line:84%
They were really naked
when they were with you.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.700 align:middle line:90%
And that is this--

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.590 align:middle line:84%
I think for a lot of
people, their reticence

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.290 align:middle line:84%
being around psychics, people
who don't go to psychics,

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:28.418 align:middle line:90%
is exactly that.

00:04:28.418 --> 00:04:29.835 align:middle line:84%
I don't want anyone
looking at me.

00:04:29.835 --> 00:04:30.560 align:middle line:90%
Uh-uh.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: Right.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.878 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everyone wants
to keep their secrets.

00:04:32.878 --> 00:04:37.460 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to jump into
you started doing this work.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.590 align:middle line:84%
How did you start actually
doing this, embracing it

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.680 align:middle line:84%
in the last 30 years, and just
committing yourself to it?

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DILLARD: Well,
I was-- actually

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.850 align:middle line:84%
had no intention of doing
this professionally.

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.910 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, it was almost
like when I was a child.

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.260 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to keep it to myself.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.020 align:middle line:84%
I wanted it to be a
part of my world, part

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.570 align:middle line:90%
of what I went to for peace.

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And I was an artist, and
I kept getting the message

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.560 align:middle line:84%
to work with people,
work with people.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And I would think, OK,
well, I will one day.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.680 align:middle line:84%
Give me a little bit
more time as an artist.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
bargaining about that.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.100 align:middle line:84%
No, give me till the
end of the season,

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.960 align:middle line:90%
and then I'll work with people.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.450 align:middle line:84%
And I just kept prolonging
it, prolonging it.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And then one very
sunny, beautiful day, I

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.320 align:middle line:84%
was driving down a
very uncrowded street,

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.890 align:middle line:84%
and someone ran a stop
sign, and they hit me,

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:29.990 align:middle line:84%
hit my car right at
the driver's seat.

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.340 align:middle line:90%
Like, right into.

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.920 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't have
a lot of injuries

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.790 align:middle line:84%
because I had my
seatbelt on, and I was--

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.550 align:middle line:90%
it was a pretty sturdy car.

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.720 align:middle line:84%
But I had enough that I couldn't
do the kind of art I was doing.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:42.980 align:middle line:90%
I just couldn't.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.350 align:middle line:84%
My arms couldn't handle
it, my shoulders.

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:49.880 align:middle line:84%
So basically, as my car
was spinning in the air,

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.518 align:middle line:84%
because it actually spun
around, I said, OK, I get it.

00:05:53.518 --> 00:05:54.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I hear you now.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.060 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: I'll do it.

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.670 align:middle line:84%
That was the very first thing
that came to me was, OK.

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:00.470 align:middle line:90%
I get it.

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:01.270 align:middle line:90%
I'll do it.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what's so funny
is I interviewed another medium

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.442 align:middle line:84%
not long ago, and it was
a car wreck that really--

00:06:06.442 --> 00:06:07.400 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: Interesting.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:07.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so it's
like, wait a minute.

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.040 align:middle line:90%
You guys are psychic.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.960 align:middle line:84%
Why do you have to
be hit by a car?

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.300 align:middle line:84%
Like other people, you're
like Dannion Brinkley,

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.780 align:middle line:90%
hit by lightning three times.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:16.580 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: Right.

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:17.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or whatever.

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:18.800 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, OK.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.370 align:middle line:90%
So even you guys don't listen.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:21.170 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: Exactly.

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:22.190 align:middle line:90%
We sure don't.

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.460 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] We learn to listen.

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:24.260 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.427 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So then you began.

00:06:25.427 --> 00:06:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And how did it start for
you when you first started?

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.640 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you're relatively young.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And how did you start
working with people

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.560 align:middle line:84%
once they said, OK, get
out there and do it?

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DILLARD: It was
something that I never--

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.000 align:middle line:84%
and I still don't have any
knowledge of how it happened

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.350 align:middle line:90%
and how it still happens.

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:47.990 align:middle line:90%


00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.485 align:middle line:84%
People literally started
asking me for readings.

00:06:50.485 --> 00:06:52.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They just started
asking out of the blue.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:53.930 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: Well, they did.

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:55.880 align:middle line:90%
They would say--

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.610 align:middle line:84%
I think I was already
noticing things about people

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.490 align:middle line:84%
or just in conversation
saying things, kind

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:02.900 align:middle line:90%
of as I was, again, as a kid.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.887 align:middle line:90%
And I think they said, wow.

00:07:04.887 --> 00:07:05.720 align:middle line:90%
How'd you know that?

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:06.290 align:middle line:90%
I said, I don't know.

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:07.640 align:middle line:90%
These things just come to me.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.673 align:middle line:84%
And so they said,
well, tell me more.

00:07:09.673 --> 00:07:11.340 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
about this in my life?

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.007 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
about that in my life?

00:07:13.007 --> 00:07:20.420 align:middle line:84%
And the medium story came later,
a little bit-- not much later,

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:24.710 align:middle line:84%
because I really didn't
want to do that part of it.

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.040 align:middle line:90%
But I was on a bus.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.110 align:middle line:84%
It was in Santa
Clara, California.

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:33.590 align:middle line:84%
I was actually volunteering
at a homeless shelter then.

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And a man was sitting
next to me who

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:42.560 align:middle line:84%
was a little disheveled-looking,
but he had a suit on.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And as I was sitting
there next to him,

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.220 align:middle line:90%
I kept seeing his mother.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And she kept saying to
me, tell him I love him.

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:50.460 align:middle line:90%
Tell him I love him.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:51.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm OK.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:52.760 align:middle line:90%
Tell him I love him.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, gosh,
he's going to think

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:55.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm cuckoo saying that.

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:56.750 align:middle line:90%
Your mom?

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:57.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A stranger.

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:58.180 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: Right.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:00.780 align:middle line:84%
So I turned to him and
said something to him,

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.810 align:middle line:90%
and he started talking about--

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:04.970 align:middle line:84%
he was on his way to
his mother's funeral.

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And I said, oh, does
she have long, dark hair

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:09.810 align:middle line:90%
and she died of a heart attack?

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:11.180 align:middle line:90%
And she went pretty quickly.

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And he was stunned,
and he looked at me,

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:15.680 align:middle line:84%
and he said-- and I told
him, well, she loves you.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.690 align:middle line:84%
She really wants
you to know that.

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:22.550 align:middle line:84%
And then I got off very quickly
from the bus, and that's--

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:24.980 align:middle line:84%
again, I had learned from
the accident was, OK.

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:28.580 align:middle line:84%
I'll start talking to
people when they come in.

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
developed a clientele.

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:30.650 align:middle line:90%
They found you.

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:31.790 align:middle line:90%
People found you.

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And I love this
one story about one

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.370 align:middle line:90%
of the skeptics that came in.

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And so this woman came
in, probably cajoled

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.015 align:middle line:90%
by a friend or something.

00:08:41.015 --> 00:08:41.900 align:middle line:90%
Just go do it.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:42.950 align:middle line:90%
She'll tell you stuff.

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:46.400 align:middle line:84%
So she comes in defensive,
and she's like, well, I

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.345 align:middle line:90%
want to talk to my mom.

00:08:48.345 --> 00:08:49.970 align:middle line:84%
How do I know you're
talking to my mom?

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And you start describing what
her mom looks like, right?

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.200 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: Right.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
were very specific.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:55.930 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't look
anything like you.

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:57.388 align:middle line:84%
She's blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

00:08:57.388 --> 00:08:58.390 align:middle line:90%
And she's like, OK.

00:08:58.390 --> 00:08:59.190 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:00.730 align:middle line:84%
But how do I know
the stuff you're

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:02.445 align:middle line:90%
telling me is from my mother?

00:09:02.445 --> 00:09:04.570 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell the rest of
the story about the pillow

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:04.960 align:middle line:90%
cushions?

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:05.560 align:middle line:90%
I love this story.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.727 align:middle line:84%
>>DILLARD: Yeah, there's
actually two funny stories.

00:09:07.727 --> 00:09:09.192 align:middle line:90%
That one was--

00:09:09.192 --> 00:09:11.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now she's saying,
how do I know it's your mom?

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:12.450 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: Right.

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And what the mother
in spirit was showing

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:20.500 align:middle line:84%
me was a stain that she had
made on the couch cushion.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And she told me to
tell her, she said,

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:26.390 align:middle line:84%
oh, I know you turned it over to
hide it, but I know it's there.

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:27.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:29.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DILLARD: And so that kind
of won her over completely.

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:30.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:32.410 align:middle line:84%
She's like, that's
beyond randomness.

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:33.658 align:middle line:90%
That's one in gajillions.

00:09:33.658 --> 00:09:35.200 align:middle line:84%
What's another funny
story like that?

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DILLARD: Well, one
very similar was--

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:42.410 align:middle line:84%
actually, it was a German
woman, and she was from Germany.

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:44.110 align:middle line:90%
She was very staunch.

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:48.940 align:middle line:84%
You know, really wanted to
know and focused with me.

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And she too didn't
really buy into it,

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.500 align:middle line:84%
that I was talking
to her mother.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.480 align:middle line:90%
And her mother said--

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:00.630 align:middle line:84%
and I'll never forget this one,
because it was so specific.

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:02.610 align:middle line:84%
She said, oh, tell
her I know she's too

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:05.550 align:middle line:90%
cheap to re-tile her kitchen.

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:09.060 align:middle line:84%
I know there's broken tiles
that she puts things over.

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.340 align:middle line:84%
And I told her
that and she just--

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.905 align:middle line:84%
her jaw dropped,
because she, you know--

00:10:13.905 --> 00:10:15.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's how
you get their attention.

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.190 align:middle line:84%
>>DILLARD: That's how
you get their attention.

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:17.460 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:18.293 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:10:18.293 --> 00:10:19.350 align:middle line:90%
That's a great story.

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:22.620 align:middle line:84%
So now let's just kind of launch
into kind of the phenomena

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:24.220 align:middle line:90%
of what you're seeing at large.

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And we can get specific
here and there,

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:28.860 align:middle line:84%
but one of the things
you say is no matter

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.620 align:middle line:84%
what the quality
of a person's life

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:37.050 align:middle line:84%
was, doesn't matter what you've
done, once we transition,

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:40.230 align:middle line:84%
you're met with this incredible,
all-encompassing love.

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:41.940 align:middle line:90%
And this seems to be universal.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:43.000 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: Absolutely.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:43.380 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.713 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Talk about this a bit.

00:10:44.713 --> 00:10:47.240 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: Yeah, absolutely.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:51.340 align:middle line:90%
It's a kind of love that--

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:53.740 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of hard to describe,
because we haven't really

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:57.430 align:middle line:84%
felt it that much
here as Earthlings.

00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:59.230 align:middle line:84%
It's a love that's
transformative

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:00.985 align:middle line:90%
and at the same time--

00:11:00.985 --> 00:11:03.550 align:middle line:84%
you had said earlier
how people don't always

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:07.640 align:middle line:84%
feel comfortable with psychics
because they may know things.

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:11.080 align:middle line:84%
The truth of it is that anyone
who's connecting with spirit

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:17.220 align:middle line:84%
and they know something,
there's a knowing of love.

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:22.790 align:middle line:84%
And when we go over and we
become aware more clearly

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:24.380 align:middle line:84%
of some of the
things that maybe we

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:27.860 align:middle line:84%
could have chosen a
different way to do that,

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:31.490 align:middle line:84%
or we could have chosen
to express more love

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:34.160 align:middle line:84%
or forgiveness or
non-judgementalness

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:39.280 align:middle line:84%
that love is a love that's
penetratingly truthful,

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:42.036 align:middle line:90%
but the core of it is love.

00:11:42.036 --> 00:11:43.250 align:middle line:90%
It's acceptance.

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:44.520 align:middle line:90%
It's non-judgement.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Could
it kind of border

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:50.590 align:middle line:84%
on what we would call
extreme compassion and grace?

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:52.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DILLARD: Oh,
absolutely, grace.

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:52.990 align:middle line:90%
That's very good.

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:54.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's absolutely right.

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:55.630 align:middle line:90%
It's grace is what it is.

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:56.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
we're all humans.

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:57.450 align:middle line:90%
We've all screwed up.

00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:58.250 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: Yeah.

00:11:58.250 --> 00:11:59.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If not
now, another time.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:01.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DILLARD: And the
thing about grace

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:03.460 align:middle line:90%
too is grace is a phenomena.

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:08.230 align:middle line:84%
It's a transformative gift
of this higher awareness

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:09.760 align:middle line:90%
and higher being.

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:14.200 align:middle line:84%
So what we did here and what
it may have looked like,

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.570 align:middle line:84%
we can kind of even
laugh at it sometimes,

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:22.570 align:middle line:84%
because we see the humor even
of our missteps and the ability

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:26.290 align:middle line:84%
to rise into a higher awareness,
because we can see that

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:27.710 align:middle line:90%
and we can forgive ourselves.

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:31.905 align:middle line:84%
It's like an opportunity
to practice that more.

00:12:31.905 --> 00:12:33.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there
must be people

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:36.100 align:middle line:84%
who feel like they've
done some bad things,

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:39.160 align:middle line:84%
and they have done things
that we consider bad on Earth.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.530 align:middle line:90%
Harmed others and such.

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:43.780 align:middle line:84%
What's it like for them
when they move over

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:44.652 align:middle line:90%
to the other side?

00:12:44.652 --> 00:12:46.360 align:middle line:84%
Because there must be
a little resistance

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.625 align:middle line:84%
if there was ever a thought of
a life review in particular.

00:12:48.625 --> 00:12:49.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: Yeah, absolutely.

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:51.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what's
that journey like?

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:52.750 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: It depends.

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:58.660 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes if someone is
really resistant and very

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:02.260 align:middle line:84%
fearful about being what they
would think of would be judged,

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:07.810 align:middle line:84%
they will sometimes not
go completely over too.

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:11.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they'll pass over
out of the physical body,

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:14.500 align:middle line:90%
but they won't go into--

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.187 align:middle line:90%
there's kind of like this--

00:13:16.187 --> 00:13:17.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Purgatory?

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:17.820 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:19.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DILLARD: Well,
it's not purgatory.

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:24.800 align:middle line:84%
What it is is it's still in
the light, but their lack of--

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:28.570 align:middle line:84%
there's so much resistance
there, they get bound up.

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And so they don't
experience it--

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is it in the
realm we would oftentimes

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:36.352 align:middle line:84%
call ghosts and phenomena
that's still fairly physical?

00:13:36.352 --> 00:13:37.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DILLARD: It's a
little different.

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:41.950 align:middle line:84%
Ghosts will cling
for an energy source

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:43.240 align:middle line:90%
here in the physical world.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.700 align:middle line:10%
That's why they'll
cling to places

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.910 align:middle line:10%
that have more energy, because
they're needing that energy

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:50.632 align:middle line:10%
to remain in more of a--

00:13:50.632 --> 00:13:52.840 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So they don't want
to let go of this world.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:53.640 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: Right.

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:57.430 align:middle line:84%
Now people who resist or
who are fearful to go over

00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:00.490 align:middle line:84%
don't always become ghosts in
the way that we think of them,

00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:02.980 align:middle line:84%
but they will kind
of be out there

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:08.380 align:middle line:84%
with this resistance and feeling
kind of alone with it until--

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.240 align:middle line:84%
something will always
come along from spirit

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:14.832 align:middle line:84%
to open them to love, and then
the transformation will happen.

00:14:14.832 --> 00:14:15.790 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, you're right.

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:19.263 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times ghosts will
come from that resistance.

00:14:19.263 --> 00:14:21.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because when you
hear of the more negative

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:23.420 align:middle line:84%
poltergeist action and
so forth, oftentimes.

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:24.220 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: Right.

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:26.178 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we talked
about it in the opening,

00:14:26.178 --> 00:14:29.500 align:middle line:84%
I brought it up that people
are dying in larger numbers

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:31.810 align:middle line:84%
than we've been accustomed
to of all age groups.

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:36.580 align:middle line:84%
Some of it is just
exasperation, fatigue, suicide,

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:38.290 align:middle line:90%
chronic disease.

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:39.820 align:middle line:90%
It's not just COVID.

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:45.707 align:middle line:84%
So in your line of work, can
you talk about what's going on?

00:14:45.707 --> 00:14:47.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DILLARD: I thought
a lot about that,

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:51.830 align:middle line:84%
because it has been a
phenomena in the past two,

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:52.990 align:middle line:90%
three years maybe.

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:56.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's been increasing much
more, especially with COVID.

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:57.647 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In young people.

00:14:57.647 --> 00:14:58.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: Oh, gosh.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:03.280 align:middle line:84%
So many young people now with
drugs, suicides, illness,

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:05.320 align:middle line:90%
tumors, everything.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.980 align:middle line:90%
Death is the great awakener.

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:13.440 align:middle line:84%
And not only do the people
who pass over awaken,

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.840 align:middle line:84%
but the family
and the loved ones

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.270 align:middle line:84%
of those who've
passed over also go

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:22.080 align:middle line:84%
through a similar
transformative experience.

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And I have come to the
awareness through my guides

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:31.770 align:middle line:84%
that there's an acceleration
happening with our need

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:33.790 align:middle line:90%
to awaken.

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And our resistance
leads to opportunities,

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:42.480 align:middle line:84%
although we wouldn't think
of it as opportunities.

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.640 align:middle line:84%
But from spirit, from
our soul perspective,

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:47.970 align:middle line:84%
it's an opportunity for
incredible growth and opening.

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And death, passing
over, is probably

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:57.760 align:middle line:84%
the biggest event that happens
that awakens us and opens us.

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.310 align:middle line:10%
And I think that if
we can consciously

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:04.240 align:middle line:10%
choose to evolve right now and
become more aware that we're

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:07.630 align:middle line:10%
on a soul path, then
it feels to me--

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:10.540 align:middle line:10%
and what I've been kind
of given from my guides

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:14.860 align:middle line:10%
is that we can come into a place
more balanced with passing.

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:17.320 align:middle line:84%
But the resistance
that we're confronting

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:20.020 align:middle line:84%
right now through our
own lack sometimes

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:26.650 align:middle line:84%
of wanting to evolve, love
more, be more kind, judgemental

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:30.850 align:middle line:84%
is actually intensifying the
number of people passing over.

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:33.430 align:middle line:90%


00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:36.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when you talk about
the great awakening in this--

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.830 align:middle line:84%
so we've passed
over from whatever.

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:41.425 align:middle line:84%
Say we've taken our
own lives or whatnot.

00:16:41.425 --> 00:16:44.380 align:middle line:90%


00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:47.440 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
life review process.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.570 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about the
ways in which when we die

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:51.487 align:middle line:84%
we're kind of ushered
here and there in a bit.

00:16:51.487 --> 00:16:54.590 align:middle line:84%
But let's hop forward to that
life review process, because it

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:56.050 align:middle line:90%
kind of factors into this.

00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:57.450 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: Right.

00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:04.540 align:middle line:84%
The life review, it's a space
with our most beautiful,

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:06.910 align:middle line:90%
harmonious heart, our soul.

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And part of the beauty and
the grace of the life review

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:13.850 align:middle line:84%
is that we are allowed and we
get to see who we really, truly

00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:14.650 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:16.390 align:middle line:90%
We experience that.

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:20.920 align:middle line:84%
Simultaneously,
we view our lives

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:22.869 align:middle line:84%
and we view the
times in our life

00:17:22.869 --> 00:17:26.650 align:middle line:84%
where there were choices that
we could make, and we did make.

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And we see more so than
we're able to see here

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:32.530 align:middle line:90%
a lot of the time how that--

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:34.960 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes they're
very small choices too,

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:36.500 align:middle line:90%
or we think they are.

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:40.780 align:middle line:84%
But how that choice really
changed the trajectory

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:42.400 align:middle line:90%
of our evolution.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:46.530 align:middle line:84%
And in that life review,
there's a process--

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:49.110 align:middle line:84%
we talked a little earlier
about that non-judgement

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.160 align:middle line:90%
and that love.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.230 align:middle line:10%
And the life review
really is a time

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:55.090 align:middle line:10%
of immense love and immense
awakening and awareness.

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:56.685 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not
someone judging you

00:17:56.685 --> 00:17:58.150 align:middle line:90%
in the scales of justice.

00:17:58.150 --> 00:17:58.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: No.

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:00.150 align:middle line:90%
There's no judgement.

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:00.950 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:05.490 align:middle line:84%
There's awareness, but there's
no condemnation at all.

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:06.290 align:middle line:90%
None.

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:07.090 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:08.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we go
through this process,

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:11.460 align:middle line:84%
and what is the
most common theme

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:16.478 align:middle line:84%
in what people find about their
lives that they didn't expect?

00:18:16.478 --> 00:18:19.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DILLARD: You know what I
found lately is powerless,

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:22.600 align:middle line:90%
feeling powerless.

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:26.920 align:middle line:84%
It's been coming up a lot
lately with people where they

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.450 align:middle line:90%
thought they were powerless.

00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:30.760 align:middle line:84%
They thought there
was nothing they

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:33.490 align:middle line:84%
could do that would change
anything in their life,

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:37.330 align:middle line:84%
or they could not
speak their truth,

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:39.430 align:middle line:84%
or they could not make
a choice that they

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:42.490 align:middle line:84%
knew was in their
highest good out of fear.

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:46.180 align:middle line:84%
Out of fear of, what
would happen to me?

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:47.560 align:middle line:90%
What will happen to my job?

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:49.910 align:middle line:84%
What will happen to
my relationships?

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:51.520 align:middle line:90%
What will happen to my mortgage?

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And what people I've
found in the life review

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.100 align:middle line:84%
are understanding
more and more is

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.740 align:middle line:84%
that choosing truth,
choosing their authenticity,

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:01.690 align:middle line:84%
and choosing what
they in their heart

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:05.200 align:middle line:84%
is right for them doesn't lead
to the ruin that they think.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:09.850 align:middle line:84%
It actually-- it leads to
power, it leads to mastery,

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:13.750 align:middle line:90%
and it leads to abundance.

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:17.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So most people don't
make decisions based on that.

00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:20.560 align:middle line:84%
They make decisions
based on practical needs,

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:22.400 align:middle line:90%
instrumental thinking.

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And I have to do this
so I can get this.

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.790 align:middle line:84%
You're always a few
degrees of separation

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:30.580 align:middle line:84%
from what your heart's
trying to tell you to go for.

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:33.100 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the population, a lot
of the people watching this

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:36.500 align:middle line:84%
are already doing this, and
some are thinking about it.

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.800 align:middle line:84%
They can feel something
as we're speaking

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:41.110 align:middle line:84%
pulling on their heart to
make this decision they've

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:42.520 align:middle line:90%
been resistant to.

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And so you're saying, if we
can just have the courage

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:48.680 align:middle line:84%
to make those decisions, we
have all the power in the world.

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:51.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DILLARD: Let me give you an
example that happened to me.

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:53.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:57.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DILLARD: I had been giving
readings for several years,

00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:04.190 align:middle line:84%
and I was separating from
my husband at the time.

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:07.370 align:middle line:84%
I was so fearful of
separating because--

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:10.820 align:middle line:84%
not for me, because I knew that
I could take care of myself.

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:14.450 align:middle line:84%
I was really concerned
about my children's college,

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:15.650 align:middle line:90%
of all things.

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:17.880 align:middle line:90%
I was very concerned.

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:19.070 align:middle line:90%
He owned a company.

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:20.635 align:middle line:90%
He was doing--

00:20:20.635 --> 00:20:22.010 align:middle line:84%
I won't get into
the whole thing,

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:24.410 align:middle line:84%
but there was a lot of
money that wasn't accounted

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:26.060 align:middle line:90%
for that he was making.

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:29.270 align:middle line:90%
So I knew that there was no--

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:31.760 align:middle line:84%
I knew he would not
pay for their college,

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.020 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't have the money.

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And that was one
of the reasons I

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:37.670 align:middle line:84%
felt I needed to
stay in the marriage.

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And I remember talking
to my guides about it,

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:42.380 align:middle line:90%
and I had this awareness.

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:44.210 align:middle line:90%
There was no choice here.

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:45.320 align:middle line:90%
And I do this still.

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.320 align:middle line:84%
Whatever I become
fearful of, I go into it.

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:52.910 align:middle line:84%
Because what happened
was I said, OK.

00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:54.650 align:middle line:90%
I have to go through with this.

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:55.820 align:middle line:90%
It was not right for me.

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:57.200 align:middle line:90%
It was limiting me.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:03.140 align:middle line:84%
For my own evolution, I had to
leave the marriage and move on.

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And when my children's
college came up--

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:10.910 align:middle line:84%
they were a couple of years away
from it, my son went first--

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:13.610 align:middle line:84%
he got a full scholarship
to Cooper Union

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:16.700 align:middle line:84%
in New York City, which
was pretty unheard of.

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:22.250 align:middle line:84%
Four years, full tuition,
plus living expenses.

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:24.680 align:middle line:84%
My daughter, two
years later, got

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:28.010 align:middle line:84%
a full four-year scholarship
to UNC in Chapel Hill,

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:32.210 align:middle line:84%
and then got a full scholarship
to a master's degree.

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:33.202 align:middle line:90%
And you see what--

00:21:33.202 --> 00:21:34.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah, no.

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.430 align:middle line:90%
This is a beautiful story.

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:37.940 align:middle line:84%
And I think everyone watching
you right now can relate

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:39.260 align:middle line:90%
to this and say, oh my god.

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:41.990 align:middle line:84%
I've been making decisions
for that exact same reason.

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:44.000 align:middle line:90%
And look what happened.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.340 align:middle line:84%
More than you could have
ever dreamed or imagined.

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:48.990 align:middle line:84%
Your kids were
already so capable.

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:50.395 align:middle line:90%
So I love that.

00:21:50.395 --> 00:21:51.770 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
sharing that story.

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:53.240 align:middle line:84%
That should embolden
some people,

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:56.690 align:middle line:84%
because the things we
hang on to out of fear,

00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:58.280 align:middle line:90%
it's not serving us.

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And for some people, it means
giving up their own lives.

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:02.210 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:05.090 align:middle line:84%
They don't want-- they don't
want the powerlessness.

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:06.150 align:middle line:90%
They don't want the fear.

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:09.200 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to live
in a world they feel--

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:12.050 align:middle line:84%
at large, humanity is
powerless right now.

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:14.210 align:middle line:84%
There's a huge
overwhelm of feeling

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:17.210 align:middle line:84%
powerless in the face of
larger events right now too.

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:20.060 align:middle line:84%
So I can understand why
people are jumping off.

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:22.920 align:middle line:84%
So they go through this and
they've made their choices.

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:25.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they've looked at this
compassionate, grace-filled

00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:27.860 align:middle line:90%
review of their life.

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:30.260 align:middle line:84%
And you were telling me
off camera, the things

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:33.530 align:middle line:84%
that we think are so
important are almost never

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:35.690 align:middle line:90%
the things that really matter.

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:36.750 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: Absolutely.

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:37.550 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:41.210 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the things that
happens in the life review is

00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:45.935 align:middle line:84%
we become aware of the power
of fear, the power of taking--

00:22:45.935 --> 00:22:48.500 align:middle line:84%
one of the only things
that we actually have power

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:51.200 align:middle line:84%
over is our own
evolution, but we

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.330 align:middle line:90%
don't think of life that way.

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:56.750 align:middle line:84%
We think of life as like
we were saying earlier.

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:59.420 align:middle line:84%
But when we do
choose to be kind,

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:02.930 align:middle line:84%
even little kindnesses,
even little-- and sometimes

00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:06.950 align:middle line:84%
the most power is in
the little things we do.

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:13.115 align:middle line:84%
It could simply be noticing
someone who's in pain

00:23:13.115 --> 00:23:16.070 align:middle line:84%
and listening to them,
and being with them,

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:18.780 align:middle line:84%
or sharing something that
we have with someone else.

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:20.130 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter to us.

00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:22.730 align:middle line:84%
We have enough, so we
give to someone else.

00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:28.130 align:middle line:10%
Or knowing when there is someone
who is being unfairly treated

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:30.900 align:middle line:10%
and being able to
stand up for them.

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:33.050 align:middle line:84%
Those are the kind of
things that give us power,

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:35.660 align:middle line:84%
and that changes the
course of our life.

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:37.580 align:middle line:84%
During the life
review, we learn that.

00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:39.410 align:middle line:84%
We think when we're
living, like you

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:42.440 align:middle line:84%
said, in the physical world that
the things that are important

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:46.010 align:middle line:84%
are our big decisions about
career, how we're going to make

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:49.460 align:middle line:84%
money, where we're
going to live,

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:52.190 align:middle line:84%
what the car is
we're going to drive.

00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:54.620 align:middle line:84%
Now we all know that those
things are important,

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:58.320 align:middle line:84%
but we act like they are
important when we're here.

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:00.660 align:middle line:90%
And it's in our actions.

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:03.738 align:middle line:84%
It's in our effort, in
our energy, because that's

00:24:03.738 --> 00:24:05.030 align:middle line:90%
where we're putting our energy.

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:08.180 align:middle line:84%
It's where we put our
energy that matters.

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:09.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:11.400 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we've climbed
out of our body.

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:13.580 align:middle line:90%
This particular journey is over.

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And everyone has
a different idea

00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:16.970 align:middle line:90%
of what it's going to be like.

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:19.550 align:middle line:84%
Do I get sucked down
a tunnel of light?

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:20.780 align:middle line:90%
Who's going to meet me there?

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And you say that
really so much of this

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:27.170 align:middle line:84%
is so creative and based so
very much on our own desires

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:28.280 align:middle line:90%
and beliefs.

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:29.690 align:middle line:90%
Talk about that.

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:32.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DILLARD: What we
encounter when we pass over

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:36.650 align:middle line:84%
really has so much to do with
what we feel comfortable with

00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:40.680 align:middle line:84%
and what is a comfortable,
safe source of love for us.

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:43.370 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people
will experience--

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:44.960 align:middle line:84%
and their family
will come to them,

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:47.790 align:middle line:84%
because they have very loving,
close relationships to them.

00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:50.660 align:middle line:84%
Some people who haven't had
loving, close relationships,

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:53.720 align:middle line:84%
maybe a pet will come that
they felt very close to.

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:57.260 align:middle line:84%
For some, they may have
had someone in life

00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:02.840 align:middle line:84%
that they looked up to or an
evolved saint or a master,

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:06.380 align:middle line:90%
a Jesus or a Buddha.

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:09.650 align:middle line:10%
Whatever it is
that we really feel

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:13.850 align:middle line:10%
that kind of love and connection
with is what comes to us.

00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:18.290 align:middle line:84%
Now simultaneously, there is
always higher beings with us

00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:19.820 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:22.400 align:middle line:84%
We're not usually that aware
of that unless we already

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:25.370 align:middle line:84%
have a belief that that is
true, that there are higher

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:26.510 align:middle line:90%
evolved beings.

00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:29.570 align:middle line:90%
Not everybody believes that.

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And they're also there,
kind of guiding us.

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:34.790 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes a little
silently than if we're

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:37.970 align:middle line:84%
comfortable with them, but
we're never truly alone

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:40.130 align:middle line:90%
once we pass over.

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:42.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I remember
just before my mom died,

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:46.247 align:middle line:84%
she was already out of her body,
it felt. We couldn't really

00:25:46.247 --> 00:25:47.330 align:middle line:90%
sense her in the same way.

00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:48.860 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't anymore.

00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:50.300 align:middle line:90%
I didn't feel her around.

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:54.300 align:middle line:84%
This was maybe the day before, I
think, or-- no, earlier the day

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:55.100 align:middle line:90%
she died.

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:57.558 align:middle line:84%
So I held her hand and
I held my sister's hand,

00:25:57.558 --> 00:25:58.850 align:middle line:90%
and we each held my mom's hand.

00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:00.230 align:middle line:90%
She was in a coma.

00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:02.090 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I saw.

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And I was just thinking,
Mom, when she left,

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.370 align:middle line:84%
has a totally different
mindset, so I'm

00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:09.500 align:middle line:84%
sure her experience was
completely different.

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:14.090 align:middle line:84%
But I saw her at about 19 with
these beautiful, just tall

00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:17.150 align:middle line:84%
light beings in a little
semicircle behind her,

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:20.090 align:middle line:84%
just patient and loving
and exuding light.

00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:22.790 align:middle line:84%
And she had such peace
about her and had

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:26.240 align:middle line:84%
returned to this youthful
appearance, a time in life

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:28.310 align:middle line:90%
when she was freer and happier.

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And a friend of mine
who is quite intuitive

00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:34.700 align:middle line:84%
also checked in on her, and
he saw the exact same scene.

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:38.277 align:middle line:84%
Now my mother probably
was going to Jesus.

00:26:38.277 --> 00:26:39.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: Probably.

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about how that--

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:45.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do we even know
how this manifests?

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:49.940 align:middle line:84%
Does it manifest as a projection
of your belief in imagination,

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:53.780 align:middle line:84%
or is there something that
embodies these visions?

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:55.490 align:middle line:84%
Or is it just a
field of love we're

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:57.140 align:middle line:84%
bathed in that
creates what it is

00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:59.210 align:middle line:90%
we need to experience and see?

00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:00.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DILLARD: I think
it's attraction.

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:03.260 align:middle line:84%
I think it's our
energy attraction.

00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:05.090 align:middle line:90%
It's our love attraction.

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And our heart, because
if it's loved ones,

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:13.100 align:middle line:84%
then we're attracting that
through our love for them

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:16.320 align:middle line:90%
and our comfortableness.

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:19.050 align:middle line:84%
It's true here in the
physical world, as we know,

00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:22.320 align:middle line:84%
that the law of
attraction is at work.

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.630 align:middle line:84%
On the other side,
it's much more obvious.

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:26.400 align:middle line:90%
Now when it comes--

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:30.090 align:middle line:84%
and if someone has this
attraction toward Jesus

00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:33.330 align:middle line:84%
or toward a specific
saint or higher being,

00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:35.457 align:middle line:84%
that higher being
will definitely--

00:27:35.457 --> 00:27:36.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Project an aspect of--

00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:39.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DILLARD: Oh, absolutely,
they will project an aspect.

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:40.020 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:40.820 align:middle line:90%
And be there.

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:42.030 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:45.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's a
beautiful, wonderful--

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:48.210 align:middle line:84%
you know, whatever
opens someone's heart

00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:50.880 align:middle line:84%
and helps them to
feel most loved is

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.747 align:middle line:90%
what comes into form for us.

00:27:52.747 --> 00:27:53.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wonderful.

00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:54.380 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: Yeah.

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:59.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what happens if
you're agnostic or atheistic

00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:03.030 align:middle line:84%
and you believe that when
you die, you're dust.

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:05.130 align:middle line:90%
You go back into the ground.

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:06.540 align:middle line:90%
What happens then?

00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:07.620 align:middle line:90%
Must be a surprise.

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:09.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DILLARD: Well, at
first what happens

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:12.485 align:middle line:90%
is that-- in my experience.

00:28:12.485 --> 00:28:13.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure it's
different at times.

00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:15.630 align:middle line:84%
There's so many
different possibilities.

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:19.470 align:middle line:84%
But my experience, sometimes
they do kind of feel

00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:21.180 align:middle line:90%
like they become dust.

00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:24.090 align:middle line:84%
They kind of go into
a bit of a sleep

00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:28.500 align:middle line:84%
sometimes, like their
consciousness really

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:29.430 align:middle line:90%
lacks awareness.

00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:32.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they are aware, but
it's like they're in auto.

00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:35.818 align:middle line:90%
They're just not--

00:28:35.818 --> 00:28:37.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're not anywhere.

00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:41.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DILLARD: Slowly, slowly,
slowly they start to wake up.

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:44.880 align:middle line:84%
They're surrounded by love,
usually higher light beings,

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:46.590 align:middle line:84%
kind of given the
time to wake up.

00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:48.990 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's very
slow waking up.

00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, the feeling
of love will wake in them.

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And I've had so many people
on the other side who were not

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.030 align:middle line:84%
believers that there was
another side that come in,

00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:01.800 align:middle line:84%
and they're always
laughing about it.

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:04.030 align:middle line:84%
They always think it's
the funniest thing.

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:04.870 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what?

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:05.670 align:middle line:90%
You were right.

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:06.510 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:07.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:07.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: Yeah.

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:10.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so you say
also that sometimes when

00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:12.390 align:middle line:84%
people are struggling
with this transition,

00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:16.200 align:middle line:84%
whether it be, as we spoke
of earlier, fear of judgement

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:18.000 align:middle line:84%
or maybe someone
who is atheistic

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000 align:middle line:84%
and doesn't believe there's
anything beyond the physical,

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.180 align:middle line:84%
sometimes the person
left behind will

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:26.190 align:middle line:84%
feel a kind of
heaviness of energy

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:30.450 align:middle line:84%
about them until the being
has freed themselves.

00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:32.760 align:middle line:84%
Talk about this, because
I'm sure some of our viewers

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:34.020 align:middle line:90%
have experienced this.

00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:35.250 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: Absolutely.

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:38.760 align:middle line:84%
I've had so many people
with that experience where--

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:42.270 align:middle line:84%
and they've come to me saying, I
don't feel my mother went over.

00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:43.920 align:middle line:90%
I don't think my father did.

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:45.040 align:middle line:90%
I can feel them.

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:46.620 align:middle line:84%
I can feel
something's not right.

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:48.060 align:middle line:90%
I can feel that heaviness.

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:49.000 align:middle line:90%
What can I do?

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.580 align:middle line:90%
How can I help them over?

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:53.130 align:middle line:90%
What can we do?

00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:56.820 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's very interesting
that that's so true where

00:29:56.820 --> 00:30:00.590 align:middle line:90%
we can really get a sense of--

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:02.510 align:middle line:84%
when we really are
close to someone--

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:04.070 align:middle line:90%
I talk about it in the book--

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:05.360 align:middle line:90%
is there's a synergy.

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:09.215 align:middle line:84%
We actually exist within
the same energy bubble.

00:30:09.215 --> 00:30:11.370 align:middle line:84%
Our energy intertwines
with others.

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:14.990 align:middle line:84%
We're not as individual
as we think in that way.

00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:17.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have an
individual personality,

00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:22.100 align:middle line:84%
an individual soul identity,
but our energy fields merge.

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And when we pass over,
there's a part of us--

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:28.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's one
reason why the passing

00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:31.670 align:middle line:84%
is so difficult too, because
that energy field starts

00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:32.540 align:middle line:90%
to really--

00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:35.630 align:middle line:84%
we can feel so
vulnerable and lost,

00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:39.860 align:middle line:84%
because we're not whole the
way we had been whole before.

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:43.310 align:middle line:84%
It takes a while for our
energy field to heal too.

00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:49.800 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is that we can
feel what's happening to them.

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:50.735 align:middle line:90%
We can literally--

00:30:50.735 --> 00:30:52.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it can
feel sticky and heavy--

00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:53.250 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: It absolutely can.

00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:53.520 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:55.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's
a good thing for us

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:58.290 align:middle line:84%
to be aware of, when we're in
the presence of someone who's

00:30:58.290 --> 00:30:59.670 align:middle line:90%
had some difficulty.

00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And speaking of
difficulty, in a lot

00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:03.810 align:middle line:84%
of religious and
spiritual traditions,

00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:07.090 align:middle line:84%
it said under no circumstances
should one commit suicide.

00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:09.750 align:middle line:84%
This is truncating your
life, which is precious.

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:11.760 align:middle line:84%
But tell us what you
see when someone--

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:13.740 align:middle line:84%
that's different than
dying of a drug overdose

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:15.117 align:middle line:90%
or self-destructive behavior.

00:31:15.117 --> 00:31:16.950 align:middle line:84%
Maybe talk a little bit
about both of these,

00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:19.242 align:middle line:84%
because we have a fair amount
of it going on right now.

00:31:19.242 --> 00:31:20.520 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: We absolutely do.

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:22.890 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of--
especially young males.

00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:26.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
certainly females too,

00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:29.970 align:middle line:84%
but in my experience,
it's been younger males.

00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:31.170 align:middle line:90%
A little older sometimes.

00:31:31.170 --> 00:31:39.540 align:middle line:84%
But most people who
commit suicide knowingly

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:42.510 align:middle line:90%
take their life.

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:45.930 align:middle line:84%
For one, they go into what
I would call, I guess,

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:48.300 align:middle line:90%
a rehab as they go over.

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:50.670 align:middle line:84%
They don't have the
complete freedom

00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:53.627 align:middle line:84%
that someone who
passes naturally have.

00:31:53.627 --> 00:31:54.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's that look like?

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DILLARD: What
it's like is it's

00:31:56.430 --> 00:32:02.250 align:middle line:84%
this intense period where they
are watched over with love.

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:03.780 align:middle line:90%
They're cared for.

00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:05.850 align:middle line:84%
It's like they're
cradled almost.

00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:13.140 align:middle line:84%
It's like the wounds, the hurts,
the confusion, the self-hatred,

00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:16.215 align:middle line:84%
all of that, it's like
they're held in these--

00:32:16.215 --> 00:32:17.100 align:middle line:90%
like cradle.

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:18.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So much despair had to
have mounted most of the time.

00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:19.470 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: So much.

00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:20.340 align:middle line:90%
So much.

00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:21.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:24.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DILLARD: And it's like
this intensive period of love

00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:27.685 align:middle line:84%
and healing for them
and understanding.

00:32:27.685 --> 00:32:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And then they go through the
life review, which sometimes

00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:36.960 align:middle line:84%
takes longer if we've taken
our life, because that period

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.850 align:middle line:84%
of time, we go a
little slower, looking

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:41.250 align:middle line:84%
at the little tiny
things that we think

00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:43.470 align:middle line:84%
are tiny that
maybe led us there,

00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:46.680 align:middle line:84%
but we didn't realize
that's the thoughts we had

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:50.460 align:middle line:90%
or the way we saw ourselves.

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:53.280 align:middle line:84%
Instead of seeing ourselves
with compassion and love,

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:56.160 align:middle line:84%
we began to have
somewhat of a self-hatred

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:59.470 align:middle line:84%
or expected too
much from ourselves.

00:32:59.470 --> 00:33:02.080 align:middle line:84%
Now one of the
interesting things,

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:08.520 align:middle line:84%
though, is that even though we
go through this intense period,

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:12.990 align:middle line:84%
our life is not solely
how we passed over.

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:16.860 align:middle line:84%
The quality of our evolution
is not just judged--

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:18.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Confined
to that one event.

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:19.583 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: It's not.

00:33:19.583 --> 00:33:21.270 align:middle line:84%
It's an event, and
that's all it is.

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:25.450 align:middle line:84%
It's not coloring all
of what we've done.

00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:27.750 align:middle line:84%
There are people
who have passed over

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:31.200 align:middle line:84%
through suicide who have
been the kindest, most

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:35.250 align:middle line:84%
loving, compassionate,
sensitive people.

00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:38.040 align:middle line:84%
And what defines
them is not the act.

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.300 align:middle line:90%
It's what they went through.

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes--
it's interesting.

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:45.270 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes they are met
with this incredible surge

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:49.200 align:middle line:84%
of evolution because of
their sensitivity and caring

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:50.260 align:middle line:90%
and love.

00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:50.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:51.350 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:53.558 align:middle line:84%
>>DILLARD: Yeah, so we can't
judge, because everybody

00:33:53.558 --> 00:33:56.290 align:middle line:84%
who passes over through suicide,
it's a different reason too.

00:33:56.290 --> 00:33:57.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:57.090 --> 00:34:01.030 align:middle line:84%
And I've lost a few friends in a
short period of time this year,

00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:04.140 align:middle line:84%
and one of them was
to assisted suicide.

00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:08.679 align:middle line:84%
And she was essentially sort
of in the same condition

00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:09.580 align:middle line:90%
as Stephen Hawking.

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:12.530 align:middle line:84%
She was rapidly descending
to his final stages.

00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:13.405 align:middle line:90%
So she couldn't talk.

00:34:13.405 --> 00:34:15.113 align:middle line:84%
It was getting to
where she wouldn't even

00:34:15.113 --> 00:34:16.270 align:middle line:90%
be able to swallow anymore.

00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:17.690 align:middle line:90%
Couldn't do anything.

00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And she was able to communicate
just enough to her husband

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:24.860 align:middle line:84%
through a finger on a text to
get the paperwork in California

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:26.739 align:middle line:90%
ready for it to be legal.

00:34:26.739 --> 00:34:27.909 align:middle line:90%
She wanted it legal.

00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:31.600 align:middle line:84%
But the night before,
her kids and her husband

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:34.250 align:middle line:84%
gathered around, and they
looked through the photo album

00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:35.050 align:middle line:90%
of their life.

00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And she could still
have a little bit

00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:38.739 align:middle line:84%
of a smile on the
side of her face.

00:34:38.739 --> 00:34:39.850 align:middle line:90%
And she smiled.

00:34:39.850 --> 00:34:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And when it was the time to do
it, she's like, let's do this.

00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:45.159 align:middle line:90%
She was so ready.

00:34:45.159 --> 00:34:46.340 align:middle line:90%
There were no tears.

00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:47.380 align:middle line:90%
There was nothing.

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:48.730 align:middle line:90%
It's like, I'm ready.

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And I can't imagine there
would be a lot of torture

00:34:51.850 --> 00:34:54.159 align:middle line:90%
around that kind of transition.

00:34:54.159 --> 00:34:57.280 align:middle line:84%
That's just, there's
nothing left of me.

00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:59.720 align:middle line:84%
Medicine can keep me alive,
but that's not me anymore.

00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:00.520 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: Yeah.

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:04.360 align:middle line:84%
And that is much
different than somebody

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:09.730 align:middle line:84%
who is leaving due to
a sense of self-hatred

00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:12.010 align:middle line:90%
or a sense of powerlessness.

00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:15.190 align:middle line:84%
What she was doing was
she was choosing power.

00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:19.270 align:middle line:84%
She was choosing a higher
form of love in many ways

00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:20.813 align:middle line:90%
and a higher form of awareness.

00:35:20.813 --> 00:35:22.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it takes
courage to do it.

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:25.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DILLARD: It absolutely takes
courage to do it that way.

00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:26.527 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:35:26.527 --> 00:35:27.610 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I'm saying.

00:35:27.610 --> 00:35:33.040 align:middle line:84%
We can't really judge even
with suicide what really--

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:35.385 align:middle line:84%
what's going on with the
individual and their path

00:35:35.385 --> 00:35:35.750 align:middle line:90%
either.

00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:36.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:40.000 align:middle line:84%
And you have said,
because I read your book,

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.310 align:middle line:84%
and you were talking
about people,

00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:44.050 align:middle line:84%
when they go through
this life review

00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:45.490 align:middle line:84%
as well, because
we want to look--

00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:47.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm only using the
subject of life review

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:50.380 align:middle line:84%
so we can get clearer
reflection of our own need

00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:53.290 align:middle line:84%
to give certain emphasis and
priority to things that we

00:35:53.290 --> 00:35:55.000 align:middle line:84%
might be walking right
past and ignoring.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.370 align:middle line:84%
But one of the
things that came up

00:35:57.370 --> 00:36:00.790 align:middle line:84%
was the notion of dementia,
the notion of life review

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:03.070 align:middle line:84%
if you were not in a
clear state of mind,

00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:05.200 align:middle line:84%
because so many people
have dementia now

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:07.780 align:middle line:84%
and so many people
die with dementia.

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:10.690 align:middle line:90%
So how does that look?

00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:13.990 align:middle line:84%
Because I recall you saying
people are not judged by things

00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:16.330 align:middle line:90%
they have no mind to discern.

00:36:16.330 --> 00:36:17.823 align:middle line:90%
That does not count.

00:36:17.823 --> 00:36:18.740 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: Absolutely.

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:19.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:20.860 align:middle line:90%
Mental illness, dementia.

00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:24.070 align:middle line:84%
There's no judgement
of that whatsoever.

00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:25.300 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: Yeah.

00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:30.250 align:middle line:84%
Especially with mental illness
is that if someone goes over

00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:32.230 align:middle line:84%
and they struggled
with that quite a bit,

00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:35.560 align:middle line:84%
and like you said, maybe made
decisions, choices, act took

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:40.830 align:middle line:84%
actions that they were
not in a balanced state,

00:36:40.830 --> 00:36:42.800 align:middle line:84%
they were not in
their whole self,

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:47.840 align:middle line:84%
they immediately go into
a pretty intense healing

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:52.280 align:middle line:84%
and love also to help them
to come back into balance.

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:55.610 align:middle line:84%
Now what's interesting is
karmically, sometimes someone

00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:59.030 align:middle line:84%
will choose mental
illness or choose dementia

00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:04.640 align:middle line:84%
as a way to learn how to have
more compassion for someone

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:09.770 align:middle line:84%
in that state, to allow
more help into their life,

00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:13.190 align:middle line:84%
to allow people to be there
for them, to be cared for.

00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:17.630 align:middle line:84%
They may have in other lifetimes
had lives where they didn't

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:21.860 align:middle line:84%
give to others and
they needed to learn

00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:23.780 align:middle line:90%
and to feel what that is like.

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:27.840 align:middle line:84%
Or they may have done things
that harmed others in some way,

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:30.860 align:middle line:84%
so they come and they have to
experience more vulnerability

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:33.950 align:middle line:84%
to really understand the
true power of kindness.

00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:37.640 align:middle line:84%
Nobody who had-- there's
no surprises when

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:39.000 align:middle line:90%
we come in on a soul level.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:39.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:40.460 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: There's none.

00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:40.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: None.

00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:41.210 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: None.

00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:42.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We know what
we're getting into.

00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:42.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: Absolutely.

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:43.753 align:middle line:90%
And we've chosen it.

00:37:43.753 --> 00:37:44.553 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:37:44.553 --> 00:37:46.760 align:middle line:84%
Now-- and this rubs a lot
of people the wrong way,

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:47.900 align:middle line:90%
because they think, no.

00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:48.740 align:middle line:90%
Life isn't fair.

00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:51.300 align:middle line:84%
Why would anyone come into
a family of abuse like that?

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:52.100 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: Right.

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:54.000 align:middle line:90%
And I've thought that.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the reality is we
are aware when we take a body.

00:37:56.930 --> 00:37:57.847 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: Absolutely.

00:37:57.847 --> 00:37:59.222 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
there's a reason

00:37:59.222 --> 00:38:01.400 align:middle line:84%
we've chosen it for our
own learning or experience

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:03.590 align:middle line:84%
or maybe karmic
adjustment or something.

00:38:03.590 --> 00:38:04.910 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: Mm-hmm.

00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:05.990 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:08.340 align:middle line:84%
I spent years saying
that same thing.

00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:09.560 align:middle line:90%
Why would I have chosen that?

00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:12.410 align:middle line:84%
When I first started
to understand

00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:15.110 align:middle line:84%
that we did have a choice,
I wanted to reject it,

00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:17.690 align:middle line:84%
because I thought, I would
have never done that to myself.

00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:20.840 align:middle line:84%
Why-- I would have never
done that to myself.

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:22.580 align:middle line:90%
And then I came to realize--

00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:25.670 align:middle line:84%
and it's taken-- it's part of
my life journey is understanding

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:27.590 align:middle line:90%
this has been--

00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:31.190 align:middle line:84%
again, it all comes
to power, that I--

00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:34.820 align:middle line:84%
it's been a struggle
especially in relationships

00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:36.770 align:middle line:90%
to be in my power.

00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:40.500 align:middle line:90%
And that's why I chose that.

00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:41.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To learn.

00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:43.260 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: Yeah.

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:45.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You talk
about service groups.

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:47.430 align:middle line:84%
We were talking about
the beings of light.

00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:49.080 align:middle line:90%
We were talking about--

00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:51.510 align:middle line:84%
there are beings who are
born on this planet who

00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:54.300 align:middle line:84%
are here literally to
help guide with light

00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:57.420 align:middle line:84%
and be of service, both
here and on the other side.

00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:59.130 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
that a little bit?

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And I say this because so
many people feel alone,

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:03.480 align:middle line:90%
and they're not.

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:04.920 align:middle line:90%
They're not alone here.

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:07.920 align:middle line:84%
And how do we start
recognizing those here

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:11.100 align:middle line:84%
on Earth who are of those
service groups who are here

00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:12.270 align:middle line:90%
to help us?

00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:14.370 align:middle line:84%
We already talked about
how we recognize them

00:39:14.370 --> 00:39:15.720 align:middle line:90%
on the other side.

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:18.030 align:middle line:84%
But how do we recognize
the help that's right here?

00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:18.960 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: Mm-hmm.

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:21.380 align:middle line:90%
That's a very good question.

00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:23.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's talk first
about the service groups.

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:25.690 align:middle line:84%
Service groups
can be-- sometimes

00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:30.400 align:middle line:84%
there are people who pass
over to go back to a group

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:34.120 align:middle line:84%
to be of service here, because
they realize that what they're

00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:36.880 align:middle line:84%
doing here is their
desire to be of service,

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:39.010 align:middle line:84%
but their options
are more limited

00:39:39.010 --> 00:39:41.020 align:middle line:84%
than what they would
like to experience.

00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:43.660 align:middle line:84%
Because once we go
over and we become

00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:46.210 align:middle line:84%
part of a soul
group, our ability

00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:49.900 align:middle line:84%
to influence and to
really give so much,

00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:51.770 align:middle line:90%
it definitely increases.

00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:52.570 align:middle line:90%
So one--

00:39:52.570 --> 00:39:54.695 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, you may
have a hard-headed client

00:39:54.695 --> 00:39:56.500 align:middle line:84%
on the other side
that's not hearing you,

00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:57.910 align:middle line:90%
but you have more to work with.

00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:58.710 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: Right.

00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:00.370 align:middle line:84%
Now sometimes through
synchronicities,

00:40:00.370 --> 00:40:02.020 align:middle line:84%
that's one of the
biggest ways that we

00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:04.450 align:middle line:84%
can recognize that
there's something at play,

00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:06.730 align:middle line:90%
is that things just happen.

00:40:06.730 --> 00:40:08.510 align:middle line:90%
Opportunities come up.

00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes-- I think that
you are one of those beings.

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:18.040 align:middle line:84%
I think that you enter someone's
life when you just know it.

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:19.090 align:middle line:90%
You know it's time.

00:40:19.090 --> 00:40:23.240 align:middle line:84%
You know it's time to take
another step, to be there.

00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:25.000 align:middle line:90%
That's what your intuition is.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.110 align:middle line:90%
It's guiding you.

00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:28.390 align:middle line:84%
You're working with a
bigger soul group that

00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:32.740 align:middle line:84%
is helping you to know
that, to broadcast that

00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:35.510 align:middle line:84%
to you a little bit,
and you're acting on it.

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:38.080 align:middle line:84%
One of the things about people
that are part of soul groups

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.150 align:middle line:84%
is they do tend to
be more like you.

00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:45.670 align:middle line:84%
They do tend to be people
that not just hear it, but act

00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:46.880 align:middle line:90%
on it.

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:49.072 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's
the real key component,

00:40:49.072 --> 00:40:50.030 align:middle line:90%
because we all hear it.

00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:52.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DILLARD: We all hear
it, but who acts on it?

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.530 align:middle line:84%
Acting on it is very
different than knowing it.

00:40:55.530 --> 00:40:58.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a
very good point too,

00:40:58.150 --> 00:41:00.160 align:middle line:84%
because we always
talk about, well,

00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:03.970 align:middle line:84%
if we just open up and if we
can just listen to our guides--

00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:04.770 align:middle line:90%
but you're right.

00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:08.190 align:middle line:84%
If you don't act on it, then
it's a wasted opportunity.

00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:10.830 align:middle line:84%
And acting on it can be
very inconvenient and even

00:41:10.830 --> 00:41:12.192 align:middle line:90%
embarrassing on Earth life.

00:41:12.192 --> 00:41:13.025 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: Oh, gosh.

00:41:13.025 --> 00:41:13.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:15.633 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, I've certainly
been embarrassed plenty

00:41:15.633 --> 00:41:17.490 align:middle line:90%
by the things I've taken up.

00:41:17.490 --> 00:41:20.430 align:middle line:84%
So talk about that
a little bit more

00:41:20.430 --> 00:41:22.740 align:middle line:84%
for people who are
really quite intuitive

00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:24.000 align:middle line:90%
and they hear these messages.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.510 align:middle line:84%
But just reiterate
one more time the need

00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:30.182 align:middle line:84%
to step forward into
what we're being shown.

00:41:30.182 --> 00:41:32.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DILLARD: I talked about
this in my very first book,

00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:35.130 align:middle line:90%
"Discover Your Psychic Type."

00:41:35.130 --> 00:41:39.480 align:middle line:84%
What brings us the most help in
life, what opens doors for us,

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:42.820 align:middle line:84%
flings the doors open
is an act of courage.

00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:43.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:45.203 align:middle line:84%
>>DILLARD: Oh, it's
an act of courage.

00:41:45.203 --> 00:41:47.500 align:middle line:84%
If you want to get
your guide's attention,

00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:50.490 align:middle line:84%
if you want the heavens
to pour down on you,

00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:52.140 align:middle line:90%
listen and act on it.

00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:53.570 align:middle line:90%
Be the fool.

00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:54.370 align:middle line:90%
Be the fool.

00:41:54.370 --> 00:41:56.745 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's-- oh, god,
I've said that so many times.

00:41:56.745 --> 00:42:00.210 align:middle line:84%
You have to be OK
with being the fool

00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:02.940 align:middle line:90%
and letting people laugh at you.

00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:05.080 align:middle line:90%
And I mean, that's so important.

00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:07.027 align:middle line:84%
And so I really appreciate
your sharing that,

00:42:07.027 --> 00:42:08.610 align:middle line:84%
because there's so
many people sitting

00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:11.850 align:middle line:84%
on the precipice of wanting
to take action, but not

00:42:11.850 --> 00:42:13.350 align:middle line:90%
ready to be the fool just yet.

00:42:13.350 --> 00:42:14.190 align:middle line:90%
Be a fool.

00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:16.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DILLARD: Well, and people
want spirit to come in

00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:18.870 align:middle line:90%
and to say, OK, here's the path.

00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:20.700 align:middle line:90%
This is the steps you take.

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:23.130 align:middle line:90%
Everything's going to be OK.

00:42:23.130 --> 00:42:25.335 align:middle line:84%
This is-- spirit
doesn't work that--

00:42:25.335 --> 00:42:27.210 align:middle line:84%
they will a little bit
at first, because they

00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:28.570 align:middle line:90%
want to get our attention.

00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And then we're like,
oh, yeah, this is good.

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:30.990 align:middle line:84%
Let me-- I'm going
to talk to spirit.

00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:32.190 align:middle line:90%
Well, then they kind of--

00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:32.580 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:33.413 align:middle line:90%
Well, wait a minute.

00:42:33.413 --> 00:42:35.910 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
do everything here.

00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:36.870 align:middle line:90%
Here's the darkness.

00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:38.500 align:middle line:90%
Walk into the darkness.

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:39.300 align:middle line:90%
Take that step.

00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:40.810 align:middle line:84%
Let's see how you
do with that one.

00:42:40.810 --> 00:42:42.550 align:middle line:84%
Let's see about your
trust on that one.

00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:44.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's see
about your commitment.

00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:45.810 align:middle line:90%
Oh, this is about commitment.

00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:48.360 align:middle line:84%
I've forgotten that
very, very famous saying.

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:50.400 align:middle line:84%
Once you commit
yourself to something,

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:54.090 align:middle line:84%
essentially all the forces in
heaven come in to help you.

00:42:54.090 --> 00:42:56.340 align:middle line:84%
But you have to take
that step to commit.

00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:58.840 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, you
have to commit to it.

00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:00.767 align:middle line:84%
So we only have a
couple minutes left,

00:43:00.767 --> 00:43:02.100 align:middle line:90%
but I wanted to talk about this.

00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:05.280 align:middle line:84%
When we're going through grief
of the loss of our loved ones,

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:07.380 align:middle line:84%
you say that's a
wonderful time for us

00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:09.840 align:middle line:84%
to blow open our own
intuitive capacities

00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:12.210 align:middle line:84%
and begin to
communicate with them.

00:43:12.210 --> 00:43:14.400 align:middle line:84%
Let's spend the rest
of our next few minutes

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:17.855 align:middle line:84%
talking about how we can most
effectively allow ourselves

00:43:17.855 --> 00:43:19.230 align:middle line:84%
to be blown open
and communicate.

00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:21.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DILLARD: Well, we go back
to what we talked about

00:43:21.570 --> 00:43:25.710 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning about
evolution and death as the great

00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:27.630 align:middle line:90%
awakener, because--

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:30.300 align:middle line:84%
let me tell you a story
that's such a good story,

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:34.290 align:middle line:84%
is that-- it's a current client
of mine who lost her son,

00:43:34.290 --> 00:43:37.320 align:middle line:84%
and he had an incredibly
planned out suicide.

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:43.290 align:middle line:84%
Incredibly planned out, and
shut her out of his life,

00:43:43.290 --> 00:43:46.682 align:middle line:84%
and he committed
suicide in a very--

00:43:46.682 --> 00:43:49.210 align:middle line:90%
a way that was just devastating.

00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And her life, of
course, fell apart.

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:54.670 align:middle line:90%
She's a physician.

00:43:54.670 --> 00:44:00.770 align:middle line:84%
Now the path that she took
with that was incredible.

00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:04.450 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen anybody
in all of my years

00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:09.380 align:middle line:84%
embrace transformation
like she has.

00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:11.000 align:middle line:90%
Unbelievable.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:18.180 align:middle line:84%
Embraced it in ways that she
stopped doing as much work.

00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:19.230 align:middle line:90%
She pulled back.

00:44:19.230 --> 00:44:21.090 align:middle line:84%
She started
meditating every day.

00:44:21.090 --> 00:44:22.590 align:middle line:90%
She started talking to him.

00:44:22.590 --> 00:44:25.020 align:middle line:84%
She started noticing
synchronicities.

00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:29.970 align:middle line:84%
She wanted to do past lives with
me, which I kind of wanted--

00:44:29.970 --> 00:44:32.130 align:middle line:84%
I know enough about
what she was wanting

00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:35.760 align:middle line:84%
to do to kind of let a little
bit more healing happen.

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:39.450 align:middle line:84%
Now she wants to walk
around Europe on foot,

00:44:39.450 --> 00:44:42.300 align:middle line:84%
because she feels that
she needs to be outdoors

00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:46.153 align:middle line:84%
walking to hear him better,
to be part of spirit, to heal.

00:44:46.153 --> 00:44:48.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what did you
find about that when you talked

00:44:48.570 --> 00:44:51.210 align:middle line:84%
with him on the other side
after this devastating,

00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:52.410 align:middle line:90%
planned out thing?

00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:54.010 align:middle line:90%
He's there for his mother now.

00:44:54.010 --> 00:44:55.710 align:middle line:90%
And why did he do it?

00:44:55.710 --> 00:44:57.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DILLARD: Oh, he is--
the synchronicities

00:44:57.690 --> 00:45:00.790 align:middle line:84%
are incredible that she's
experiencing, and from him.

00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:02.310 align:middle line:90%
She absolutely knows.

00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:06.080 align:middle line:90%
He had a very hard time with--

00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:08.360 align:middle line:84%
he had high expectations
for himself,

00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:11.000 align:middle line:90%
and he was very much a control--

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.480 align:middle line:90%
control, control, control.

00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:16.400 align:middle line:84%
He also, I believe, had
an imbalance in his brain

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:20.000 align:middle line:84%
that we have not-- doctors
were not able to identify.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.150 align:middle line:84%
And it kind of focused
all of his energy

00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:26.090 align:middle line:84%
in a part of his brain
that was really damaging

00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:28.040 align:middle line:90%
to him and his self-esteem.

00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:29.997 align:middle line:84%
It's very complicated,
his passing.

00:45:29.997 --> 00:45:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's one thing
that's happening.

00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:36.830 align:middle line:84%
The vibrations-- there's so
much frequency changes now.

00:45:36.830 --> 00:45:38.420 align:middle line:84%
I know we don't
have a lot of time.

00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:40.090 align:middle line:90%
I won't get into this.

00:45:40.090 --> 00:45:42.543 align:middle line:84%
But imbalances are
more common now too

00:45:42.543 --> 00:45:44.710 align:middle line:84%
because of some of the
frequency shifting that we're

00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:46.840 align:middle line:90%
experiencing globally.

00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:47.980 align:middle line:90%
And he had some of that.

00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:49.760 align:middle line:90%
He was a good example of that.

00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:54.280 align:middle line:84%
But I bring that up because
she embraced the spiritual path

00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:57.670 align:middle line:84%
like no one I've ever seen
embrace the spiritual path.

00:45:57.670 --> 00:46:01.060 align:middle line:90%
And that is healing him as well.

00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:04.750 align:middle line:84%
He's healing and she's healing,
because this transformation

00:46:04.750 --> 00:46:09.020 align:middle line:84%
for both of them, they're
as connected as they--

00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:10.780 align:middle line:90%
unbelievably.

00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:14.320 align:middle line:84%
And she's the type of
person too who has courage.

00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:15.970 align:middle line:90%
Incredible courage.

00:46:15.970 --> 00:46:19.240 align:middle line:84%
And I know that she is
going to make a huge impact

00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:20.740 align:middle line:90%
on other people's lives.

00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:21.557 align:middle line:90%
Huge.

00:46:21.557 --> 00:46:22.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
sharing that story,

00:46:23.770 --> 00:46:24.920 align:middle line:90%
because a lot of people--

00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:25.720 align:middle line:90%
it's funny.

00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:27.850 align:middle line:84%
I know so many people
who've lost sons.

00:46:27.850 --> 00:46:28.940 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: So many.

00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:29.740 align:middle line:90%
So many.

00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:30.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not daughters.

00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:31.150 align:middle line:90%
Sons.

00:46:31.150 --> 00:46:31.600 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: Sons.

00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:33.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The boys aren't
knowing what their place is.

00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:34.840 align:middle line:90%
The young men don't know.

00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:36.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DILLARD: The male
and female is changing.

00:46:36.730 --> 00:46:40.207 align:middle line:84%
You know, energetically, female
energy is coming in stronger.

00:46:40.207 --> 00:46:42.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Coming into
the dominant position.

00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:43.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DILLARD: And we have
to take care of males,

00:46:43.930 --> 00:46:46.240 align:middle line:84%
believe it or not, with their
evolution even more now.

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:47.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:47.560 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: Yeah.

00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:48.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very good point.

00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:54.190 align:middle line:84%
So tell us just what you would
say in brief for any one of us

00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:56.320 align:middle line:84%
who is in the process
of losing someone

00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:59.050 align:middle line:84%
or soon will lose someone
to their transition out

00:46:59.050 --> 00:47:00.250 align:middle line:90%
of physical view.

00:47:00.250 --> 00:47:02.435 align:middle line:90%
We know they're still with us.

00:47:02.435 --> 00:47:04.060 align:middle line:84%
Tell us what we can
do to have the most

00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:06.640 align:middle line:90%
effective communication.

00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:09.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DILLARD: Well, the first thing
is to allow yourself to grieve.

00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:11.830 align:middle line:90%
Allow yourself to grieve.

00:47:11.830 --> 00:47:13.150 align:middle line:90%
Don't try to make it fast.

00:47:13.150 --> 00:47:16.300 align:middle line:84%
Don't try to think
yourself through it.

00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:17.420 align:middle line:90%
Pour your heart out.

00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:18.220 align:middle line:90%
Open your heart.

00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:20.440 align:middle line:84%
Feel all the grief,
all the sadness.

00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:25.060 align:middle line:10%
As much as you can handle, let
it up, because it's the grief--

00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:27.910 align:middle line:10%
behind that grief as it
comes up, there's space.

00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:29.170 align:middle line:10%
There's opening.

00:47:29.170 --> 00:47:31.960 align:middle line:10%
And in that opening, you can
ask for the love of the heavens

00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:34.660 align:middle line:10%
to fill you, for the
comfort of the heavens.

00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
transformation also.

00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And to speak and talk
to your loved ones.

00:47:40.090 --> 00:47:41.770 align:middle line:90%
Again, courage.

00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:43.840 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes we-- oh, we can't.

00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:45.040 align:middle line:90%
People think I'm kooky.

00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:46.705 align:middle line:90%
Well, who cares?

00:47:46.705 --> 00:47:47.530 align:middle line:90%
Talk to them.

00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:49.780 align:middle line:90%
Ask them to be with you.

00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:52.180 align:middle line:90%
Ask them, and they will.

00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:53.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And they will.

00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:53.870 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: And they will.

00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:54.170 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:47:54.170 --> 00:47:56.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sherrie,
thank you so much wisdom

00:47:56.090 --> 00:47:59.540 align:middle line:84%
and for sharing some both
personal and anecdotal stories

00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:02.460 align:middle line:84%
with us, all of them which
I felt were very impactful.

00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:03.825 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciated it.

00:48:03.825 --> 00:48:04.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DILLARD: Thank you.

00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:06.560 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:09.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sherrie's book is
titled "I'm Still With You."

00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:10.950 align:middle line:84%
She isn't taking
new sessions now,

00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:13.937 align:middle line:84%
but you can still reach out to
her through sherriedillard.com.

00:48:13.937 --> 00:48:16.520 align:middle line:84%
But you can pick up the book and
learn how to do a lot of this

00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:17.180 align:middle line:90%
yourself.

00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:19.097 align:middle line:84%
