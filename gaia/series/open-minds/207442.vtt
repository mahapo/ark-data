In your opinion,

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.340 align:middle line:84%
the ancient city of
Eridu, in Mesopotamia,

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.427 align:middle line:84%
is the most ancient

because it sounds good

out the same way?

00:00:30.193 --> 00:00:30.993 align:middle line:90%

00:00:30.993 --> 00:00:32.070 align:middle line:90%
In fact, it's opposite.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.370 align:middle line:84%

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.940 align:middle line:84%

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.820 align:middle line:10%
In 2003, my blood
boiled when I learned

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.890 align:middle line:10%
that American military
troops ransacked

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.910 align:middle line:10%
the ancient Iraqi city of Ur
after we invaded Iraq, spray

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.860 align:middle line:10%
painting the ancient artifacts.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.510 align:middle line:84%
Ur was considered
at the time to be

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.320 align:middle line:84%
the most ancient city on Earth,
home of the biblical Abraham.

that a nearby city

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.740 align:middle line:84%
named Eridu is even more
ancient and laden with cuneiform

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.050 align:middle line:84%
tablets telling of
our ancient history,

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.320 align:middle line:84%

openly looted of its treasures

You're passionate about it,

00:01:57.805 --> 00:02:00.710 align:middle line:84%
you have a documentary
that you did on this.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And you were able to obtain
some photographs that

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.340 align:middle line:84%

per se, of these looters.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.980 align:middle line:84%

let's talk about the city

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.950 align:middle line:84%
of Eridu and its
historical significance.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.080 align:middle line:84%
Most people have
never heard of it.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.920 align:middle line:90%
>> LACROIX: Yeah.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.470 align:middle line:10%
Eridu for me is quite
dear to my heart,

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.600 align:middle line:10%
because one of the
focus areas that I've

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.730 align:middle line:10%
had studying throughout
the years has been

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.030 align:middle line:10%
ancient Mesopotamian history,
looking into Sumerian,

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.120 align:middle line:10%
Akkadian, and Babylonian tablets
and trying to piece together

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.620 align:middle line:10%
this lost story of humanity.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.960 align:middle line:84%
Because truthfully, when
you go through the records,

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.750 align:middle line:84%
and you look at what are
the oldest writings that

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.480 align:middle line:84%
still exist today, are
they paper records?

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.710 align:middle line:10%
Are they papyrus?

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.510 align:middle line:10%
What are those older records?

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.180 align:middle line:10%
And you really find
out that they're

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.010 align:middle line:10%
what's known as
cuneiform tablets,

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.000 align:middle line:10%
this etched-in symbols
into clay or stone.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.610 align:middle line:84%
And then the clay,
if it's in that case,

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.480 align:middle line:84%
is often fired up and turned
into this hard material that

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.430 align:middle line:84%
can survive for
thousands of years.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And the ancient Sumerians wrote
more than 50,000 cuneiform

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.450 align:middle line:84%
tablets over the
course of history

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.790 align:middle line:84%
that have been discovered
in various libraries.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And when we read
those tablets, when we

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.820 align:middle line:84%
try to take and look
at every version--

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.210 align:middle line:84%
Sumerian, Akkadian, and
Babylonian-- the same theme

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.560 align:middle line:84%
comes up over and over
in every single one.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.340 align:middle line:84%
It's mentioned in at
least a dozen tablets,

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.120 align:middle line:84%
and that is that Eridu is the
very first city ever created

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.080 align:middle line:90%
here on the planet.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.140 align:middle line:84%
Not something where nomadic
hunters and gatherers

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.505 align:middle line:84%
decided just to group
together, but a divine kingship

00:03:48.505 --> 00:03:49.880 align:middle line:84%
lowering from
heaven and creating

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.140 align:middle line:90%
the first civilization.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.280 align:middle line:84%
So Eridu is quite
dear to my heart,

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.180 align:middle line:84%
and that's why, Regina, what
you just mentioned about what's

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.673 align:middle line:84%
going on there,
it's truly tragic.

00:03:58.673 --> 00:04:00.590 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It is tragic,
and one of the things

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.750 align:middle line:84%
that's interesting,
before we go on with this,

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.550 align:middle line:84%
is everybody's
looking at timelines,

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:05.960 align:middle line:90%
always looking at timelines.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.430 align:middle line:90%
We have no idea.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.100 align:middle line:84%
The one thing I think humanity
needs to be a little bit more

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.380 align:middle line:84%
humble about is we have no idea
how ancient our human history

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:14.180 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.690 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:15.020 align:middle line:90%
>> LACROIX: Exactly.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.190 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so some will
say, OK, well, Lemuria,

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.610 align:middle line:84%
Lemuria was a half a
million, a million years ago.

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:21.410 align:middle line:84%
Others will say,
well we know Atlantis

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.630 align:middle line:84%
was at least a quarter
of a million years ago,

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.550 align:middle line:90%
up to about 12,000 years ago.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.820 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying
that, in your opinion,

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.380 align:middle line:84%
that the ancient city of Eridu,
in Mesopotamia, is the most

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.385 align:middle line:84%
ancient civilization,
and so describe that.

00:04:37.385 --> 00:04:39.260 align:middle line:84%
And I want to get into
this a little further,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.080 align:middle line:84%
because this is where
nuanced thinking comes in.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.730 align:middle line:84%
>> LACROIX: Yeah, and listen,
I love to speculate on Atlantis

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.010 align:middle line:84%
and Lemuria and try to
figure out where that fits

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.280 align:middle line:84%
into the timeline, and we
have some clues based on Solan

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.950 align:middle line:84%
and based on Plato's
descriptions of it.

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.640 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, the only date
that he gives for Atlantis

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.840 align:middle line:90%
is when it was destroyed.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:00.080 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.185 align:middle line:84%
>> LACROIX: He doesn't actually
say when it was first created.

00:05:02.185 --> 00:05:02.490 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Not at all.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.000 align:middle line:84%
>> LACROIX: So we have to try
to backtrack and look at some

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.800 align:middle line:90%
of the evidence.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And what I end up funneling down
my path is that I look and say,

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.700 align:middle line:84%
well, we have evidence
to show how old Eridu is.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.220 align:middle line:84%
So that gives us a
little bit of a ballpark

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.570 align:middle line:90%
to try to create a timeline.

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, but
there are other cities

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.010 align:middle line:84%
and tablets mentioned
that have distinctions

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.450 align:middle line:84%
on events like this great
deluge, this catastrophe.

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:25.250 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.792 align:middle line:84%
>> LACROIX: Potentially, like
the Younger Dryas and how there

00:05:27.792 --> 00:05:30.440 align:middle line:84%
were cities that existed before
and then cities that existed

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.240 align:middle line:90%
after.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And really, what we find in that
is that take, for an example,

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.178 align:middle line:84%
take like the
Sumerian King List,

00:05:37.178 --> 00:05:39.470 align:middle line:84%
one of the most well-known
of all the cuneiform tablets

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.678 align:middle line:84%
that people, when they go
down this road, they study.

00:05:41.678 --> 00:05:45.020 align:middle line:84%
And it blows their mind, because
the Sumerian King List gives

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.170 align:middle line:84%
this accurate record
of ancient kings that

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:50.780 align:middle line:84%
ruled in these early
Sumerian cities,

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.140 align:middle line:84%
and what it says in
there is the preface

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:54.140 align:middle line:90%
for the beginning of it.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.600 align:middle line:84%
It says, when kingship
was lowered from heaven,

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.760 align:middle line:84%
kingship was in Eridu, and so
we look at that and we say,

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.780 align:middle line:84%
OK, is that verifiable
with other tablets?

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.690 align:middle line:84%
We look at Eridu, Genesis,
Uruk List of Kings,

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.770 align:middle line:84%
and we find the same
mention over and over again.

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.620 align:middle line:84%
So we know that that's the
first city, but how old is it?

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:11.420 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.753 align:middle line:84%
>> LACROIX: And that's what
we get into some interesting

00:06:13.753 --> 00:06:17.240 align:middle line:84%
aspects of when you add up
like the Sumerian King List,

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.240 align:middle line:84%
and you try to figure out,
well, the kings ruled for these

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.210 align:middle line:84%
reigns, and then this is
when it was first created.

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:27.650 align:middle line:84%
You get like a 200,000,
250,000-year-old story,

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.300 align:middle line:84%
and Eridu is the
center of that story.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.820 align:middle line:90%
So there we go.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.920 align:middle line:84%
We're talking roughly a
quarter of a million years

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.290 align:middle line:84%
just there, not what the
Wikipedia entry says.

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:38.090 align:middle line:90%
>> LACROIX: No.

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.160 align:middle line:90%
Certainly not.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.310 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I'm not funding
Wikipedia anymore, actually,

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:44.900 align:middle line:90%
but this is interesting.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Because I think it's
important to understand

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.460 align:middle line:90%
for all of us that--

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:50.900 align:middle line:84%
what I've come to
understand over

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.420 align:middle line:84%
the years-- that many of
these ancient cultures,

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.240 align:middle line:84%
as far as we can
see, were concurrent.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.540 align:middle line:84%
So you have Egypt as an ancient
culture that's developing,

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.280 align:middle line:90%
but what stage of development?

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.900 align:middle line:84%
We don't know at
any given stage.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.910 align:middle line:84%
Most of those pyramids
are under the sands.

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:05.940 align:middle line:90%
The early ones are gone.

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:06.740 align:middle line:90%
They're buried.

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:07.540 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.860 align:middle line:84%
And so it's the same with
this, but at least you

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.050 align:middle line:84%
have something because
of the Kings List.

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:13.340 align:middle line:90%
>> LACROIX: Yeah.

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's just play
with the notion that it could

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.530 align:middle line:84%
be 200,000, 250,000
years as a city.

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:20.330 align:middle line:90%
>> LACROIX: OK.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.240 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That makes us a much
more sophisticated species than

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.080 align:middle line:90%
we thought.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.750 align:middle line:84%
>> LACROIX: Yeah, and it
changes the entire narrative.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:31.040 align:middle line:84%
It changes this doctrine we
have of civilization only

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.090 align:middle line:90%
being 6,000 years old.

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:32.540 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.665 align:middle line:84%
>> LACROIX: And everything
fitting into that tight,

00:07:34.665 --> 00:07:36.350 align:middle line:90%
little, neat area of time.

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:37.642 align:middle line:90%
It just doesn't make any sense.

00:07:37.642 --> 00:07:38.442 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:07:38.442 --> 00:07:40.865 align:middle line:84%
You look at the erosion marks
on the Sphinx enclosure.

00:07:40.865 --> 00:07:41.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:43.722 align:middle line:84%
>> LACROIX: And you really
can just prove what you say.

00:07:43.722 --> 00:07:45.680 align:middle line:84%
Look, we know that there
wasn't enough rainfall

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:46.910 align:middle line:84%
during this time
period in history

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:48.060 align:middle line:84%
to be able to
create that erosion.

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:48.260 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.810 align:middle line:84%
>> LACROIX: So we therefore
have to look beyond that.

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:53.540 align:middle line:84%
Look at the alignments with
Leo, look at the Sphinx,

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.600 align:middle line:84%
look at the Great Pyramids
aligns with Sirius and Orion

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.270 align:middle line:84%
and try to understand,
well, when did they align,

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.570 align:middle line:84%
and how does that play into
Eridu and ancient Mesopotamia?

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:04.028 align:middle line:84%
And as we're going
to go along, you

00:08:04.028 --> 00:08:05.778 align:middle line:84%
could find out that
they're all connected.

00:08:05.778 --> 00:08:06.590 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:07.390 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:10.370 align:middle line:84%
So this is at the confluence of
the Tigris and Euphrates River.

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:13.130 align:middle line:84%
This is the cradle of
civilization, this valley,

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:18.290 align:middle line:84%
and near this, and in fact up
north from it, is Gobekli Tepe.

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:21.920 align:middle line:10%
All this starts tying together,
now that they've dug there

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.190 align:middle line:10%
and see the sophistication of
what was left behind there.

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:28.130 align:middle line:84%
So we'll go into a little
tale about that area,

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:31.085 align:middle line:84%
but it also appears
that one of the-- you

00:08:31.085 --> 00:08:34.130 align:middle line:84%
said the Kings List, once
you're able to read cuneiform,

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:36.500 align:middle line:84%
and Billy Carson told me
you can actually read it.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:36.679 align:middle line:90%
>> LACROIX: Yeah.

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:38.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm studying to actually
learn how to read it.

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:39.120 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love it.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:39.920 align:middle line:90%
>> LACROIX: Yeah.

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.080 align:middle line:90%
It's not an easy task.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.610 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No, not at all, and
you rely on a few translators

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:46.380 align:middle line:84%
that you have a lot of respect
for that are consistent.

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:47.840 align:middle line:84%
I think it's fair
now to bring up,

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.930 align:middle line:84%
before I go here, Zacharias
Sitchin's interpretations,

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:55.130 align:middle line:84%
because there are two schools
of thought on that one.

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:58.130 align:middle line:84%
>> LACROIX: Yeah, and so the
more that I dug into this,

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:01.760 align:middle line:84%
like a lot of individuals,
most will start with Zacharias

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.458 align:middle line:84%
Sitchin, because
he's very well known.

00:09:03.458 --> 00:09:05.750 align:middle line:84%
His books have reached so
many people around the world,

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:07.850 align:middle line:84%
and that's where
I started my path.

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:09.890 align:middle line:90%
But I quickly realized that--

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:11.540 align:middle line:90%
because I'm an objective person.

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:12.740 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:15.230 align:middle line:84%
I don't just create a story
because it sounds good

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:16.070 align:middle line:90%
and go with it.

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:19.530 align:middle line:84%
I go where the evidence is, and
I became very, very interested,

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:24.030 align:middle line:84%
almost obsessed, with that
story of this ancient Annunaki

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.690 align:middle line:84%
Mesopotamian story, and I wanted
to know if what he was saying

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:27.490 align:middle line:90%
was accurate.

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And as I went along,
I realized, well,

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:33.170 align:middle line:84%
not everything he was saying
was completely accurate.

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:35.892 align:middle line:84%
He had some aspects
of truth in there,

00:09:35.892 --> 00:09:37.850 align:middle line:84%
but then there was a lot
that I disagreed with.

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And so I went back to
the books, and I said,

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:43.130 align:middle line:84%
well, I want to look into the
history of who first translated

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:46.130 align:middle line:84%
these tablets, who these
Assyriologist experts are,

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:48.420 align:middle line:84%
and then who's verified
each other's work?

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And truly, you get
this story that

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:56.390 align:middle line:84%
goes back to really beginning
in 1849 with Austen Henry Layard

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:59.330 align:middle line:84%
when the University of
Oxford, they came down

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:03.860 align:middle line:84%
to the Iraqi area, and they were
looking for ancient libraries

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:04.670 align:middle line:90%
and ancient cities.

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And what they found was, in
the ancient city of Nineveh,

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:11.000 align:middle line:84%
in Iraq, which by the
way was destroyed by ISIS

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.300 align:middle line:84%
and is no longer there any
longer, what they found

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:18.050 align:middle line:84%
is the greatest library
ever amassed in history.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:20.810 align:middle line:84%
Even more important than the
Library of Alexandria which

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:24.080 align:middle line:84%
was burned down by the Romans
and most of those records lost.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.020 align:middle line:84%
But the difference is that
most people have never

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:28.160 align:middle line:90%
even heard of this library.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:28.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:30.080 align:middle line:84%
>> LACROIX: And that
library is called--

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:30.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Spell
it out for people--

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:31.880 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.970 align:middle line:84%
>> LACROIX: So it's the
Royal Ashurbanipal Library,

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:42.590 align:middle line:84%
and A-S-H-U-R- B-A-N-I-P-A-L,
and he was this really unique

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:43.580 align:middle line:90%
individual in history.

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.700 align:middle line:84%
Where a lot of these kings
and rulers during these time

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.320 align:middle line:90%
frames, they were conquerors.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.450 align:middle line:84%
They just conquered
other areas, and they

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:52.340 align:middle line:84%
wanted great wealth
and power, but he

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:53.840 align:middle line:90%
was a different kind of ruler.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.450 align:middle line:10%
He was a ruler who
truly wanted to protect

00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:59.295 align:middle line:10%
the legacy of history, the
information of history.

00:10:59.295 --> 00:11:00.170 align:middle line:10%
He was a high priest.

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:03.290 align:middle line:10%
He was a scholar, and
so he used his power

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:05.960 align:middle line:10%
to send out armies to
every part of the region

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:09.740 align:middle line:10%
to go amass and find these
tablets which were already

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:11.390 align:middle line:10%
ancient during his time period.

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:13.170 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And what
was his time period?

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:13.790 align:middle line:84%
>> LACROIX: Well,
that's the thing.

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:15.832 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to recreate
the timeline of history,

00:11:15.832 --> 00:11:18.020 align:middle line:84%
because that doctrine
of 6,000 years

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:21.110 align:middle line:84%
is truly something that
we have to move everything

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:22.280 align:middle line:90%
in a different places.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.640 align:middle line:84%
He probably lives somewhere
around 4,000 years ago.

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So he was dedicated
to preserving history

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:29.330 align:middle line:90%
and knowledge.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:33.530 align:middle line:84%
So that was discovered
in the mid-1800s,

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:36.740 align:middle line:84%
and so let's talk about what
happened with that information,

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:38.180 align:middle line:90%
once it was rediscovered.

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:38.980 align:middle line:90%
>> LACROIX: Yeah.

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:42.230 align:middle line:84%
So Austen Henry Layard found
more than 50,000 cuneiform

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:43.730 align:middle line:84%
tablets in this
ancient library that

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:45.560 align:middle line:90%
had been burned to the ground.

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.870 align:middle line:84%
It actually helped preserve
the tablets even better

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:49.430 align:middle line:84%
because of the
heat, and they were

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:50.810 align:middle line:90%
buried under layers of sand.

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And they found them, and
they looked at these tablets,

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.910 align:middle line:84%
and they had absolutely
no idea how to read them.

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:58.730 align:middle line:84%
It was unlike any language
they'd ever seen before,

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:00.680 align:middle line:84%
and if you study
Sumerian, you learn

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.720 align:middle line:84%
that it's what's known
as a language isolate.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.490 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
that's shared by it.

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:05.870 align:middle line:90%
It's unique in its own.

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:07.430 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't even use an alphabet.

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:11.090 align:middle line:84%
It has just enormous amounts
of different characters related

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:14.540 align:middle line:84%
to words that you combine to
figure out what the story is.

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:16.910 align:middle line:84%
So for more than 20
years, these tablets

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:19.210 align:middle line:84%
remained unknown
for what they were.

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:21.190 align:middle line:84%
It was a language
that had died out

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:23.840 align:middle line:84%
and had not been spoken
for thousands of years.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:24.640 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:27.550 align:middle line:10%
>> LACROIX: And so these tablets
remained for no more than 20

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:32.380 align:middle line:10%
years, until a man named
George Smith, in 1875,

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:35.860 align:middle line:10%
finally cracked the code and
figured out how to actually

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:38.980 align:middle line:10%
read it, and the first tablets
that he translated was the Epic

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:39.850 align:middle line:10%
of Gilgamesh.

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And he realized
that here we have

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:44.770 align:middle line:84%
a story that talks about
origins and the great deluge

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:46.270 align:middle line:84%
and these different
kings and rulers

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:48.760 align:middle line:84%
at different times and all
these incredible aspects.

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:52.870 align:middle line:84%
And from there, individuals
like Samuel and Noah Kramer

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:57.520 align:middle line:84%
and Stephanie Dalley have come
and confirmed his translations

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:00.920 align:middle line:84%
to try to piece of this story
back together from the past.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so what was it in
the Sitchin story that you did

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:05.540 align:middle line:90%
not resonate with in particular?

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:06.340 align:middle line:90%
>> LACROIX: Yeah.

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:08.200 align:middle line:84%
There was a number
of terms and ways

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.227 align:middle line:84%
that he interpreted
things that just were not

00:13:10.227 --> 00:13:12.310 align:middle line:84%
very accurate, if you go
back to read the records.

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:14.260 align:middle line:84%
For instance, he
talked about how

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.440 align:middle line:84%
we were created to
mine gold and toil

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:20.080 align:middle line:84%
in this place, almost
like a slave species,

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:21.813 align:middle line:84%
but really, what
you find is they

00:13:21.813 --> 00:13:24.230 align:middle line:84%
don't talk about gold mining
or anything like that at all.

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:26.830 align:middle line:84%
They actually talk about
how the ancient Igigi,

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:29.440 align:middle line:84%
a subset of the
Annunaki, were trying

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.690 align:middle line:90%
to create infrastructure here.

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:34.540 align:middle line:84%
It actually talks about
how they were laying bricks

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:37.030 align:middle line:84%
and pure places, and the
Igigi were building temples,

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:40.330 align:middle line:84%
and they were clearing
lifelines of the river channels.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:43.240 align:middle line:84%
So that was what I think some
of the confusion over mining

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:46.480 align:middle line:84%
was, because they were clearing
river channels of the Tigris

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.100 align:middle line:84%
and Euphrates
Rivers, so that they

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:50.050 align:middle line:84%
could have an extensive
agricultural system

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:53.030 align:middle line:84%
to create the blueprints
of a civilization.

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:55.690 align:middle line:84%
You have to have certain
criteria and certain things

00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:57.190 align:middle line:84%
to be able to create
a civilization,

00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:00.400 align:middle line:84%
and they knew that, and that
was what they were doing there.

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:03.363 align:middle line:84%
But the story going forward
on where we came from

00:14:03.363 --> 00:14:04.780 align:middle line:84%
and how we're
associated with that

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:06.170 align:middle line:90%
was just quite a bit different.

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:06.970 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:09.820 align:middle line:84%
OK, and so the whole
notion of slave species

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:11.650 align:middle line:84%
doesn't exactly play
out the same way.

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:12.190 align:middle line:90%
>> LACROIX: No.

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:12.650 align:middle line:90%
In fact--

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:14.110 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because I have a
great objection to the term

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:14.530 align:middle line:90%
slaves species.

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:14.830 align:middle line:90%
>> LACROIX: Yeah.

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:15.980 align:middle line:90%
I do as well.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.770 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's
really the opposite

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:22.870 align:middle line:84%
is that we were created by
some and almost like perfection

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:23.830 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:27.160 align:middle line:84%
How we were created perfect
for this planet but also

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.520 align:middle line:84%
to be truly like
beings that could've

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:33.700 align:middle line:84%
been sent to a place of
enormous power and potential.

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And that power and potential
has been forgotten in us,

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:40.700 align:middle line:84%
and we have lost our way over
such a long period of time.

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:43.660 align:middle line:84%
All of these catastrophes that
have come and reset us back

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:45.340 align:middle line:84%
and having to relearn
everything again,

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:47.960 align:middle line:84%
and we really are a shadow
of our former self right now.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:48.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:51.080 align:middle line:84%
We just have to
wake up, remember,

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:53.080 align:middle line:84%
and that's what you're
trying to help people do.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, that is
interesting, because even

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.250 align:middle line:84%
in the world of ufology
and some of the people

00:14:57.250 --> 00:15:00.608 align:middle line:84%
who've written books back
in the '40s, '50s '60s,

00:15:00.608 --> 00:15:02.650 align:middle line:84%
there was a little more
sanity around the subject

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:05.050 align:middle line:90%
in a certain sense at that time.

00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:08.350 align:middle line:84%
It has been said that
there are at least

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:14.860 align:middle line:84%
400,000 humanoid species
just in our galaxy.

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:18.580 align:middle line:84%
And so if that's true
it appears that this

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:21.580 align:middle line:84%
form that we have now, and
the form the Annunaki came in,

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:24.520 align:middle line:84%
and we see slight iterations
of longer skulls or fewer

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.620 align:middle line:84%
fingers and so forth
here and there.

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:31.820 align:middle line:84%
But it appears to be a form
that's quite diversely capable.

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:32.620 align:middle line:90%
>> LACROIX: Yeah.

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:33.420 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:36.970 align:middle line:84%
It seems like-- we don't know
all the different species that

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:38.030 align:middle line:90%
exist in the universe.

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:40.452 align:middle line:84%
We only have this little
glimpse of this might be this.

00:15:40.452 --> 00:15:42.160 align:middle line:84%
This might be that,
but one of the things

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.630 align:middle line:84%
we know for certain is we
were created in their image.

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:45.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:47.110 align:middle line:84%
>> LACROIX: Meaning that
they looked like us,

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:49.065 align:middle line:84%
and you can see depictions
in murals of them.

00:15:49.065 --> 00:15:50.440 align:middle line:84%
They're much taller
than we were,

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:53.110 align:middle line:84%
and I think really that's where
the whole story of the Nephilim

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:55.480 align:middle line:84%
comes in with these
giant kings ruling.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.310 align:middle line:90%
That's the image of them.

00:15:57.310 --> 00:15:58.330 align:middle line:90%
That's what they are.

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:01.097 align:middle line:84%
We are like a child of them
created in their image.

00:16:01.097 --> 00:16:03.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So we're just
another iteration of a humanoid

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:03.910 align:middle line:90%
species.

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:04.360 align:middle line:90%
>> LACROIX: Exactly.

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.402 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Basically,
which is highly functional.

00:16:06.402 --> 00:16:07.540 align:middle line:90%
We have opposable thumbs.

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:08.582 align:middle line:90%
>> LACROIX: That's right.

00:16:08.582 --> 00:16:09.382 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:16:09.382 --> 00:16:11.020 align:middle line:84%
So let's get into
Eridu, and let's

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:13.150 align:middle line:90%
talk about some of the gods.

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:16.240 align:middle line:84%
To me, it's fascinating,
when it starts crossing over

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.650 align:middle line:90%
into biblical characters.

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:18.692 align:middle line:90%
>> LACROIX: That's right.

00:16:18.692 --> 00:16:20.793 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's get
into Enlil and Enki Many

00:16:20.793 --> 00:16:22.960 align:middle line:84%
of the people watching this
right now, our audience,

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:25.690 align:middle line:84%
have heard of them, but go
ahead and tell it the way you

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:26.770 align:middle line:90%
understand it.

00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:27.100 align:middle line:90%
>> LACROIX: OK.

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:28.990 align:middle line:84%
So when you look at
ancient Sumerian records,

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:31.570 align:middle line:84%
and you look at the history
of it, what you find

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:36.400 align:middle line:84%
is that this archetype of
what these gods are portraying

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.130 align:middle line:84%
is not just based on forces
of nature or the planets.

00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:41.650 align:middle line:90%
They're real ethereal beings.

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:44.590 align:middle line:84%
They're deities that seem to
have a very significant role

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:45.460 align:middle line:90%
in our story.

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:48.250 align:middle line:84%
It seems that our story
begins with them, as I said,

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:50.860 align:middle line:84%
with the creation of
us, but that creation

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:54.430 align:middle line:84%
came after the first
city was created.

00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:58.780 align:middle line:84%
So Eridu existed before
even mankind was created,

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:01.270 align:middle line:84%
and it may even be where
the biblical Eden is, along

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:03.610 align:middle line:84%
the banks of the Euphrates
and Tigris Rivers.

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:07.569 align:middle line:84%
That area was much different
10-plus 1,000 years ago

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:08.390 align:middle line:90%
than it is now.

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:09.760 align:middle line:90%
It had more water.

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:12.220 align:middle line:84%
It was much more lush, and
now it's more of a desert,

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:16.540 align:middle line:84%
but we have to remember,
the only constant is change.

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:17.349 align:middle line:90%
Climates change.

00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:19.640 align:middle line:84%
Things change over
time, and so the way

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.859 align:middle line:84%
that the Sumerian
stories really start

00:17:21.859 --> 00:17:24.890 align:middle line:84%
is that, basically,
there was this need

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:28.069 align:middle line:84%
to create a steward,
someone who could manage

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:30.260 align:middle line:84%
the infrastructure
here, someone who could

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:31.820 align:middle line:90%
do the role of the Annunaki.

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:35.433 align:middle line:84%
Because they decided that,
based on the Igigi's revolt

00:17:35.433 --> 00:17:37.100 align:middle line:84%
and not wanting to
do that work anymore,

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:40.430 align:middle line:84%
that we would be created to
alleviate the toil of the gods.

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:41.750 align:middle line:90%
That's the term they use.

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:44.105 align:middle line:84%
So that we would be the ones
doing all the things here

00:17:44.105 --> 00:17:46.910 align:middle line:84%
and building temples
and bringing whatever

00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:49.820 align:middle line:90%
they needed for those temples.

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:53.390 align:middle line:84%
And what's amazing about
Eridu is that's where--

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:56.720 align:middle line:84%
if you look at the creator
god who created mankind, Enki

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:58.700 align:middle line:90%
meaning Lord of the Earth--

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:02.420 align:middle line:84%
E-N means Lord-- and
Enlil, his half brother

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:04.850 align:middle line:84%
who in a lot of
the ancient stories

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:07.400 align:middle line:84%
really opposes how
we were created.

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:12.650 align:middle line:84%
He felt quite threatened
that we were created

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:16.490 align:middle line:84%
in too much like their image,
and that we would basically

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:18.740 align:middle line:84%
ascend and eventually become
even greater than he did.

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:21.360 align:middle line:84%
So there was a lot of tension
between the two of them,

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:24.800 align:middle line:84%
and so that's
really why it really

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.140 align:middle line:84%
weaves into why this
city is so important.

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:30.970 align:middle line:84%
Because Enki, the creator of
mankind along with his sister,

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:34.100 align:middle line:84%
Ninmah, that was
where it all began.

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:36.110 align:middle line:84%
That was where first
civilization first began

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:39.915 align:middle line:84%
and our story first began,
right there in Eridu.

00:18:39.915 --> 00:18:41.540 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at
the history of Eridu,

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:44.300 align:middle line:84%
you find out that there's an
ancient city of the Eridu,

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:47.280 align:middle line:84%
and then there's the ziggurat
of Eridu right next to it.

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And that site is where
all of these issues

00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:53.180 align:middle line:84%
are today, where it
has been deliberately

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:56.870 align:middle line:84%
ignored and deliberately
left to the wolves,

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:59.330 align:middle line:84%
so that this site can truly
just disappear in history

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:01.053 align:middle line:90%
and never be known.

00:19:01.053 --> 00:19:02.220 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's fascinating.

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:04.880 align:middle line:84%
It is fascinating that all the
attention has come back around

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:08.090 align:middle line:84%
to the same area, the
points of conflict.

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:10.850 align:middle line:84%
So what's interesting to me
also-- there are a few things.

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:15.388 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to throw the
metaphysical part into it.

00:19:15.388 --> 00:19:17.930 align:middle line:84%
You're doing the research on
all of the physical evidence you

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:21.588 align:middle line:84%
can find, and that is that
in far memory experiences

00:19:21.588 --> 00:19:23.630 align:middle line:84%
of people-- in other words,
those who can go back

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:25.880 align:middle line:90%
into other times--

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:28.520 align:middle line:84%
one thing that's been noted
is genetic manipulation

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.800 align:middle line:84%
and genetic engineering
around the planet

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:34.820 align:middle line:84%
and these projects where humans
were genetically engineered

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:37.340 align:middle line:84%
for whatever purpose
regionally was needed.

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:40.652 align:middle line:84%
And that holds up with
hundreds or thousands of people

00:19:40.652 --> 00:19:42.110 align:middle line:84%
who have gone back
in time have now

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:45.350 align:middle line:84%
documented, through their own
experience without knowing

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:46.740 align:middle line:90%
anything, about it.

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:47.540 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:48.470 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:50.550 align:middle line:84%
They were doing some
genetic work on us,

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:53.090 align:middle line:84%
and so this keeps
popping up randomly.

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:55.250 align:middle line:84%
So that overlays with
the physical evidence

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:59.450 align:middle line:84%
of what you're talking about
in the cuneiform tablets.

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:02.870 align:middle line:84%
The other part to me that's
fascinating in all this,

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:05.200 align:middle line:84%
when you're trying
to interpret it,

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:09.170 align:middle line:84%
is that I believe in the
wheel of incarnations.

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:09.970 align:middle line:90%
>> LACROIX: Yes.

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:14.260 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So people who
were there at that time are

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:15.760 align:middle line:90%
certainly around now.

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:16.760 align:middle line:90%
We keep coming back.

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.120 align:middle line:84%
So there are people who
actually were probably

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:22.300 align:middle line:84%
authors of some of those
cuneiform tablets--

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:24.370 align:middle line:90%
who knows, maybe even you--

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:26.350 align:middle line:84%
that are authors of
these that are back

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:30.455 align:middle line:84%
to interpret for that very
reason, because they can.

00:20:30.455 --> 00:20:32.080 align:middle line:84%
If I tried to do it,
I'd probably never

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:33.050 align:middle line:90%
be able to do it.

00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:36.340 align:middle line:84%
But if it's already in you,
if that information is already

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:38.620 align:middle line:84%
in you, these people,
I believe, many

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:41.050 align:middle line:84%
have come back to help
reveal our history to us.

00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:42.520 align:middle line:90%
>> LACROIX: Yeah.

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.260 align:middle line:84%
That's what I like
to think too, and I

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:47.960 align:middle line:84%
feel like this incredible
need to help this site.

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:48.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:49.840 align:middle line:84%
>> LACROIX: It's
something deep within me,

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:51.970 align:middle line:84%
and it's hard to figure
out what that is.

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:53.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, you
were born to do this.

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:54.670 align:middle line:84%
You're obsessed,
and it's wonderful.

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:56.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm so happy you
are, because you're

00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:58.240 align:middle line:84%
so clear in your
research, and you're

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:01.300 align:middle line:84%
so clear in your
articulation of it.

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:04.000 align:middle line:84%
Rather than going in as a
rah-rah for somebody else,

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.100 align:middle line:84%
to uphold someone
else's story, you're

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:09.280 align:middle line:84%
really trying to cut through and
find what's true for all of us.

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:12.640 align:middle line:84%
>> LACROIX: Yeah, and really the
way that it hits home to me is,

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.440 align:middle line:84%
not only the significance
of this site--

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.660 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to get into some
of the other things that play

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:18.743 align:middle line:84%
in as well with the star
connections and all those

00:21:18.743 --> 00:21:19.570 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:22.300 align:middle line:84%
But to see images,
like you mentioned,

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:25.660 align:middle line:84%
that I've saved and shown,
like in the other documentary

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:26.500 align:middle line:90%
that I had made.

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:31.030 align:middle line:84%
To see people just walking
up and finding the most

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:34.450 align:middle line:84%
ancient records of mankind,
the libraries of our stories

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:37.600 align:middle line:84%
sitting, sticking out of
these ancient temple walls

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.660 align:middle line:84%
and out of this ancient temple
mountain, and people just

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:43.480 align:middle line:84%
finding them and just
showing no respect,

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:46.570 align:middle line:84%
taking them and going to
steal them and sell them just

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:48.220 align:middle line:90%
for money.

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:50.117 align:middle line:90%
To me, it's the ultimate crime.

00:21:50.117 --> 00:21:50.950 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:51.790 align:middle line:90%
>> LACROIX: It really is.

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:53.498 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I agree
with you, and for you,

00:21:53.498 --> 00:21:54.890 align:middle line:90%
it just breaks your heart.

00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:56.015 align:middle line:90%
>> LACROIX: It really does.

00:21:56.015 --> 00:21:57.550 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it hits
home, and that's

00:21:57.550 --> 00:22:00.220 align:middle line:84%
why I created that
campaign called Campaign

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:03.400 align:middle line:84%
to Protect Eridu, so we can help
bring awareness to this site.

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:06.310 align:middle line:10%
Because honestly, you
like to think, well,

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:09.040 align:middle line:10%
somebody else will do
this, and maybe they won't.

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:10.040 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They haven't.

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:10.400 align:middle line:90%
>> LACROIX: Right?

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:10.900 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:12.108 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They haven't, so--

00:22:12.108 --> 00:22:15.460 align:middle line:84%
>> LACROIX: So I'm doing it,
and others are helping to bring

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:18.663 align:middle line:84%
awareness to a lot of these
organizations that have decided

00:22:18.663 --> 00:22:20.080 align:middle line:84%
to ignore this
site and forget it.

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:22.570 align:middle line:84%
And if we get enough
support and enough awareness

00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:24.610 align:middle line:84%
about these ancient
sites, we can

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:26.500 align:middle line:84%
protect them and get
those ancient records

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:27.430 align:middle line:90%
and have them studied.

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:30.020 align:middle line:84%
So we can understand our
story to an even deeper level.

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:30.820 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:32.500 align:middle line:84%
So you talked about
a couple of temples

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:35.740 align:middle line:84%
one regular kind and one
regular-sided pyramid,

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:39.920 align:middle line:84%
but also the ziggurat temple
which is different in nature.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:42.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of them was
dedicated to the underworld,

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:45.190 align:middle line:84%
and people don't really
understand what that means.

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:48.250 align:middle line:84%
They think often, oh,
does that mean Satan?

00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:49.370 align:middle line:90%
What does this mean?

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:52.850 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the temple
connected with the underworld

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:53.650 align:middle line:90%
that's there.

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:54.450 align:middle line:90%
>> LACROIX: OK.

00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:56.990 align:middle line:84%
So there's two sites at
Eridu that are important.

00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:58.217 align:middle line:90%
There may be more.

00:22:58.217 --> 00:23:00.550 align:middle line:84%
Again, that area hasn't really
been uncovered very well.

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:02.470 align:middle line:10%
So we still have
so much to find,

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:05.390 align:middle line:10%
but you have the main
city of Eridu itself

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:07.720 align:middle line:10%
which is the only area
that's ever been excavated.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:10.120 align:middle line:10%
It was excavated
for, subsequently,

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:14.415 align:middle line:10%
for late 1800s briefly,
up through 1946 to 1948.

00:23:14.415 --> 00:23:15.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And
we'll get to that,

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:16.915 align:middle line:90%
because that's interesting.

00:23:16.915 --> 00:23:19.360 align:middle line:84%
>> LACROIX: OK, but what's
important is that we look

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:23.362 align:middle line:84%
at the ziggurat of Eridu, known
as it's also the main name,

00:23:23.362 --> 00:23:25.070 align:middle line:84%
if you were to look
in the ancient texts,

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:26.360 align:middle line:90%
it's called the E-Abzu Temple.

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:27.160 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:29.740 align:middle line:84%
So that's the E, it's
named after Enki,

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:30.970 align:middle line:90%
and it's his temple.

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:33.700 align:middle line:84%
Because the interesting
aspect, when you really

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:36.910 align:middle line:84%
look into the tablets, is that
the Annunaki seemed to take up

00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:38.518 align:middle line:90%
different roles in our reality.

00:23:38.518 --> 00:23:40.060 align:middle line:84%
That was really it's
the thing that's

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:44.140 align:middle line:84%
echoed throughout all of
them is that like Enlil,

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:46.870 align:middle line:84%
Lord of the Sky or
the Heavens, and then

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:50.860 align:middle line:84%
Enki, Lord of the Earth,
he was designated to become

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:52.150 align:middle line:90%
a ruler in the underworld.

00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:54.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are some
serious connotations that--

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:55.970 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:56.770 align:middle line:90%
>> LACROIX: Yeah.

00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:59.110 align:middle line:84%
Later on about this being
the place where hell is

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:00.590 align:middle line:90%
and all those terms.

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:02.530 align:middle line:90%
Those terms aren't real.

00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:04.810 align:middle line:84%
Those are scare tactics
and fear-based things.

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:06.310 align:middle line:84%
Really, what it
comes down to is you

00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:09.590 align:middle line:84%
think of the Earth as a realm,
and you have higher dimensions,

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:10.390 align:middle line:90%
lower dimensions.

00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:12.670 align:middle line:84%
You have the surface, where
the physical reality is.

00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:14.710 align:middle line:84%
Then, you have
everything underneath us,

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:16.960 align:middle line:84%
and that's what is
called the underworld.

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:20.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you look at
the ancient Egyptians,

00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:21.970 align:middle line:84%
they were obsessed
with the underworld.

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:25.390 align:middle line:84%
That was where they figured
that incarnation and reaching

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:27.070 align:middle line:90%
higher states of energy was.

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:29.080 align:middle line:84%
And not to mention,
you could go down in

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:31.230 align:middle line:84%
and connect to potentially
the gods in ways

00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:32.230 align:middle line:90%
that you couldn't above.

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:34.363 align:middle line:84%
It was a different kind
of energy going down

00:24:34.363 --> 00:24:36.280 align:middle line:84%
to the center of the
Earth, having the aquifer

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:38.620 align:middle line:84%
systems and the
connections that they

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:40.540 align:middle line:84%
had with the pyramids
and all those systems.

00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:43.240 align:middle line:84%
The same thing is
true though in Eridu,

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.620 align:middle line:90%
but it's a little bit different.

00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:47.530 align:middle line:10%
Because the E-Abzu
Temple is called

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:50.200 align:middle line:10%
that, because it's literally
the temple of the underworld.

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:52.670 align:middle line:10%
That's what that
name breaks down to.

00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at depictions
of Eridu, that ziggurat,

00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:00.550 align:middle line:84%
the way that they had artists'
rendering from descriptions

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:04.030 align:middle line:84%
before it collapsed and
became what it is now,

00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:07.570 align:middle line:84%
you saw ancient temple openings
in multiple places that

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:10.690 align:middle line:84%
went down in, and we
don't know where they go.

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:12.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
really interesting is

00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:15.610 align:middle line:84%
that ziggurat mountain, where
the temple has been eroding,

00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:17.500 align:middle line:84%
where those tablets
are, that's never

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:19.435 align:middle line:84%
been excavated by
archaeologists ever.

00:25:19.435 --> 00:25:20.560 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Which is insane.

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.227 align:middle line:84%
>> LACROIX: It's just
completely insane.

00:25:22.227 --> 00:25:25.030 align:middle line:84%
There are not only are those
treasures on the mountain mound

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:27.550 align:middle line:84%
itself, like the tablets
and the clay pots,

00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:31.540 align:middle line:84%
but there may be literal
underworld entrances that

00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:33.830 align:middle line:90%
go down to who knows where.

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:34.630 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:36.550 align:middle line:84%
>> LACROIX: And that's very
exciting to think about.

00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:37.870 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It is very
exciting to think about.

00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:40.010 align:middle line:84%
We can go a couple of
different directions.

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:43.000 align:middle line:84%
One, just to again lay down
a little bit of framework

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.330 align:middle line:84%
historically, one thing that
we didn't mention a bit ago is,

00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:47.980 align:middle line:84%
when they started
doing excavation--

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:50.410 align:middle line:84%
and you have photos of
this in your documentary--

00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:51.940 align:middle line:90%
it's laden with seashells.

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:52.982 align:middle line:90%
>> LACROIX: That's right.

00:25:52.982 --> 00:25:55.150 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So the
city was buried.

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:57.715 align:middle line:84%
Due to the inundation,
it was buried.

00:25:57.715 --> 00:26:00.400 align:middle line:84%
>> LACROIX: Yeah, and that's
another piece of the evidence.

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:01.200 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:03.835 align:middle line:84%
And you say, OK, well, the
Sumerian King List, some people

00:26:03.835 --> 00:26:05.710 align:middle line:84%
could add up dates wrong
that may be suspect,

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:07.930 align:middle line:84%
but what about when you get
physical evidence like this?

00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:08.230 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:10.930 align:middle line:84%
Where you look, and you could
see some of those images

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:13.210 align:middle line:84%
I have on that
documentary, where

00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:14.980 align:middle line:84%
because this mountain
was never excavated,

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:16.612 align:middle line:90%
it was almost left in place.

00:26:16.612 --> 00:26:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And there literally,
like you said,

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:22.180 align:middle line:84%
are seashells strewn across
the top of the mountain, which

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:24.100 align:middle line:84%
you think, well, how
could something like that

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:24.970 align:middle line:90%
even happen?

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And you really look at
the deluge stories that

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.560 align:middle line:84%
are in these tablets
carried over,

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.050 align:middle line:84%
and you really find that
there were catastrophes

00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:33.040 align:middle line:90%
in Earth's history.

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:35.680 align:middle line:84%
Where things like maybe
the Mediterranean Black Sea

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:38.248 align:middle line:84%
and the Persian Gulf
had these walls of water

00:26:38.248 --> 00:26:40.040 align:middle line:84%
that came through and
destroyed everything.

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:42.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that's
the ultimate proof for how

00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:44.470 align:middle line:84%
these seashells got
laid in that spot,

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:48.130 align:middle line:84%
and how it proves that this
city is older than the flood.

00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:48.970 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So yes.

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:49.770 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:51.950 align:middle line:84%
So that takes us back at
least 12,000 years anyway.

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:52.750 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:54.910 align:middle line:90%
Now, let's go to the above part.

00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:56.770 align:middle line:84%
They had alignments
that have become

00:26:56.770 --> 00:26:59.590 align:middle line:84%
well known at other
famous, sacred sites

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:02.470 align:middle line:84%
as well, with the stars
with a constellation.

00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:04.160 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
their alignments.

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:04.960 align:middle line:90%
>> LACROIX: OK.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.705 align:middle line:84%
So the first place
to point out--

00:27:06.705 --> 00:27:08.830 align:middle line:84%
so when people start looking
at these ancient sites

00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:12.520 align:middle line:84%
and the significance of how they
play for why they were built

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:14.140 align:middle line:84%
in the certain
locations they are,

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:16.010 align:middle line:84%
there's a couple of
things to consider.

00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:17.650 align:middle line:84%
The first is that
there seems to be

00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:19.390 align:middle line:84%
this line around
the Earth that's

00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:21.040 align:middle line:90%
known as the 38th parallel.

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:23.980 align:middle line:84%
It's this location between
the middle of the land masses

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:27.460 align:middle line:84%
and above the equator, where
it was very important for them

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:29.600 align:middle line:90%
to build right on that line.

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:32.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's just one of the
things that's very interesting.

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:35.140 align:middle line:84%
Like for instance, you
look at where Eridu is.

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:36.758 align:middle line:90%
You go west.

00:27:36.758 --> 00:27:38.800 align:middle line:84%
You look at where the
Great Pyramids of Giza are.

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:40.510 align:middle line:90%
You continue just to the east.

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:42.400 align:middle line:84%
You look at the ancient
city of Persepolis

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:44.980 align:middle line:84%
in Iran and Naqsh-e
Rostam, and then you

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:48.070 align:middle line:84%
keep going over like Angkor
Wat and all these places.

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:50.650 align:middle line:84%
They're all found right
on this 38th parallel,

00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:52.160 align:middle line:90%
but there's more.

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:54.040 align:middle line:84%
There's also these
ley line connections

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:56.590 align:middle line:84%
on the Earth that
correspond exactly

00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:59.618 align:middle line:84%
to the same locations too, and
there's even others as well,

00:27:59.618 --> 00:28:00.910 align:middle line:90%
as we get into star alignments.

00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:04.960 align:middle line:84%
But as I was saying just now
before, when I mentioned that,

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:08.590 align:middle line:84%
go to a place like the
Great Pyramids of Giza.

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:09.990 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:13.172 align:middle line:84%
Look at how those
pyramids are aligned,

00:28:13.172 --> 00:28:14.630 align:middle line:84%
and then you take
some of the work,

00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:16.220 align:middle line:84%
like Freddie Silva
and Graham Hancock

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:18.320 align:middle line:84%
and Robert Schoch and
all these great minds,

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:21.590 align:middle line:84%
and they noticed and identified
that, hey, wait a minute.

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:24.495 align:middle line:84%
Not only are these pyramids
aligned to Sirius and Orion

00:28:24.495 --> 00:28:26.120 align:middle line:84%
during a certain time
period of history

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:28.310 align:middle line:84%
that show how old they
are, but they're also

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:31.130 align:middle line:84%
aligned to the three
belt stars of Orion,

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:33.570 align:middle line:84%
and we see that in
Teotihuacan as well.

00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:37.887 align:middle line:84%
But where we also see it
is in other new discoveries

00:28:37.887 --> 00:28:38.720 align:middle line:90%
that have been made.

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:41.570 align:middle line:84%
For instance, you had Freddy
Silva on your show recently.

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:43.460 align:middle line:84%
He was discussing
the connections

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:45.890 align:middle line:84%
with Gobekli Tepe with
the Great Pyramids,

00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:48.260 align:middle line:84%
and that was a
fascinating connection

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:51.075 align:middle line:84%
that I thought was very
helpful for identifying some

00:28:51.075 --> 00:28:52.200 align:middle line:90%
of these other connections.

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:54.650 align:middle line:84%
So what Freddy was talking
about that was so brilliant

00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:56.810 align:middle line:84%
is that, when you
look at Gobekli Tepe,

00:28:56.810 --> 00:28:59.000 align:middle line:84%
its original name
wasn't Potbelly Hill.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.680 align:middle line:84%
It was Portasar, and Portasar
means umbilical cord of Osiris.

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:07.580 align:middle line:84%
And Osiris was-- one of the
ancient connections it had was

00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:09.980 align:middle line:84%
that it had a deep
connection to relate

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:11.960 align:middle line:84%
to the Orion, the
stars of Orion,

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:15.320 align:middle line:84%
and that was like in a
symbolic way to connect Osiris.

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:20.030 align:middle line:84%
So if the three pyramids of Giza
are aligned to the three belt

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:25.190 align:middle line:84%
stars of Orion, and Gobekli Tepe
is the umbilical cord of Orion,

00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:26.960 align:middle line:90%
then what else is connected?

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:28.910 align:middle line:84%
And I started to
really look at this,

00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:31.430 align:middle line:84%
and one of the really
significant connections I found

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:33.710 align:middle line:84%
was, when I was
looking at star charts,

00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:36.320 align:middle line:84%
and I noticed where Orion is,
where the umbilical cord is

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:38.810 align:middle line:84%
with Gobekli Tepe,
how everything aligns

00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:41.480 align:middle line:84%
and thinking about the
law of correspondence,

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:45.050 align:middle line:84%
as above, so below, and the fact
that it seems like everything

00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:46.935 align:middle line:84%
is being built here
to mirror the heavens,

00:29:46.935 --> 00:29:47.810 align:middle line:90%
to mirror the cosmos.

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:49.268 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: To mirror
their heavens.

00:29:49.268 --> 00:29:53.570 align:middle line:84%
>> LACROIX: Exactly, and
what you found was that

00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:56.150 align:middle line:84%
the Euphrates River and,
potentially, even the Tigris,

00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:59.750 align:middle line:84%
they may have had a very
different flow direction back

00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:00.560 align:middle line:90%
in the day.

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:02.360 align:middle line:10%
And it looks like,
when you connect

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:05.570 align:middle line:10%
Gobekli Tepe at the headwaters
with Eridu down at the Persian

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:08.570 align:middle line:10%
Gulf and all the other ancient
Sumerian cities in between,

00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:12.380 align:middle line:10%
you get an exact mirroring of
the Eridanus constellation.

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:17.420 align:middle line:10%
And Eridanus is what connects
to Orion in the stars.

00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:18.620 align:middle line:90%
It's a star connection.

00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:20.968 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, and it's
their star connection.

00:30:20.968 --> 00:30:22.010 align:middle line:90%
>> LACROIX: That's right.

00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:27.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That they created
it to not just mimic but bring,

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:31.690 align:middle line:84%
as you say, below, where they
are familiar with from above.

00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:35.050 align:middle line:84%
>> LACROIX: Yeah, and it looks
like they were creating that

00:30:35.050 --> 00:30:37.840 align:middle line:84%
heaven on Earth here,
and furthermore,

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:41.830 align:middle line:84%
even the stars of Eridanus
may exactly correlate to where

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:44.980 align:middle line:84%
these cities were built. That's
why Eridu has such a similar

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:46.120 align:middle line:90%
name to Eridanus.

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:46.480 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:47.380 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:51.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, and if you take the notion
that we've had periodic poll

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:53.057 align:middle line:84%
reversals through
time, of course,

00:30:53.057 --> 00:30:55.265 align:middle line:84%
the waters are going to run
a little bit differently.

00:30:55.265 --> 00:30:57.020 align:middle line:84%
Everything is going
to reconfigure itself.

00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:59.560 align:middle line:84%
So the fact that there's
even this much history that's

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:02.433 align:middle line:84%
this well preserved,
if indeed we're

00:31:02.433 --> 00:31:03.850 align:middle line:84%
talking about a
culture that could

00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:05.410 align:middle line:84%
be a quarter of a
million years old,

00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:07.940 align:middle line:84%
is phenomenal that we've
even gotten this far, really.

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:08.740 align:middle line:90%
>> LACROIX: Yeah.

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:09.540 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:13.990 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So now, let's talk
about what happened in 1948.

00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:16.330 align:middle line:90%
I just find this so peculiar.

00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:17.470 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about it.

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:18.270 align:middle line:90%
>> LACROIX: OK.

00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:21.670 align:middle line:84%
So the University of
Oxford and a couple other,

00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:24.730 align:middle line:84%
like the Iraqi museum and
a few other institutions,

00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:29.830 align:middle line:84%
they went back to Eridu after
an extended period of time

00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:30.910 align:middle line:90%
of not being at the site.

00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:32.920 align:middle line:84%
There was work done
in the late 1800s,

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:35.020 align:middle line:84%
and they were in the
city of Eridu excavating,

00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:36.580 align:middle line:90%
and then that kind of stopped.

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And then they went down, and
they revisited again the site

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:44.740 align:middle line:84%
from the years in 1946 to
1948, and they found tablets.

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:47.360 align:middle line:10%
There's even one displayed
in the University of Oxford.

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:48.160 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Eureka.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:48.490 align:middle line:10%
>> LACROIX: Right?

00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:49.520 align:middle line:10%
They found information.

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:51.700 align:middle line:10%
It's not like they went there,
they didn't discover anything,

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:52.930 align:middle line:10%
and they decided to move on.

00:31:52.930 --> 00:31:55.540 align:middle line:84%
They found tablets,
displayed them.

00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:56.680 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:56.890 align:middle line:90%
>> LACROIX: Yeah.

00:31:56.890 --> 00:31:57.690 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:31:57.690 --> 00:32:00.160 align:middle line:84%
They displayed and they found
where the first city on Earth

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:04.240 align:middle line:84%
was, and then, poof, they
just abandoned the site.

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:06.760 align:middle line:84%
The site itself
has been ignored,

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:09.730 align:middle line:84%
and the last time it
was excavated was 1948.

00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden, there must

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.780 align:middle line:84%
have been some kind of
a memo brought down.

00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:14.580 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:17.170 align:middle line:84%
Where hey, let's leave
this site alone and not

00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:19.060 align:middle line:90%
touch it ever again, basically.

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:21.070 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I just
don't understand that,

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:25.090 align:middle line:90%
not on any logical level.

00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:26.500 align:middle line:90%
This doesn't make any sense.

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:29.920 align:middle line:84%
If you have discovered something
that profound and ancient,

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:32.260 align:middle line:84%
why wouldn't universities
all over the world

00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:33.460 align:middle line:90%
have been all over this?

00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:35.650 align:middle line:84%
Why wouldn't governments
be trying to stake

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:36.710 align:middle line:90%
out their claim?

00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:37.510 align:middle line:90%
>> LACROIX: Yeah.

00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:38.310 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Why?

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:39.110 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:40.960 align:middle line:84%
The Americans went into
Iraq, and we're not

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:44.770 align:middle line:84%
a very well educated
population, certainly,

00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:46.570 align:middle line:84%
when they went in
there with the notion

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:50.830 align:middle line:84%
that the people, the native
people there, the Iraqis,

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:52.600 align:middle line:84%
are primitive people
with primitive art

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:54.020 align:middle line:90%
and primitive cities.

00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:56.650 align:middle line:84%
It was a very primitive
way to view people

00:32:56.650 --> 00:32:57.918 align:middle line:90%
in another part of the world.

00:32:57.918 --> 00:32:58.960 align:middle line:90%
So we weren't respectful.

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:00.580 align:middle line:84%
We talked about that
in the beginning,

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:02.800 align:middle line:84%
go in and start
trashing the joint.

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:04.750 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about some
of what was trashed

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:09.490 align:middle line:84%
and also how the Americans
started, essentially,

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:11.000 align:middle line:90%
taking over those areas.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:11.800 align:middle line:90%
>> LACROIX: OK.

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:14.800 align:middle line:84%
So the first place to start
is why did this happen?

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:16.465 align:middle line:90%
How could this be?

00:33:16.465 --> 00:33:17.590 align:middle line:90%
There's got to be a reason.

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:17.800 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:18.925 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Well, that's it.

00:33:18.925 --> 00:33:21.160 align:middle line:84%
>> LACROIX: There's two
major reasons in my mind.

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:23.890 align:middle line:84%
The first reason
is, this city being

00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:26.560 align:middle line:84%
as old as it is,
specifically mentioned

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:29.050 align:middle line:84%
as being the first city and
having that evidence there

00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:31.180 align:middle line:84%
for it, it would
completely change

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:33.380 align:middle line:90%
the narrative of human history.

00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:35.630 align:middle line:84%
We would have to completely
rewrite this whole story.

00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:36.430 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:38.752 align:middle line:84%
So you have that issue
right there as well.

00:33:38.752 --> 00:33:40.460 align:middle line:84%
But I think there's
an even deeper issue,

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:42.610 align:middle line:84%
and I think it gets
into religious context.

00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:46.760 align:middle line:84%
Because of the way that Enki
became demonized in religion,

00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:48.130 align:middle line:90%
he was the serpent.

00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:49.360 align:middle line:90%
That was his symbol.

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:52.297 align:middle line:84%
He was the serpent god, or the
metamorphosis that eventually

00:33:52.297 --> 00:33:54.880 align:middle line:84%
became the dragon, like you've
seen a lot of ancient cultures.

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:57.100 align:middle line:84%
But that's why you
see this influence

00:33:57.100 --> 00:34:00.250 align:middle line:84%
of, like in the Americas,
for instance, Kukulkan

00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:04.180 align:middle line:84%
to the Maya, Quetzalcoatl
to the Aztec, Viracocha,

00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:07.300 align:middle line:84%
these are all serpent gods
of wisdom and knowledge,

00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:08.656 align:middle line:90%
and what happened?

00:34:08.656 --> 00:34:10.989 align:middle line:84%
Well, later on, they were
conquered by the mighty Eagle,

00:34:10.989 --> 00:34:13.490 align:middle line:84%
and this became a
demonized place.

00:34:13.490 --> 00:34:14.290 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:17.350 align:middle line:84%
Enki became this Satan
figure in the underworld.

00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:22.030 align:middle line:84%
That's why, when you look at the
trident and then the pitchfork,

00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:25.360 align:middle line:84%
the trident was one of
his original symbols

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:28.150 align:middle line:84%
that he had with him during
ancient Atlantean times.

00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And then it became
inverted to the pitchfork

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:32.800 align:middle line:84%
and this tell devil
figure down there,

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:36.429 align:middle line:84%
and that's because
he became a threat.

00:34:36.429 --> 00:34:38.560 align:middle line:90%
He created us in perfection.

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:42.110 align:middle line:84%
He was the crafty, creator
god of our history,

00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:44.199 align:middle line:84%
and he became demonized,
because it goes back

00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:45.790 align:middle line:84%
to the story of
the Garden of Eden.

00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:49.270 align:middle line:84%
He is the serpent that
tempted Adam and Eve to eat

00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:52.690 align:middle line:84%
of the fruit of the tree
of knowledge, and remember,

00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:55.850 align:middle line:84%
there's this god figure in that
story that didn't want that.

00:34:55.850 --> 00:34:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And I really think
that, if you really

00:34:57.790 --> 00:34:59.560 align:middle line:84%
look at the parallels
of that story,

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:01.870 align:middle line:90%
that god figure is Enlil.

00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:03.640 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: If Enlil--

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:07.145 align:middle line:84%
how did he gain that degree
of prominence and control?

00:35:07.145 --> 00:35:08.770 align:middle line:84%
>> LACROIX: Well,
it's a complex story.

00:35:08.770 --> 00:35:11.740 align:middle line:84%
Even though Enki is considered
his title as Lord of the Earth,

00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:14.850 align:middle line:84%
Enlil ended up being in control
of most of the story here,

00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:15.650 align:middle line:90%
most of the art.

00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:17.775 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, we're
talking Old Testament stuff.

00:35:17.775 --> 00:35:20.560 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about pitiful
God's really, punishing

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:24.880 align:middle line:84%
and pitiful gods that would
have you kneeling before them

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:27.910 align:middle line:84%
and begging for crumbs, that Old
Testament stuff which I never

00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:29.500 align:middle line:90%
believed even at five.

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:32.980 align:middle line:84%
So that doesn't make any sense,
but how did that take hold?

00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:35.620 align:middle line:84%
It took hold of all the
major world religions.

00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:37.828 align:middle line:84%
>> LACROIX: That's right,
and those are the Abrahamic

00:35:37.828 --> 00:35:39.940 align:middle line:84%
religions that came after
that, and I feel like,

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:43.740 align:middle line:84%
if you look at those parallels
of that jealous god, Enlil,

00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:46.450 align:middle line:84%
who in gnostic texts,
like the Nag Hammadi.

00:35:46.450 --> 00:35:49.900 align:middle line:84%
He talks about how his
name in there is Yaldabaoth

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:52.540 align:middle line:84%
and he's a jealous
god of humanity that

00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:54.758 align:middle line:84%
is so jealous that
he casts us down

00:35:54.758 --> 00:35:56.050 align:middle line:90%
into the lowest form of matter.

00:35:56.050 --> 00:35:57.160 align:middle line:90%
That's a quote from that.

00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:57.460 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:35:57.460 --> 00:35:59.680 align:middle line:84%
>> LACROIX: And that same
figure is also, I believe,

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:03.010 align:middle line:84%
Yahweh in the Old Testament,
who is, like you said,

00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:05.930 align:middle line:84%
he's an angry, jealous god that
demands sacrifice and all these

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:06.730 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:36:06.730 --> 00:36:07.897 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Blood sacrifices.

00:36:07.897 --> 00:36:10.600 align:middle line:84%
>> LACROIX: But that's
why Enki became demonized,

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:13.750 align:middle line:84%
because he took over religion
as this powerful figure,

00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:17.020 align:middle line:84%
and Enki was this evil
serpent, underworld hell,

00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:18.160 align:middle line:90%
all these connotations.

00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:19.720 align:middle line:84%
That's why-- one of
the reasons why--

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:23.650 align:middle line:84%
I think this site has
also been abandoned.

00:36:23.650 --> 00:36:26.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so at
this point in time,

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:30.160 align:middle line:84%
where knowledge and information
can flow freely around

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:34.330 align:middle line:84%
the planet, why continue
to keep the ruse going?

00:36:34.330 --> 00:36:35.293 align:middle line:90%
>> LACROIX: Yeah.

00:36:35.293 --> 00:36:36.460 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: What's the point?

00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:38.050 align:middle line:84%
>> LACROIX: It's like they're
trying to hold onto scraps,

00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:40.300 align:middle line:84%
as long as they possibly
can, even though so many

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:43.300 align:middle line:84%
in the world are discovering
that this is an ancient city,

00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:46.270 align:middle line:84%
or the first city, and they're
literally like outraged.

00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:49.570 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of people who have
commented on that documentary

00:36:49.570 --> 00:36:51.988 align:middle line:84%
and on this information
just in complete disbelief

00:36:51.988 --> 00:36:53.530 align:middle line:84%
that something like
this is happening

00:36:53.530 --> 00:36:56.200 align:middle line:84%
to one of the most important,
if not the most important,

00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:57.250 align:middle line:90%
sites in history.

00:36:57.250 --> 00:36:57.730 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:57.730 --> 00:37:00.272 align:middle line:84%
>> LACROIX: And I think that's
why this show is so important,

00:37:00.272 --> 00:37:03.160 align:middle line:84%
talking to you, because we can
bring that necessary awareness

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:06.520 align:middle line:84%
to protect our story and all the
most important archaeological

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:07.340 align:middle line:90%
places in history.

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:08.140 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:11.200 align:middle line:84%
We have the governments,
the academic world.

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.840 align:middle line:84%
We have religions,
who might all resist

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:16.480 align:middle line:84%
having a new story of
our history emerge.

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:18.490 align:middle line:84%
But as I was
pointing out earlier,

00:37:18.490 --> 00:37:22.415 align:middle line:84%
it seems like that time is now
closing, that window for them.

00:37:22.415 --> 00:37:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you, like you say,
do a little bit of pillaging

00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:26.207 align:middle line:84%
and raping on the
way out the door

00:37:26.207 --> 00:37:28.720 align:middle line:90%
while you can is still going on.

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:33.010 align:middle line:84%
But tell us your vision
of what that story would

00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:36.010 align:middle line:84%
bring to humanity by way
of our own empowerment,

00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:37.520 align:middle line:90%
if it were allowed to get out.

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:38.320 align:middle line:90%
>> LACROIX: Yeah.

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.570 align:middle line:84%
So there's a tablet
called The Myth of Adapa,

00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:42.970 align:middle line:84%
and it discusses
how Adapa was not

00:37:42.970 --> 00:37:45.730 align:middle line:84%
the first man created but the
first perfect man created,

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:47.050 align:middle line:90%
and he lived in Eridu.

00:37:47.050 --> 00:37:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And it discusses
how he lived there,

00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:51.400 align:middle line:84%
and he was one of
the great sages.

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And they called these
sages the Apkallu,

00:37:53.890 --> 00:37:56.290 align:middle line:84%
and there were seven great
sages around the world.

00:37:56.290 --> 00:38:02.650 align:middle line:84%
And Enki, basically, his
incarnation as a king there was

00:38:02.650 --> 00:38:03.610 align:middle line:90%
known as [NON-ENGLISH].

00:38:03.610 --> 00:38:07.407 align:middle line:84%
And they had this perfect
story created, where humanity

00:38:07.407 --> 00:38:09.490 align:middle line:84%
was reaching these higher
states of consciousness,

00:38:09.490 --> 00:38:12.670 align:middle line:84%
and then, of course, the whole
thing fragmented, and language

00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:16.510 align:middle line:84%
was injected in and all
these different divisions

00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:21.040 align:middle line:84%
of humanity, and we all became
almost at odds with each other.

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:23.650 align:middle line:84%
But it really all
started there, and that's

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:27.640 align:middle line:84%
where not only the perfect man,
the perfect human was created,

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:32.860 align:middle line:84%
but it was where, essentially,
these divisions of the gods

00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:33.730 align:middle line:90%
really began.

00:38:33.730 --> 00:38:34.930 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
conversations were.

00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:36.388 align:middle line:84%
That's where they
decided to create

00:38:36.388 --> 00:38:39.730 align:middle line:84%
these aspects of above
and below of our reality,

00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:42.460 align:middle line:90%
so that they can create this.

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:46.360 align:middle line:84%
I guess, some would wonder
what exactly they created here.

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:48.610 align:middle line:84%
Is it a control system, or
is it more of just a way

00:38:48.610 --> 00:38:50.355 align:middle line:90%
to manage mankind?

00:38:50.355 --> 00:38:51.730 align:middle line:84%
It's an interesting
aspect, but I

00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:53.985 align:middle line:84%
think that the possibilities
of what we could discover

00:38:53.985 --> 00:38:56.110 align:middle line:84%
in Eridu, if we were able
to go in and excavate it,

00:38:56.110 --> 00:38:57.700 align:middle line:90%
are literally endless.

00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:00.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, if it's
the whole notion of created

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:03.440 align:middle line:84%
in their image, then that
means we're quite capable.

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:04.240 align:middle line:90%
>> LACROIX: Yeah.

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:06.698 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And I think that's
really the story right there.

00:39:06.698 --> 00:39:10.270 align:middle line:84%
I think that the institutions
and religions of the world

00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:13.360 align:middle line:84%
do not want us as human
beings to know just

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:16.960 align:middle line:84%
how incredibly capable we
already are, and imagine

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:20.322 align:middle line:84%
if we had our memory back how
incredibly capable we would be.

00:39:20.322 --> 00:39:22.280 align:middle line:84%
>> LACROIX: How angry
we'd be at what happened.

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:23.830 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:24.950 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And capable.

00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:27.490 align:middle line:84%
So just a little
bit, how can people

00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:34.370 align:middle line:84%
become involved in helping with
this effort to preserve Eridu?

00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:36.370 align:middle line:84%
Are you looking for
institutional help?

00:39:36.370 --> 00:39:39.080 align:middle line:84%
Are you looking for
a GoFundMe campaign?

00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:40.160 align:middle line:90%
What are you looking for?

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:42.790 align:middle line:84%
What would you like to
see in an ideal outcome?

00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:45.040 align:middle line:84%
>> LACROIX: Yeah, and I'm
really, in that documentary,

00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:47.200 align:middle line:84%
I put a number of names
that people can contact.

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:48.940 align:middle line:84%
I didn't include email
or phone numbers,

00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:50.980 align:middle line:84%
because I was going to
leave it open to people.

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:52.030 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to
just be like call

00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:53.592 align:middle line:90%
this number and all that stuff.

00:39:53.592 --> 00:39:56.050 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted people to reach
out in their own creative ways

00:39:56.050 --> 00:40:00.790 align:middle line:84%
that are non-violent, so that
we can overwhelm this system

00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:03.790 align:middle line:84%
to bring protection
to this site.

00:40:03.790 --> 00:40:06.130 align:middle line:84%
UNESCO all the way to
the University of Oxford,

00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:09.807 align:middle line:84%
the Iraqi antiquities, the
head of the Iraqi museum,

00:40:09.807 --> 00:40:11.890 align:middle line:84%
I could go on and on,
there's so many institutions

00:40:11.890 --> 00:40:14.800 align:middle line:84%
that control this
archaeological doctrine.

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:17.260 align:middle line:84%
That if enough pressure
is put on them,

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:18.790 align:middle line:90%
that something can change.

00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:21.040 align:middle line:84%
That's the only power that
we have as the people here.

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:21.840 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:24.850 align:middle line:84%
To truly use our
voice to make change.

00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:27.490 align:middle line:84%
And what I envision
here is, if we

00:40:27.490 --> 00:40:30.730 align:middle line:84%
were able to get enough
people to make enough noise,

00:40:30.730 --> 00:40:33.520 align:middle line:84%
especially like doing this
discussion with you right now,

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:36.010 align:middle line:84%
we can literally
change the future.

00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:38.590 align:middle line:84%
This site could be preserved
and not just studied

00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:39.800 align:middle line:90%
by one institution.

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:41.680 align:middle line:84%
But what if it was
studied by a collaboration

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:44.320 align:middle line:84%
of every archaeological
organization in the world?

00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:45.770 align:middle line:90%
Because we're all humans.

00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:46.730 align:middle line:90%
We're all people.

00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:50.020 align:middle line:84%
We need to all understand
our story and where it began.

00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And I envision something
like a Project Eridu,

00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:56.830 align:middle line:84%
where the public demanded
not only protection but maybe

00:40:56.830 --> 00:40:58.420 align:middle line:90%
complete openness and awareness.

00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:00.310 align:middle line:84%
Where we found another
tablet, and then

00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:02.260 align:middle line:90%
they show the new translation.

00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:04.000 align:middle line:84%
And everyone's maybe
excited to find out

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.090 align:middle line:84%
what comes out on like a
monthly or a six month basis

00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:09.880 align:middle line:84%
and like something
to keep up with it.

00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:13.060 align:middle line:84%
This could be an
exciting thing, because I

00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:16.540 align:middle line:84%
want to have you understand,
Regina, the significance

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:19.720 align:middle line:84%
is that you can't
see a site like this

00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:21.020 align:middle line:90%
anywhere in the world.

00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by that is, when
you study our ancient sites,

00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:28.170 align:middle line:84%
most of them have at
least been identified.

00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:29.790 align:middle line:84%
There are some under
the ground that

00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:33.270 align:middle line:84%
are not known about, like in the
jungles of Guatemala, for sure.

00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:37.110 align:middle line:10%
But places that are exposed on
the surface, that are known,

00:41:37.110 --> 00:41:39.270 align:middle line:10%
they all are at least
partially excavated

00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:40.740 align:middle line:10%
and somewhat protected.

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:45.610 align:middle line:10%
This site is like completely
abandoned, and not only that,

00:41:45.610 --> 00:41:49.080 align:middle line:10%
but as I said, the ziggurat of
Eridu was never even touched.

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:50.850 align:middle line:10%
And it just remains
sitting there

00:41:50.850 --> 00:41:52.590 align:middle line:10%
with all these records
just sticking--

00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:56.610 align:middle line:10%
literally cuneiform records, or
tablets, are like sticking out.

00:41:56.610 --> 00:41:57.780 align:middle line:10%
It's so sad.

00:41:57.780 --> 00:41:58.200 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: It's unbelievable.

00:41:58.200 --> 00:41:59.000 align:middle line:10%
>> LACROIX: I know.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.440 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: It's like, this
how is it possible this has

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:02.240 align:middle line:10%
happened?

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:05.010 align:middle line:84%
But I think we've looked
at a few of the motives

00:42:05.010 --> 00:42:08.290 align:middle line:84%
maybe, a few of the motives, but
nonetheless, I agree with you.

00:42:08.290 --> 00:42:11.370 align:middle line:84%
I think the time for secrecy,
that kind of shadow ownership,

00:42:11.370 --> 00:42:14.970 align:middle line:84%
is over, be it the Americans
or the Iraqis controlling it.

00:42:14.970 --> 00:42:17.320 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
belongs to all of humanity.

00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:19.800 align:middle line:84%
I agree with you
100%, and I'm glad,

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:21.447 align:middle line:84%
if you were there
then and back now,

00:42:21.447 --> 00:42:24.030 align:middle line:84%
or if you just came here for the
first time, however it rolls,

00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:26.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm just happy
you're so completely

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:27.780 align:middle line:90%
devoted to making this happen.

00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:28.020 align:middle line:90%
>> LACROIX: Thank you.

00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:28.820 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate that.

00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:30.060 align:middle line:90%

00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:31.350 align:middle line:90%
I love what you're doing.

00:42:31.350 --> 00:42:32.350 align:middle line:90%
>> LACROIX: My pleasure.

00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:33.390 align:middle line:90%
It's a passion of mine.

00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:34.950 align:middle line:90%
