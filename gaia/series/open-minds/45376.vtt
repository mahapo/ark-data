00:00:28.012 --> 00:00:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: I'm here
at the annual International UFO

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.250 align:middle line:84%
Congress in Scottsdale,
Arizona, where I've had a chance

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.550 align:middle line:84%
to catch up with some of the top
people in the world of ufology.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.440 align:middle line:84%
One such person
was Ted Peters, who

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.260 align:middle line:84%
has spent the majority of
his academic life examining

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.460 align:middle line:84%
the potential
effects of disclosure

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.130 align:middle line:84%
on the religious
communities of the world.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.360 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about some
of the larger themes

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.240 align:middle line:84%
first, which has to do more
with a certain kind of elitism

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.920 align:middle line:84%
in thinking between the
scientific community,

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.930 align:middle line:84%
the ufology community,
and then we're

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.732 align:middle line:84%
going to overlay that
into religions after.

00:01:03.732 --> 00:01:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And tell us your
perspective on it,

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.148 align:middle line:84%
because you've spent a
long time studying this.

00:01:07.148 --> 00:01:09.910 align:middle line:84%
>> TED PETERS: The largest thing
I can think of is the whole

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.790 align:middle line:90%
physical cosmos and who owns it.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe establishment space
scientists and astrobiologists

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.310 align:middle line:84%
think they own it,
or at least they

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.870 align:middle line:84%
own the privilege of dispensing
the information about it.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And what I find fascinating
is that the astrobiologists

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.047 align:middle line:84%
don't invite the ufologists
to their barbecues.

00:01:35.047 --> 00:01:36.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No, they don't.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.720 align:middle line:90%
>> PETERS: They don't.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.190 align:middle line:84%
And yet, I think
that if they did,

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.660 align:middle line:90%
they'd find a lot in common.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.680 align:middle line:84%
They're both very concerned
about the universe.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.770 align:middle line:84%
They're very concerned
about extraterrestrial life

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.540 align:middle line:90%
and our relationship to it.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.330 align:middle line:84%
The astrobiologists say
we're still looking.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.460 align:middle line:84%
The ufologists say
we've already found it.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.770 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.560 align:middle line:90%
>> PETERS: But they think alike.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And one of the ways
that they think alike

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.260 align:middle line:84%
that they don't acknowledge
is that they both believe

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.830 align:middle line:84%
in evolution, and then they
export evolution from Earth

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.240 align:middle line:84%
to these other planets
in an imaginary way.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And they believe that
evolution progresses.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.500 align:middle line:90%
It leads to intelligence.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.442 align:middle line:90%
It leads to science.

00:02:17.442 --> 00:02:18.400 align:middle line:90%
It leads to technology.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.970 align:middle line:84%
And bingo, we have
a wonderful world,

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.760 align:middle line:84%
the world that the
scientists create.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.637 align:middle line:84%
It's just that they've
created it on other planets.

00:02:27.637 --> 00:02:28.720 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They have, yes.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.580 align:middle line:84%
And I think part of
the problem, of course,

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.480 align:middle line:84%
always the challenge
with science,

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.120 align:middle line:84%
is that you have
grant money and you

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.650 align:middle line:84%
have tenure and all
these things to consider.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's very difficult for
science, at this point,

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.510 align:middle line:84%
to really move
outside of the box

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.250 align:middle line:84%
that they've put
themselves in, it seems.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: I think that's
an excellent insight.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And a year or two ago,
I gave a presentation

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.240 align:middle line:90%
to the SETI people.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.700 align:middle line:84%
There were 90
scientists in the room.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.280 align:middle line:84%
I suggested ways in which
they were making myths

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.550 align:middle line:84%
about these extraterrestrial
civilizations,

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.740 align:middle line:84%
and a few scientists
took umbrage.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.500 align:middle line:84%
But one said, oh, we've
got to make myths.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.100 align:middle line:84%
That's the way we
get our funding.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.900 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Truer words
were never spoken.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.005 align:middle line:90%
That I can appreciate.

00:03:13.005 --> 00:03:13.420 align:middle line:90%
>> PETERS: Right.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:14.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:15.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.739 align:middle line:84%
But I don't want to
hint that something's

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:19.780 align:middle line:90%
wrong with their science.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.585 align:middle line:90%
They do really good science.

00:03:21.585 --> 00:03:23.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They're doing what
they can within the constraints

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.950 align:middle line:90%
of an institution.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:24.949 align:middle line:90%
>> PETERS: That's right.

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:27.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think the whole
society should thank them.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.470 align:middle line:84%
But you're right that they
have certain parameters.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.110 align:middle line:84%
They stay within
those parameters.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
overlaps, actually,

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.410 align:middle line:84%
with the UFO community,
even though there

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.980 align:middle line:84%
are some aspects
of the UFO stuff

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.790 align:middle line:84%
that the scientists
wouldn't like.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.180 align:middle line:84%
But there's more
overlap than either side

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.115 align:middle line:90%
is willing to admit.

00:03:46.115 --> 00:03:46.740 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.781 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about some
of the assumptions that

00:03:48.781 --> 00:03:50.090 align:middle line:90%
have happened from both sides.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.724 align:middle line:84%
Because I like the
complexity of the subject.

00:03:53.724 --> 00:03:54.390 align:middle line:90%
>> PETERS: Good.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So there is the
assumption that anything that

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.330 align:middle line:84%
can make it to Earth in physical
fashion has extremely advanced

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.150 align:middle line:84%
technology, which we could
agree on, but that that means

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.850 align:middle line:84%
they're somehow spiritually
evolved as well.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.910 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
breakdown starts coming in.

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.810 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: It is reasonable
to think that if they can come

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.579 align:middle line:84%
here and we cannot go there,
they know something we don't.

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.340 align:middle line:90%
That's a very plausible thing.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.370 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: But advances in
science and technology are not

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:33.540 align:middle line:84%
necessarily advances in
morality or spiritual insight,

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.970 align:middle line:90%
and we see that on planet Earth.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.860 align:middle line:84%
The 20th century was the
most technologically advanced

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.530 align:middle line:84%
century in the
history of our planet,

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.760 align:middle line:84%
yet we killed more people
in war and in genocide

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.920 align:middle line:90%
using these machines.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.330 align:middle line:84%
So for every advance in
science and technology,

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.430 align:middle line:84%
there's an equal advance
in the amount of violence

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.010 align:middle line:90%
that we can perpetrate.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.870 align:middle line:84%
So we need to ask,
if extraterrestrials

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.830 align:middle line:84%
are more advanced in
science and technology,

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.222 align:middle line:84%
how did they get to be
morally superior to us?

00:05:10.222 --> 00:05:10.930 align:middle line:90%
How do leopards--

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:11.410 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Very good question.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:12.980 align:middle line:90%
>> PETERS: --change their spots?

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And if they are
morally superior,

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.400 align:middle line:84%
then I'm going to
say, thank you.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.482 align:middle line:84%
But there's no reason
really to expect it.

00:05:21.482 --> 00:05:23.690 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: There's no reason
to make that assumption.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And what I've always
found interesting is

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.160 align:middle line:84%
when you come to conferences
like this particular one,

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.750 align:middle line:84%
you have those who are looking
at the hope of the situation

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.090 align:middle line:84%
and what our future could
look like in companionship

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.310 align:middle line:84%
with other extraterrestrial
visitors and species,

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.300 align:middle line:84%
and then you have
those who have more

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.670 align:middle line:84%
of a fear-based agenda
saying, no, these

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.890 align:middle line:84%
are here not necessarily for
our best good, and so forth.

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And so that brings us to the
subject of what is commonly

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.640 align:middle line:84%
called the Prime
Directive, which

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.520 align:middle line:84%
those who are more spiritually
enlightened or advanced,

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.240 align:middle line:84%
interdimensionally, within
this dimension, and so forth,

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.240 align:middle line:84%
aren't allowed to
interfere, right?

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.930 align:middle line:90%
>> PETERS: Well, yes.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.590 align:middle line:84%
I think the hope that
you just mentioned

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.740 align:middle line:90%
is a good, healthy sign.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.950 align:middle line:84%
And what we have seen
actually since 1950

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:17.380 align:middle line:84%
down to the present time
is a terrestrial hope

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.700 align:middle line:84%
that we can make this
world a better place.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.130 align:middle line:84%
We want to stop
nuclear arms testing.

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.940 align:middle line:84%
We want to prevent
thermonuclear war.

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And more recently,
since the 1980s,

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:31.920 align:middle line:84%
how can we bring health
to our dying planet?

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.007 align:middle line:84%
So the very fact that we yearn
for these things is good.

00:06:36.007 --> 00:06:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It means we might
be ready for a relationship

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.350 align:middle line:84%
of a more sophisticated
nature with them.

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:44.250 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: Well, and if the
aliens are saying, yeah,

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.820 align:middle line:84%
these things are right,
it's not news to us,

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.945 align:middle line:90%
but it's encouraging to us.

00:06:50.945 --> 00:06:51.570 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:56.820 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: But now when we
get to thinking of aliens

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.070 align:middle line:84%
as nonphysical, as
interdimensional,

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:06.350 align:middle line:84%
or as spiritual in character,
what they communicate,

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:11.890 align:middle line:84%
to be sure, is love and
union and companionship.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:16.950 align:middle line:84%
But I just have to say
I don't understand then

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:22.916 align:middle line:84%
the moral imperative for
fixing a physical planet.

00:07:22.916 --> 00:07:24.195 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:07:24.195 --> 00:07:26.320 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: In fact, if you
have an opinion on that,

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.170 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to hear it.

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:30.000 align:middle line:84%
I know you're interviewing
me, but just how

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.910 align:middle line:84%
would the disembodied
spiritual entities really have

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:37.510 align:middle line:84%
an impact on what, for us,
are physically-oriented moral

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:38.280 align:middle line:90%
issues?

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.970 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, perhaps one
answer to that might be that

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:43.590 align:middle line:84%
because people are coming
to a more open place within

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:46.730 align:middle line:84%
themselves, and so there is a
possibility to kind of pierce

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:49.900 align:middle line:84%
those veils in terms of
inspiration or communication,

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:53.360 align:middle line:84%
that that kind of information
is simply being maybe brought

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.640 align:middle line:84%
forth and offered and given to
inspire humans into their own

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.080 align:middle line:90%
higher action.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:01.390 align:middle line:84%
So on that level, I think it
can be-- I wouldn't consider

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:05.470 align:middle line:84%
that to be interference as the
highest and best good, if that

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:08.230 align:middle line:84%
is the directive
highest and best good,

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:10.030 align:middle line:84%
which is a little
different than the denser

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:14.750 align:middle line:84%
kind of communication that some
talk about from the Archons

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:18.280 align:middle line:84%
and from some ET species
that may have had

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.650 align:middle line:84%
their fingers in the pot
here and stirring things

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:22.800 align:middle line:84%
for the last several
hundred thousand years.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.135 align:middle line:90%
>> PETERS: Right.

00:08:23.135 --> 00:08:23.634 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:08:23.634 --> 00:08:26.260 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And it's not
saying that all can't be true

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:27.240 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.230 align:middle line:84%
I believe it's all
happening at the same time.

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:29.938 align:middle line:90%
>> PETERS: Right.

00:08:29.938 --> 00:08:32.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think my own
position is wherever

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.559 align:middle line:84%
we get the message from,
from ET in its most

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:41.529 align:middle line:84%
exalted spiritual achievement
or from our own heart

00:08:41.529 --> 00:08:46.160 align:middle line:84%
or a prophet in between,
it's still the right message.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.700 align:middle line:90%
It's world peace.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:51.070 align:middle line:84%
It's a planet governed
by love and compassion

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:55.440 align:middle line:84%
and not by national
rivalry and violence.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.840 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.140 align:middle line:90%
I totally agree with you.

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.710 align:middle line:84%
Now one of your areas that
you're really developing

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:03.680 align:middle line:84%
is an area that is new to
people called Astrotheology.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.440 align:middle line:84%
And I also like the
subject of astro-ethics.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And I look at that from
the densest point of view.

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:11.670 align:middle line:84%
Is it ethical for us to shoot
all that space junk out there?

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:14.780 align:middle line:84%
What are we interfering
with, especially

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.270 align:middle line:84%
nuclear detonations
in particular,

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:19.200 align:middle line:84%
which we have attempted
to do in the past?

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:19.650 align:middle line:90%
>> PETERS: Right.

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:21.650 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's talk
about what is the field

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:22.950 align:middle line:90%
of Astrotheology?

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:25.157 align:middle line:84%
What is it that you're
looking to develop?

00:09:25.157 --> 00:09:27.240 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: Well, there are
a number of definitions

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.500 align:middle line:84%
of Astrotheology, but the
one I want to work with is

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:34.250 align:middle line:84%
a religious interpretation of
what's going on in the space

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:37.240 align:middle line:84%
sciences, especially
astrobiology,

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:41.050 align:middle line:84%
and the search for microbial
life within our solar system,

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:45.450 align:middle line:84%
and then the search for
intelligent life on exoplanets

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:50.150 align:middle line:84%
that would be elsewhere
in the Milky Way.

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:54.140 align:middle line:84%
If you believe in God,
is it all God's creation?

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:56.140 align:middle line:90%
Or is it just Earth?

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:59.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, I happen to think
that God's grace is imbued

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:03.040 align:middle line:90%
throughout the entire universe.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.770 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
question is, if we

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:10.750 align:middle line:84%
meet them, our friends in space,
our new neighbors in space,

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:14.480 align:middle line:84%
do we invite them over
for a covered dish dinner?

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.400 align:middle line:84%
Or do we get out
the machine guns?

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.065 align:middle line:84%
Well, I like the covered
dish dinner invitation--

00:10:20.065 --> 00:10:20.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:21.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm with you.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.880 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: --much,
much better than that.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.870 align:middle line:84%
And what kind of an
impact might this

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:31.790 align:middle line:84%
have on the world view of people
in our traditional religions?

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And there are some
who say, oh, this

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:37.280 align:middle line:84%
is just going to
destroy classical

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.700 align:middle line:84%
or traditional
religious beliefs.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought, well,
I'm going to look into this

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:47.190 align:middle line:84%
and just see whether or not
that either fear or prophecy

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:48.350 align:middle line:90%
might be true or false.

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:50.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, and
yet at the same time,

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:54.670 align:middle line:84%
it's my understanding that there
are more than 400 references

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:57.920 align:middle line:84%
to what appears to be
visitations from visitors

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:01.240 align:middle line:84%
off-planet throughout the
Bible, scattered throughout.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And often these
beings are depicted

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:06.910 align:middle line:84%
as human, which this
conference talks

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:09.430 align:middle line:84%
about a lot of humanoid
visitations, by the way.

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:11.950 align:middle line:84%
They're human, but maybe they
have some fire around them

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:13.320 align:middle line:90%
or wings around them.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.810 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe their
chariots, which were

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:19.880 align:middle line:84%
the vehicle popular in the day
when this came forward also

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:23.250 align:middle line:84%
has electricity or
energy or fire around it.

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:26.600 align:middle line:84%
And often times these
events in the Bible

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:32.120 align:middle line:84%
appear to coincide with times
of strife for a given tribe,

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.700 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:36.780 align:middle line:84%
So it's not as though it's--
it's hiding in plain sight.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.610 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: Well, as I read
the Hebrew scriptures,

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:41.664 align:middle line:90%
they're always in strife.

00:11:41.664 --> 00:11:42.705 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:11:42.705 --> 00:11:44.788 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: I don't think
they've ever had harmony,

00:11:44.788 --> 00:11:46.670 align:middle line:84%
except under the
period of the judges.

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:49.640 align:middle line:84%
There were some periods of
peace and prosperity and shalom.

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.790 align:middle line:84%
But there was a lot
of strife there.

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:55.200 align:middle line:84%
But yes, there are
these curious things,

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:59.550 align:middle line:84%
such as the Children of Israel
following the pillar of smoke

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:01.990 align:middle line:90%
by day and the fire by night.

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:03.950 align:middle line:84%
It looks kind of
like a volcano to me.

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:08.080 align:middle line:84%
But it's really
God leading them.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:12.400 align:middle line:84%
And whether it was a miracle,
looked like a miracle,

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:16.600 align:middle line:84%
God can use natural
things to lead us,

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.410 align:middle line:90%
but it's still spectacular.

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:20.910 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But there's a lot
of phenomena laced throughout

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:21.300 align:middle line:90%
the Bible--

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:22.150 align:middle line:90%
>> PETERS: Oh, there is.

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:23.090 align:middle line:90%
A lot of mysterious--

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:23.860 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --which
would all make--

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:24.060 align:middle line:90%
>> PETERS: --phenomena.

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:25.851 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --sense here
at this conference,

00:12:25.851 --> 00:12:28.909 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't make sense
if sitting in a pew.

00:12:28.909 --> 00:12:29.700 align:middle line:90%
That's the problem.

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.210 align:middle line:90%
>> PETERS: That's true, yeah.

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:34.570 align:middle line:84%
I seldom in my sermons
say that it wasn't really

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:37.025 align:middle line:84%
a fiery chariot that
picked up Elijah.

00:12:37.025 --> 00:12:39.480 align:middle line:90%
It was really a flying saucer.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.610 align:middle line:90%
Although we would enjoy that.

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:44.080 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Of course, your
congregation must enjoy that,

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.090 align:middle line:90%
because they know you.

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:46.290 align:middle line:90%
They're there for you.

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:49.335 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: Oh, yeah, no,
I can get away with it.

00:12:49.335 --> 00:12:50.210 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love it.

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:53.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, now talk about
the ethics a little bit.

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:55.230 align:middle line:84%
Because you talk
about it in terms

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:58.354 align:middle line:84%
of microbial life in space
right down to space junk.

00:12:58.354 --> 00:12:59.770 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
the ethics issue.

00:12:59.770 --> 00:12:59.905 align:middle line:90%
>> PETERS: Yeah.

00:12:59.905 --> 00:13:01.995 align:middle line:84%
I think we divide the
ethics into two categories,

00:13:01.995 --> 00:13:03.530 align:middle line:90%
at least I do.

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:06.360 align:middle line:84%
The first has to do
with space exploration

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.940 align:middle line:90%
within our solar system.

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And then the other
one, more speculative.

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:13.660 align:middle line:84%
What happens if we
meet or communicate

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:17.730 align:middle line:84%
with intelligent species
from another star system?

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:21.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, locally we've
got a lot of issues.

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:23.720 align:middle line:84%
Space junk is the
one that we were

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.790 align:middle line:84%
talking about a
couple minutes ago,

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:30.550 align:middle line:84%
with 3,000 to 4,000
satellites now in orbit

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:34.220 align:middle line:90%
have broken up and crumbled.

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:37.540 align:middle line:84%
Nobody, even down
to the present day,

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:41.810 align:middle line:84%
is financially responsible
for creating a trash

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:45.110 align:middle line:90%
dump orbiting our planet.

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And already now when we
want to shoot off a rocket

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:52.800 align:middle line:84%
we have to be careful to
avoid the existing trash dump.

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.160 align:middle line:84%
That tells you a lot
about human nature,

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:59.000 align:middle line:84%
and it also tell you about
how business works, right?

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.285 align:middle line:84%
We don't want our businesses
or even our governments

00:14:02.285 --> 00:14:07.790 align:middle line:84%
to have to pay upfront for
the clean up of the mess

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:08.990 align:middle line:90%
that they're going to make.

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:12.570 align:middle line:84%
So I think this is an
enormous ethical issue,

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:14.730 align:middle line:84%
to make somebody responsible
for the clean up.

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:18.750 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, gee,
it's about human nature.

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:21.467 align:middle line:84%
We want things in the present,
and we're just unwilling--

00:14:21.467 --> 00:14:23.300 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: To think
about the ramifications.

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:25.635 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: --to discipline
ourselves for the long-term

00:14:25.635 --> 00:14:26.135 align:middle line:90%
future.

00:14:26.135 --> 00:14:30.600 align:middle line:84%
So I think space
junk is a big issue.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.480 align:middle line:84%
Planetary protection's
just another one.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:38.060 align:middle line:84%
If we have intercourse
with microbial life

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:41.520 align:middle line:84%
from another planet, will
we contaminate Earth?

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:47.060 align:middle line:84%
Or the other one is if we find
a biosphere on Mars or Titan

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:50.330 align:middle line:84%
or something like that, do
we have a responsibility

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:53.400 align:middle line:84%
to respect that biosphere,
treat life as an end

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.070 align:middle line:90%
rather than as a means?

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:57.290 align:middle line:84%
Believe it or not, this
is not a settled issue

00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:59.206 align:middle line:90%
amongst our space researchers.

00:14:59.206 --> 00:15:00.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No, it
is not settled,

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:02.650 align:middle line:84%
because we're still of
the mentality that we need

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:04.139 align:middle line:90%
to harvest for our own good.

00:15:04.139 --> 00:15:04.930 align:middle line:90%
>> PETERS: Oh, yes.

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:06.460 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:09.320 align:middle line:84%
Send the bulldozers up
there and run them over.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:11.225 align:middle line:84%
That theme appeared
in the movie "Avatar."

00:15:11.225 --> 00:15:11.850 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:14.100 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: And that's a
genuine ethical issue.

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:14.890 align:middle line:90%
It's not just--

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:15.950 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I think that's
why people related.

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:17.050 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: --Hollywood's
imagination.

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:17.966 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:15:17.966 --> 00:15:20.340 align:middle line:84%
People related very
deeply and emotionally

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:21.870 align:middle line:90%
to that film for a reason.

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:23.290 align:middle line:90%
>> PETERS: Mm hmm.

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:26.070 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So if we are
encountering asteroids and this

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:30.590 align:middle line:84%
sort of thing, of being able
to utilize mineral content

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:34.190 align:middle line:84%
and such from, say, these
other bodies in space,

00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:37.020 align:middle line:84%
where does the
ethics line go there?

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:39.400 align:middle line:84%
Say if on Earth, because
we're looking, perhaps,

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:42.170 align:middle line:84%
not to harvest as much on our
own planet, to not disturb

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:43.840 align:middle line:84%
it ecologically,
so we decide we're

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.700 align:middle line:84%
going to go to space and harvest
these same minerals that we

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:47.310 align:middle line:90%
need.

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:54.740 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: Well, I think that
life has a primary moral claim

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:56.620 align:middle line:90%
on us more than non-life.

00:15:56.620 --> 00:16:01.540 align:middle line:84%
So harvesting minerals, I don't
see an ethical or moral issue

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:03.180 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:05.100 align:middle line:84%
I do think that
if we were to find

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:07.656 align:middle line:84%
microbial life in
an environment--

00:16:07.656 --> 00:16:09.530 align:middle line:84%
and it's not going to
be there all by itself.

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:13.590 align:middle line:84%
It's going to have its own
ecosphere-- I think initially

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:15.840 align:middle line:84%
we have to say, oh, we
have to respect that.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:16.940 align:middle line:90%
We have to protect that.

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:17.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:20.530 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: And then after
we learn more about it,

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:24.760 align:middle line:84%
then we could raise the
issue of exploitation or not.

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:27.960 align:middle line:84%
But immediately, no, the
last thing we want to do

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:32.890 align:middle line:84%
is destroy it before
we understand it.

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And then, if life were to
turn out to be intelligent,

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:39.754 align:middle line:84%
I think it has even a
greater moral claim on us.

00:16:39.754 --> 00:16:40.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:44.030 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: And we can't
just turn sentient beings

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:45.830 align:middle line:90%
into a means for our own ends.

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:48.400 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Even if they're
microscopic sentient beings.

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.610 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: Even if they're
microscopic, right.

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:53.193 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And then, again, when
we get to that level where we

00:16:53.193 --> 00:16:57.500 align:middle line:84%
have an ability to perhaps even
communicate more intelligently

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.450 align:middle line:84%
with these other species,
then it may be possible to go

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:02.480 align:middle line:90%
into cooperative arrangements.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.410 align:middle line:84%
But we don't know that until
we have the sophistication

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:06.170 align:middle line:90%
to communicate.

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:07.170 align:middle line:90%
>> PETERS: That's right.

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And the technical problems
in getting that communication

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:14.490 align:middle line:90%
capability are enormous.

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:17.220 align:middle line:84%
But let's just imagine
that we accomplish it.

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:21.450 align:middle line:84%
If "Star Trek" can imagine
it, we can imagine it, right?

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:24.400 align:middle line:84%
I divide the extraterrestrial
intelligences

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.540 align:middle line:84%
into three categories,
our inferiors,

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:29.500 align:middle line:84%
kind of like animals
here on this planet,

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:33.470 align:middle line:84%
our peers, roughly the
same level of intelligence,

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:35.530 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, and
then our superiors,

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:39.890 align:middle line:84%
those whose minds are way
beyond what yours and mine can

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:41.250 align:middle line:90%
catch up with.

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:44.440 align:middle line:84%
Do we have the same moral
responsibility to all of them?

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.690 align:middle line:90%
Well, I don't think so.

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:49.910 align:middle line:84%
With regard to interaction,
I think with our peers

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:53.030 align:middle line:84%
we know we're going to have
to respect their sovereignty.

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:54.970 align:middle line:90%
We might develop trade.

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:59.270 align:middle line:84%
We might develop sharing
education or something

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:00.220 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:01.870 align:middle line:84%
I think we could
handle that one.

00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:04.880 align:middle line:84%
But our primary
moral directive would

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:08.840 align:middle line:84%
be to treat them as a
moral end and not just

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:11.400 align:middle line:84%
as a means for our
own exploitation.

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:15.090 align:middle line:84%
So if there is exploitation,
it's got to be agreed upon.

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:17.965 align:middle line:90%
But what if they're inferior?

00:18:17.965 --> 00:18:20.450 align:middle line:90%
What if they're like animals?

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:22.990 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, and who's
to say what's inferior

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:26.647 align:middle line:84%
in the realm of
pure intelligence?

00:18:26.647 --> 00:18:27.730 align:middle line:90%
That's a big debate, yeah.

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:30.230 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: I'm only borrowing
other people's criteria here,

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:33.770 align:middle line:84%
because I think love and
compassion are my most

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:34.850 align:middle line:90%
important things.

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:38.542 align:middle line:84%
But most people engaged
in this use intelligence

00:18:38.542 --> 00:18:40.580 align:middle line:90%
as their criteria.

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:44.800 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to say, what
is our experience with animals

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:45.300 align:middle line:90%
here?

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:46.800 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that would
be in the more common realm

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:47.340 align:middle line:90%
of debate, yeah.

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:48.490 align:middle line:90%
>> PETERS: It would, yeah.

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:52.450 align:middle line:84%
We make hamburgers,
but we love our pets.

00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:53.159 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:18:53.159 --> 00:18:53.783 align:middle line:90%
>>PETERS: So...

00:18:53.783 --> 00:18:56.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And these are human
dilemmas right now as well.

00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:58.650 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: These are
human dilemmas now.

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:02.334 align:middle line:84%
Can we learn from these
as we now confront--

00:19:02.334 --> 00:19:03.250 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:05.124 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: And then,
finally, the worst case,

00:19:05.124 --> 00:19:07.560 align:middle line:84%
the most challenging case
would be if they are truly

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:12.520 align:middle line:84%
our superiors in
most measurable ways.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:16.930 align:middle line:84%
Would we have to volunteer to
be their servants or slaves?

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:19.480 align:middle line:90%
Would we become their pets?

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.800 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, let's
say if they are superior

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:25.240 align:middle line:84%
in a spiritual/intellectual
sense,

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.742 align:middle line:84%
then they would not choose
to enslave another species.

00:19:27.742 --> 00:19:29.492 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: I would
hope that you're right.

00:19:29.492 --> 00:19:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And then we would want
to learn from them.

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:31.860 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:32.390 align:middle line:90%
>> PETERS: That is for sure.

00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:33.940 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Then you can
have, again, cooperation,

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:35.435 align:middle line:84%
collaboration, and
maybe mentorship.

00:19:35.435 --> 00:19:36.200 align:middle line:90%
>> PETERS: That's right.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.075 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That would
be a good way to do it.

00:19:38.075 --> 00:19:40.360 align:middle line:84%
Now this is not anything
that's new to religion.

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:41.940 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
the Catholic Church.

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:43.575 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about the Vatican.

00:19:43.575 --> 00:19:45.960 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
Vatican Observatory.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.660 align:middle line:90%
>> PETERS: Right.

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:51.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, I work with some of the
researchers in the Vatican

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:52.510 align:middle line:90%
Observatory.

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:53.820 align:middle line:90%
They're Jesuits.

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not a Catholic, but if
I were, I'd want to be a Jesuit.

00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:59.934 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like the
Marines of Christianity.

00:19:59.934 --> 00:20:00.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:02.190 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: And
they're great people.

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:03.350 align:middle line:90%
They're scientists.

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And among the various
projects that they deal with,

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:09.840 align:middle line:84%
they deal with the question
of extraterrestrial life.

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:14.210 align:middle line:84%
They don't work towards
a theological synthesis,

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:17.050 align:middle line:84%
but they're very
theologically aware.

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:18.950 align:middle line:90%
And let's just say this.

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:23.300 align:middle line:84%
If they find ETI, they
won't be surprised.

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:26.285 align:middle line:84%
And so if we think, oh,
the Roman Catholic Church

00:20:26.285 --> 00:20:31.540 align:middle line:84%
is so anachronistic and
out of date, I'd just say,

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:33.110 align:middle line:90%
well, look at the facts.

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:35.472 align:middle line:84%
These people have thought
about this for decades,

00:20:35.472 --> 00:20:36.830 align:middle line:90%
if not generations.

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:39.590 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, yes, evidence
for hundreds of years.

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:41.030 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about
that in a moment.

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:43.560 align:middle line:84%
But there were also
very public statements

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:45.870 align:middle line:84%
made by Monsignor
Bolducci, as I recall.

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:46.620 align:middle line:90%
>> PETERS: Mm hmm.

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:48.745 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Can you tell us
a little bit about that?

00:20:48.745 --> 00:20:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And that was about
10, 12, 14 years ago,

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:52.100 align:middle line:90%
he started coming out.

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:52.880 align:middle line:90%
>> PETERS: Yes.

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And this is consistent with
what, in general, you're

00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:59.910 align:middle line:84%
going to hear from
Jose Funes, who

00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:03.200 align:middle line:84%
is the current director of
the Vatican Observatory.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.650 align:middle line:84%
You would also hear
from Pope John Paul II,

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:08.730 align:middle line:84%
if he were around to
enter into the debate.

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And that is God's
creation is large enough

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:17.060 align:middle line:84%
to include sentient
beings on other planets.

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:22.560 align:middle line:84%
It's also your and
my responsibility

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:26.340 align:middle line:84%
to love and care for
our new space neighbors.

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And then Guy Consolmagno and
some of the other Jesuits

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:33.070 align:middle line:84%
like to debate, well, should
we baptize them or not?

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:35.680 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I was going to ask
you about-- when I heard that,

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:39.210 align:middle line:84%
when I read that, I
thought, are you kidding me?

00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:43.270 align:middle line:84%
That if there are other
intelligent species that they

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:46.730 align:middle line:84%
would choose to be baptized
into the Catholic faith.

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:49.502 align:middle line:90%


00:21:49.502 --> 00:21:51.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, I laughed, but
it was mind-boggling

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:52.910 align:middle line:84%
that that thought
would even come up.

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:54.530 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: I think we all need
to chuckle about it a little

00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:55.029 align:middle line:90%
bit.

00:21:55.029 --> 00:22:00.580 align:middle line:84%
But we really need to think
about the relationship

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:05.860 align:middle line:84%
that we would share with
other sentient creatures.

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And would we share the
same relationship with God,

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:11.040 align:middle line:90%
or would it be different?

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.970 align:middle line:84%
We won't know
until we meet them.

00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:14.060 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:16.940 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: But on
the other hand,

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:21.440 align:middle line:84%
I can understand why you'd want
to get the baptismal water up

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:25.175 align:middle line:84%
to temperature just
in case we need it.

00:22:25.175 --> 00:22:25.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:28.850 align:middle line:84%
I can't imagine trying to
indoctrinate an alien species

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:31.100 align:middle line:84%
into one of our
religions here on Earth.

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:32.260 align:middle line:90%
But whatever.

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:33.664 align:middle line:90%
He's thinking big, right?

00:22:33.664 --> 00:22:34.330 align:middle line:90%
>> PETERS: Yeah.

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:36.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, these days we
don't indoctrinate.

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:41.660 align:middle line:84%
In these days, we sort of have
a mutual sharing and learning.

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:45.672 align:middle line:84%
And yes, we on Earth are going
to have to expand our minds.

00:22:45.672 --> 00:22:47.255 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
to open our minds.

00:22:47.255 --> 00:22:48.380 align:middle line:90%
You ever heard that phrase?

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:49.256 align:middle line:90%
I'll bet you have.

00:22:49.256 --> 00:22:50.089 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:22:50.089 --> 00:22:50.600 align:middle line:90%
Open minds.

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:54.090 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: And we may learn
some beautiful things.

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:58.470 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, we may
have some important things

00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:00.300 align:middle line:90%
to share with them as well.

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:01.123 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:23:01.123 --> 00:23:02.250 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:04.880 align:middle line:90%
I do agree.

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:06.943 align:middle line:90%
We're an interesting species.

00:23:06.943 --> 00:23:08.026 align:middle line:90%
When you look at it from--

00:23:08.026 --> 00:23:09.400 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: At
least to ourselves.

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.930 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, I think we
are an interesting species,

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:14.900 align:middle line:84%
in that the possibility for
learning on this planet,

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:18.275 align:middle line:84%
so many different things,
so many different inputs

00:23:18.275 --> 00:23:21.690 align:middle line:84%
and stimuli is really quite
interesting compared to what

00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:25.850 align:middle line:84%
some who have had experiences--
you can call it either through

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:29.250 align:middle line:84%
astral travel or
through, supposedly,

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:31.650 align:middle line:84%
certain covert
military projects--

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:35.140 align:middle line:84%
have gone to other places
where the variety of potential

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:38.280 align:middle line:84%
for experience and learning is
just so much more limited than

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:41.190 align:middle line:84%
this wonderful crazy
place we live on.

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:44.080 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: Well, this category
of experiencing and learning is

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:47.150 align:middle line:84%
an extremely important
human category.

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:52.700 align:middle line:84%
But right next to it is
love and compassion as well.

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:53.700 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:57.910 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: If I were a
Jesuit, and even as I am,

00:23:57.910 --> 00:24:03.475 align:middle line:84%
I want to say we've experienced
God's grace and God's love

00:24:03.475 --> 00:24:05.390 align:middle line:90%
and God's care.

00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And if anything, we want the
whole universe to enjoy this.

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:12.510 align:middle line:90%
We hope that they already are.

00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:16.237 align:middle line:84%
But if they're not, then it's
worth sharing the news about.

00:24:16.237 --> 00:24:18.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, and it's
interesting in that this

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:20.820 align:middle line:84%
species, and I'm sure
many, many other species,

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:25.700 align:middle line:84%
have had the latitude of
free will to be able to learn

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:29.580 align:middle line:84%
to bounce off the edges of the
dark and the light and find

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:31.000 align:middle line:90%
what works.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And so the notion that we
have throughout our history

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:38.780 align:middle line:84%
been a bloody and violent race
alongside being a race filled

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:42.130 align:middle line:84%
with love, compassion,
generosity, and grace,

00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:44.760 align:middle line:84%
that has to be also of
interest in and of itself,

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:47.165 align:middle line:90%
is what can be learned in there?

00:24:47.165 --> 00:24:49.040 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: Well, you
really say it very well.

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:52.730 align:middle line:84%
We are ambiguous that on the
one hand blood and violence

00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:55.469 align:middle line:84%
is so characteristic,
gratuitous blood

00:24:55.469 --> 00:24:57.260 align:middle line:84%
and violence on the
part of the human race.

00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:59.150 align:middle line:84%
At the same time,
we have our moments

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:03.790 align:middle line:84%
in which we rise above all that
in terms of love and compassion

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:05.200 align:middle line:90%
and healing.

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:07.007 align:middle line:90%
And we know which one is right.

00:25:07.007 --> 00:25:08.090 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: We can feel it.

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:10.010 align:middle line:90%
We resonate with it.

00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: And whatever our
relationship with ETI would be,

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.440 align:middle line:84%
we're going to want it to be on
the side of love and compassion

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:20.785 align:middle line:90%
and grace, regardless.

00:25:20.785 --> 00:25:21.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:25.290 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: But there are forces
already at work on this planet

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:27.980 align:middle line:84%
that, as you had
suggested earlier, well,

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:29.880 align:middle line:84%
we're going to mine
those asteroids.

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:32.830 align:middle line:84%
We're going to make a
tourist profit off the moon

00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:34.460 align:middle line:90%
as we roll our tour buses--

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:35.000 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, that's real.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.036 align:middle line:90%
>> PETERS: --around the moon.

00:25:36.036 --> 00:25:36.702 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:36.702 --> 00:25:37.870 align:middle line:90%
That's already in the works.

00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:42.350 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: And so in some ways
we're going to export the human

00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:45.950 align:middle line:84%
condition from our planet
to off-planet locations.

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:49.900 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, you know,
I just interviewed a fellow.

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:53.240 align:middle line:84%
He claims to have had contact
with this one particular being

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:56.830 align:middle line:84%
that is a Venusian
for many, many years.

00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And the being has
explained to him

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:04.520 align:middle line:84%
that many other planets
are interested in what

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:10.540 align:middle line:84%
we have to offer because we do
bring a certain-- humanity has

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:13.810 align:middle line:84%
learned to operate, as he
said, within a framework

00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:16.490 align:middle line:84%
of dense negativity
and operate through it

00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:18.760 align:middle line:84%
and even find love
and compassion

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:21.510 align:middle line:84%
through the resistance
of negativity and fear

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:22.600 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.157 align:middle line:84%
And that other
cultures are actually

00:26:25.157 --> 00:26:27.240 align:middle line:84%
looking forward to our
maturing to the point where

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:29.470 align:middle line:84%
we can bring some
of-- and you have

00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:31.300 align:middle line:84%
to hear the negativity
in a different way.

00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:34.860 align:middle line:84%
They classify it as
something as seemingly

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:37.580 align:middle line:84%
innocent as bringing games,
which brings competition, which

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:42.110 align:middle line:84%
brings win and loss, to other
planets and other peoples that

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:44.860 align:middle line:84%
have long since
stopped all of that

00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:47.440 align:middle line:84%
and, also as a
result of not having

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:50.570 align:middle line:84%
the opportunity to bounce
off of the light and dark

00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:52.490 align:middle line:84%
have ceased to grow
on a certain level.

00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:54.580 align:middle line:84%
There's been no
challenge within society.

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:56.370 align:middle line:84%
They've structured
it so they've reached

00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:59.650 align:middle line:90%
that homeostasis and peace.

00:26:59.650 --> 00:27:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it was kind
of interesting concept,

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:04.950 align:middle line:84%
that we could export a little
negativity via competition

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:08.420 align:middle line:84%
and maybe kick-start some
growth in other cultures.

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:10.610 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: Well, it
is a profound insight.

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:14.240 align:middle line:84%
But we've had a variant here
with the philosopher Hegel

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:17.750 align:middle line:84%
and some others who go back
to the Adam and Eve story

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:21.710 align:middle line:84%
and say, it's really
good that we chose

00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:25.470 align:middle line:84%
to eat the forbidden
fruit, because now we're

00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:28.690 align:middle line:84%
learning the difference
between good and evil,

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:33.050 align:middle line:84%
whereas what the bliss God
had originally intended was

00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:35.810 align:middle line:84%
you're so saturated with
good the question of evil

00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:38.840 align:middle line:84%
never comes up,
so that our growth

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:42.620 align:middle line:84%
is through this
challenge of negativity.

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:46.150 align:middle line:84%
I just want to say, given all
the blood that has been shed--

00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:47.400 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Enough?

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:49.407 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: --I don't
need any more challenges.

00:27:49.407 --> 00:27:49.990 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:51.740 align:middle line:84%
Now I have to ask you
a personal question,

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:54.552 align:middle line:84%
because you ended up
putting this survey together

00:27:54.552 --> 00:27:55.885 align:middle line:90%
that I think is really profound.

00:27:55.885 --> 00:27:57.580 align:middle line:90%
Because this is the argument.

00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:59.270 align:middle line:90%
Is humanity ready?

00:27:59.270 --> 00:27:59.890 align:middle line:90%
Are we ready?

00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:02.650 align:middle line:84%
Are parishioners around
the planet, ordinary folks,

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:05.280 align:middle line:84%
are people that are in
the materialistic science

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.170 align:middle line:90%
world ready for contact?

00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:10.760 align:middle line:84%
But before we talk about
your findings of that survey,

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:12.480 align:middle line:90%
why are you doing all of this?

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:15.530 align:middle line:84%
What is it in you that
turned you this direction

00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:17.145 align:middle line:90%
to begin with?

00:28:17.145 --> 00:28:19.270 align:middle line:84%
Even though we're back
engineering the story a bit,

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:21.071 align:middle line:84%
give us a little
of your own story.

00:28:21.071 --> 00:28:23.570 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: Well, I grew up in
a family where we were talking

00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:26.225 align:middle line:84%
about flying saucers
and UFOs all the time.

00:28:26.225 --> 00:28:29.360 align:middle line:84%
And my imagination
was stimulated

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:33.410 align:middle line:84%
by the idea of outer space and
extraterrestrial intelligence

00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:36.040 align:middle line:84%
long before I went into
the ministry and long

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:39.450 align:middle line:90%
before I became a researcher.

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:42.650 align:middle line:84%
So I don't want to give
up my childhood toys,

00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:48.290 align:middle line:84%
for heaven's sake, just
because-- so that's part of it.

00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:49.980 align:middle line:90%
Plus, I like UFO people.

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:52.690 align:middle line:84%
I love coming to
conferences such as this.

00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:57.760 align:middle line:84%
These are people with
imaginations and good hearts.

00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:04.310 align:middle line:84%
At any rate, I like the
milieu of the UFO people.

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:09.590 align:middle line:84%
And then what really prompted me
is a colleague and friend, Paul

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:13.335 align:middle line:84%
Davies at Arizona
State University, who

00:29:13.335 --> 00:29:18.380 align:middle line:84%
has said for the last 20
years that if we confirm

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:20.592 align:middle line:84%
that extraterrestrial
intelligence exists,

00:29:20.592 --> 00:29:24.550 align:middle line:84%
that the world's religions
will face a crisis.

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:28.370 align:middle line:84%
They might even collapse,
because their world view is

00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:33.950 align:middle line:84%
so shrunken and so geocentric
that they cannot handle this.

00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And I just intuitively
thought, I don't think so.

00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:42.360 align:middle line:84%
So I noticed Victoria
Alexander's survey of 10 years

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:43.450 align:middle line:90%
or so ago.

00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And she seemed to think
religious people are

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:46.950 align:middle line:90%
going to be fine.

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:52.840 align:middle line:84%
So I developed a refined,
rather detailed survey of my own

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:56.170 align:middle line:84%
and thought, I'm going to
try to prove or disprove

00:29:56.170 --> 00:30:00.830 align:middle line:84%
this idea that religions
are fragile and vulnerable.

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:01.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And so--

00:30:01.670 --> 00:30:02.462 align:middle line:90%
>> PETERS: And so--

00:30:02.462 --> 00:30:03.878 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --tell
us what you did,

00:30:03.878 --> 00:30:05.380 align:middle line:90%
and tell us what you found out.

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:06.460 align:middle line:90%
>> PETERS: Yeah.

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:09.700 align:middle line:90%
Well, 10-question questionnaire.

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:14.120 align:middle line:84%
But the key question
was, if we can confirm

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:17.490 align:middle line:84%
that extraterrestrial
intelligent civilizations

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:22.620 align:middle line:84%
exist, will your faith suffer
a crisis or will it collapse?

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:24.760 align:middle line:90%
That's the key question.

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:29.710 align:middle line:84%
So we got enough responses
to be statistically

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:33.730 align:middle line:84%
important from Roman Catholics,
mainline Protestants,

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:38.760 align:middle line:84%
evangelical Protestants,
which include fundamentalists,

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:43.770 align:middle line:90%
let's see, Jews, and Buddhists.

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And we got responses from
Hindus and Mormons and others.

00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:55.890 align:middle line:84%
And what is staggeringly
interesting is

00:30:55.890 --> 00:31:06.030 align:middle line:84%
that 92% in general of everyone
who self-declares thinks,

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:11.360 align:middle line:84%
oh, it's just fine,
that God is big enough

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:14.610 align:middle line:84%
to put intelligent
life on other planets.

00:31:14.610 --> 00:31:19.580 align:middle line:84%
And my favorite line is from a
mainline Protestant who said,

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:24.220 align:middle line:84%
I'd share a pew with
an alien any day.

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:26.790 align:middle line:84%
Oh, by the way, the Buddhists
were very interesting.

00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:29.120 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't a single
Buddhist-- and this

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.500 align:middle line:84%
is statistically
important-- not a single one

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:34.510 align:middle line:84%
who said that his or her
faith would be a problem.

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And just like
everybody else, they

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:41.635 align:middle line:84%
said we're myopic
if we think Earth

00:31:41.635 --> 00:31:43.260 align:middle line:84%
is the center of all
things, et cetera.

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:44.510 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, what about
the Islamic community?

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:45.530 align:middle line:90%
You didn't mention them.

00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:48.330 align:middle line:84%
Was there anything in there
from the Islamic community?

00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:50.210 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: We didn't
get enough responses.

00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:52.330 align:middle line:84%
But we did get
the same statement

00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:57.380 align:middle line:84%
that Allah has made life on
other planets to worship Allah

00:31:57.380 --> 00:31:59.360 align:middle line:90%
just like we do here on Earth.

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:02.180 align:middle line:84%
So the Muslims are
not any different

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:05.796 align:middle line:84%
on that particular issue
than any of the others.

00:32:05.796 --> 00:32:09.630 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So this whole
thing by the church higher-ups

00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:11.930 align:middle line:84%
saying-- and our
governments-- oh,

00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:15.590 align:middle line:84%
these little people aren't ready
for anything this profound,

00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:18.100 align:middle line:84%
what is it that they're
trying to hold onto?

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's not
even an assumption.

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:21.980 align:middle line:84%
I consider that
to be more or less

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:24.860 align:middle line:90%
a lie, a means of manipulation.

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: I agree that it's
a means of manipulation.

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:32.590 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's a lie
or not, as I said,

00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:35.385 align:middle line:84%
I think some people believe
this despite the evidence

00:32:35.385 --> 00:32:36.160 align:middle line:90%
to the contrary.

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:37.255 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, yeah,
at least some people do,

00:32:37.255 --> 00:32:39.230 align:middle line:84%
but the vast majority
can't by this time.

00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: I think that some
people want to believe that

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:45.650 align:middle line:84%
religious people are fragile
and they're going to collapse

00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:48.820 align:middle line:84%
and that justifies
withholding the truth.

00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:51.070 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, they have
put them in a very inferior

00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:56.710 align:middle line:84%
position of coming and begging
through a priest or to the gods

00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:58.440 align:middle line:84%
for the little bit
that is theirs.

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:02.600 align:middle line:84%
They've been conditioned to be
in an inferior position in some

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:04.000 align:middle line:90%
of the religions.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.919 align:middle line:84%
And so I can
understand thinking,

00:33:05.919 --> 00:33:07.960 align:middle line:84%
they're dependent on us,
so thus they're fragile.

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:09.043 align:middle line:90%
We've made them dependent.

00:33:09.043 --> 00:33:11.380 align:middle line:90%


00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:14.690 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: Actually, I hadn't
thought about it that way.

00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:21.070 align:middle line:84%
In our post-World-World-II era,
where increasingly religious

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:25.850 align:middle line:84%
people are well-educated and
have access to the internet,

00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:30.400 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, religious people
are just as individualistic

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:32.380 align:middle line:84%
and think for
themselves, I think,

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:36.820 align:middle line:84%
as anybody in any
other field might.

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:38.790 align:middle line:84%
What I did discover
in the survey that

00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:42.770 align:middle line:84%
is sort of interesting is that
the people who self-declare

00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:46.090 align:middle line:84%
as non-religious, which
would include both

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:48.360 align:middle line:84%
atheists as well as
spiritual but not religious--

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:54.160 align:middle line:84%
I didn't discriminate-- that
group is, of course, not

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:56.492 align:middle line:90%
afraid of the discovery of ETI.

00:33:56.492 --> 00:33:57.200 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:59.870 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: But they think
that all those other religious

00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:01.600 align:middle line:84%
people are going
to have a problem.

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:02.725 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:34:02.725 --> 00:34:05.332 align:middle line:84%
Of course, because within
the atheist community

00:34:05.332 --> 00:34:07.540 align:middle line:84%
there's more judgment toward
the religious community.

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:08.206 align:middle line:90%
>> PETERS: Yeah.

00:34:08.206 --> 00:34:09.420 align:middle line:90%
And I find that interesting.

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:16.020 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes to the
government wanting to treat us

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:19.930 align:middle line:84%
like children, I
don't know if this

00:34:19.930 --> 00:34:21.429 align:middle line:84%
has anything to do
with that or not.

00:34:21.429 --> 00:34:21.770 align:middle line:90%
I just don't know.

00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:23.730 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It just seems that
there's a direct correlation

00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:26.313 align:middle line:84%
there between the Church and the
government thinking we're not

00:34:26.313 --> 00:34:27.060 align:middle line:90%
ready.

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:28.679 align:middle line:84%
We only have a
couple minutes left,

00:34:28.679 --> 00:34:30.940 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to
ask you about this.

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:32.389 align:middle line:84%
The movie "The Day
the Earth Stood

00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:34.860 align:middle line:84%
Still," I read somewhere
that your thought was,

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:36.830 align:middle line:84%
you know, if there
is going to be

00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:40.320 align:middle line:84%
a direct visitation
and message, you

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:42.969 align:middle line:84%
would want it to be
more of that nature.

00:34:42.969 --> 00:34:43.620 align:middle line:90%
>> PETERS: Yes.

00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:49.350 align:middle line:84%
I love the 1951 version of "The
Day the Earth Stood Still."

00:34:49.350 --> 00:34:50.480 align:middle line:90%
In retrospect, I will say--

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:51.646 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Klaatu's message.

00:34:51.646 --> 00:34:54.782 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: --there are only
two authentic UFO movies,

00:34:54.782 --> 00:34:56.740 align:middle line:84%
"The Day the Earth Stood
Still," the first one,

00:34:56.740 --> 00:35:01.370 align:middle line:84%
not the second one, and then
"Close Encounters of the Third

00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:03.490 align:middle line:90%
Kind" in 1977.

00:35:03.490 --> 00:35:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And Spielberg, who is a genius,
an artistic genius, in my mind,

00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:11.480 align:middle line:84%
said he thought he was
going to do a sci-fi movie,

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:14.760 align:middle line:84%
and then he realized
that UFOs are religious.

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:17.070 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why
that movie looks

00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:18.820 align:middle line:90%
so religious in character.

00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:21.550 align:middle line:84%
But what those two
movies have in common

00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:24.980 align:middle line:84%
is that they're
bringing peace to Earth.

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:30.110 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the science fiction
genre, "War of the Worlds,"

00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:31.622 align:middle line:90%
is this conflict model.

00:35:31.622 --> 00:35:32.330 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:32.830 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:35.660 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: And most people
who have UFO experiences

00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:38.160 align:middle line:90%
don't think of conflict.

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:42.680 align:middle line:84%
So what happens in
1951 is Klaatu--

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:47.845 align:middle line:84%
and I like to sign my emails
Klaatu Barada Nikto-- Klaatu

00:35:47.845 --> 00:35:51.370 align:middle line:84%
comes from outer
space to bring peace,

00:35:51.370 --> 00:35:54.730 align:middle line:84%
and the politicians
don't want it.

00:35:54.730 --> 00:35:56.050 align:middle line:90%
They want rivalry.

00:35:56.050 --> 00:35:59.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, who's he going
to go to to get peace?

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:01.310 align:middle line:90%
Well, the scientists.

00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:04.530 align:middle line:84%
The scientists come from
all these different nations.

00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:06.660 align:middle line:84%
And the final scene
of this movie-- and I

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:09.790 align:middle line:84%
love it-- you've got these
scientists, some with turbans

00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:12.520 align:middle line:84%
because they're Sikhs and
they're different races,

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:16.050 align:middle line:84%
and the scientists have this
international community.

00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:18.420 align:middle line:84%
It's the scientists,
not the politicians

00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:20.220 align:middle line:90%
who are going to bring us peace.

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:22.107 align:middle line:84%
And then we get the
great speech at the end.

00:36:22.107 --> 00:36:23.190 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's beautiful.

00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:25.260 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: And I
think that people,

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:26.940 align:middle line:84%
such as George
Adamski and others,

00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:29.640 align:middle line:90%
were influenced by this movie.

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:33.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to say the
movie dictated anything,

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:39.500 align:middle line:84%
but I do think that that image
that the space people will be

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:44.392 align:middle line:84%
our allies in pursuing world
peace, well, I kind of like it.

00:36:44.392 --> 00:36:45.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
that's true or not,

00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:48.290 align:middle line:90%
but I really hope it's true.

00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:49.050 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Me too.

00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:51.830 align:middle line:84%
And on that note, thank you
so much for taking time out

00:36:51.830 --> 00:36:55.040 align:middle line:84%
of a very busy conference
to meet with us.

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:56.540 align:middle line:84%
>> PETERS: Nice be
with you, Regina.

00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:58.650 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thank you.

00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:17.334 align:middle line:90%
