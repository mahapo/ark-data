be a more perfect world

if we no longer have the
ability to deceive one another?

If we could simply send
out a request by thought

and have it answered
within seconds.

00:00:36.303 --> 00:00:37.838 align:middle line:90%
According to Dr. Larry Dossey,

00:00:37.838 --> 00:00:40.740 align:middle line:84%
this phenomena is
rising within humanity.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.876 align:middle line:84%
We're entering a time
when our world is going

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:45.779 align:middle line:84%
to be a direct reflection
of our connectedness

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:47.748 align:middle line:90%
through non-local mind.

00:00:47.748 --> 00:00:50.884 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Dossey is here to share more
about our inner connectedness

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:54.321 align:middle line:84%
of all life forms by sharing
some astounding stories back

00:00:54.321 --> 00:00:57.824 align:middle line:84%

Einstein called Spooky Action

Larry, welcome, it's
good to see you again.

00:01:01.328 --> 00:01:02.596 align:middle line:84%
>> Larry Dossey: It's
great to be back, Regina.

00:01:02.596 --> 00:01:04.131 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Last time we talked
it was about premonition

00:01:04.131 --> 00:01:07.901 align:middle line:84%
and this is really a life long
body of work and extension

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:10.170 align:middle line:84%
of everything you've
written about in the past.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.571 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: Exactly.

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:13.073 align:middle line:84%
I have a premonition the first
time but I'll be back talking

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:14.107 align:middle line:90%
to about something else.

00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:15.275 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Here we
go, and here we are.

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:16.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: Here we are.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.545 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: This shows how
these non-local mind functions.

00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:19.779 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: There you are.

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:21.113 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And you did a
beautiful job on this book.

00:01:21.113 --> 00:01:23.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just an incredible
amount of reference working it.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.855 align:middle line:84%
But there's stories that have
a very strong human appeal.

00:01:28.855 --> 00:01:32.292 align:middle line:84%
I mean because many of the
things you talked about in here.

00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:33.827 align:middle line:84%
Many of the people
you talk about,

00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:36.630 align:middle line:84%
we both had direct
experience of and chatted with

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.797 align:middle line:84%
but it's been kind
of part and parcel.

00:01:38.797 --> 00:01:42.702 align:middle line:84%
There's something now about
bringing it all together

00:01:42.702 --> 00:01:46.071 align:middle line:84%
to show us that this is
really our birthright.

00:01:46.071 --> 00:01:47.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: Well, I
think this is part

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.809 align:middle line:84%
of that originally
equipment as I like to say.

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:50.944 align:middle line:90%
You know, we don't have

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:53.480 align:middle line:84%
to engineer this
connectedness and unity stuff.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.718 align:middle line:84%
It comes with a set birth until
it's hardwired into their being.

00:01:58.718 --> 00:02:01.755 align:middle line:84%
And so the trick is to not
just do science in this book

00:02:01.755 --> 00:02:04.090 align:middle line:84%
because nobody would
read this if it were only

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.159 align:middle line:90%
about scientific experiments.

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.229 align:middle line:84%
As you say we have to connect
this with people's lives

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.265 align:middle line:84%
to make it relevant to
their everyday living.

00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:13.633 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Absolutely.

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:16.670 align:middle line:84%
So what we'll do since we're
going to get into a lot of that.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.105 align:middle line:84%
We'll go ahead and do
just a little tiny,

00:02:19.105 --> 00:02:22.576 align:middle line:84%
tiny primer on the notion
of quantum entanglement

00:02:22.576 --> 00:02:23.743 align:middle line:90%
because really this is kind

00:02:23.743 --> 00:02:25.177 align:middle line:84%
of where the one mind
is coming through.

00:02:25.177 --> 00:02:27.881 align:middle line:84%
So here's our little
itty-bitty science lesson,

00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:29.716 align:middle line:90%
let's take a look.

00:02:33.787 --> 00:02:35.155 align:middle line:84%
>> [Background Music]
Einstein didn't take well

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:38.725 align:middle line:90%
to Quantum Theory, and in 1935,

00:02:38.725 --> 00:02:41.161 align:middle line:84%
he and a few fellow
physicist wrote a paper

00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:43.763 align:middle line:90%
under the name of EPR.

00:02:43.763 --> 00:02:46.399 align:middle line:84%
And their attempt to
disapprove Quantum Theory,

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:49.236 align:middle line:84%
not only did they further
validify it but they came

00:02:49.236 --> 00:02:52.272 align:middle line:90%
across another strange feature

00:02:52.272 --> 00:02:56.009 align:middle line:84%
of quantum physics--
quantum entanglement.

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:58.311 align:middle line:84%
When two particles
interact with each other,

00:02:58.311 --> 00:03:01.114 align:middle line:84%
it becomes what is
called entangled,

00:03:01.114 --> 00:03:04.384 align:middle line:84%
developing a special connected
relationship with one another.

00:03:04.384 --> 00:03:08.421 align:middle line:84%
Now, when one of these particles
are affected say by measurement

00:03:08.421 --> 00:03:12.859 align:middle line:84%
or observation, one particle
will reflect the exact same

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:16.162 align:middle line:84%
trait as the other
spontaneously.

00:03:16.162 --> 00:03:19.499 align:middle line:84%
No matter how far apart
they are across the room

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:20.533 align:middle line:90%
or across the universe.

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:23.470 align:middle line:90%
Einstein found this so strange

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:30.143 align:middle line:84%
that he later termed it
spooky action at a distance.

00:03:30.143 --> 00:03:32.812 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So there's our
spooky action at a distance.

00:03:32.812 --> 00:03:34.748 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go ahead
and put a definition

00:03:34.748 --> 00:03:36.783 align:middle line:90%
that you have in the book here.

00:03:36.783 --> 00:03:41.153 align:middle line:84%
One mind is like an invisible
non-physical cloud computing

00:03:41.153 --> 00:03:45.458 align:middle line:84%
platform with infinite storage
capacity and is user free.

00:03:45.458 --> 00:03:49.129 align:middle line:84%
All minds are already
connected non-locally.

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:50.196 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: Yes.

00:03:50.196 --> 00:03:52.065 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, one
interesting development

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:54.266 align:middle line:90%
in the entanglement story is

00:03:54.266 --> 00:03:57.704 align:middle line:84%
that decades ago we nearly
thought that entanglement apply

00:03:57.704 --> 00:04:02.175 align:middle line:84%
to subatomic particles such as
electrons and protons, and so.

00:04:02.175 --> 00:04:05.178 align:middle line:84%
The breakthrough understanding
currently however is

00:04:05.178 --> 00:04:07.414 align:middle line:84%
that entanglement
is not confined

00:04:07.414 --> 00:04:09.349 align:middle line:90%
to that invisible world.

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:12.152 align:middle line:84%
We now know that
implies in biology.

00:04:12.152 --> 00:04:15.889 align:middle line:84%
And as far as we can tell from
the experiences people have

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:19.192 align:middle line:84%
of unity and connectedness
even at global distances,

00:04:19.192 --> 00:04:22.862 align:middle line:84%
this entangle metaphor seems
to be almost a perfect way

00:04:22.862 --> 00:04:26.866 align:middle line:84%
to understand how humans
are connected at a distance

00:04:26.866 --> 00:04:29.703 align:middle line:84%
because when one of us
changes the other one

00:04:29.703 --> 00:04:33.340 align:middle line:84%
with whom we're emotionally
bonded who maybe far away

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.775 align:middle line:84%
and not even know
about your experience

00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:39.079 align:middle line:84%
that the evidence shows that
my thoughts and my feelings

00:04:39.079 --> 00:04:42.349 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes even my physical
symptoms change instantly

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:43.416 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:04:43.416 --> 00:04:46.419 align:middle line:84%
So we go back to the
invisible particles

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.255 align:middle line:84%
as being the best metaphor
we have currently about how

00:04:49.255 --> 00:04:51.391 align:middle line:84%
to understand these human
to human connections.

00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:52.659 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Absolutely.

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:55.595 align:middle line:84%
And so is there-- I mean
there are invisible universal

00:04:55.595 --> 00:04:59.399 align:middle line:84%
principles that are
in affect here

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:02.569 align:middle line:84%
that reflect the
greater and the lesser.

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:05.772 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is-- this really
is truly universal in nature,

00:05:05.772 --> 00:05:07.340 align:middle line:90%
as well cosmic in nature.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.342 align:middle line:84%
We can't separate
ourselves from it.

00:05:09.342 --> 00:05:13.880 align:middle line:84%
You can't separate the
view of an atom in the body

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.149 align:middle line:84%
to looking virtually
identical if you were

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:18.852 align:middle line:84%
to view the cosmos
that we live within.

00:05:18.852 --> 00:05:19.619 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: Right.

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:20.754 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: It would appear

00:05:20.754 --> 00:05:22.889 align:middle line:84%
to be an identical
function even physically.

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:24.491 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: And one of the
things that we're understanding,

00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:26.826 align:middle line:90%
Regina, is that you can't secede

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:29.429 align:middle line:84%
from this connectedness
even if you tried.

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:31.331 align:middle line:84%
And God knows we've
tried in western culture.

00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:32.465 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Every which way?

00:05:32.465 --> 00:05:36.169 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: We are made
a fetish, individuality,

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:40.039 align:middle line:84%
and self responsibility,
and basically isolation.

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:44.244 align:middle line:84%
I'm not against self
responsibility and all

00:05:44.244 --> 00:05:47.781 align:middle line:84%
of that kind of thing, but
where it goes off the tracks is

00:05:47.781 --> 00:05:50.550 align:middle line:84%
when we emphasize
that to the exclusion

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.886 align:middle line:90%
of our unity and connectedness.

00:05:52.886 --> 00:05:55.321 align:middle line:84%
There are two sides
of this coin.

00:05:55.321 --> 00:05:59.759 align:middle line:84%
We do need to emphasize their
own personalities and egos

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:02.262 align:middle line:84%
because that's part of
being a healthy individual.

00:06:02.262 --> 00:06:05.131 align:middle line:84%
But let's not forget the unity
which has come out not just

00:06:05.131 --> 00:06:07.801 align:middle line:84%
in people's experiments these
days, experiences these days,

00:06:07.801 --> 00:06:10.703 align:middle line:84%
but also in laboratory
experiments--

00:06:10.703 --> 00:06:11.538 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:06:11.538 --> 00:06:12.605 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: Dossey: -- that show

00:06:12.605 --> 00:06:16.209 align:middle line:84%
that our experiences
are not lying to us.

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:19.212 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Absolutely and
in fact we were just talking

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:22.215 align:middle line:84%
about the kind of this
divinity and our unity.

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:26.419 align:middle line:84%
And there was a quote toward the
end of the book in which use--

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:28.888 align:middle line:84%
some-- it wasn't you where
it was stated in the book

00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:31.658 align:middle line:84%
that however the expert
was commenting on it said,

00:06:31.658 --> 00:06:35.161 align:middle line:84%
"We often think of the
opposite of love as hate

00:06:35.161 --> 00:06:36.996 align:middle line:84%
when in fact they
said the opposite

00:06:36.996 --> 00:06:41.034 align:middle line:84%
of love is individuality,
meaning, discontentedness."

00:06:41.034 --> 00:06:41.835 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: Yes.

00:06:41.835 --> 00:06:42.769 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: And I'm with you.

00:06:42.769 --> 00:06:44.671 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have to
express our own.

00:06:44.671 --> 00:06:46.539 align:middle line:84%
We have to express
our self, our traits.

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:49.042 align:middle line:84%
We have to bump up against
things and learn as a result

00:06:49.042 --> 00:06:52.245 align:middle line:84%
of that individuation, but
boy, it sure is a sad life

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:55.248 align:middle line:84%
if you can't experience the
connectedness within that.

00:06:55.248 --> 00:07:00.453 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: It's also emotionally
dry and desiccated way live.

00:07:00.453 --> 00:07:05.625 align:middle line:84%
You know, one of the things
this distant connectedness thing

00:07:05.625 --> 00:07:09.662 align:middle line:84%
really very powerful ways
is the emotional bondedness.

00:07:09.662 --> 00:07:11.498 align:middle line:90%
It's just a fancy word for love.

00:07:11.498 --> 00:07:14.033 align:middle line:84%
And the more emotionally
bonded and loving people are

00:07:14.033 --> 00:07:16.035 align:middle line:84%
in a distance, the
more likely we are

00:07:16.035 --> 00:07:18.371 align:middle line:90%
to see these dramatic examples

00:07:18.371 --> 00:07:21.508 align:middle line:84%
of connectedness no matter
how far apart we are.

00:07:21.508 --> 00:07:22.609 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: That is
so true and I think

00:07:22.609 --> 00:07:24.911 align:middle line:90%
of it just in a very small way.

00:07:24.911 --> 00:07:27.847 align:middle line:84%
When I was younger
and into an extent all

00:07:27.847 --> 00:07:30.683 align:middle line:84%
through my life I would find
that if I was down in the mount

00:07:30.683 --> 00:07:33.353 align:middle line:84%
about something sad,
something it made me sad,

00:07:33.353 --> 00:07:38.024 align:middle line:84%
the only way I could climb out
of that feeling was to think

00:07:38.024 --> 00:07:40.560 align:middle line:84%
of something, anything,
no matter how tiny.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.795 align:middle line:84%
I could do reaching
out to someone else.

00:07:42.795 --> 00:07:44.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: True.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:45.164 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: If I could do
something for someone else,

00:07:45.164 --> 00:07:48.935 align:middle line:84%
boom, immediately, that
feeling would dissipate.

00:07:48.935 --> 00:07:50.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: Yeah.

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:51.471 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I mean as soon as
the thought came into mind,

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:53.039 align:middle line:84%
before I could even reach
out to the other person

00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:54.774 align:middle line:90%
that offer something, you know?

00:07:54.774 --> 00:07:56.809 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
just a tiny example

00:07:56.809 --> 00:07:59.345 align:middle line:84%
of what we all experience
whether we know it or not.

00:07:59.345 --> 00:08:02.549 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
the fact that this is

00:08:02.549 --> 00:08:07.520 align:middle line:84%
such a deeply wired
principle of our reality

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:11.958 align:middle line:84%
that people will do seemingly,
well, very courageous,

00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:15.361 align:middle line:84%
wildly dangerous things on
behalf of total strangers.

00:08:15.361 --> 00:08:16.429 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: Right.

00:08:16.429 --> 00:08:17.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And you
start that at the first

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:18.431 align:middle line:90%
or second chapter in your book.

00:08:18.431 --> 00:08:20.333 align:middle line:90%
We start with the subject.

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:22.335 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about a
couple of examples.

00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:25.538 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about you
military career but also

00:08:25.538 --> 00:08:29.042 align:middle line:84%
about the man that jump off a
flat form in a subway station

00:08:29.042 --> 00:08:32.045 align:middle line:84%
to save another human
being, a stranger.

00:08:32.045 --> 00:08:34.012 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: Well, it's one of
those spectacular examples

00:08:34.012 --> 00:08:38.517 align:middle line:84%
of the rescue experienced I've
come across in this research.

00:08:38.517 --> 00:08:41.721 align:middle line:84%
It happened in 2007
on January 2nd,

00:08:41.721 --> 00:08:46.259 align:middle line:84%
the guy who did the rescuing
was a black construction worker

00:08:46.259 --> 00:08:48.194 align:middle line:90%
named Wesley Autrey.

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:52.364 align:middle line:84%
And Wesley was on a subway
platform in midtown Manhattan

00:08:52.364 --> 00:08:56.336 align:middle line:84%
and he saw a young man
had a seizure and he fell

00:08:56.336 --> 00:08:57.704 align:middle line:90%
on to the subway tracks

00:08:57.704 --> 00:09:00.373 align:middle line:84%
and without thinking immediately
Autrey was off the platform

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:05.378 align:middle line:84%
down trying to get this guy
back up on the platform.

00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:08.681 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't do it however
and he saw a train coming,

00:09:08.681 --> 00:09:12.552 align:middle line:84%
and he knew he had time
to do only one thing,

00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:14.787 align:middle line:84%
put this guy lined
up between the trucks

00:09:14.787 --> 00:09:16.322 align:middle line:90%
and cover him with his own body.

00:09:16.322 --> 00:09:19.659 align:middle line:90%
He was almost beheaded.

00:09:19.659 --> 00:09:22.795 align:middle line:84%
They were five trains that
passed over before he--

00:09:22.795 --> 00:09:25.565 align:middle line:90%
the guy could get the train stop

00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:27.300 align:middle line:84%
and Wesley had a
big grease smudge

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:33.006 align:middle line:84%
on his knit cap showing just
how close he came to tragedy.

00:09:33.006 --> 00:09:34.741 align:middle line:84%
And so he became
famous overnight.

00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:38.111 align:middle line:84%
He was the guest at the State
of the Union message a couple

00:09:38.111 --> 00:09:42.915 align:middle line:84%
of months later and I was
amazed and astonished by this

00:09:42.915 --> 00:09:44.117 align:middle line:90%
because this parallel,

00:09:44.117 --> 00:09:47.153 align:middle line:84%
some experiences I had
has battalion surgeon way

00:09:47.153 --> 00:09:50.923 align:middle line:84%
out in the buildings in
Vietnam back in the late 60s.

00:09:50.923 --> 00:09:52.125 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:09:52.125 --> 00:09:53.526 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And, is it was
saying-- as you were--

00:09:53.526 --> 00:09:58.031 align:middle line:84%
stating in the book
that this is-- we--

00:09:58.031 --> 00:10:01.067 align:middle line:84%
it's not just an
isolated act of heroism.

00:10:01.067 --> 00:10:05.304 align:middle line:84%
When this happens the motivation
is so strong because in effect,

00:10:05.304 --> 00:10:08.741 align:middle line:84%
we are entangled with
that other person's field.

00:10:08.741 --> 00:10:12.712 align:middle line:84%
We are one and in
doing that heroic event

00:10:12.712 --> 00:10:14.480 align:middle line:84%
in a sense you're
saving yourself,

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.116 align:middle line:84%
you're saving your own
reality on some level.

00:10:17.116 --> 00:10:18.484 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: Well, the
Greek mythologist,

00:10:18.484 --> 00:10:21.120 align:middle line:84%
Joseph Campbell said "The only
way you can explain why one

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.557 align:middle line:84%
person will be crazy enough to
do something like Autrey did is

00:10:24.557 --> 00:10:27.527 align:middle line:84%
that if those two
minds were so fused

00:10:27.527 --> 00:10:30.363 align:middle line:84%
that you became essentially
the same person as you say--

00:10:30.363 --> 00:10:31.464 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:32.732 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: -- so that,
at the decisive moment,

00:10:32.732 --> 00:10:35.468 align:middle line:84%
the rescuer is not
rescuing someone else.

00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:38.271 align:middle line:84%
He's actually rescuing
himself so closely

00:10:38.271 --> 00:10:41.307 align:middle line:84%
and so tightly have their
consciousness come together."

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:42.508 align:middle line:90%
I think that's spot on.

00:10:42.508 --> 00:10:45.244 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And it had to
have been something having

00:10:45.244 --> 00:10:46.679 align:middle line:90%
to do with compassion?

00:10:46.679 --> 00:10:47.714 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: Yes.

00:10:47.714 --> 00:10:49.716 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: That is
a universal solvent.

00:10:49.716 --> 00:10:51.084 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: Yes, it is.

00:10:51.084 --> 00:10:55.455 align:middle line:84%
And I think that one reason
people have a really tough time,

00:10:55.455 --> 00:10:58.891 align:middle line:84%
wondering why people behave
like that is because it goes

00:10:58.891 --> 00:11:00.626 align:middle line:90%
against modern biology.

00:11:00.626 --> 00:11:03.096 align:middle line:84%
People aren't supposed to
put their life in danger

00:11:03.096 --> 00:11:05.865 align:middle line:84%
for somebody they don't have
anything in common with.

00:11:05.865 --> 00:11:06.999 align:middle line:90%
We're supposed--

00:11:06.999 --> 00:11:09.001 align:middle line:84%
so the biologists tell
us to conserve our genes

00:11:09.001 --> 00:11:12.605 align:middle line:84%
so we can stay alive and
propagate and convey our genes

00:11:12.605 --> 00:11:15.108 align:middle line:90%
down through other's generation.

00:11:15.108 --> 00:11:16.576 align:middle line:90%
So, this doesn't use that, no.

00:11:16.576 --> 00:11:19.412 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I think one person
in particular, Richard Dawkins.

00:11:19.412 --> 00:11:21.481 align:middle line:90%
you know, the selfish gene.

00:11:21.481 --> 00:11:22.682 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: Right.

00:11:22.682 --> 00:11:24.283 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: That's not
turning out to have legs.

00:11:24.283 --> 00:11:25.485 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: No.

00:11:25.485 --> 00:11:27.153 align:middle line:84%
And as a matter of fact,
he's taken a lot of heat,

00:11:27.153 --> 00:11:29.922 align:middle line:84%
deservedly so because
it's just doesn't account

00:11:29.922 --> 00:11:31.524 align:middle line:90%
for human experiences.

00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:34.127 align:middle line:90%
In the book I talked about--

00:11:34.127 --> 00:11:38.931 align:middle line:84%
an oppositional book to Dawkins'
the self-- selfish gene.

00:11:38.931 --> 00:11:42.335 align:middle line:84%
The name of this book
is the "Selfless Gene."

00:11:42.335 --> 00:11:45.004 align:middle line:84%
And so we really do need
to expand what we know

00:11:45.004 --> 00:11:48.808 align:middle line:84%
about human behavior because
Dawkins was willfully inadequate

00:11:48.808 --> 00:11:52.278 align:middle line:84%
in his assessment of who we
are and what we're capable of.

00:11:52.278 --> 00:11:53.379 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Absolutely.

00:11:53.379 --> 00:11:54.313 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's talk about
your own experience

00:11:54.313 --> 00:11:56.616 align:middle line:90%
within that in Vietnam.

00:11:56.616 --> 00:11:58.451 align:middle line:90%
You were platoon surgeon.

00:11:58.451 --> 00:12:01.187 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: Well, I was battalion
surgeon way up behind--

00:12:01.187 --> 00:12:04.223 align:middle line:84%
beyond anything as
fancy as a MASH unit.

00:12:04.223 --> 00:12:07.326 align:middle line:84%
One day a helicopter crashed
about a couple hundred yards

00:12:07.326 --> 00:12:11.998 align:middle line:84%
from my aid station and I ran to
the side, the thing was a mess.

00:12:11.998 --> 00:12:14.767 align:middle line:84%
It was turned upside down,
the pilot was trapped.

00:12:14.767 --> 00:12:17.904 align:middle line:84%
And without thinking, I
entered this helicopter

00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:21.574 align:middle line:84%
with the ruptured fuel
tanks, draining fuel,

00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:24.477 align:middle line:84%
and it was expected that it
will explode at any moment

00:12:24.477 --> 00:12:28.915 align:middle line:84%
and cut the pilot loose from
the seat belts and got him

00:12:28.915 --> 00:12:32.285 align:middle line:84%
out with the help of
the medic of mine.

00:12:32.285 --> 00:12:35.655 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't understand
later why I behave that way

00:12:35.655 --> 00:12:39.458 align:middle line:84%
because I'd made solemn vows
before I went to Vietnam

00:12:39.458 --> 00:12:44.197 align:middle line:84%
that I would never do anything
risky like that out of deference

00:12:44.197 --> 00:12:46.833 align:middle line:84%
to my family and the
people who cared for me

00:12:46.833 --> 00:12:50.203 align:middle line:84%
but when the situations
like that would crop up,

00:12:50.203 --> 00:12:53.906 align:middle line:84%
they were just action and
behavior and no thinking.

00:12:53.906 --> 00:12:56.676 align:middle line:90%
And it was automatic and I was--

00:12:56.676 --> 00:12:58.644 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: You were
cognizant of the danger.

00:12:58.644 --> 00:13:00.980 align:middle line:84%
You knew that it could
explode on some level.

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:01.814 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: Yeah.

00:13:01.814 --> 00:13:02.615 align:middle line:90%
It was hard not to be aware of.

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:03.883 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah sure.

00:13:03.883 --> 00:13:05.251 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: There
were lot of soldiers

00:13:05.251 --> 00:13:08.421 align:middle line:84%
who were ringing this thing
and it kept out of the danger

00:13:08.421 --> 00:13:11.691 align:middle line:84%
with the expectation that, you
know, they could be blown up.

00:13:11.691 --> 00:13:13.726 align:middle line:84%
And I remember to this
day when I rotated back

00:13:13.726 --> 00:13:14.994 align:middle line:90%
to the United States

00:13:14.994 --> 00:13:18.331 align:middle line:84%
of encountering Joseph
Campbell's description of how

00:13:18.331 --> 00:13:21.667 align:middle line:84%
at those decisive moments when
one person rescues another

00:13:21.667 --> 00:13:25.805 align:middle line:84%
as we have mentioned,
the consciousness fuses,

00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:27.707 align:middle line:90%
so that there is not thought.

00:13:27.707 --> 00:13:31.777 align:middle line:84%
There is no careful
weighing of circumstances.

00:13:31.777 --> 00:13:33.212 align:middle line:90%
There's only action.

00:13:33.212 --> 00:13:34.747 align:middle line:84%
And I knew in an
heartbeat, Regina that,

00:13:34.747 --> 00:13:37.483 align:middle line:84%
that was the explanation
for my crazy behavior,

00:13:37.483 --> 00:13:39.151 align:middle line:90%
and I still believe that

00:13:39.151 --> 00:13:43.289 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's the best most
rational explanation we have

00:13:43.289 --> 00:13:45.358 align:middle line:90%
about heroic act to that sort.

00:13:45.358 --> 00:13:47.493 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Is that one of the
things that motivated you to go

00:13:47.493 --> 00:13:52.164 align:middle line:84%
down this path of understanding
deeper this interconnectedness

00:13:52.164 --> 00:13:52.932 align:middle line:90%
of mind?

00:13:52.932 --> 00:13:54.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: Oh absolutely.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.334 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: A pivotal-- I
assumed it was a pivotal event

00:13:55.334 --> 00:13:55.968 align:middle line:90%
in your life.

00:13:55.968 --> 00:13:57.203 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: It was.

00:13:57.203 --> 00:13:58.004 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And you must
have witnessed it thousands

00:13:58.004 --> 00:13:59.305 align:middle line:90%
of times out there.

00:13:59.305 --> 00:14:01.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: Quite a number of
times as a matter of fact.

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:03.910 align:middle line:84%
But there was another event
that I should put on the table.

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:06.212 align:middle line:84%
I've known about this
connectedness thing ever

00:14:06.212 --> 00:14:10.416 align:middle line:84%
since I was old enough to know
that I am an identical twin.

00:14:10.416 --> 00:14:13.986 align:middle line:84%
And my brother and I have
had this sort of thing all

00:14:13.986 --> 00:14:17.189 align:middle line:84%
of their life, we just
call it twin stuff.

00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:21.327 align:middle line:84%
It's the distant appreciation
of someone else's thoughts

00:14:21.327 --> 00:14:25.798 align:middle line:84%
and emotion and sometimes
sharing even physical symptoms.

00:14:25.798 --> 00:14:29.135 align:middle line:84%
When you don't know that
your identical twin is having

00:14:29.135 --> 00:14:30.236 align:middle line:90%
something like that.

00:14:30.236 --> 00:14:31.504 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:14:31.504 --> 00:14:34.573 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: These are jaw
dropping experiences, really.

00:14:34.573 --> 00:14:36.642 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I have a big chunk
in this interview to talk

00:14:36.642 --> 00:14:39.145 align:middle line:84%
about you two and there's
even more to that story

00:14:39.145 --> 00:14:41.013 align:middle line:90%
and some other people as well.

00:14:41.013 --> 00:14:44.050 align:middle line:84%
But something has caught my mind
here, within this, before we get

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:47.887 align:middle line:84%
into the twin phenomena and
I love the animal phenomena.

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:49.188 align:middle line:90%
The animal kingdom is so pure--

00:14:49.188 --> 00:14:49.889 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: So do I.

00:14:49.889 --> 00:14:50.957 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: -- that way.

00:14:50.957 --> 00:14:52.358 align:middle line:84%
We are going to some
videos on that too.

00:14:52.358 --> 00:14:55.628 align:middle line:84%
But one thing that striking
me is when you're talking

00:14:55.628 --> 00:14:59.398 align:middle line:84%
about this, no thinking,
this fusion of mind

00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:03.736 align:middle line:84%
in these heroic events,
I'm looking in my mind

00:15:03.736 --> 00:15:08.641 align:middle line:84%
at the converse effect which
I interviewed a woman named

00:15:08.641 --> 00:15:10.876 align:middle line:90%
Elena Tonetti-Vladimirova.

00:15:10.876 --> 00:15:14.847 align:middle line:90%
She had become the protege of--

00:15:14.847 --> 00:15:16.615 align:middle line:84%
the name of the doctors
escapes me,

00:15:16.615 --> 00:15:19.452 align:middle line:84%
the famous Russian doctor
who's brought the notion

00:15:19.452 --> 00:15:21.954 align:middle line:84%
of water birth to the
rest of the western world.

00:15:21.954 --> 00:15:23.756 align:middle line:84%
She was his protege
and she explained

00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:27.526 align:middle line:84%
to me what the birth process
was like in Soviet Russia

00:15:27.526 --> 00:15:32.298 align:middle line:84%
which explained a lot of
things which was you go

00:15:32.298 --> 00:15:36.535 align:middle line:84%
into the center, you are
alone in the labor process.

00:15:36.535 --> 00:15:38.771 align:middle line:84%
There are other factors
before this that set you off,

00:15:38.771 --> 00:15:40.573 align:middle line:84%
but you are alone in
the labor process.

00:15:40.573 --> 00:15:43.909 align:middle line:84%
When the baby is finally
birth, the baby is taken away

00:15:43.909 --> 00:15:46.012 align:middle line:90%
for five days right immediately.

00:15:46.012 --> 00:15:48.581 align:middle line:84%
There's no bonding to
happen with the mother

00:15:48.581 --> 00:15:50.916 align:middle line:84%
which is excruciatingly
painful for her

00:15:50.916 --> 00:15:52.184 align:middle line:84%
with the nursing
and all of that.

00:15:52.184 --> 00:15:55.287 align:middle line:84%
But also the baby is
put on sugar water

00:15:55.287 --> 00:16:02.728 align:middle line:84%
and there is a complete lack of
bonding that would happen there.

00:16:02.728 --> 00:16:05.131 align:middle line:84%
And you start looking
at some of this larger--

00:16:05.131 --> 00:16:08.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean you call them
conspiracies, agendas,

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:12.171 align:middle line:84%
whatever you want, this media
affects that keep people

00:16:12.171 --> 00:16:16.142 align:middle line:84%
in this isolated separateness
from one another competing

00:16:16.142 --> 00:16:17.643 align:middle line:90%
when that's against nature--

00:16:17.643 --> 00:16:19.011 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: Right.

00:16:19.011 --> 00:16:20.513 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- with one another,
and you have to look at that

00:16:20.513 --> 00:16:22.214 align:middle line:90%
and say, "Hmm, it's all around.

00:16:22.214 --> 00:16:23.449 align:middle line:90%
It feels ground."

00:16:23.449 --> 00:16:27.219 align:middle line:84%
All the indications are
there to compete, separate,

00:16:27.219 --> 00:16:29.021 align:middle line:90%
become better than, isolated,

00:16:29.021 --> 00:16:31.891 align:middle line:84%
I can do it on my
own, wrong messaging.

00:16:31.891 --> 00:16:33.225 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: Well I think
it's more than wrong.

00:16:33.225 --> 00:16:35.828 align:middle line:84%
I think it's barbaric
and pathological.

00:16:35.828 --> 00:16:36.962 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: I agree.

00:16:36.962 --> 00:16:38.931 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: And it goes
against their instincts

00:16:38.931 --> 00:16:44.336 align:middle line:84%
at which were born, which is
to coalesce and come together.

00:16:44.336 --> 00:16:46.105 align:middle line:90%
We have to get beyond this.

00:16:46.105 --> 00:16:50.009 align:middle line:84%
Because this emphasis
on isolation

00:16:50.009 --> 00:16:53.145 align:middle line:84%
and disconnectedness I think
it's found this epidemic

00:16:53.145 --> 00:16:57.450 align:middle line:84%
of selfishness and greed which
at this point is no exaggeration

00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:01.420 align:middle line:84%
to say threatens their planet
and unless we can bond in a way

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:04.457 align:middle line:84%
that helps us connect
with all cinch of life,

00:17:04.457 --> 00:17:05.725 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we
are going to be able

00:17:05.725 --> 00:17:08.060 align:middle line:84%
to meet the challenges
we face environmentally

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:11.497 align:middle line:84%
and in many other ways and
there's search for ways

00:17:11.497 --> 00:17:13.666 align:middle line:90%
to survive as a species.

00:17:13.666 --> 00:17:15.668 align:middle line:84%
I don't think this
one as an bonded

00:17:15.668 --> 00:17:20.372 align:middle line:84%
and stuff is just a
matter for philosophy.

00:17:20.372 --> 00:17:23.875 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is not something
to be contemplated at leisure.

00:17:23.875 --> 00:17:26.077 align:middle line:90%
I think is an urgent situation.

00:17:26.077 --> 00:17:29.582 align:middle line:84%
I think their future depends
on whether we get it or not

00:17:29.582 --> 00:17:32.685 align:middle line:84%
about our connectedness, not
with just each other human

00:17:32.685 --> 00:17:35.321 align:middle line:84%
to human but with all the
rest of cinch in life.

00:17:35.321 --> 00:17:37.189 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Let's
talk about that,

00:17:37.189 --> 00:17:39.925 align:middle line:84%
the global coherence initiative,
Howard Martin's work.

00:17:39.925 --> 00:17:42.695 align:middle line:84%
There-- it's putting these
sensors around the planet

00:17:42.695 --> 00:17:46.932 align:middle line:84%
and these sensors are showing
the responds of the earth

00:17:46.932 --> 00:17:49.969 align:middle line:84%
to group thought
feeling and meditation.

00:17:49.969 --> 00:17:54.507 align:middle line:84%
We-- our emotional
body is intertwined

00:17:54.507 --> 00:17:56.909 align:middle line:84%
with the earth's
own emotional body.

00:17:56.909 --> 00:17:59.245 align:middle line:84%
And I know for some people
that's hard to imagine,

00:17:59.245 --> 00:18:03.516 align:middle line:84%
but this is as ancient being
that we lived with and on,

00:18:03.516 --> 00:18:06.552 align:middle line:84%
and we are-- is our
host let's say.

00:18:06.552 --> 00:18:07.753 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: Well,

00:18:07.753 --> 00:18:09.855 align:middle line:84%
it's appropriate they were
filming this for Gaiam

00:18:09.855 --> 00:18:12.191 align:middle line:84%
because if there's
a television network

00:18:12.191 --> 00:18:16.529 align:middle line:84%
that has ever honored connected
and unity it is this one.

00:18:16.529 --> 00:18:18.164 align:middle line:90%
And so it's totally appropriate

00:18:18.164 --> 00:18:19.565 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking
about this here.

00:18:19.565 --> 00:18:22.134 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yes, it's
absolutely is and it is,

00:18:22.134 --> 00:18:24.637 align:middle line:84%
it's being scientifically
proven if we put

00:18:24.637 --> 00:18:27.640 align:middle line:84%
out a particular thought process
that is of a negative nature,

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.309 align:middle line:84%
it is going to create
a stress within--

00:18:30.309 --> 00:18:32.578 align:middle line:84%
whatever the lay lines
are, the energetics

00:18:32.578 --> 00:18:34.914 align:middle line:84%
of that particular region
of the world, right?

00:18:34.914 --> 00:18:35.548 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: Right.

00:18:35.548 --> 00:18:36.949 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: I mean.

00:18:36.949 --> 00:18:38.617 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: Talk about something
called the global consciousness

00:18:38.617 --> 00:18:42.388 align:middle line:84%
project in the book which once
again has the sensor distributed

00:18:42.388 --> 00:18:43.989 align:middle line:90%
all over the planet.

00:18:43.989 --> 00:18:46.725 align:middle line:84%
And when an event
happens that have

00:18:46.725 --> 00:18:52.031 align:middle line:84%
to captures universal awareness
such as the World Cup and soccer

00:18:52.031 --> 00:18:57.970 align:middle line:84%
or Princess Diana's death,
the sensors begin to show

00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:01.340 align:middle line:84%
that the things become
more coherent

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:03.776 align:middle line:84%
when they are producing
supposedly random

00:19:03.776 --> 00:19:05.377 align:middle line:84%
and equal numbers
of ones and zeros.

00:19:05.377 --> 00:19:09.982 align:middle line:84%
They begin to become
focused so do this electric--

00:19:09.982 --> 00:19:12.751 align:middle line:84%
electronic devices
in the same way

00:19:12.751 --> 00:19:14.853 align:middle line:84%
that people's minds
are being focused

00:19:14.853 --> 00:19:17.656 align:middle line:84%
on this particular event
whatever it might be.

00:19:17.656 --> 00:19:21.560 align:middle line:84%
This is a profound example of
this process of entanglement

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:23.629 align:middle line:84%
that we were talking
about a moment ago.

00:19:23.629 --> 00:19:27.299 align:middle line:84%
And this is just crucial for
us to realize that when we talk

00:19:27.299 --> 00:19:28.500 align:middle line:90%
about our oneness and unity,

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:32.137 align:middle line:84%
we're just not talking
woo-woo philosophy here.

00:19:32.137 --> 00:19:33.339 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: No.

00:19:33.339 --> 00:19:35.774 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: This has been
elevated now to the domain

00:19:35.774 --> 00:19:38.577 align:middle line:84%
of science and we have to
keep coming back to this

00:19:38.577 --> 00:19:40.145 align:middle line:84%
that we are making
this stuff up.

00:19:40.145 --> 00:19:43.082 align:middle line:84%
This is not poetic beautiful
metaphors when we talk

00:19:43.082 --> 00:19:44.450 align:middle line:90%
about unity and oneness.

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:47.620 align:middle line:84%
We are talking about
actual physical reality.

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:50.556 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: You have another
quote in the book cared

00:19:50.556 --> 00:19:52.891 align:middle line:90%
by Arthur Schopenhauer, it says

00:19:52.891 --> 00:19:55.995 align:middle line:84%
"Universal compassion
is the only thing

00:19:55.995 --> 00:19:59.064 align:middle line:90%
that guarantees our morality."

00:19:59.064 --> 00:20:00.666 align:middle line:84%
It's only guarantee
of our morality.

00:20:00.666 --> 00:20:03.636 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: Well I think
what it means by that is

00:20:03.636 --> 00:20:09.241 align:middle line:84%
that it is guarantee and it's
not a matter of convenience.

00:20:09.241 --> 00:20:13.245 align:middle line:84%
That morality flows from this
appreciation that we are one.

00:20:13.245 --> 00:20:15.748 align:middle line:84%
We need a bigger dose of
that in our culture today.

00:20:15.748 --> 00:20:18.183 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Oh my God, and
then you watch something

00:20:18.183 --> 00:20:20.085 align:middle line:90%
like the various reality shows

00:20:20.085 --> 00:20:22.454 align:middle line:84%
on television are all
based on competition.

00:20:22.454 --> 00:20:23.222 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: Competition.

00:20:23.222 --> 00:20:24.523 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: All of it.

00:20:24.523 --> 00:20:27.359 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's such a backward
lens and it's so pervasive

00:20:27.359 --> 00:20:29.695 align:middle line:84%
that it's-- you can
see it reflected some

00:20:29.695 --> 00:20:32.731 align:middle line:84%
in the very younger
parts of our culture.

00:20:32.731 --> 00:20:34.266 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: You know, if
you look at certain periods

00:20:34.266 --> 00:20:37.903 align:middle line:84%
in people's life, you can see
this intrinsic appreciation

00:20:37.903 --> 00:20:38.938 align:middle line:90%
for one is coming.

00:20:38.938 --> 00:20:41.307 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite
examples is daycare.

00:20:41.307 --> 00:20:44.576 align:middle line:84%
If you look at kids who were
in daycare, they always hugging

00:20:44.576 --> 00:20:47.012 align:middle line:84%
down each other, you know,
and loving on each other

00:20:47.012 --> 00:20:49.915 align:middle line:90%
and they don't behave

00:20:49.915 --> 00:20:53.686 align:middle line:84%
as if isolation was the
prime thing in our genes.

00:20:53.686 --> 00:20:54.386 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: No.

00:20:54.386 --> 00:20:55.688 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: Not at all.

00:20:55.688 --> 00:20:57.056 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Even if they're
bumping each other the head.

00:20:57.056 --> 00:20:59.558 align:middle line:84%
They're just exploring some
limits with right each other.

00:20:59.558 --> 00:21:02.528 align:middle line:84%
And when we are looking science
of it, you call it Schrodinger,

00:21:02.528 --> 00:21:05.631 align:middle line:84%
if Schrodinger the
patron saint of one mind,

00:21:05.631 --> 00:21:07.800 align:middle line:84%
most people I've heard
of Schrodinger cat.

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:08.867 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: Right, right.

00:21:08.867 --> 00:21:09.835 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Let's talk
about why this is

00:21:09.835 --> 00:21:11.704 align:middle line:90%
and put it in science context?

00:21:11.704 --> 00:21:14.873 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: Well Schrodinger was
awarded the Nobel Prize in 1933

00:21:14.873 --> 00:21:17.242 align:middle line:84%
for his discovery of what's
called the Schrodinger wave

00:21:17.242 --> 00:21:19.445 align:middle line:84%
equations with that
which quantum physics

00:21:19.445 --> 00:21:21.380 align:middle line:90%
as we know it would not exist.

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:26.018 align:middle line:84%
He believed strongly in the
unity of human consciousness.

00:21:26.018 --> 00:21:28.887 align:middle line:84%
He said that we do not know
consciousness in the plural.

00:21:28.887 --> 00:21:34.159 align:middle line:84%
He said it only occurs
as oneness and he says

00:21:34.159 --> 00:21:38.697 align:middle line:84%
that in truth there
is only one mind.

00:21:38.697 --> 00:21:42.735 align:middle line:84%
I like this because not only
was it an inspiration to me

00:21:42.735 --> 00:21:44.570 align:middle line:90%
to have some backup like--

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:45.771 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:21:45.771 --> 00:21:47.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: A Nobel
physicist but it says as well

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:51.143 align:middle line:84%
that this idea once again,
just doesn't some looney idea

00:21:51.143 --> 00:21:53.946 align:middle line:84%
that you know, woo
woo, people somewhere

00:21:53.946 --> 00:21:56.315 align:middle line:90%
in the new age made up.

00:21:56.315 --> 00:21:59.685 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some of the most
majestic minds in science

00:21:59.685 --> 00:22:03.188 align:middle line:84%
in the 20th century have stood
up for this idea with one mind.

00:22:03.188 --> 00:22:05.657 align:middle line:84%
Another example is the
great 20th century physicist

00:22:05.657 --> 00:22:08.994 align:middle line:90%
David Bohm.

00:22:08.994 --> 00:22:09.695 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:22:09.695 --> 00:22:10.829 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: -- who said,

00:22:10.829 --> 00:22:12.965 align:middle line:84%
deep down consciousness
of human kind is one.

00:22:12.965 --> 00:22:14.967 align:middle line:84%
And he said if we
don't see this is

00:22:14.967 --> 00:22:16.869 align:middle line:84%
because blinding
ourselves to it.

00:22:16.869 --> 00:22:23.575 align:middle line:84%
So it's a sort of nice to have
backup of that caliber to ally

00:22:23.575 --> 00:22:28.814 align:middle line:84%
with this idea of the promise
of a single interfused,

00:22:28.814 --> 00:22:31.083 align:middle line:90%
connected, human consciousness

00:22:31.083 --> 00:22:32.284 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So when
you're talking

00:22:32.284 --> 00:22:34.119 align:middle line:84%
about human consciousness
and human entanglement,

00:22:34.119 --> 00:22:36.221 align:middle line:84%
you can't really separate it
from quantum entanglement.

00:22:36.221 --> 00:22:37.423 align:middle line:90%
It's all one in the same.

00:22:37.423 --> 00:22:38.657 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: Well I
think so and that's one

00:22:38.657 --> 00:22:39.625 align:middle line:90%
of the new revelations.

00:22:39.625 --> 00:22:40.959 align:middle line:90%
We're not talking

00:22:40.959 --> 00:22:44.129 align:middle line:84%
about individual subatomic
particles coming together,

00:22:44.129 --> 00:22:46.031 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
human creatures.

00:22:46.031 --> 00:22:50.302 align:middle line:84%
And I would take it even further
beyond humans and just say look,

00:22:50.302 --> 00:22:53.105 align:middle line:84%
anything that has a remnant of
consciousness is probably part

00:22:53.105 --> 00:22:56.341 align:middle line:84%
of this connectiveness
as well which we see

00:22:56.341 --> 00:22:58.577 align:middle line:90%
in the animal anecdotes,

00:22:58.577 --> 00:23:01.046 align:middle line:84%
and stories which I
talked about in the book.

00:23:01.046 --> 00:23:03.382 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And not
only that, plants.

00:23:03.382 --> 00:23:04.817 align:middle line:84%
We know that plants
are connected

00:23:04.817 --> 00:23:07.820 align:middle line:84%
to human consciousness
at a vast distance.

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:09.555 align:middle line:84%
I think it was Cleve
Blackburns work?

00:23:09.555 --> 00:23:10.222 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: That's true.

00:23:10.222 --> 00:23:10.923 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Backster.

00:23:10.923 --> 00:23:12.291 align:middle line:90%
Cleve Backster's work.

00:23:12.291 --> 00:23:16.962 align:middle line:84%
And he was able to document
that via film and photography

00:23:16.962 --> 00:23:18.464 align:middle line:84%
that was what going
on with the owner

00:23:18.464 --> 00:23:20.399 align:middle line:84%
of the plant was
affecting the plant.

00:23:20.399 --> 00:23:22.935 align:middle line:84%
And we know that plants connect
and communicate with each other,

00:23:22.935 --> 00:23:26.205 align:middle line:84%
trees and forest are
families communicating.

00:23:26.205 --> 00:23:28.407 align:middle line:84%
So now, we all love
animal, let's take it

00:23:28.407 --> 00:23:29.975 align:middle line:90%
into the animal realm.

00:23:29.975 --> 00:23:32.978 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
we're going to start

00:23:32.978 --> 00:23:36.081 align:middle line:90%
with the story about Bobbie.

00:23:36.081 --> 00:23:40.018 align:middle line:84%
And this was back from 1923 and
you write about this in the book

00:23:40.018 --> 00:23:43.355 align:middle line:84%
and you've studied the story so
please tell us more about more

00:23:43.355 --> 00:23:46.024 align:middle line:84%
about Bobbie 'cause it shows
us the incredible connectedness

00:23:46.024 --> 00:23:47.259 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:23:47.259 --> 00:23:50.162 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: Well, Bobbie was
a shepherd-collie mixed.

00:23:50.162 --> 00:23:53.765 align:middle line:84%
Now the family which owned
Bobbie was moving from Indiana

00:23:53.765 --> 00:23:57.636 align:middle line:84%
to Oregon, but as they've
started their journey Bobbie

00:23:57.636 --> 00:23:59.137 align:middle line:90%
gets lost.

00:23:59.137 --> 00:24:01.607 align:middle line:84%
They're heartbroken because
they can't find this dog.

00:24:01.607 --> 00:24:05.344 align:middle line:84%
So they have to go alone to
Oregon to their new home.

00:24:05.344 --> 00:24:07.112 align:middle line:84%
Now, the family had
been to Oregon before

00:24:07.112 --> 00:24:09.548 align:middle line:84%
but Bobbie never
had made that trip.

00:24:09.548 --> 00:24:13.585 align:middle line:84%
So, about six months later,
you know there's the scratch

00:24:13.585 --> 00:24:16.288 align:middle line:84%
at the door in Oregon
and here's Bobbie.

00:24:16.288 --> 00:24:21.426 align:middle line:84%
And Bobbie runs up the stairs,
jumps into bed with the master--

00:24:21.426 --> 00:24:25.097 align:middle line:84%
the dog owner and so this
is not a look a like a dog.

00:24:25.097 --> 00:24:28.867 align:middle line:84%
I mean there are many ways
they could identify this dog

00:24:28.867 --> 00:24:32.571 align:middle line:84%
by its characteristics scars
and marks besides the dog tag.

00:24:32.571 --> 00:24:35.607 align:middle line:84%
And so there is Bobbie,
and so everybody is--

00:24:35.607 --> 00:24:36.942 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Let's look at
the journey of Bobbie.

00:24:36.942 --> 00:24:43.215 align:middle line:84%
I mean this is really-- this
is incredible, look at that?

00:24:43.215 --> 00:24:47.953 align:middle line:84%
Now we've heard of people moving
to another city and their cats

00:24:47.953 --> 00:24:51.757 align:middle line:84%
or dogs finding them but
look at that journey.

00:24:51.757 --> 00:24:53.759 align:middle line:84%
And there was nothing
within his memory.

00:24:53.759 --> 00:24:57.329 align:middle line:84%
He was going solely
on a resonance field

00:24:57.329 --> 00:25:01.166 align:middle line:84%
of some kind intertwined
with his master.

00:25:01.166 --> 00:25:02.501 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: Well, that's
the way I would put it.

00:25:02.501 --> 00:25:06.371 align:middle line:84%
I think this is human to
animal fusion of consciousness.

00:25:06.371 --> 00:25:07.606 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:25:07.606 --> 00:25:08.941 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: I had the
opportunity to discuss this case

00:25:08.941 --> 00:25:11.944 align:middle line:84%
at the meeting at the
Smithsonian Institution

00:25:11.944 --> 00:25:15.981 align:middle line:84%
and you might be surprised that
how bitterly deeply resist this,

00:25:15.981 --> 00:25:19.518 align:middle line:84%
this idea of minds of animals
and humans coming together.

00:25:19.518 --> 00:25:26.058 align:middle line:84%
One of these individuals who was
objecting to this premise said,

00:25:26.058 --> 00:25:30.262 align:middle line:84%
well it's all pheromones, you
know, these chemical that--

00:25:30.262 --> 00:25:31.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Wow, that's
a sniffer.

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:33.131 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: -- that
blow, you know,

00:25:33.131 --> 00:25:37.836 align:middle line:84%
from Oregon over to Indiana and
so the dogs just sniff them out

00:25:37.836 --> 00:25:39.638 align:middle line:90%
and found the new home.

00:25:39.638 --> 00:25:43.108 align:middle line:84%
And I just-- this guy
doesn't understand pheromones,

00:25:43.108 --> 00:25:45.277 align:middle line:90%
they don't bridge species.

00:25:45.277 --> 00:25:46.678 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: No.

00:25:46.678 --> 00:25:49.681 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: You know, they happen
between species of the same kind

00:25:49.681 --> 00:25:51.249 align:middle line:90%
but he would not be corrected.

00:25:51.249 --> 00:25:54.753 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Bu the desperate
attack to just prove it--

00:25:54.753 --> 00:25:56.254 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: It's desperate.

00:25:56.254 --> 00:25:57.656 align:middle line:90%
It's desperate, yeah.

00:25:57.656 --> 00:26:00.726 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- is what's crazy
and Bobbie ended up a hero

00:26:00.726 --> 00:26:02.127 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: It did.

00:26:02.127 --> 00:26:03.128 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Right, we have
some pictures of him in town.

00:26:03.128 --> 00:26:04.129 align:middle line:90%
He's being heralded.

00:26:04.129 --> 00:26:06.031 align:middle line:84%
He was well known
and wrote about--

00:26:06.031 --> 00:26:09.101 align:middle line:84%
written about at
the time and oh,

00:26:09.101 --> 00:26:11.370 align:middle line:90%
about what regal post of Bobbie.

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:12.571 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: Isn't Bobbie great?

00:26:12.571 --> 00:26:14.039 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Bobbie is great.

00:26:14.039 --> 00:26:16.308 align:middle line:90%
And in the sec here, here we go.

00:26:16.308 --> 00:26:20.212 align:middle line:84%
He's being heralded for
the hero that he was.

00:26:20.212 --> 00:26:23.215 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: He was being-- he
was given keys to cities--

00:26:23.215 --> 00:26:24.249 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:26:24.249 --> 00:26:25.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: -- and
this sort of thing.

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:27.552 align:middle line:84%
After Bobbie died and
once buried, Rin Tin Tin,

00:26:27.552 --> 00:26:31.923 align:middle line:84%
the famous German shepherd movie
star dog actually laid a wreath

00:26:31.923 --> 00:26:35.394 align:middle line:90%
at Bobbie's grave-- dog to dog.

00:26:35.394 --> 00:26:36.495 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Oh.

00:26:36.495 --> 00:26:37.829 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: I thought
that was a nice touch.

00:26:37.829 --> 00:26:40.499 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: It is, and the
thing is that there's something

00:26:40.499 --> 00:26:42.868 align:middle line:90%
about the animal kingdom.

00:26:42.868 --> 00:26:46.672 align:middle line:84%
And dog seem to exemplify maybe
because we're so close to them.

00:26:46.672 --> 00:26:50.208 align:middle line:84%
We live so closely with
them that is so pure and so

00:26:50.208 --> 00:26:54.112 align:middle line:84%
without guile that allows
them to still be able

00:26:54.112 --> 00:26:57.149 align:middle line:84%
to receive the information
with long lost access to.

00:26:57.149 --> 00:26:59.418 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: You know, I
think that's exactly right

00:26:59.418 --> 00:27:04.589 align:middle line:84%
and we see this intimacy also
not just with dogs but I want

00:27:04.589 --> 00:27:07.759 align:middle line:84%
to share a cat lover
friends that we it also

00:27:07.759 --> 00:27:09.961 align:middle line:90%
in non-dogs including cats.

00:27:09.961 --> 00:27:11.329 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes, including cats.

00:27:11.329 --> 00:27:13.565 align:middle line:84%
And also, you see this
in this Animal Kingdom

00:27:13.565 --> 00:27:18.737 align:middle line:84%
where you have cross species
coming to the rescue of others.

00:27:18.737 --> 00:27:20.372 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: Yes.

00:27:20.372 --> 00:27:22.274 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Which is
something that theoretically

00:27:22.274 --> 00:27:24.976 align:middle line:84%
if this were a competitive
universe,

00:27:24.976 --> 00:27:26.978 align:middle line:84%
you would not be seeing
that especially ones

00:27:26.978 --> 00:27:30.182 align:middle line:84%
that are considered
to be enemies, right?

00:27:30.182 --> 00:27:33.318 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: Well, yes indeed
and there many studies now

00:27:33.318 --> 00:27:36.655 align:middle line:84%
which I talk about in
the book which show

00:27:36.655 --> 00:27:40.258 align:middle line:84%
that humans actually give
their life to rescue animals.

00:27:40.258 --> 00:27:41.593 align:middle line:90%
And we know that humans--

00:27:41.593 --> 00:27:44.396 align:middle line:84%
that animals would give
their life to rescue humans.

00:27:44.396 --> 00:27:46.765 align:middle line:84%
And animals will do the
same toward other animals.

00:27:46.765 --> 00:27:50.602 align:middle line:84%
So there's every combination,
you can think about,

00:27:50.602 --> 00:27:54.473 align:middle line:84%
about the display, manifestation
of this oneness and unity thing.

00:27:54.473 --> 00:27:58.210 align:middle line:84%
It almost isn't important
about who's in need,

00:27:58.210 --> 00:28:00.846 align:middle line:84%
it's that some living
creature, some creature

00:28:00.846 --> 00:28:04.583 align:middle line:84%
that is somewhat conscious
or fully conscious is

00:28:04.583 --> 00:28:07.219 align:middle line:84%
in desperate need
of rescue and that's

00:28:07.219 --> 00:28:09.421 align:middle line:84%
when you see thing
bring into action.

00:28:09.421 --> 00:28:11.523 align:middle line:84%
I think if you unpack
all of that, what you get

00:28:11.523 --> 00:28:14.226 align:middle line:84%
down to also is affection
and compassion.

00:28:14.226 --> 00:28:15.293 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I was
going to say, yes,

00:28:15.293 --> 00:28:17.095 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't
even have to be a need.

00:28:17.095 --> 00:28:19.431 align:middle line:84%
It can just be a joy of some
of kind where you see a bird

00:28:19.431 --> 00:28:21.266 align:middle line:84%
and a cat who have
become friends

00:28:21.266 --> 00:28:23.401 align:middle line:84%
and are playing together,
for example.

00:28:23.401 --> 00:28:25.971 align:middle line:84%
Those are my favorite little
YouTube videos of course,

00:28:25.971 --> 00:28:27.038 align:middle line:90%
everybody loves those.

00:28:27.038 --> 00:28:28.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: Great, yeah.

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.941 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And so you
mentioned a little bit ago

00:28:29.941 --> 00:28:32.911 align:middle line:84%
about their crossover also
with the human kingdom.

00:28:32.911 --> 00:28:36.581 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take a look at
another video and this has to do

00:28:36.581 --> 00:28:38.283 align:middle line:90%
with the dog name Duke,

00:28:38.283 --> 00:28:41.953 align:middle line:84%
who threw these subtle
interconnected fields,

00:28:41.953 --> 00:28:43.822 align:middle line:90%
saved the household's baby.

00:28:43.822 --> 00:28:46.558 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at
this, he made the news.

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:52.564 align:middle line:84%
>> Story about a rescued dog and
one extremely grateful family

00:28:52.564 --> 00:28:55.901 align:middle line:84%
that Brousseau of Connecticut
adopted a dog named Duke six

00:28:55.901 --> 00:28:58.737 align:middle line:84%
years ago and he has
now paid them back

00:28:58.737 --> 00:29:01.306 align:middle line:84%
in dramatic passion,
check it out.

00:29:01.306 --> 00:29:03.275 align:middle line:84%
>> Duke is an ordinary
looking dog

00:29:03.275 --> 00:29:05.377 align:middle line:90%
who did something extraordinary.

00:29:05.377 --> 00:29:06.778 align:middle line:90%
>> He's such a good dog.

00:29:06.778 --> 00:29:09.614 align:middle line:84%
>> Last Sunday night, Duke
jumped on his owner's bed

00:29:09.614 --> 00:29:13.485 align:middle line:84%
and started shaking so
uncontrollably, he woke them up.

00:29:13.485 --> 00:29:17.255 align:middle line:84%
>> He is insanely obedience
so this was extremely bizarre.

00:29:17.255 --> 00:29:20.158 align:middle line:84%
>> So bizarre in fact that
Jenna Brousseau immediately knew

00:29:20.158 --> 00:29:21.293 align:middle line:90%
something was wrong.

00:29:21.293 --> 00:29:23.428 align:middle line:84%
This prompted her and
her husband to go check

00:29:23.428 --> 00:29:26.431 align:middle line:84%
on their nine-week old
infant daughter, Harper.

00:29:26.431 --> 00:29:28.600 align:middle line:84%
Sure enough something
was horribly wrong,

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.769 align:middle line:90%
Harper wasn't breathing.

00:29:30.769 --> 00:29:34.139 align:middle line:84%
>> My husband called 911 and the
ambulance came here and it was

00:29:34.139 --> 00:29:38.109 align:middle line:84%
because of our Dukey
dog who alerted us.

00:29:38.109 --> 00:29:40.812 align:middle line:84%
>> Duke's call for help
saved the little girl.

00:29:40.812 --> 00:29:42.681 align:middle line:90%
Harper is now doing just fine.

00:29:42.681 --> 00:29:45.116 align:middle line:90%
>> If Duke hadn't, you know,

00:29:45.116 --> 00:29:49.020 align:middle line:84%
been so scared we were
just gone to sleep.

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:51.623 align:middle line:84%
>> The Brousseau adopted
this scrappy little dog

00:29:51.623 --> 00:29:53.925 align:middle line:84%
from an animal shelter
six years ago.

00:29:53.925 --> 00:29:58.029 align:middle line:84%
A debt of gratitude that is now
been repaid many times over.

00:29:58.029 --> 00:29:59.130 align:middle line:90%
>> He is the perfect dog.

00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:01.766 align:middle line:90%
He was meant-- meant to be ours.

00:30:01.766 --> 00:30:03.101 align:middle line:90%
He was meant to hers.

00:30:03.101 --> 00:30:07.305 align:middle line:84%
I tell him all the time, you
were born at mommy's heart.

00:30:07.305 --> 00:30:09.908 align:middle line:84%
We owned him just because
he was so meant to be ours.

00:30:09.908 --> 00:30:12.177 align:middle line:90%
He's heaven, he's a good boy.

00:30:12.177 --> 00:30:15.647 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: In their world
it's not extraordinary.

00:30:15.647 --> 00:30:16.648 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: No that's true.

00:30:16.648 --> 00:30:17.782 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: This is
how they operate.

00:30:17.782 --> 00:30:20.552 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: That's
exactly the case.

00:30:20.552 --> 00:30:22.854 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite stories
that didn't make the book

00:30:22.854 --> 00:30:26.625 align:middle line:84%
but nonetheless, it's really
inspiring is a patient

00:30:26.625 --> 00:30:30.695 align:middle line:84%
with diabetes mellitus, who
slip occasionally into a comma.

00:30:30.695 --> 00:30:34.666 align:middle line:84%
So this man taught
his dog somehow

00:30:34.666 --> 00:30:37.669 align:middle line:84%
to push the right
buttons for 911.

00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:39.471 align:middle line:90%
You can imagine what happened.

00:30:39.471 --> 00:30:42.908 align:middle line:84%
One day the guy goes into
comma, the dog calls 911

00:30:42.908 --> 00:30:44.476 align:middle line:90%
and saves it, the best.

00:30:44.476 --> 00:30:45.777 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: God it's amazing.

00:30:45.777 --> 00:30:48.713 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: So these things
get entirely intricate and--

00:30:48.713 --> 00:30:51.816 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yeah and there's
something happening there.

00:30:51.816 --> 00:30:55.186 align:middle line:84%
The cases we just talked
about, there is a need.

00:30:55.186 --> 00:30:58.657 align:middle line:84%
When we look at the subject of
entropy or we look at the field

00:30:58.657 --> 00:31:02.694 align:middle line:84%
of potential, all potential
exist all the time, right?

00:31:02.694 --> 00:31:03.795 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: Yes, yes.

00:31:03.795 --> 00:31:04.996 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: But there
is something that has

00:31:04.996 --> 00:31:08.500 align:middle line:84%
to create a defining
kind of coalescence

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:11.236 align:middle line:90%
into collapsing into an event.

00:31:11.236 --> 00:31:12.637 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: Yes.

00:31:12.637 --> 00:31:14.306 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Let's talk about that
for more of a scientific point

00:31:14.306 --> 00:31:18.576 align:middle line:84%
of view, this collapsing
through need to a reality.

00:31:18.576 --> 00:31:21.246 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: Right, well early
on physicist said the thing

00:31:21.246 --> 00:31:23.181 align:middle line:84%
that collapses all
of this possibility

00:31:23.181 --> 00:31:26.851 align:middle line:84%
into a single observed--
observable event is,

00:31:26.851 --> 00:31:28.553 align:middle line:90%
it's just observation.

00:31:28.553 --> 00:31:31.423 align:middle line:84%
Since then as we've learned
that and tying them up,

00:31:31.423 --> 00:31:34.726 align:middle line:84%
it includes not just
individual particles bur people.

00:31:34.726 --> 00:31:38.296 align:middle line:84%
There have been other factors
which have floated to the top

00:31:38.296 --> 00:31:40.432 align:middle line:84%
and the one that I think
is crucial is the one you

00:31:40.432 --> 00:31:41.333 align:middle line:90%
just mentioned.

00:31:41.333 --> 00:31:42.600 align:middle line:90%
It's human need.

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:45.570 align:middle line:84%
You see it in these animal
and human interplays here.

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:47.772 align:middle line:90%
You see it in person to person,

00:31:47.772 --> 00:31:51.242 align:middle line:84%
manifestations of
rescue attempts.

00:31:51.242 --> 00:31:55.947 align:middle line:84%
Its need and so need
plus human compassion

00:31:55.947 --> 00:31:58.049 align:middle line:84%
and love equals this
sort or events

00:31:58.049 --> 00:32:00.185 align:middle line:90%
that we're witnessing here.

00:32:00.185 --> 00:32:02.087 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: There
is some kind of,

00:32:02.087 --> 00:32:05.457 align:middle line:84%
it almost like a plasmic
field to emotion then.

00:32:05.457 --> 00:32:07.959 align:middle line:84%
There's something about
emotion that can send

00:32:07.959 --> 00:32:10.962 align:middle line:84%
out this resonances,
S.O.S resonance

00:32:10.962 --> 00:32:14.933 align:middle line:84%
that essentially can be received
on any number of levels.

00:32:14.933 --> 00:32:16.334 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: I think
that's right, you know,

00:32:16.334 --> 00:32:19.104 align:middle line:84%
some of the consciousness
researchers I follow say

00:32:19.104 --> 00:32:25.176 align:middle line:84%
that love and human need and
compassion constitute the glue

00:32:25.176 --> 00:32:28.880 align:middle line:84%
that unites people across great
distances and I like that,

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:32.550 align:middle line:84%
the idea of some psychological
spiritual glue that sort

00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:36.054 align:middle line:84%
of helps us maintain
contact at a distance.

00:32:36.054 --> 00:32:41.593 align:middle line:84%
I will say that with respect
to these animal rescues,

00:32:41.593 --> 00:32:45.797 align:middle line:84%
Mark Twain was so impressed
by the dog's involvement

00:32:45.797 --> 00:32:49.934 align:middle line:84%
in these things that he said,
"If dogs do not go to heaven,

00:32:49.934 --> 00:32:51.703 align:middle line:90%
I want to go where my dogs go."

00:32:51.703 --> 00:32:53.004 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I would
agree with him.

00:32:53.004 --> 00:32:57.509 align:middle line:84%
I would agree that--
that purity of spirit is,

00:32:57.509 --> 00:32:59.411 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's an inspiration
to all humans

00:32:59.411 --> 00:33:00.645 align:middle line:90%
or at least should be.

00:33:00.645 --> 00:33:04.282 align:middle line:84%
Now, staying in the
scientific realm also you talked

00:33:04.282 --> 00:33:06.017 align:middle line:90%
about stem cells in the book.

00:33:06.017 --> 00:33:07.218 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: Mm-hmm.

00:33:07.218 --> 00:33:09.154 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And you like
the function of stem cells

00:33:09.154 --> 00:33:11.990 align:middle line:84%
to this quantum entanglement
of one mind.

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:13.425 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:33:13.425 --> 00:33:17.929 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: Well for me stem cell
epitomized this thing of need.

00:33:17.929 --> 00:33:21.800 align:middle line:84%
You know, there are cells in
the body that can differentiate

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:24.536 align:middle line:90%
into any other cell in the body

00:33:24.536 --> 00:33:26.604 align:middle line:84%
but they don't go
just differentiating

00:33:26.604 --> 00:33:28.373 align:middle line:90%
into just to any cell.

00:33:28.373 --> 00:33:30.442 align:middle line:84%
It depends on what
the body needs.

00:33:30.442 --> 00:33:34.746 align:middle line:84%
Somehow there's a recognition
phenomena between the stem cells

00:33:34.746 --> 00:33:38.850 align:middle line:84%
and the rest of the body and
they go where they're needed.

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:40.718 align:middle line:84%
It's like a doctor
being on call.

00:33:40.718 --> 00:33:43.688 align:middle line:84%
They're on call and a when
a certain need arises,

00:33:43.688 --> 00:33:46.758 align:middle line:84%
they migrate to that
area and differentiate

00:33:46.758 --> 00:33:51.529 align:middle line:84%
into that needed cell whether
it's repairing a heart that's

00:33:51.529 --> 00:33:55.066 align:middle line:84%
been damaged from heart
attack or differentiating

00:33:55.066 --> 00:33:58.103 align:middle line:84%
into blood cells if
they're needed or GI cells.

00:33:58.103 --> 00:33:59.838 align:middle line:90%
They can do almost anything.

00:33:59.838 --> 00:34:03.608 align:middle line:84%
But need is the thing
that prompts them

00:34:03.608 --> 00:34:05.009 align:middle line:90%
to do whatever they do.

00:34:05.009 --> 00:34:09.347 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: It's like they're a
perfected holographic template

00:34:09.347 --> 00:34:10.815 align:middle line:90%
of the highest potential

00:34:10.815 --> 00:34:13.717 align:middle line:84%
that can express
physically in the human.

00:34:13.717 --> 00:34:16.253 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: And I think that just
a great metaphor, the stem cells

00:34:16.253 --> 00:34:19.590 align:middle line:84%
for how humans respond
to one another

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:22.092 align:middle line:90%
at a distance depending on need.

00:34:22.092 --> 00:34:24.229 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Let's talk-- by the
way there was another story

00:34:24.229 --> 00:34:26.798 align:middle line:84%
in your book on humans that I
thought was really interesting

00:34:26.798 --> 00:34:28.967 align:middle line:84%
and about this entanglement
and it had to do

00:34:28.967 --> 00:34:31.735 align:middle line:84%
with Abraham Lincoln maybe
you can explain that.

00:34:31.735 --> 00:34:34.505 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: Well this is
another human-dog story

00:34:34.505 --> 00:34:37.142 align:middle line:84%
that somehow has
been swept aside

00:34:37.142 --> 00:34:41.746 align:middle line:84%
and people I think are sort of
embarrassed to talk about it.

00:34:41.746 --> 00:34:43.815 align:middle line:84%
When he went to Fords
Theater the night

00:34:43.815 --> 00:34:49.554 align:middle line:84%
that he was assassinated the
dog stayed home of course but at

00:34:49.554 --> 00:34:52.523 align:middle line:90%
that time Lincoln was shot.

00:34:52.523 --> 00:34:55.159 align:middle line:84%
The dog went crazy,
the dog started running

00:34:55.159 --> 00:34:59.130 align:middle line:84%
in the White House from side
to side and barking and it was

00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:01.766 align:middle line:84%
as if this animal is having some
sort of emotional breakdown.

00:35:01.766 --> 00:35:03.001 align:middle line:90%
This had never happened.

00:35:03.001 --> 00:35:07.071 align:middle line:84%
This was a peaceful,
tranquil, obedient animal.

00:35:07.071 --> 00:35:10.742 align:middle line:84%
And the staff in the White
House said something is happened

00:35:10.742 --> 00:35:12.277 align:middle line:90%
to the president.

00:35:12.277 --> 00:35:14.045 align:middle line:84%
They seem to connect
this dog's behavior

00:35:14.045 --> 00:35:16.948 align:middle line:84%
with some tragic event
in Lincoln's life.

00:35:16.948 --> 00:35:21.186 align:middle line:84%
And as it turned out the times
correlated, the dog's distress,

00:35:21.186 --> 00:35:23.688 align:middle line:84%
correlated with the time the
president was assassinated.

00:35:23.688 --> 00:35:26.891 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yeah and that's
the story, you're right.

00:35:26.891 --> 00:35:29.828 align:middle line:84%
That's not a story,
that's normally told.

00:35:29.828 --> 00:35:34.199 align:middle line:84%
Let's extend this out to flocks
and the swarming mentality,

00:35:34.199 --> 00:35:36.334 align:middle line:84%
the schooling or
swarming mentality

00:35:36.334 --> 00:35:40.972 align:middle line:84%
because this was really
an interesting aspect

00:35:40.972 --> 00:35:42.340 align:middle line:90%
of this entanglement.

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:44.008 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take a look
at another little video.

00:35:44.008 --> 00:35:47.212 align:middle line:84%
This has to do with the swarming
effect and after we come out,

00:35:47.212 --> 00:35:50.848 align:middle line:84%
let's talk bout what
actually is going on here, OK.

00:35:50.848 --> 00:35:59.924 align:middle line:90%
[ Music ]

00:36:01.359 --> 00:36:03.027 align:middle line:84%
>> [Background Music] They
start out flying in the groups,

00:36:03.027 --> 00:36:05.563 align:middle line:84%
they've been feeding
with all day.

00:36:05.563 --> 00:36:09.500 align:middle line:84%
And slowly merge into bigger
and ever denser flocks.

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:12.871 align:middle line:84%
I spent hours watching,
I've never seen collusion.

00:36:12.871 --> 00:36:14.873 align:middle line:90%
How can that be possible?

00:36:14.873 --> 00:36:23.948 align:middle line:90%
[ Music ]

00:36:25.817 --> 00:36:30.088 align:middle line:84%
Individuals but moving in a
single entity and a reason

00:36:30.088 --> 00:36:32.991 align:middle line:84%
for this behavior, well
thousands of eyes looking

00:36:32.991 --> 00:36:36.694 align:middle line:84%
for predators on the ruse sight,
nothing could escape their gaze,

00:36:36.694 --> 00:36:40.765 align:middle line:84%
no rocket could surprise these
soaring mass of bird flesh.

00:36:40.765 --> 00:36:43.835 align:middle line:84%
The activity warms their
bodies for the cold night ahead

00:36:43.835 --> 00:36:46.204 align:middle line:84%
and there's something
social going on here

00:36:46.204 --> 00:36:48.740 align:middle line:84%
because when they do settle
to roost, the warmest,

00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:53.244 align:middle line:84%
safest perches in the ridge will
be taken by the dominant males.

00:36:53.244 --> 00:36:55.546 align:middle line:84%
Adolescents and females
will be pushed to the edges

00:36:55.546 --> 00:36:57.949 align:middle line:84%
so the birds are
also maneuvering

00:36:57.949 --> 00:37:01.386 align:middle line:90%
for position, social position.

00:37:01.386 --> 00:37:04.022 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: But this is
beyond mechanical and social,

00:37:04.022 --> 00:37:07.091 align:middle line:84%
that appears to be the
reflection of pieces

00:37:07.091 --> 00:37:09.994 align:middle line:84%
of one mind almost like
a fractal of a mind.

00:37:09.994 --> 00:37:11.329 align:middle line:84%
>>Dossey: It looks
like a good mind.

00:37:11.329 --> 00:37:13.097 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: It does.

00:37:13.097 --> 00:37:16.634 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: The commentator
mentioned, biological advantages

00:37:16.634 --> 00:37:19.404 align:middle line:84%
to behaving like this
confusing predators

00:37:19.404 --> 00:37:20.905 align:middle line:90%
and that sort of thing.

00:37:20.905 --> 00:37:22.440 align:middle line:90%
That may well be true,

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:26.044 align:middle line:84%
but doesn't explain
how these animals do it

00:37:26.044 --> 00:37:28.379 align:middle line:90%
practically simultaneously.

00:37:28.379 --> 00:37:31.082 align:middle line:84%
This is been put under
the microscope and analyze

00:37:31.082 --> 00:37:35.086 align:middle line:84%
by ethologist, people who
study animal behavior.

00:37:35.086 --> 00:37:38.356 align:middle line:84%
And you just simply can't
explain how these animals

00:37:38.356 --> 00:37:41.926 align:middle line:84%
from one side of the flock moves
simultaneously with animals

00:37:41.926 --> 00:37:43.594 align:middle line:90%
on the other side of flock.

00:37:43.594 --> 00:37:49.400 align:middle line:84%
This applies to fishes
and schools and swarms

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:51.302 align:middle line:90%
of anything that flies.

00:37:51.302 --> 00:37:52.337 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Birds, bees, yeah.

00:37:52.337 --> 00:37:53.771 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: Exactly.

00:37:53.771 --> 00:37:57.909 align:middle line:84%
And also the example I used in
the book has to do with Caribou

00:37:57.909 --> 00:38:00.978 align:middle line:84%
and the great porcupine
herd in Northern Alaska.

00:38:00.978 --> 00:38:03.181 align:middle line:84%
They were-- they
were two ethologists

00:38:03.181 --> 00:38:06.417 align:middle line:84%
who followed this gigantic
herd around for six month.

00:38:06.417 --> 00:38:08.653 align:middle line:84%
And they filmed them
and they came

00:38:08.653 --> 00:38:10.621 align:middle line:84%
up where they're saying
something weird is going on here

00:38:10.621 --> 00:38:12.623 align:middle line:90%
that we don't understand.

00:38:12.623 --> 00:38:16.327 align:middle line:84%
This is not like dominoes
falling on, hitting the other

00:38:16.327 --> 00:38:18.396 align:middle line:90%
and propagating in the way.

00:38:18.396 --> 00:38:19.630 align:middle line:90%
This is how-- this would be a

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:23.034 align:middle line:84%
like all the dominoes
falling simultaneously.

00:38:23.034 --> 00:38:26.104 align:middle line:84%
There's no place in
modern biology for this.

00:38:26.104 --> 00:38:28.172 align:middle line:84%
In order to explain
this Regina we have

00:38:28.172 --> 00:38:30.541 align:middle line:84%
to introduce some
other principle

00:38:30.541 --> 00:38:33.544 align:middle line:84%
which I think is incorporated in
this idea of group consciousness

00:38:33.544 --> 00:38:36.214 align:middle line:84%
or unity and connectedness
between creatures.

00:38:36.214 --> 00:38:38.649 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And also Rupert
Sheldrake's work looking

00:38:38.649 --> 00:38:40.451 align:middle line:90%
at morphic fields.

00:38:40.451 --> 00:38:41.886 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain a
little bit about that

00:38:41.886 --> 00:38:44.188 align:middle line:84%
because he spent
tremendous amount of time.

00:38:44.188 --> 00:38:46.991 align:middle line:84%
And the impetus for these
birds, any kind of impetus seems

00:38:46.991 --> 00:38:50.228 align:middle line:84%
to be happening before there
would be even the ability

00:38:50.228 --> 00:38:51.696 align:middle line:90%
to consciously react.

00:38:51.696 --> 00:38:54.332 align:middle line:84%
So this is an unconscious
reaction with them

00:38:54.332 --> 00:38:55.833 align:middle line:90%
in that as they moved.

00:38:55.833 --> 00:38:57.168 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: That's exactly right.

00:38:57.168 --> 00:39:00.738 align:middle line:84%
No one has contributed more
to this than Sheldrake.

00:39:00.738 --> 00:39:02.874 align:middle line:84%
It's proper that
we give him credit.

00:39:02.874 --> 00:39:06.577 align:middle line:84%
He actually did videos
of animals, pets,

00:39:06.577 --> 00:39:11.616 align:middle line:84%
dogs specifically,
who could into it

00:39:11.616 --> 00:39:14.685 align:middle line:84%
when their owners decided
to come home from the office

00:39:14.685 --> 00:39:17.755 align:middle line:84%
or whoever and the dog would
invariably go to the door,

00:39:17.755 --> 00:39:20.658 align:middle line:84%
to the window and just
stand there waiting,

00:39:20.658 --> 00:39:24.962 align:middle line:84%
the moment that the decision
made by the owner to return.

00:39:24.962 --> 00:39:28.599 align:middle line:84%
They try to fake the dogs out a
million ways by returning home

00:39:28.599 --> 00:39:31.969 align:middle line:84%
at different times of
day and various condenses

00:39:31.969 --> 00:39:34.172 align:middle line:84%
where they're walking,
or on bicycle or a taxi

00:39:34.172 --> 00:39:38.910 align:middle line:84%
or any other way and they
couldn't fake the dogs out.

00:39:38.910 --> 00:39:40.611 align:middle line:90%
The dogs knew.

00:39:40.611 --> 00:39:44.449 align:middle line:84%
This looks like what
Sheldrake call morphic fields

00:39:44.449 --> 00:39:47.552 align:middle line:84%
which go beyond spatial
separation.

00:39:47.552 --> 00:39:52.356 align:middle line:84%
This is what we're calling
the one mind hypothesis.

00:39:52.356 --> 00:39:55.593 align:middle line:84%
I'm happy to say that
Sheldrake came to my home

00:39:55.593 --> 00:40:00.364 align:middle line:84%
when his book was in
manuscript phase and we talked

00:40:00.364 --> 00:40:03.234 align:middle line:84%
about these things and we
have a great time doing it

00:40:03.234 --> 00:40:04.669 align:middle line:84%
because we were on the
same channel about it.

00:40:04.669 --> 00:40:08.072 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well-- he is
a wonderful gentleman.

00:40:08.072 --> 00:40:09.507 align:middle line:90%
I have great respect for.

00:40:09.507 --> 00:40:11.642 align:middle line:90%
He's actually I've heard myself

00:40:11.642 --> 00:40:14.178 align:middle line:84%
and others also just
to bring this up.

00:40:14.178 --> 00:40:16.247 align:middle line:90%
I have misused the terminology

00:40:16.247 --> 00:40:18.249 align:middle line:84%
and called it morphogenic
fields.

00:40:18.249 --> 00:40:21.385 align:middle line:84%
And I was in his home in
London one time and he said no,

00:40:21.385 --> 00:40:24.055 align:middle line:90%
no it is not morphogenic and--

00:40:24.055 --> 00:40:26.224 align:middle line:84%
now I hear with other people
he said its either more

00:40:26.224 --> 00:40:28.226 align:middle line:84%
morphogenetic or
more morphic fields.

00:40:28.226 --> 00:40:30.728 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just setting that
straight for all of us.

00:40:30.728 --> 00:40:31.295 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: No.

00:40:31.295 --> 00:40:32.296 align:middle line:90%
Good for you.

00:40:32.296 --> 00:40:35.633 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And so
I wanted to talk--

00:40:35.633 --> 00:40:41.239 align:middle line:84%
moving from the humans and
the morphic fields of mind

00:40:41.239 --> 00:40:43.508 align:middle line:84%
into what happens
even beyond death.

00:40:43.508 --> 00:40:47.278 align:middle line:84%
Because one thing we know for
sure is what ever memory is,

00:40:47.278 --> 00:40:51.449 align:middle line:84%
what ever mind is, is not
inside this obviously.

00:40:51.449 --> 00:40:53.518 align:middle line:84%
This may be simply
or processing unit

00:40:53.518 --> 00:40:56.387 align:middle line:84%
to access it were I think
scientist is becoming pretty

00:40:56.387 --> 00:40:57.288 align:middle line:90%
clear on that.

00:40:57.288 --> 00:40:58.689 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about what happens

00:40:58.689 --> 00:41:00.791 align:middle line:84%
after death you have
some interesting things

00:41:00.791 --> 00:41:03.394 align:middle line:90%
about near death experiences.

00:41:03.394 --> 00:41:05.696 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: Well-- only
15 million Americans

00:41:05.696 --> 00:41:08.666 align:middle line:84%
by now have had what we call
a near death experience.

00:41:08.666 --> 00:41:11.068 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that they
come back and tell us is

00:41:11.068 --> 00:41:13.104 align:middle line:90%
that we're not separate.

00:41:13.104 --> 00:41:14.605 align:middle line:90%
We're all united.

00:41:14.605 --> 00:41:15.973 align:middle line:90%
There's no disunity.

00:41:15.973 --> 00:41:20.344 align:middle line:84%
Everything is at that dimension
one and that sense of unity

00:41:20.344 --> 00:41:22.346 align:middle line:84%
and connectedness
is also marinated

00:41:22.346 --> 00:41:24.949 align:middle line:90%
in this intense felling of love.

00:41:24.949 --> 00:41:27.919 align:middle line:84%
That's the classic
near death experience

00:41:27.919 --> 00:41:31.489 align:middle line:84%
which so many people have
return to tell us about.

00:41:31.489 --> 00:41:35.860 align:middle line:84%
This is I think indirect
evidence of immortality

00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:38.563 align:middle line:84%
but comment immortality
and eternality

00:41:38.563 --> 00:41:40.364 align:middle line:90%
in slightly different way.

00:41:40.364 --> 00:41:43.701 align:middle line:84%
The way I think we can
understand it is to say

00:41:43.701 --> 00:41:47.138 align:middle line:84%
that the one mind
is the dimension

00:41:47.138 --> 00:41:52.109 align:middle line:84%
where individual minds gather
and it's beyond space and time.

00:41:52.109 --> 00:41:55.580 align:middle line:84%
The operative word
for me is non-local.

00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:58.482 align:middle line:84%
That's just a fancy
word for infinite.

00:41:58.482 --> 00:42:02.753 align:middle line:84%
Now something is infinite
in time, it's immortal.

00:42:02.753 --> 00:42:06.357 align:middle line:84%
So to say that our minds behave
as if they're infinite in time

00:42:06.357 --> 00:42:14.332 align:middle line:84%
and non-local mandates
immortality, it just arises.

00:42:14.332 --> 00:42:18.669 align:middle line:84%
As matter of fact you can't
be partially non-local.

00:42:18.669 --> 00:42:21.973 align:middle line:84%
Non-locality involves
infinitude.

00:42:21.973 --> 00:42:23.541 align:middle line:90%
So, it's like being pregnant.

00:42:23.541 --> 00:42:25.276 align:middle line:84%
You can't be a little
bit pregnant

00:42:25.276 --> 00:42:27.478 align:middle line:84%
and either can you be
a little non-local.

00:42:27.478 --> 00:42:29.780 align:middle line:84%
So the fact there, our
minds behave non-locally

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:34.685 align:middle line:84%
and this existence is solid
evidence that something

00:42:34.685 --> 00:42:36.554 align:middle line:84%
about our minds has
to be infinite

00:42:36.554 --> 00:42:39.323 align:middle line:84%
in space therefore
immortal and internal.

00:42:39.323 --> 00:42:44.061 align:middle line:84%
So I think when you put people's
near death experiences together

00:42:44.061 --> 00:42:48.532 align:middle line:84%
with the experiments which
show it is non-local quality

00:42:48.532 --> 00:42:49.834 align:middle line:90%
of conscious thing,

00:42:49.834 --> 00:42:51.836 align:middle line:84%
you've really got something
powerful here that points

00:42:51.836 --> 00:42:54.505 align:middle line:84%
like an arrow toward
immortality.

00:42:54.505 --> 00:42:55.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Absolutely.

00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:57.408 align:middle line:84%
And one thing people
don't normally talk

00:42:57.408 --> 00:43:00.211 align:middle line:84%
about in their books is the
shared death experience,

00:43:00.211 --> 00:43:02.146 align:middle line:84%
that's the nuance
of that but explain

00:43:02.146 --> 00:43:04.348 align:middle line:84%
to us what a shared
death experience is?

00:43:04.348 --> 00:43:07.084 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: Well this has
come to light through cases

00:43:07.084 --> 00:43:09.020 align:middle line:84%
that been collected
but Dr. Raymond Moody

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:14.925 align:middle line:84%
who gave us this 1970's book,
Got A life, the Beyond Life.

00:43:14.925 --> 00:43:18.729 align:middle line:84%
And so a shared death
experience is the experience

00:43:18.729 --> 00:43:20.765 align:middle line:90%
like a near death experience

00:43:20.765 --> 00:43:23.801 align:middle line:84%
without going through--
without nearly dying.

00:43:23.801 --> 00:43:26.937 align:middle line:84%
And so for example people can
be gathered around a bedside

00:43:26.937 --> 00:43:29.206 align:middle line:90%
of a loved one who is dying

00:43:29.206 --> 00:43:32.743 align:middle line:84%
and that loved one maybe
having a near death experience

00:43:32.743 --> 00:43:35.012 align:middle line:90%
but it's like that's catching.

00:43:35.012 --> 00:43:39.050 align:middle line:84%
The people around the
bedside begin to share it

00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:42.119 align:middle line:84%
and they have these
transcending experiences

00:43:42.119 --> 00:43:46.791 align:middle line:84%
and come back after-- after they
gone through them and tell us,

00:43:46.791 --> 00:43:49.293 align:middle line:84%
what's the dead ringer for
a near death experience?

00:43:49.293 --> 00:43:52.596 align:middle line:84%
What it say is that people
do not have to nearly die

00:43:52.596 --> 00:43:55.232 align:middle line:84%
in order have near
death like experience.

00:43:55.232 --> 00:43:58.202 align:middle line:84%
You can just have
it because you care

00:43:58.202 --> 00:44:00.004 align:middle line:84%
about the person
who's having it--

00:44:00.004 --> 00:44:02.239 align:middle line:84%
here's that love
connection again.

00:44:02.239 --> 00:44:04.241 align:middle line:84%
This feeling of compassion
of caring

00:44:04.241 --> 00:44:07.111 align:middle line:84%
about someone who's your
mother, your father,

00:44:07.111 --> 00:44:10.948 align:middle line:84%
your child who is dying
is enough to catapult you

00:44:10.948 --> 00:44:12.850 align:middle line:90%
into the actual experience.

00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:14.485 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And I can
go forward or backward?

00:44:14.485 --> 00:44:16.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: Yes, it
certainly can.

00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:19.824 align:middle line:84%
Moody says that these
are probably as common

00:44:19.824 --> 00:44:22.259 align:middle line:90%
as the near death experience.

00:44:22.259 --> 00:44:26.497 align:middle line:84%
But people don't really want to
talk about them in the same way

00:44:26.497 --> 00:44:29.133 align:middle line:84%
that people never wanted to talk
about the near death experience

00:44:29.133 --> 00:44:30.968 align:middle line:90%
until Moody wrote about it.

00:44:30.968 --> 00:44:34.071 align:middle line:84%
I predict that we're
going to see, just a flood

00:44:34.071 --> 00:44:37.408 align:middle line:84%
of shared death experiences
arising in our culture

00:44:37.408 --> 00:44:40.377 align:middle line:84%
that people will talk about when
they become more comfortable

00:44:40.377 --> 00:44:41.746 align:middle line:90%
with the idea.

00:44:41.746 --> 00:44:44.715 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yes, when they feel
there's permission to do so.

00:44:44.715 --> 00:44:45.716 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: Yes.

00:44:45.716 --> 00:44:48.652 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: This reminds
me of going back

00:44:48.652 --> 00:44:50.387 align:middle line:90%
as far as much forward.

00:44:50.387 --> 00:44:53.557 align:middle line:84%
Years ago I love the
subject of hypnotherapy

00:44:53.557 --> 00:44:57.428 align:middle line:84%
and so I studied for-- well, you
know, it's usually a few months

00:44:57.428 --> 00:45:00.664 align:middle line:84%
and a few nights a week, you got
your certification but I find

00:45:00.664 --> 00:45:02.566 align:middle line:84%
that I already had a resonance
with it and could do it.

00:45:02.566 --> 00:45:05.736 align:middle line:84%
I didn't need the certification
or anything to do that.

00:45:05.736 --> 00:45:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And I would-- I really enjoyed
taking people into the past

00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:13.444 align:middle line:84%
and into future particularly
more so that any clinical stuff.

00:45:13.444 --> 00:45:18.649 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I found was that
it was not unusual once you were

00:45:18.649 --> 00:45:23.854 align:middle line:84%
in this guiding this person to
go where they needed to go to be

00:45:23.854 --> 00:45:28.559 align:middle line:84%
in their mind with them to see
the-- see the scene and be there

00:45:28.559 --> 00:45:31.061 align:middle line:84%
and fill it before
they would explain it.

00:45:31.061 --> 00:45:34.832 align:middle line:84%
And by the same token I
found that in that period

00:45:34.832 --> 00:45:39.170 align:middle line:84%
of time it became easy to access
people in their consciousness

00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:42.473 align:middle line:84%
and memories within the
days before their birth

00:45:42.473 --> 00:45:44.508 align:middle line:84%
and within the days
after their death.

00:45:44.508 --> 00:45:47.044 align:middle line:84%
And they could tell me
things that would turn out.

00:45:47.044 --> 00:45:48.245 align:middle line:90%
Where is the money Fred?

00:45:48.245 --> 00:45:48.946 align:middle line:90%
Where did you hide it?

00:45:48.946 --> 00:45:50.147 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: that's right.

00:45:50.147 --> 00:45:50.714 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: You know and
they tell you where it is.

00:45:50.714 --> 00:45:52.116 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: Yeah.

00:45:52.116 --> 00:45:53.751 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So this is something
that was really quite easy to do

00:45:53.751 --> 00:45:55.386 align:middle line:90%
and that anybody can do.

00:45:55.386 --> 00:45:56.787 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: Yes.

00:45:56.787 --> 00:45:59.356 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So there is no time
space boundary whether it's the

00:45:59.356 --> 00:46:01.158 align:middle line:90%
past present or future.

00:46:01.158 --> 00:46:03.527 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: You know that's a
hard lesson for humans to come

00:46:03.527 --> 00:46:05.563 align:middle line:90%
to grips with this idea

00:46:05.563 --> 00:46:08.499 align:middle line:84%
that time could flow
backwards carrying information

00:46:08.499 --> 00:46:12.002 align:middle line:84%
from the future into the present
which you might experience

00:46:12.002 --> 00:46:14.371 align:middle line:90%
as pre-cognition or premunition.

00:46:14.371 --> 00:46:20.044 align:middle line:84%
And I think that hypnosis gives
some profound insight into that.

00:46:20.044 --> 00:46:20.811 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:46:20.811 --> 00:46:21.812 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: Also dreams do.

00:46:21.812 --> 00:46:22.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Dreams, yes.

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:24.248 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: You know
when we're dreaming,

00:46:24.248 --> 00:46:29.119 align:middle line:84%
we don't erect these barriers
of logic which we experience

00:46:29.119 --> 00:46:31.522 align:middle line:84%
when we're awake which
saying this is nonsense.

00:46:31.522 --> 00:46:33.624 align:middle line:84%
This is impossible,
this couldn't happen.

00:46:33.624 --> 00:46:35.459 align:middle line:90%
In dreams, it's OK.

00:46:35.459 --> 00:46:36.694 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes, OK.

00:46:36.694 --> 00:46:38.395 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk-- now we talk little

00:46:38.395 --> 00:46:44.568 align:middle line:84%
about how animals have this pure
guile state where they can sense

00:46:44.568 --> 00:46:49.039 align:middle line:84%
where need is or they can
sense to follow where love is.

00:46:49.039 --> 00:46:52.576 align:middle line:84%
But the same existed for
us before we squashed it.

00:46:52.576 --> 00:46:53.511 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: Yes.

00:46:53.511 --> 00:46:55.145 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And one
of the stories

00:46:55.145 --> 00:46:56.981 align:middle line:84%
in your book I just
love has to do

00:46:56.981 --> 00:47:00.084 align:middle line:90%
with aboriginal smoke signals.

00:47:00.084 --> 00:47:02.086 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about these
phenomena 'cause it's

00:47:02.086 --> 00:47:03.654 align:middle line:90%
completely misunderstood.

00:47:03.654 --> 00:47:04.989 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: Oh absolutely.

00:47:04.989 --> 00:47:07.157 align:middle line:84%
There's quite a literature
about this.

00:47:07.157 --> 00:47:09.627 align:middle line:84%
A lot of it has to do
with not Native Americans

00:47:09.627 --> 00:47:10.828 align:middle line:90%
but native Australians.

00:47:10.828 --> 00:47:12.329 align:middle line:90%
They have aborigines.

00:47:12.329 --> 00:47:17.167 align:middle line:84%
And extensive work has been done
interviewing Native Americans.

00:47:17.167 --> 00:47:21.572 align:middle line:84%
This was usually done in
the early part of the 1900s

00:47:21.572 --> 00:47:25.609 align:middle line:84%
when not a lot was known
about aboriginal culture.

00:47:25.609 --> 00:47:28.913 align:middle line:84%
In any case White people
almost always believed

00:47:28.913 --> 00:47:33.817 align:middle line:84%
that there was some
code that was involved

00:47:33.817 --> 00:47:38.422 align:middle line:84%
with that smoke signals like,
you know, one puff is come here.

00:47:38.422 --> 00:47:39.623 align:middle line:90%
Two puffs I'll meet you there.

00:47:39.623 --> 00:47:41.091 align:middle line:90%
Something like they set--

00:47:41.091 --> 00:47:42.793 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Like Morse
code of some kind.

00:47:42.793 --> 00:47:46.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: Yes, like-- but the
aborigines continually insisted

00:47:46.130 --> 00:47:49.066 align:middle line:84%
that it was just an
attention getting device.

00:47:49.066 --> 00:47:54.305 align:middle line:84%
It was a way of alerting someone
who was out there, listen up.

00:47:54.305 --> 00:47:55.306 align:middle line:90%
Pay attention.

00:47:55.306 --> 00:47:57.574 align:middle line:84%
I have something I
want to tell you.

00:47:57.574 --> 00:48:02.513 align:middle line:84%
And the communication would go
not through the puffs of smoke

00:48:02.513 --> 00:48:05.382 align:middle line:84%
but through actual sending
of thoughts from one person

00:48:05.382 --> 00:48:07.251 align:middle line:90%
to another at a distance.

00:48:07.251 --> 00:48:13.791 align:middle line:84%
This is what we call telepathy
in-- in consciousness research.

00:48:13.791 --> 00:48:17.261 align:middle line:84%
But it's a hard lesson
for White folks to learn.

00:48:17.261 --> 00:48:17.895 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you know, time--

00:48:17.895 --> 00:48:19.263 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: It is.

00:48:19.263 --> 00:48:20.798 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: White
folk pioneers just never really

00:48:20.798 --> 00:48:21.899 align:middle line:90%
got it.

00:48:21.899 --> 00:48:25.336 align:middle line:84%
And it's an example I
think of the ability

00:48:25.336 --> 00:48:28.605 align:middle line:84%
of primitive pre-modern
cultures to accept this idea

00:48:28.605 --> 00:48:31.241 align:middle line:84%
of one minded communication
almost naturally.

00:48:31.241 --> 00:48:34.044 align:middle line:90%
They didn't struggle with it.

00:48:34.044 --> 00:48:35.946 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: There's
another story you had--

00:48:35.946 --> 00:48:37.381 align:middle line:84%
we have several things
to get through.

00:48:37.381 --> 00:48:39.516 align:middle line:84%
I want to get to the twins
'cause I love this part.

00:48:39.516 --> 00:48:42.419 align:middle line:84%
But just really briefly I don't
how you pronounce his name

00:48:42.419 --> 00:48:43.554 align:middle line:90%
whether it was Ikan

00:48:43.554 --> 00:48:46.724 align:middle line:90%
or Ikan the blind guide.

00:48:46.724 --> 00:48:50.961 align:middle line:84%
This is a fabulous story because
he was able to connect not just

00:48:50.961 --> 00:48:53.864 align:middle line:84%
with each other but through the
eyes of people who could see

00:48:53.864 --> 00:48:55.666 align:middle line:84%
and through the earth
speaking to him.

00:48:55.666 --> 00:48:59.069 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: Right, well this
is from the work of Gershan--

00:48:59.069 --> 00:49:03.874 align:middle line:84%
Douchan Gersi who was an
explorer, an adventurer

00:49:03.874 --> 00:49:06.543 align:middle line:90%
and a film maker who drove one--

00:49:06.543 --> 00:49:10.914 align:middle line:84%
on one occasion from North
Africa down to Timbuktu

00:49:10.914 --> 00:49:14.818 align:middle line:84%
which is several hundred miles
away across trackless waste.

00:49:14.818 --> 00:49:17.454 align:middle line:84%
He went-- before he started his
trip to a military commander

00:49:17.454 --> 00:49:20.858 align:middle line:84%
at the post and he said,
"Furnish me the guide.

00:49:20.858 --> 00:49:22.693 align:middle line:84%
I've got to have
an expert guide."

00:49:22.693 --> 00:49:26.597 align:middle line:84%
So he sends in ICAN and he says
oh there's one little problem

00:49:26.597 --> 00:49:27.698 align:middle line:90%
he's blind.

00:49:27.698 --> 00:49:28.999 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: That instills
confidence.

00:49:28.999 --> 00:49:30.601 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: He can't see.

00:49:30.601 --> 00:49:33.337 align:middle line:84%
So but he said he'll
get you there.

00:49:33.337 --> 00:49:34.672 align:middle line:90%
He's perfect.

00:49:34.672 --> 00:49:37.174 align:middle line:84%
Well this didn't make any sense
to Gersi but he went along

00:49:37.174 --> 00:49:41.612 align:middle line:84%
with it and as it turned out
this guy used other people minds

00:49:41.612 --> 00:49:45.616 align:middle line:84%
and vision to tell
him where to go.

00:49:45.616 --> 00:49:48.318 align:middle line:84%
And so Ikan would
tell Gersi and a set

00:49:48.318 --> 00:49:53.657 align:middle line:84%
of companions don't talk just
look around and just be quiet

00:49:53.657 --> 00:49:55.325 align:middle line:90%
and just witness things.

00:49:55.325 --> 00:49:57.828 align:middle line:84%
And so it was that he
could see through the eyes

00:49:57.828 --> 00:50:01.065 align:middle line:84%
and the consciousness
of the sided people.

00:50:01.065 --> 00:50:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And he got them there without
any hesitation or delay at all.

00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:09.339 align:middle line:84%
And he will also just simply
go out and sit in the desert

00:50:09.339 --> 00:50:13.477 align:middle line:84%
and smell things and sort of
just sense whatever he sense.

00:50:13.477 --> 00:50:15.145 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Where water was.

00:50:15.145 --> 00:50:16.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: He was-- where
water was and it was

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:21.919 align:middle line:84%
as if he was one big
human sensing machine.

00:50:21.919 --> 00:50:24.021 align:middle line:90%
And vision was only part of it.

00:50:24.021 --> 00:50:26.457 align:middle line:84%
I mean and he could do without
the vision because he was

00:50:26.457 --> 00:50:28.859 align:middle line:84%
so tuned in with
everything else.

00:50:28.859 --> 00:50:30.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Larry do you
think that's something

00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:32.129 align:middle line:84%
that any human being
if they choose

00:50:32.129 --> 00:50:34.431 align:middle line:90%
to can be trained back into?

00:50:34.431 --> 00:50:35.833 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: I think so.

00:50:35.833 --> 00:50:38.702 align:middle line:84%
When I was in Vietnam I saw this
all the time in kids who were

00:50:38.702 --> 00:50:42.339 align:middle line:84%
out on patrols, who simply knew
where to stay up and not to stay

00:50:42.339 --> 00:50:44.675 align:middle line:84%
up and where a sniper
was and whatnot.

00:50:44.675 --> 00:50:47.811 align:middle line:84%
This was a survival
oriented capacity.

00:50:47.811 --> 00:50:49.580 align:middle line:84%
Some of these kids,
you know, none of them

00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:51.281 align:middle line:84%
where into consciousness
nature research.

00:50:51.281 --> 00:50:52.082 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:50:52.082 --> 00:50:52.916 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: They didn't care.

00:50:52.916 --> 00:50:54.284 align:middle line:90%
They just wanted to stay alive.

00:50:54.284 --> 00:50:57.955 align:middle line:84%
And I'll never forget when one
of them told me once, "Doc,

00:50:57.955 --> 00:51:01.091 align:middle line:84%
you don't need to know
a long time ahead."

00:51:01.091 --> 00:51:03.460 align:middle line:84%
He says, "Sometimes
only a second

00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:06.363 align:middle line:84%
or two is enough
to save your life."

00:51:06.363 --> 00:51:08.765 align:middle line:84%
And many of these
young men would say

00:51:08.765 --> 00:51:11.802 align:middle line:84%
that they have some sense
that they can't explain.

00:51:11.802 --> 00:51:14.304 align:middle line:84%
That is reason they're
still alive.

00:51:14.304 --> 00:51:18.175 align:middle line:84%
You see this in every situation
where people's lives are

00:51:18.175 --> 00:51:20.711 align:middle line:90%
at stake such as in combat.

00:51:20.711 --> 00:51:21.712 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Absolutely.

00:51:21.712 --> 00:51:23.547 align:middle line:84%
Now we get to the
subject of twins.

00:51:23.547 --> 00:51:24.948 align:middle line:90%
You're a twin.

00:51:24.948 --> 00:51:27.417 align:middle line:84%
Did I read correctly, your
wife-- is your wife a twin?

00:51:27.417 --> 00:51:28.519 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: Yes.

00:51:28.519 --> 00:51:29.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: You're a
twin, your wife is twin.

00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:31.021 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: Yes, it
kinds of strange.

00:51:31.021 --> 00:51:34.491 align:middle line:84%
Our household has been sort of
a laboratory for strange, weird,

00:51:34.491 --> 00:51:36.894 align:middle line:84%
twin stuff for quite
a long time.

00:51:36.894 --> 00:51:38.228 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Well and you read

00:51:38.228 --> 00:51:40.397 align:middle line:84%
about some other strange twin
stuff where you're talking

00:51:40.397 --> 00:51:44.568 align:middle line:84%
about essentially, it's almost
like one being, one mind,

00:51:44.568 --> 00:51:48.071 align:middle line:84%
one being is occupying two
separate bodies completely.

00:51:48.071 --> 00:51:50.407 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about the Twin Jims.

00:51:50.407 --> 00:51:52.543 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: Well the
Twin Jims were part

00:51:52.543 --> 00:51:55.245 align:middle line:84%
of the Minnesota
Twin Study Program.

00:51:55.245 --> 00:51:59.416 align:middle line:84%
And they came together
late in life

00:51:59.416 --> 00:52:03.020 align:middle line:84%
after having been separated
shortly after birth and raised

00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:06.323 align:middle line:84%
in different homes and
different environments but later

00:52:06.323 --> 00:52:09.660 align:middle line:84%
in their 40s when they
came together they found

00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:12.896 align:middle line:84%
out that they had lived
almost identical lives.

00:52:12.896 --> 00:52:15.365 align:middle line:84%
They married women
of the same name.

00:52:15.365 --> 00:52:18.468 align:middle line:84%
They named their first
born son as the same name.

00:52:18.468 --> 00:52:21.238 align:middle line:84%
They had a dog they
named the same thing.

00:52:21.238 --> 00:52:25.209 align:middle line:84%
They had vacationed at the
same area on the Gulf Cost

00:52:25.209 --> 00:52:29.346 align:middle line:84%
about just a few blocks from
one another not knowing it.

00:52:29.346 --> 00:52:32.583 align:middle line:84%
Anybody looking at this
stuff would say this is

00:52:32.583 --> 00:52:33.684 align:middle line:90%
absolutely weird.

00:52:33.684 --> 00:52:35.586 align:middle line:90%
How do you explain this?

00:52:35.586 --> 00:52:40.657 align:middle line:84%
Well the researcher said
this is all genetic stuff.

00:52:40.657 --> 00:52:42.793 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
just too easy on answer

00:52:42.793 --> 00:52:48.098 align:middle line:84%
because nobody has a clue
about how genes would code

00:52:48.098 --> 00:52:52.135 align:middle line:84%
in two different individuals
with respect to wives

00:52:52.135 --> 00:52:54.638 align:middle line:84%
who are named the same,
children who are named the same.

00:52:54.638 --> 00:52:56.206 align:middle line:90%
Dogs who are named the same.

00:52:56.206 --> 00:52:57.507 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Similar
personalities,

00:52:57.507 --> 00:53:00.544 align:middle line:84%
virtually identical
ticks and propensities.

00:53:00.544 --> 00:53:01.979 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: It could be.

00:53:01.979 --> 00:53:03.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:06.183 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: Actually, but there's
an associated body of evidence

00:53:06.183 --> 00:53:10.053 align:middle line:84%
which makes me very dubious
about a genetic explanation--

00:53:10.053 --> 00:53:10.988 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Absolutely.

00:53:10.988 --> 00:53:11.655 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: -- for
all these stuff.

00:53:11.655 --> 00:53:12.656 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: There has

00:53:12.656 --> 00:53:13.991 align:middle line:84%
to be something greater
in effect there.

00:53:13.991 --> 00:53:16.893 align:middle line:84%
And when they finally met
each other they fell in love.

00:53:16.893 --> 00:53:18.095 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: They did.

00:53:18.095 --> 00:53:20.897 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: For the first
time they knew themselves.

00:53:20.897 --> 00:53:21.999 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: Well they felt

00:53:21.999 --> 00:53:23.500 align:middle line:84%
as if their whole life
had been transformed

00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:25.269 align:middle line:90%
by this reconnection.

00:53:25.269 --> 00:53:28.906 align:middle line:84%
And this gets back to what
were talking about earlier

00:53:28.906 --> 00:53:32.876 align:middle line:84%
about perhaps the
thread of compassion

00:53:32.876 --> 00:53:36.013 align:middle line:84%
and love was the thing that
helped their minds unit

00:53:36.013 --> 00:53:39.516 align:middle line:84%
and prepare them for
these identical behaviors.

00:53:39.516 --> 00:53:41.818 align:middle line:90%
Can I mention one other example?

00:53:41.818 --> 00:53:42.753 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes, absolutely.

00:53:42.753 --> 00:53:44.321 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: That supports
this idea.

00:53:44.321 --> 00:53:46.523 align:middle line:84%
This had to do with
identical twin girls

00:53:46.523 --> 00:53:50.227 align:middle line:84%
who were four years old
in Spain in the 1970s

00:53:50.227 --> 00:53:51.261 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Is this
Sylvia and Martha?

00:53:51.261 --> 00:53:52.596 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: This is
Sylvia and Martha.

00:53:52.596 --> 00:53:53.864 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: That's
what I was going

00:53:53.864 --> 00:53:55.098 align:middle line:90%
to bring up and I so love it.

00:53:55.098 --> 00:53:55.766 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: That s right.

00:53:55.766 --> 00:53:56.967 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:53:56.967 --> 00:53:57.668 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: Well we're the
same-- same mind here.

00:53:57.668 --> 00:53:59.002 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Here we are.

00:53:59.002 --> 00:54:00.737 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: So the father took
Sylvia, this four little--

00:54:00.737 --> 00:54:03.473 align:middle line:84%
four year old girl, off
to visit the grandparents

00:54:03.473 --> 00:54:06.276 align:middle line:84%
who were ten miles--
tens of miles away.

00:54:06.276 --> 00:54:09.780 align:middle line:84%
Martha stayed home to help
her mom with household chores.

00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:13.617 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, Martha touched
a red hot iron and erupted

00:54:13.617 --> 00:54:16.420 align:middle line:90%
with a large second degree burn,

00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:19.890 align:middle line:84%
a huge blister on
her right hand.

00:54:19.890 --> 00:54:22.959 align:middle line:84%
At the same time it
was determined tens

00:54:22.959 --> 00:54:26.163 align:middle line:84%
of miles away her
twin sister erupted

00:54:26.163 --> 00:54:30.867 align:middle line:84%
with an identical blister on the
same hand and the same pattern.

00:54:30.867 --> 00:54:32.669 align:middle line:84%
I don't see how you
get that out of genes.

00:54:32.669 --> 00:54:33.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Exactly.

00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:35.005 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: I mean I just
don't think that's a

00:54:35.005 --> 00:54:36.640 align:middle line:90%
proper explanation.

00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:41.978 align:middle line:84%
Something else is going on that
unites people at a distance.

00:54:41.978 --> 00:54:44.915 align:middle line:84%
You see it in full
volume in identical twins

00:54:44.915 --> 00:54:47.317 align:middle line:84%
who had a heart connection
with one another.

00:54:47.317 --> 00:54:50.053 align:middle line:84%
But you see it in other people
who were fundamentally bonded

00:54:50.053 --> 00:54:57.761 align:middle line:84%
like a mother and a child or
lovers or siblings and so on.

00:54:57.761 --> 00:54:59.463 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yeah, this
is just to the extreme.

00:54:59.463 --> 00:55:02.232 align:middle line:84%
And again that could bring up
a lot of others spooky kinds

00:55:02.232 --> 00:55:05.836 align:middle line:84%
of subjects like maybe living
literally, an entity living

00:55:05.836 --> 00:55:08.572 align:middle line:84%
in two realities at the
same times simultaneously

00:55:08.572 --> 00:55:09.906 align:middle line:90%
or any number of things.

00:55:09.906 --> 00:55:12.209 align:middle line:84%
But the point is that it all
goes back to non-local mind.

00:55:12.209 --> 00:55:13.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: I believe it does.

00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:15.979 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And now we only
have about five minutes left

00:55:15.979 --> 00:55:20.550 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to get into
more the instructional part

00:55:20.550 --> 00:55:24.287 align:middle line:84%
about how we access this because
there are two keywords here

00:55:24.287 --> 00:55:25.756 align:middle line:84%
and I'd like you
to expand on it.

00:55:25.756 --> 00:55:28.892 align:middle line:84%
And one has to do
with creativity,

00:55:28.892 --> 00:55:30.794 align:middle line:90%
the field of creation.

00:55:30.794 --> 00:55:33.263 align:middle line:84%
And of course the
final one is love.

00:55:33.263 --> 00:55:34.831 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: Yes.

00:55:34.831 --> 00:55:37.567 align:middle line:84%
Well I think for
starters, it's a mistake

00:55:37.567 --> 00:55:40.971 align:middle line:90%
to try too hard to access it.

00:55:40.971 --> 00:55:43.473 align:middle line:84%
You know, all that's actually
said there is something he

00:55:43.473 --> 00:55:47.244 align:middle line:84%
called a law of reverse
effort that operates in this

00:55:47.244 --> 00:55:48.779 align:middle line:84%
which it's just the
way of saying

00:55:48.779 --> 00:55:52.616 align:middle line:84%
that the harder you try the
more you're going to fail.

00:55:52.616 --> 00:55:58.889 align:middle line:84%
And the key recognition is
that were already connected.

00:55:58.889 --> 00:56:01.258 align:middle line:84%
And so this is not something
you'd have to manipulate

00:56:01.258 --> 00:56:03.894 align:middle line:84%
and control as if
you could anyway.

00:56:03.894 --> 00:56:06.997 align:middle line:84%
It's just a manifestation
of who we are.

00:56:06.997 --> 00:56:12.169 align:middle line:84%
And if we learn to sit down,
be quiet, and stop the chatter,

00:56:12.169 --> 00:56:15.405 align:middle line:84%
most people find that they
can live into an awareness

00:56:15.405 --> 00:56:16.440 align:middle line:90%
of their connectedness

00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:18.975 align:middle line:84%
with other things
and other creatures.

00:56:18.975 --> 00:56:22.746 align:middle line:84%
So although there are ways that
had been recommended about how

00:56:22.746 --> 00:56:26.116 align:middle line:84%
to access this state, we always
have to keep that in mind.

00:56:26.116 --> 00:56:28.084 align:middle line:84%
You know you can
make this happen.

00:56:28.084 --> 00:56:31.254 align:middle line:84%
It's like we talked about
on premonitions once.

00:56:31.254 --> 00:56:33.256 align:middle line:90%
It sort of does you.

00:56:33.256 --> 00:56:35.091 align:middle line:90%
You know you don't do me up.

00:56:35.091 --> 00:56:37.427 align:middle line:84%
But what we need to
do is to find a way

00:56:37.427 --> 00:56:41.331 align:middle line:84%
of inviting this recognition
of unity and oneness

00:56:41.331 --> 00:56:45.435 align:middle line:84%
into our life not that
we can make it happen.

00:56:45.435 --> 00:56:47.604 align:middle line:84%
And so throughout history
there are time-honored ways

00:56:47.604 --> 00:56:48.972 align:middle line:90%
of doing this.

00:56:48.972 --> 00:56:52.609 align:middle line:84%
One of the great ways is just
meditation whether you call

00:56:52.609 --> 00:56:56.913 align:middle line:84%
that contemplation or just
getting quiet or doing nothing.

00:56:56.913 --> 00:57:00.984 align:middle line:84%
All of these methods have a way
of quieting the conscious mind

00:57:00.984 --> 00:57:04.821 align:middle line:84%
so that a deeper way of knowing
and understanding can percolate

00:57:04.821 --> 00:57:07.791 align:middle line:84%
up from their own conscious
and this play itself

00:57:07.791 --> 00:57:09.793 align:middle line:90%
to our conscious awareness.

00:57:09.793 --> 00:57:16.066 align:middle line:84%
There are other ways that have
traditionally been described.

00:57:16.066 --> 00:57:19.336 align:middle line:84%
Many people find that
exposure to nature is a way

00:57:19.336 --> 00:57:25.675 align:middle line:84%
of quieting the aware mind
and listening to classical,

00:57:25.675 --> 00:57:29.646 align:middle line:84%
great music or any kind
of music for that matter.

00:57:29.646 --> 00:57:35.385 align:middle line:84%
Viewing great art in museums
is often described as a way

00:57:35.385 --> 00:57:39.723 align:middle line:84%
of having an epiphany that
helps you understand the reality

00:57:39.723 --> 00:57:41.858 align:middle line:90%
of the unity and oneness.

00:57:41.858 --> 00:57:42.926 align:middle line:90%
Some of these things are

00:57:42.926 --> 00:57:45.562 align:middle line:84%
so ordinary they
are almost comical.

00:57:45.562 --> 00:57:48.098 align:middle line:84%
I have a friend who said that
he had his great awakening

00:57:48.098 --> 00:57:51.468 align:middle line:84%
to the oneness of all things
when one morning he woke up

00:57:51.468 --> 00:57:52.702 align:middle line:90%
and was sitting on the side

00:57:52.702 --> 00:57:55.672 align:middle line:84%
of his bed picking
lint from his navel.

00:57:55.672 --> 00:57:57.274 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Literally?

00:57:57.274 --> 00:57:58.608 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: Literally.

00:57:58.608 --> 00:58:02.746 align:middle line:84%
So I don't recommend this
technique but it's part of the--

00:58:02.746 --> 00:58:05.081 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yes, I mean each
person has an access point.

00:58:05.081 --> 00:58:07.517 align:middle line:84%
Some people have that when
they're taking showers.

00:58:07.517 --> 00:58:09.920 align:middle line:90%
Water seems to be a great mover.

00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:13.123 align:middle line:84%
Another friend of mine whose
high intuitive has her visions

00:58:13.123 --> 00:58:14.224 align:middle line:90%
while she's washing dishes

00:58:14.224 --> 00:58:15.892 align:middle line:84%
with the water running
over her hands.

00:58:15.892 --> 00:58:20.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's just kind of a mind
numbing, blank type of chore.

00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:23.967 align:middle line:84%
But something in that allows the
visions to come through clearly.

00:58:23.967 --> 00:58:25.101 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: Absolutely.

00:58:25.101 --> 00:58:29.172 align:middle line:84%
And as to creativity
the science literature--

00:58:29.172 --> 00:58:33.343 align:middle line:84%
Literature of Discovery
is full of great scientist

00:58:33.343 --> 00:58:36.012 align:middle line:84%
who had their epiphanies
and awakenings

00:58:36.012 --> 00:58:41.618 align:middle line:84%
of the breakthrough while they
were dreaming or during reverie.

00:58:41.618 --> 00:58:44.554 align:middle line:84%
One of the great examples is
Kekule who was sitting in front

00:58:44.554 --> 00:58:48.992 align:middle line:84%
of a fire and was dosing
and he saw the structure

00:58:48.992 --> 00:58:51.795 align:middle line:84%
of the Benzene molecule which
he had not been able to figure

00:58:51.795 --> 00:58:56.299 align:middle line:84%
out because in his dream or
his reverie he saw snake--

00:58:56.299 --> 00:59:00.470 align:middle line:84%
a snake with its tail it
its mouth and discovered

00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:04.407 align:middle line:84%
through this revelation
that the structure was a--

00:59:04.407 --> 00:59:06.142 align:middle line:90%
was a ring compound.

00:59:06.142 --> 00:59:10.814 align:middle line:84%
It totally kick started the
science of organic chemistry.

00:59:10.814 --> 00:59:12.616 align:middle line:90%
We could make a long list of--

00:59:12.616 --> 00:59:13.383 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:59:13.383 --> 00:59:14.718 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: So that's our--

00:59:14.718 --> 00:59:15.685 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: There been books
written on that exact thing.

00:59:15.685 --> 00:59:16.286 align:middle line:90%
>> Dossey: There have.

00:59:16.286 --> 00:59:17.687 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:59:17.687 --> 00:59:18.955 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: And-- and one of the
threads that runs through all

00:59:18.955 --> 00:59:22.592 align:middle line:84%
of those things that most
great inventors come back

00:59:22.592 --> 00:59:25.295 align:middle line:84%
with its realization that
everything is connected.

00:59:25.295 --> 00:59:29.499 align:middle line:84%
It's all one and
discovery lies in partially

00:59:29.499 --> 00:59:31.801 align:middle line:84%
in apprehending this
universal truth.

00:59:31.801 --> 00:59:33.103 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:59:33.103 --> 00:59:36.439 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: Thomas Edison who
most people considered one

00:59:36.439 --> 00:59:39.542 align:middle line:84%
of the premier inventors
in human history said

00:59:39.542 --> 00:59:42.312 align:middle line:84%
that he'd never created
anything,

00:59:42.312 --> 00:59:43.680 align:middle line:90%
never created anything.

00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:46.316 align:middle line:84%
This is a man who most of us
think created a lot of stuff.

00:59:46.316 --> 00:59:49.185 align:middle line:84%
He said he gets his
ideas from the universe.

00:59:49.185 --> 00:59:53.056 align:middle line:84%
He says thoughts come
to me from the outside.

00:59:53.056 --> 00:59:54.391 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Absolutely.

00:59:54.391 --> 00:59:56.092 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: Well I think that
the one mind provides a pool

00:59:56.092 --> 00:59:59.529 align:middle line:84%
of information which creative
people learn how to tap.

00:59:59.529 --> 01:00:02.832 align:middle line:84%
And this is manifested as
creativity and invention.

01:00:02.832 --> 01:00:05.402 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And it
is our birthright.

01:00:05.402 --> 01:00:07.637 align:middle line:84%
And as you say probably one
of the simplest meditations

01:00:07.637 --> 01:00:11.441 align:middle line:84%
for accessing is just choosing
to be in that resonance of love,

01:00:11.441 --> 01:00:14.377 align:middle line:84%
quietly, and allow whatever
percolates to percolate.

01:00:14.377 --> 01:00:16.146 align:middle line:84%
>> Dossey: And I think
that's a beautiful wikipedia.

01:00:16.146 --> 01:00:17.914 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And Larry you told
me I was the first journalist

01:00:17.914 --> 01:00:19.716 align:middle line:84%

your book.

01:00:19.716 --> 01:00:20.650 align:middle line:90%
