00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:23.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
If you're like me,

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.940 align:middle line:84%
you become incensed when
you see someone littering.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.760 align:middle line:10%
Yet, we often turn a blind
eye to where our old tires go

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.670 align:middle line:10%
after a tire change, where
our water bottles end up

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.230 align:middle line:10%
when we recycle, and so forth.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.270 align:middle line:90%
But Mike Reynolds does not.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.240 align:middle line:84%
He spent decades taking our
garbage and building homes

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.340 align:middle line:84%
with it, both here
and in disaster zones

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.300 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.940 align:middle line:84%
This is truly an
inspiring story.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And not only inspiring,
Mike, it's a story, to me,

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.460 align:middle line:84%
above everything
else, of beauty.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.470 align:middle line:84%
Even the simplest
forms you build, to me,

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.470 align:middle line:84%
are more beautiful than most of
the architecture we see around

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.850 align:middle line:90%
us in this world.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.040 align:middle line:84%
And not only that,
spiritual beauty as well,

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.610 align:middle line:84%
and I'm hoping we can get into
that part of the discussion

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.350 align:middle line:84%
before we even launch
into the trials

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.760 align:middle line:84%
and tribulations
of being a creative

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.270 align:middle line:84%
in a non-creative world,
for the most part.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.930 align:middle line:84%
So welcome, and maybe tell us
what your original inspiration

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.250 align:middle line:90%
was, because you are a poet.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.750 align:middle line:90%
You're a visionary.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.230 align:middle line:84%
You dream a lot of these
edifices into reality.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.730 align:middle line:84%
Where did all of
this come from that

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.810 align:middle line:84%
sent you down the road
as an architecture

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.010 align:middle line:90%
to building bubbles for housing?

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.000 align:middle line:10%
>>MIKE REYNOLDS:
Well, I think, right

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.680 align:middle line:10%
after architectural school,
I came to Taos, New Mexico,

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.730 align:middle line:10%
which was a beautiful place.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:35.970 align:middle line:90%
And I came from the Midwest.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.170 align:middle line:84%
So in Taos, New Mexico,
there was mountains and mesas

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.950 align:middle line:84%
and snow and desert,
and it was just way

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.180 align:middle line:90%
different than the Midwest.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
set me up mentally

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.860 align:middle line:84%
or emotionally to
feel things, I guess.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:05.300 align:middle line:10%
And the things I felt became
guiding visions or whatever

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:12.470 align:middle line:10%
to my future, and I think that's
what put me in the position

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.090 align:middle line:10%
to be doing what I'm doing now.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the space
itself allowed your mind

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.445 align:middle line:84%
to expand into all of these
concepts in a new way.

00:02:19.445 --> 00:02:23.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REYNOLDS: Yeah, I think
what happens to people

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.760 align:middle line:84%
is if you can empty
your mind, really

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.080 align:middle line:84%
amazing existing stuff
in the universe comes in.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
all there is to it.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.020 align:middle line:90%
It's out there.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.300 align:middle line:90%
All the information is there.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.880 align:middle line:84%
You just have to
get in a situation

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.840 align:middle line:84%
where you're empty
enough to receive it,

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.390 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's
what happened.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.850 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Your wife, when you
see her in the documentary,

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.580 align:middle line:10%
sometimes she seems like
she's a long suffering woman.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.970 align:middle line:84%
She said, oh my god,
he's gone quiet again.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.930 align:middle line:84%
That means we've got
something brewing.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And how did her life and her
ideals fit in with your ideals

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.596 align:middle line:84%
throughout all these
many years of creativity?

00:03:03.596 --> 00:03:07.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REYNOLDS: Well, she,
basically, put up with it.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.100 align:middle line:90%
But she's very creative, too.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think she may not always
agree with the intensity

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.340 align:middle line:84%
that I will go after
things, but she

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.320 align:middle line:84%
agrees that the direction
is a valid direction.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And she's there in
spirit with a lot of it

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.585 align:middle line:84%
and there physically
with a lot of it.

00:03:29.585 --> 00:03:31.304 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And for
those people who

00:03:31.304 --> 00:03:32.720 align:middle line:84%
want to go further
into your work,

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.020 align:middle line:84%
you also wrote a book called,
"A Coming of Wizards."

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.140 align:middle line:10%
>>REYNOLDS: The book,
"A Coming of Wizards,"

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:46.520 align:middle line:10%
is a book that came to
me in terms of a vision,

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:52.870 align:middle line:10%
I guess you would say, after
I got free in New Mexico.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.470 align:middle line:84%
It was just overwhelming how
free it seemed out there.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.380 align:middle line:84%
And then it made it
so I could receive

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.140 align:middle line:90%
what is out there anyway.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.210 align:middle line:84%
And so that's how I ended
up writing this book,

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:09.610 align:middle line:90%
"A Coming of Wizards."

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.110 align:middle line:84%
And I actually go back
and look at it today,

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.390 align:middle line:84%
and the things that
were said in there

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:22.340 align:middle line:84%
still guide me today about
the pragmatic application

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.480 align:middle line:90%
of this kind of thinking.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.600 align:middle line:90%


00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.570 align:middle line:90%
There was an actual incident.

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.810 align:middle line:84%
I talk about it
sometimes, but I don't

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.890 align:middle line:84%
like to get too
woo-woo with any of it.

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:42.500 align:middle line:84%
I want it to be very pragmatic,
so people can accept it.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.010 align:middle line:84%
But it was a dream,
vision type thing.

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.630 align:middle line:84%
And I was into pyramids and
am into pyramids, in terms of,

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.760 align:middle line:84%
there is something going
on with the pyramids.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.470 align:middle line:84%
Look all over the
planet, there are

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.390 align:middle line:90%
pyramids all over the planet.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.610 align:middle line:84%
So there was a
reason for building

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.820 align:middle line:84%
these things, specifically
aligned and magnetically

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.750 align:middle line:84%
aligned, and they involved
crystal and a lot of things.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.610 align:middle line:90%
So I experimented with them.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.010 align:middle line:84%
I had a bed in the
King's Chamber level

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.260 align:middle line:84%
of a perfectly
proportioned pyramid.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.340 align:middle line:90%
I slept in it.

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.720 align:middle line:90%
I spent a lot of time there.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.985 align:middle line:90%
I had a dream there.

00:05:15.985 --> 00:05:20.990 align:middle line:84%
The dream was the impetus
of "A Coming of Wizards"

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:26.840 align:middle line:84%
book that turned me
on to thinking, that

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.920 align:middle line:84%
allowed me to get
away and look back

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.170 align:middle line:90%
at where we are on this planet.

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And it caused me to want to
take a very pragmatic approach

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:43.010 align:middle line:84%
to trying to make that happen
in a way that wasn't just words

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.960 align:middle line:90%
and magic and spiritual talk.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.750 align:middle line:84%
I took it to a very
pragmatic level,

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.640 align:middle line:84%
and that's how the
earthship itself,

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.000 align:middle line:84%
as a building concept, a
sustainable building concept,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.980 align:middle line:90%
came about.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, years
ago, many, many years ago,

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.217 align:middle line:84%
I saw a movie called
"Slaughterhouse-Five."

00:06:02.217 --> 00:06:03.800 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
remember that one.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.883 align:middle line:90%
>>REYNOLDS: Vaguely, yeah.

00:06:04.883 --> 00:06:08.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Anyway, he ends up
in this alternate world of his,

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.070 align:middle line:90%
living in a bubble in space.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And that became my
ideal for a home.

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.620 align:middle line:84%
Living in, literally,
a Plexiglas bubble

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.230 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of a redwood
forest with some light pouring

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.210 align:middle line:90%
in would be my ideal structure.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.390 align:middle line:84%
But anything that I
have been in in my life,

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.030 align:middle line:84%
right down to the home I
own in Sedona right now,

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.360 align:middle line:84%
the notion of these
rounded spaces

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.240 align:middle line:84%
creates a completely different
experience and potential.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.340 align:middle line:90%
Can you talk about that?

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.815 align:middle line:84%
Because your structures
are all rounded and domed.

00:06:37.815 --> 00:06:43.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REYNOLDS: Well, I think
what we're looking at,

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:46.130 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what we call
biotecture-- we don't even

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:48.380 align:middle line:84%
call it architecture anymore,
because I don't really

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:53.270 align:middle line:84%
agree that architecture is
addressing our current needs,

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.940 align:middle line:84%
physically or emotionally
or spiritually

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:56.970 align:middle line:90%
or in any other way.

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:04.130 align:middle line:84%
But we're really trying to
give ourselves the opportunity

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:08.990 align:middle line:84%
and make people have the
opportunity to feel the earth,

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.790 align:middle line:90%
to be--

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:11.870 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that they
are part of the earth.

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:14.240 align:middle line:84%
If we recognize we're
part of the earth,

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.500 align:middle line:84%
then we're not
going to destroy it.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.860 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it's
like, my hand is out here,

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.680 align:middle line:90%
so maybe I'm not aware of it.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.580 align:middle line:84%
But really, if I'm
not aware of my hand,

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:33.530 align:middle line:84%
I can have it be damaged
and not even know it.

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:34.930 align:middle line:90%
The earth is an extension of us.

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:36.970 align:middle line:84%
We're an extension
of the earth, really.

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And if we can make the dwelling
spaces, the sustainable vessels

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:51.530 align:middle line:84%
that people live in, keep them
aware of the entire physique

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:55.160 align:middle line:84%
of the earth, then
we won't be trying

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.440 align:middle line:90%
to beg people to not destroy it.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.110 align:middle line:84%
They'll naturally treat it
like they treat their own body.

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:03.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Truly, and when
it comes to architecture,

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:06.200 align:middle line:84%
seems like, certainly,
in modern history,

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:10.340 align:middle line:84%
relatively modern history,
the last 1,000 years or so--

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:13.160 align:middle line:84%
granted, there have been some
beautiful Gothic constructions

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.530 align:middle line:84%
and such, where
this arched energy

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:16.980 align:middle line:90%
is taken into consideration.

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:21.380 align:middle line:84%
But by and large, people have
constructed boxes to live in.

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:23.120 align:middle line:90%
This isn't how nature works.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:27.560 align:middle line:84%
There are very few examples
of boxes in nature, right?

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REYNOLDS: Right.

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:34.669 align:middle line:84%
I think the box architecture
that we are experiencing now

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:40.280 align:middle line:84%
is a direct result
of the box thinking.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:44.280 align:middle line:84%
We are kind of in a box as
far as our thinking goes

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.370 align:middle line:84%
and as far as our feeling
goes, and we don't really

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:48.170 align:middle line:90%
get out of it.

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:50.447 align:middle line:84%
So naturally, the
things we build

00:08:50.447 --> 00:08:51.530 align:middle line:90%
are going to reflect that.

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:55.230 align:middle line:90%


00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:58.640 align:middle line:84%
I've tried to change it,
evolve it, and everything.

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.940 align:middle line:84%
But now, I'm into
another phase of it,

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:05.280 align:middle line:84%
in terms of just
trying to transcend it,

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.455 align:middle line:90%
because it's there in cities.

00:09:07.455 --> 00:09:09.410 align:middle line:90%
And it's all over the world.

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:13.160 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to change
that, but you can transcend it.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
important, because we're

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:22.000 align:middle line:84%
on a planet that is not really
doing too well with this.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And the result is, we are
going to be left alone,

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:28.250 align:middle line:90%
not the planet.

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:29.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:33.750 align:middle line:10%
One of the people I've admired
historically in modern times

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:35.610 align:middle line:10%
is Rudolf Steiner,
on a lot of levels.

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.990 align:middle line:10%
And one of them was his notion
of space and architecture

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:42.090 align:middle line:10%
and the lack of use
of right angles,

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:44.390 align:middle line:10%
if it could at all be avoided.

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of
the things people

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:48.650 align:middle line:84%
have found interesting
about his work,

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:50.510 align:middle line:84%
like his original
Goetheanum, which

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:53.180 align:middle line:84%
was two interlocking
domes, is that you

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:55.160 align:middle line:90%
can't see the means of support.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.500 align:middle line:84%
Is it simply that it's
so much more difficult

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.150 align:middle line:90%
to build a domed space?

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:04.616 align:middle line:84%
Is that why we're in this
functional boxed reality?

00:10:04.616 --> 00:10:08.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REYNOLDS: Well, our
world, in my opinion,

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:12.460 align:middle line:90%
is run on economics these days.

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:15.580 align:middle line:84%
Economy, money is
almost like God,

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:19.480 align:middle line:90%
and that controls everything.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.880 align:middle line:84%
You can't have water,
power, sewage, food,

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.380 align:middle line:84%
shelter without going
through money to get to it.

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:30.640 align:middle line:84%
And that ends up governing our
thinking and our architecture,

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:34.600 align:middle line:84%
and so it is an
expression of that.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think, in nature, nature
has nothing to do with money.

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:41.300 align:middle line:84%
Trees don't have
to buy anything.

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:45.250 align:middle line:84%
They simply grow out of
and are part of nature.

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And if we could do that,
I'm sure our architecture

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.120 align:middle line:90%
would change.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:52.090 align:middle line:84%
Our architecture that
we call biotecture

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:59.300 align:middle line:84%
now is organically
expressing this thinking.

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
will be in the future

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:08.795 align:middle line:84%
if we can somehow transcend
this place that we're in now.

00:11:08.795 --> 00:11:10.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
call them earthships.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:11.503 align:middle line:90%
Your homes are earthships.

00:11:11.503 --> 00:11:13.591 align:middle line:84%
You've been doing this
for over 30 years, right?

00:11:13.591 --> 00:11:15.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REYNOLDS: Over
40 years, actually.

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:16.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Over 40 years.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And all of these structures
are domed in nature.

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:22.660 align:middle line:84%
When I see it, it
just lifts my heart

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:25.270 align:middle line:84%
to see these structures,
even the simplest, most

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:28.984 align:middle line:84%
rudimentary ones, because you
can feel your way into that

00:11:28.984 --> 00:11:30.900 align:middle line:84%
and what it would be
like to be in that space.

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:34.440 align:middle line:90%


00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.370 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned in the
open of the show

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:38.920 align:middle line:84%
that you're really fond
of using things that

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.380 align:middle line:90%
are difficult to dispose of.

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:44.890 align:middle line:84%
You can look at the stench
of a burning pile of rubber,

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:49.060 align:middle line:84%
or you can do what you do with
them in the case of old tires.

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And we'll have some visuals here
to look at, taking old tires

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:55.310 align:middle line:84%
and packing them with
mud and there you begin.

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:57.100 align:middle line:10%
Let's talk about
the original homes

00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:00.430 align:middle line:10%
you built and also using
beer cans to build bricks.

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:02.855 align:middle line:84%
These dwellings, actually,
for the most part, last, too,

00:12:02.855 --> 00:12:03.655 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:12:03.655 --> 00:12:06.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REYNOLDS: Yes, they
last very well there.

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:10.310 align:middle line:84%
I started this as,
I have to admit,

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:13.780 align:middle line:84%
a contrived effort to
recycle, because there were so

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.930 align:middle line:84%
many tires and cans and
bottles and things around.

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:18.970 align:middle line:10%
But now, after doing
it for 40 years,

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:20.680 align:middle line:10%
I really don't know
of a better way

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:24.250 align:middle line:10%
to build, in terms of
longevity of the materials,

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:27.580 align:middle line:10%
because bottles and cans and
tires are made very well.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.890 align:middle line:10%
But here's the most
important thing.

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:34.510 align:middle line:10%
These materials are indigenous
to the entire planet.

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:35.800 align:middle line:90%
I've been all over the world.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.430 align:middle line:84%
Every country has got
cans, tires, and bottles.

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:41.840 align:middle line:84%
They're right at arm's
reach for us to use.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:44.650 align:middle line:84%
And if you came here
from another planet,

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:46.970 align:middle line:84%
you would look at them
as, they grow here.

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:49.090 align:middle line:84%
They're natural
products of this planet.

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:52.690 align:middle line:84%
So I don't look at them
as garbage anymore.

00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:57.130 align:middle line:84%
I don't even use the
word garbage in my mind,

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:59.000 align:middle line:84%
because there's no
such thing as it.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.420 align:middle line:84%
We invented the
concept of garbage,

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:04.280 align:middle line:84%
because we don't know what to
do with a lot of our byproducts.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:08.140 align:middle line:84%
But to me, tires, cans,
bottles are natural resources

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:12.200 align:middle line:84%
of this planet that are
very useful in building

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.890 align:middle line:84%
our sustainable
vessels of the future.

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:16.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about that.

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:20.156 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about how you do
get this lovely domed effect.

00:13:20.156 --> 00:13:23.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REYNOLDS: Well,
they're sculpted.

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:25.200 align:middle line:90%
A lot of them are very sculpted.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.330 align:middle line:90%
We are getting into more--

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:34.840 align:middle line:84%
not hard rectangles, but shapes
that help them be affordable.

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.390 align:middle line:84%
They're not all
domed, but the thing

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:39.265 align:middle line:90%
is, the thinking is organic.

00:13:39.265 --> 00:13:42.295 align:middle line:90%


00:13:42.295 --> 00:13:46.690 align:middle line:84%
We've come up with a definition
of what we're trying to do,

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:49.030 align:middle line:90%
in terms of people.

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And every person, every village,
every city, every country,

00:13:54.210 --> 00:14:00.080 align:middle line:84%
the people have to be able
to address six issues.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is
comfortable shelter

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:04.280 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't use fossil fuels.

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:05.860 align:middle line:90%
One of them is electricity.

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:06.850 align:middle line:90%
One of them is water.

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:08.350 align:middle line:90%
One of them is food.

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:10.970 align:middle line:84%
One of them is what
to do with sewage.

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is what
to do with this thing we

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:14.110 align:middle line:90%
call garbage.

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:19.280 align:middle line:84%
Every country, city has to
address these six things.

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:22.990 align:middle line:84%
So in our process of making
every single building address

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:27.070 align:middle line:84%
those six things, it ends
up being organic looking,

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:30.550 align:middle line:84%
and it's not just
addressing economy.

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:34.540 align:middle line:84%
It's addressing the six things
that humans need for sustenance

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:35.340 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:38.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the buildings, the
way you've moved them forward

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:42.370 align:middle line:84%
over the years, are essentially
complete ecosystems,

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:45.130 align:middle line:84%
self-sustaining
ecosystems, to the point

00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:48.700 align:middle line:84%
where you can grow your herbs
and vegetables and foods,

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:53.290 align:middle line:84%
and even have a fish
pond for your own tilapia

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:54.910 align:middle line:90%
right there in your home.

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:58.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REYNOLDS: Yeah, I
think that's the thing.

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:03.370 align:middle line:84%
It's the thinking
of this is to really

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:05.200 align:middle line:90%
transcend infrastructure.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.660 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
right now, people

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:10.979 align:middle line:84%
have to pay for power, water,
sewage, comfortable shelter.

00:15:10.979 --> 00:15:13.270 align:middle line:84%
They even have to pay for
what to do with their sewage.

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:16.240 align:middle line:84%
They have to pay for
disposal of their garbage.

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:21.460 align:middle line:84%
If we can make this part of
the everyday living of people,

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:25.690 align:middle line:84%
we've cut down their
dependence on infrastructure,

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:29.890 align:middle line:84%
if not eliminated
it, and, therefore,

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:33.850 align:middle line:84%
put them on a different
level in terms of economy

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:37.510 align:middle line:84%
because the economy,
most people--

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:39.010 align:middle line:90%
I travel the world a lot.

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And they're rioting in Egypt,
in the Ukraine over a better

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:46.750 align:middle line:84%
economy, because they think the
economy gives them sustenance.

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:50.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're opening up a
pathway for sustenance that

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:52.180 align:middle line:90%
has nothing to do with economy.

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:53.140 align:middle line:90%
The sun is there.

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:54.310 align:middle line:90%
The rain is there.

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:57.190 align:middle line:84%
The biology and the physics
of the planet are there.

00:15:57.190 --> 00:15:59.170 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to go
through an economy

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:02.230 align:middle line:84%
to get at them for
your sustenance.

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:05.440 align:middle line:84%
So we're trying to make these
earthships be vessels that

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:10.115 align:middle line:84%
put people in touch with
those phenomena of this planet

00:16:10.115 --> 00:16:10.990 align:middle line:90%
and give them a life.

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:21.055 align:middle line:84%

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And I think we can change the
existing life on this planet

00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:33.880 align:middle line:90%

this young generation,

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:42.820 align:middle line:84%
that's coming up in this way,
the more exposure they can have

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:44.350 align:middle line:84%
to this-- it seems
to me, it's not

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:47.410 align:middle line:84%
going to take more than two
generations where we really

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:49.090 align:middle line:90%
could start turning it around.

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:51.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REYNOLDS: Yeah, I
think, I'm seeing it.

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:54.190 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing
this for decades,

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:57.550 align:middle line:84%
and we're now starting to
do schools in South America

00:20:57.550 --> 00:20:59.410 align:middle line:90%
and other parts of the world.

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And when grade school
kids go to schools

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:11.200 align:middle line:84%
that grow bananas in the
hallway and catch rainwater,

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.720 align:middle line:84%
walking through the
door of the school house

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.340 align:middle line:84%
embodies a different
kind of education.

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:18.680 align:middle line:84%
In other words, there's
the reading, writing,

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:20.340 align:middle line:90%
and arithmetic, that's--

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:21.370 align:middle line:90%
we need it.

00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:26.200 align:middle line:84%
But there is the education
about life on this planet that--

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.750 align:middle line:90%
they do a few token courses.

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:30.310 align:middle line:84%
But we're not worried
about that now,

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:32.950 align:middle line:84%
because the building
that they're sitting in

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:38.800 align:middle line:90%
is embodying this education.

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And the kids, you can
see the results already.

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:46.060 align:middle line:84%
We've had a school in Uruguay
in existence now for two years,

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:48.170 align:middle line:84%
and the kids love
to go to school.

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:48.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'll bet.

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:51.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REYNOLDS: And it's changed
the whole nature of everything.

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:53.920 align:middle line:84%
Parents are moving to
this area so their kids

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.050 align:middle line:90%
can go to this school.

00:21:56.050 --> 00:22:02.260 align:middle line:84%
So it is the kids, because
they, in two decades,

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:04.660 align:middle line:84%
will be running
the permit offices

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:07.180 align:middle line:84%
and running the
politics and doing

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:09.940 align:middle line:84%
things that will make
it easier for people

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:11.420 align:middle line:90%
to go in this direction.

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:14.530 align:middle line:84%
Whereas now, it's harder,
just because, it's not

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:17.890 align:middle line:90%
anybody's plan to make it hard.

00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:23.320 align:middle line:84%
It's just that by
nature, our reality

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:28.780 align:middle line:84%
has grown to almost
choke us from evolution.

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:32.470 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what we're,
somehow, trying to transcend.

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:33.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:35.400 align:middle line:90%
Let's go into the story.

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:38.024 align:middle line:84%
Now, we'll go back
in time a little bit,

00:22:38.024 --> 00:22:39.190 align:middle line:90%
when you first started this.

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:41.440 align:middle line:84%
You started gathering
a community of people.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And as your wife
said, you tended

00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:47.260 align:middle line:84%
to attract all kinds of people,
strange people, sad people,

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:49.840 align:middle line:84%
people who were geniuses
in their own right, people

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.140 align:middle line:84%
who had skills, people
who were down and out.

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And you all gathered
together, because they

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.200 align:middle line:84%
could see the beauty
in your vision

00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:00.350 align:middle line:84%
and started creating this
village of sorts in Taos.

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:04.310 align:middle line:90%


00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:09.220 align:middle line:84%
The original homes you built,
you're talking about roughly

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:12.190 align:middle line:84%
keeping a constant
temperature of--

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:15.220 align:middle line:84%
I think in your film,
it said around 70.

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:16.180 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:22.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REYNOLDS: Yeah, we have to go
into the physics of this planet

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:27.250 align:middle line:84%
and the thermal mass and the
solar gain to understand it.

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:33.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually very simple to
make a building stay 70 degrees

00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:34.540 align:middle line:90%
without fuel.

00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:36.070 align:middle line:90%
It's as simple as--

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:41.210 align:middle line:84%
the example I use is I
had a big, black dog.

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:45.370 align:middle line:84%
And that dog would lay in
the sun in the winter time.

00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:48.090 align:middle line:84%
He'd lay in the shade
in the summer time.

00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:49.200 align:middle line:90%
It's as simple as that.

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.190 align:middle line:90%
All of this is that simple.

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:54.480 align:middle line:84%
It's just understanding
that that's available to us.

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:58.290 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, housing, we're making
housing all over the world that

00:23:58.290 --> 00:24:01.470 align:middle line:84%
stays comfortable
without fuel, and that's

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:04.950 align:middle line:90%
one giant step for mankind.

people don't remember what that

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:09.780 align:middle line:84%

when they go camping--

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:12.480 align:middle line:84%
to not have these electrical
grids inside the house,

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.880 align:middle line:84%
to have wireless running
through the house.

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:17.370 align:middle line:84%
But it's a completely different
kind of feeling, isn't it?

00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:19.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REYNOLDS: Yeah, well,
it's like, I think,

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:21.390 align:middle line:90%
that's true, too.

00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:29.130 align:middle line:84%
When expose people to an earthen

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:38.940 align:middle line:84%
You know how they have
subliminal messages.

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:41.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course, this
is a subliminal message

00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:43.980 align:middle line:84%
that the earth is
giving us, which

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:51.160 align:middle line:84%
is going affect our thinking,
and thinking manifests reality.

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And so it's going to affect
our reality for us to be

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:56.985 align:middle line:90%
living in and of the earth.

00:24:56.985 --> 00:24:58.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Truly.

00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's so interesting,
with our audience and Gaia

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:03.180 align:middle line:84%
audiences in
general, oftentimes,

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:04.740 align:middle line:90%
we're looking to the stars.

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:08.010 align:middle line:84%
We're looking to have these
breakthrough messages come

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:11.670 align:middle line:84%
from divine beings,
from sourced elsewhere.

00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:14.220 align:middle line:84%
When we often don't
stop and think,

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:19.110 align:middle line:84%
one of those divine beings
in this cosmic architecture

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:20.970 align:middle line:90%
is the earth itself.

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:24.600 align:middle line:84%
And massive amounts of
intuitive, incredibly deep

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:28.280 align:middle line:84%
information are constantly
being fed from the earth

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:29.280 align:middle line:90%
that we're cut off from.

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.090 align:middle line:84%
People aren't receiving
the information.

00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:33.330 align:middle line:84%
Instead, we're looking
to stars and satellites,

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:36.180 align:middle line:84%
hoping we're going to get a
download from an ET somewhere.

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And I find it just
fascinating when,

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:40.430 align:middle line:90%
it's all right here already.

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:42.630 align:middle line:84%
Our mechanism for
being able to connect

00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:45.570 align:middle line:84%
with that-- our tuning fork
is our body and our being.

00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:47.830 align:middle line:84%
It's right here, but
we're cut off from it

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:49.770 align:middle line:84%
due to all these
artificial signals

00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:51.585 align:middle line:90%
that we've put into our space.

00:25:51.585 --> 00:25:54.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REYNOLDS: Yeah, I call
that introverted evolution.

00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:59.770 align:middle line:84%
When ancient people used to
look at the stars or the sunset

00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:03.660 align:middle line:84%
or the clouds, we
look at TV, which

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:06.030 align:middle line:90%
is just an image of ourself.

00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:09.970 align:middle line:84%
And we end up thinking
in terms of what we see.

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:15.840 align:middle line:84%
And so I think by placing us
in a living situation where

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:21.030 align:middle line:84%
we are seeing and feeling
and being in the earth, even

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:25.830 align:middle line:84%
in a home, that is going
to shape our thinking

00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:29.925 align:middle line:84%
and shape our attitudes
and shape our future.

00:26:29.925 --> 00:26:33.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I've had some of
my most profound experiences

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:36.130 align:middle line:84%
in caves, where I'll
stumble across a cave

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:37.830 align:middle line:84%
or intentionally
go to a cave, where

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:39.780 align:middle line:84%
you're surrounded by
this incredible earth

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:42.360 align:middle line:84%
energy, the Schumann
waves, and so forth.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And you have a completely
different spectrum

00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:48.790 align:middle line:84%
of access to yourself and
knowledge in that environment,

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:52.872 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, you're
creating little caves of sorts,

00:26:52.872 --> 00:26:54.330 align:middle line:84%
because these are
all natural earth

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:55.980 align:middle line:90%
materials without interference.

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:58.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REYNOLDS: Yeah, they are.

00:26:58.460 --> 00:26:59.850 align:middle line:90%
They're not dark like a cave.

00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:05.340 align:middle line:84%
They're very bright, but they
are creatures of the earth.

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:08.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm certainly not going to say
that to a building inspector,

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:10.020 align:middle line:84%
but these buildings
are creatures

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:17.130 align:middle line:84%
of the earth, that embrace
us and give us sustenance,

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:20.430 align:middle line:84%
because they encounter the
earth to give us the things

00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:22.380 align:middle line:90%
that this human body needs.

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:24.070 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not going backwards.

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:25.480 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we need electricity.

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.900 align:middle line:84%
But I don't want to get it
from a nuclear power plant.

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:31.370 align:middle line:84%
I want to get it
right from the sun.

00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:34.350 align:middle line:84%
I want water, not filled
with chlorine and fluoride.

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:36.600 align:middle line:90%
I want it right from the rain.

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:40.710 align:middle line:84%
This is available to everybody
in a very empowering way that

00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:44.550 align:middle line:90%
gives them the right to have it.

00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And I think if every man,
woman, and child on this planet

00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:53.880 align:middle line:84%
were to have the access to
what I just call sustenance,

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:56.640 align:middle line:84%
these six points,
then we're going

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.850 align:middle line:84%
to be seeing a vastly
different world in the future.

00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:01.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely,
and a lot of people

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:04.500 align:middle line:84%
that have visions of
the future almost always

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:08.250 align:middle line:84%
see these little domes,
domed types of architecture.

00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:09.150 align:middle line:90%
That's very common.

00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:10.660 align:middle line:90%
I've seen that as well.

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:13.520 align:middle line:84%
So in these domes, these
homes, these original homes

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.630 align:middle line:84%
you built even years
ago, you're saying

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:17.940 align:middle line:84%
that the temperatures
can drop as low as 20,

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:20.280 align:middle line:90%
30 degrees below zero.

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And they still tend to keep
their integrity, in terms

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:24.555 align:middle line:90%
of the interior temperature?

00:28:24.555 --> 00:28:27.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REYNOLDS: Yes, that was
the first aspect of it,

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:30.480 align:middle line:84%
is trying to make the
building stay comfortable

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:35.890 align:middle line:84%
and getting more and more into
the things that can cause that.

00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And we, just by
trial and error, have

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:42.060 align:middle line:84%
arrived at a place where,
yeah, we have buildings

00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:46.550 align:middle line:84%
that just blow people's minds
in terms of temperature,

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:50.760 align:middle line:84%
because they are going outside
and their nostrils inside

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:54.410 align:middle line:84%
freeze in the climate that
we have here in Colorado

00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:57.380 align:middle line:84%
and New Mexico at
high elevation.

00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:59.672 align:middle line:84%
And these buildings,
they walk inside.

00:28:59.672 --> 00:29:01.505 align:middle line:84%
They're walking around
barefoot with bananas

00:29:01.505 --> 00:29:04.580 align:middle line:84%
growing in the
hallway, and they're

00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:06.980 align:middle line:84%
like, how could
this possibly be?

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:10.700 align:middle line:10%
But what's amazing is,
it's eighth grade physics--

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:12.605 align:middle line:10%
is what it is.

00:29:12.605 --> 00:29:15.140 align:middle line:10%
The whole secret, if
you want to call it

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:19.520 align:middle line:10%
that, to living on this planet
is nothing more than eighth

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:21.420 align:middle line:10%
grade physics and biology.

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:23.570 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And you're taking
this around the world

00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:25.070 align:middle line:10%
and leaving these
templates that you

00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:27.470 align:middle line:10%
say a sixth grader
can understand,

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:29.780 align:middle line:10%
in terms of the construction
of these places.

00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:32.140 align:middle line:10%
We'll talk about that
in just a moment.

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:34.330 align:middle line:84%
But meanwhile, you have
your original community.

00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:36.650 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's pitching in
the grand experiment.

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:40.640 align:middle line:84%
And you say, a lot was learned
through what the community

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.230 align:middle line:90%
would accept or complain about.

00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:43.670 align:middle line:84%
It's like, no,
it's a little hot.

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:44.570 align:middle line:90%
It's a little cold.

00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:46.070 align:middle line:90%
It's a little this and that.

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:48.470 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the adjustments
you made in the architecture

00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:51.350 align:middle line:84%
were reflections of
the complaints or needs

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:52.960 align:middle line:90%
of the people.

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REYNOLDS: Yeah, I
let the people guide me

00:29:55.880 --> 00:30:01.170 align:middle line:84%
in terms of responding to
what they complain about.

00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:04.010 align:middle line:10%
However, I didn't
always do that.

00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:06.500 align:middle line:10%
And that's how I got
in a lot of trouble.

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:10.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't think the complaints
are valid in some cases.

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:13.070 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, I was
just trying to do

00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:15.500 align:middle line:84%
this in spite of whether
people liked it or not.

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:17.720 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't work.

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:21.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't care how beautiful
an idea or a concept

00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:24.965 align:middle line:84%
is, you've got to give
it to people slowly.

00:30:24.965 --> 00:30:29.330 align:middle line:84%
If you impose new thinking
on them too quickly,

00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:32.960 align:middle line:84%
they simply get
rigid and reject.

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:36.620 align:middle line:84%
An example I make to
myself is like, I once

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:38.750 align:middle line:90%
had a banana tree way back.

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:41.630 align:middle line:84%
I just planted it, and it
was already four feet tall

00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:43.470 align:middle line:90%
when I planted it.

00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:46.280 align:middle line:84%
It was in the back
of a building that

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:48.870 align:middle line:90%
had a southern light coming in.

00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:51.890 align:middle line:90%
And it was a straight tree.

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:55.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, slowly over
the weeks, that tree

00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:57.030 align:middle line:90%
leaned toward the light.

00:30:57.030 --> 00:31:00.500 align:middle line:90%
Its rigid trunk bent and leaned.

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:02.510 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't take
that tree and bend it

00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:05.420 align:middle line:84%
when I first put it there, and
that's what humanity is like.

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:09.650 align:middle line:84%
We can't bend them right now
into a better way of thinking.

00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:13.170 align:middle line:84%
We have to let them
slowly grow toward it.

00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:15.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's a
lesson that took me

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:16.850 align:middle line:90%
a couple of decades to learn.

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:18.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to
talk about that lesson.

00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:19.730 align:middle line:90%
We might as well launch in.

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:21.896 align:middle line:84%
So you started learning
first within your community.

00:31:21.896 --> 00:31:24.290 align:middle line:84%
There were certain things you
could really push forward.

00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And other things, you
were getting a little bit

00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:26.870 align:middle line:90%
of pushback on, maybe?

00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:30.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REYNOLDS: Oh yeah, pushback
is the story of my life,

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:32.750 align:middle line:84%
because first of all,
it took me a long time

00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:34.190 align:middle line:90%
to learn that lesson.

00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:36.530 align:middle line:84%
But now, it's like
the only reason

00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:38.630 align:middle line:84%
we have a lot of stress
on this planet right

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:43.070 align:middle line:84%
now is because we
have designed it.

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:49.410 align:middle line:84%
We have religions and politics
and doctrines and dogma,

00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:52.700 align:middle line:84%
I guess, is what it is,
that people grow up in,

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:56.760 align:middle line:84%
and they don't even know
there is another way.

00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And those things have taken
them away from the earth.

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:03.180 align:middle line:84%
When really, if we can
expose them to that again,

00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:07.160 align:middle line:84%
whatever way we can, and it
has to be in small doses,

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:12.860 align:middle line:84%
then they can get the
message at their own pace

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:13.880 align:middle line:90%
and their own speed.

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:18.080 align:middle line:84%
One thing that I've
been looking at

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:21.530 align:middle line:84%
is, I didn't think
there was enough time

00:32:21.530 --> 00:32:26.210 align:middle line:84%
for us to fool around getting
this message very slowly.

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:30.870 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to be all right,
and we're going to evolve.

00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:35.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think we don't have to
do the doomsday rush situation.

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:39.920 align:middle line:84%
We do have to keep moving in
the direction of sustainability

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:40.910 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:42.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you
were too big a dose

00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:47.570 align:middle line:84%
for the building department and
other powers that be in Taos.

00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:51.620 align:middle line:84%
In your documentary, wow,
what you went up against,

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:55.160 align:middle line:84%
repeatedly-- and I have to
say, you did a beautiful job--

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:57.680 align:middle line:84%
it seemed from the
film's portrayal of you--

00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:00.230 align:middle line:84%
of zipping it and trying
to just play the game,

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:02.530 align:middle line:90%
which just was painful to watch.

00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:04.520 align:middle line:10%
So here, you have
these people that

00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:09.260 align:middle line:10%
are not creative thinkers, who
are somehow threatened by what

00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:11.360 align:middle line:10%
you're doing out
there and started

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:14.210 align:middle line:10%
sending other people
within their departments

00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:17.480 align:middle line:10%
out, ultimately, with
guns to shut you down

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:20.950 align:middle line:10%
when you and your band
of merry followers

00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:22.850 align:middle line:10%
were out trying to build
these little domes.

00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:25.570 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about the politics
of what happened there.

00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:28.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REYNOLDS: Well, it
wasn't anybody's fault.

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:32.750 align:middle line:84%
It's just that these
people that were against me

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:35.990 align:middle line:84%
were acting in the
direction of what

00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:37.760 align:middle line:84%
they thought was the
health and safety

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:39.230 align:middle line:90%
and welfare of the people.

00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:42.410 align:middle line:84%
And I call that penny
wise and dollar foolish.

00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:47.720 align:middle line:84%
It's like they are keeping
us alive for the moment,

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:50.250 align:middle line:84%
so that we can die
slowly in the future.

00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
nobody's fault.

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:57.290 align:middle line:84%
But it is the nature of
what's going on here,

00:33:57.290 --> 00:34:00.320 align:middle line:84%
and so it keeps me from
really getting bent out

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:01.170 align:middle line:90%
of shape about it.

00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:04.790 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
it's nobody's fault.

00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:06.140 align:middle line:90%
I can't blame that person.

00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:08.120 align:middle line:84%
Even though they're
trying to put me in jail,

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:09.889 align:middle line:90%
I still can't blame that person.

00:34:09.889 --> 00:34:11.880 align:middle line:90%
They grew up thinking that way.

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And so I went through
several phases of this.

00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:19.639 align:middle line:84%
It used to be I hid
from building inspectors

00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:23.030 align:middle line:84%
and avoided them and
things like that,

00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:25.250 align:middle line:84%
because I knew I
was doing things

00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:28.031 align:middle line:84%
that-- building buildings out
of what they call garbage.

00:34:28.031 --> 00:34:30.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you didn't have
permits, you just had ideas.

00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:32.239 align:middle line:84%
>>REYNOLDS: It got
scary that way.

00:34:32.239 --> 00:34:35.420 align:middle line:84%
So my next method
of trying to do this

00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:38.960 align:middle line:84%
was to join them, so I went to
the legislature in New Mexico.

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:42.230 align:middle line:84%
I spent four years
lobbying and presenting

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:44.389 align:middle line:90%
and finally got a law passed.

00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:45.620 align:middle line:90%
That was horrible.

00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:48.710 align:middle line:84%
I would never spend four years
of my life doing that again,

00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:50.970 align:middle line:84%
but it was my attempt
at joining them.

00:34:50.970 --> 00:34:51.770 align:middle line:90%
It did work.

00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:54.230 align:middle line:84%
Governor Bill Richardson
signed the bill,

00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:56.630 align:middle line:84%
and it is an Act
in New Mexico now.

00:34:56.630 --> 00:35:02.790 align:middle line:84%
But that took too long, and
that was not a viable answer.

00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:04.260 align:middle line:90%
So now, I'm looking at--

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:07.530 align:middle line:90%


00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:10.100 align:middle line:84%
well, here's the way I
explain it to myself,

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:13.010 align:middle line:84%
is like, if you have a
dog and it has worms,

00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:15.900 align:middle line:84%
you try to cram a worm
pill down the dog's throat.

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:17.180 align:middle line:90%
And you get bit.

00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:18.860 align:middle line:90%
He spits it back up.

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:20.195 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't like it.

00:35:20.195 --> 00:35:22.070 align:middle line:84%
But if you take that
worm pill and you put it

00:35:22.070 --> 00:35:25.370 align:middle line:84%
in a ball of hamburger, throw
it at the dog, he swallows it.

00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:28.490 align:middle line:84%
So that's the way
I look at it now.

00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:32.150 align:middle line:84%
I know what the
world wants and what

00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:36.110 align:middle line:84%
they're capable of
receiving, and I

00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:40.460 align:middle line:84%
take what we want to
do and put it in that.

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:42.710 align:middle line:84%
And they don't even
notice it, and it's

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:46.970 align:middle line:84%
causing us to be able to--
without stress, without war,

00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:49.130 align:middle line:84%
without conflict,
it's causing us

00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:52.310 align:middle line:84%
to be able to transcend
the situation that we're

00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:53.756 align:middle line:90%
in throughout the world.

00:35:53.756 --> 00:35:55.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But
initially, what you

00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:58.280 align:middle line:84%
were trying to do with this bill
was just have a zone set aside

00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:00.350 align:middle line:84%
where you could be
free to experiment.

00:36:00.350 --> 00:36:01.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REYNOLDS: It
seemed very logical.

00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:03.156 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It seemed logical.

00:36:03.156 --> 00:36:04.680 align:middle line:90%
You had the land.

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:07.490 align:middle line:84%
Why would government
concern itself

00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:12.950 align:middle line:84%
to the point of anger and
filibustering and so forth?

00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:14.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REYNOLDS: Yes,
they're not seeing.

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:17.180 align:middle line:84%
We test airplanes,
and it kills people.

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:18.260 align:middle line:90%
We test automobiles.

00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:19.550 align:middle line:90%
People get killed.

00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:20.720 align:middle line:90%
We test drugs.

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:22.220 align:middle line:90%
Really, it's ridiculous.

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing that
almost got them thinking

00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:27.200 align:middle line:90%
was here in New Mexico--

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:31.550 align:middle line:84%
in New Mexico, we
tested the atomic bomb,

00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:33.830 align:middle line:90%
and it blew apart 10,000 acres.

00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:36.140 align:middle line:90%
So it's still polluted today.

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:42.890 align:middle line:84%
So why can't we take 10 acres
and test methods of living?

00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:48.430 align:middle line:90%
But it hits nerves or something.

00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:49.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does.

00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:52.190 align:middle line:84%
The amount of anger
that was engendered

00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:54.920 align:middle line:84%
in some of these people
is really quite shocking.

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:58.370 align:middle line:84%
What do you feel they
felt under threat by?

00:36:58.370 --> 00:37:01.085 align:middle line:90%


00:37:01.085 --> 00:37:03.425 align:middle line:84%
Or they just don't like
people doing things outside

00:37:03.425 --> 00:37:04.225 align:middle line:90%
of the rules.

00:37:04.225 --> 00:37:05.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REYNOLDS: Well, that.

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:09.794 align:middle line:84%
But the first time
I told an engineer

00:37:09.794 --> 00:37:11.960 align:middle line:84%
that I was going to build
a house out of beer cans--

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:16.246 align:middle line:84%
he was my older mentor
that I was looking up to.

00:37:16.246 --> 00:37:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And I told him I had this
great idea to build a house out

00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:20.230 align:middle line:90%
of beer cans.

00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:21.420 align:middle line:90%
It was in a bar.

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:22.220 align:middle line:90%
He stood up--

00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:24.219 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's where
those good ideas come up.

00:37:24.219 --> 00:37:25.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REYNOLDS: In a bar.

00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And he stormed out of
the bar read in the face

00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:32.330 align:middle line:84%
saying I was a disgrace to
the architectural community

00:37:32.330 --> 00:37:34.280 align:middle line:84%
for wanting to build
out of garbage.

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:38.330 align:middle line:84%
In other words, human
waste and garbage

00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:40.640 align:middle line:84%
are things that
people don't want

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:45.140 align:middle line:90%
to consider as a good thing.

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:50.360 align:middle line:84%
Biologically, they are good, and
garbage is a natural resource.

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And I want the things
that nobody else wants.

00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:56.530 align:middle line:90%
It's almost like alchemy.

00:37:56.530 --> 00:38:00.110 align:middle line:84%
I can turn them into things
that we need for our life.

00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:03.260 align:middle line:84%
Human waste turns into
food if it's done right.

00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:06.290 align:middle line:84%
Garbage turns into
building materials.

00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:10.910 align:middle line:84%
One of my things on this planet
that I would consider to be

00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:13.880 align:middle line:90%
a mentor-type thing is a tree.

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:16.070 align:middle line:84%
A tree has what we
would call garbage.

00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:18.200 align:middle line:84%
It drops its leaves
on the ground,

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:20.750 align:middle line:84%
and they turn into
dirt for more trees.

00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:23.840 align:middle line:84%
They're not in wrappers
like our garbage.

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:27.710 align:middle line:84%
They make more soil
for more trees.

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:30.440 align:middle line:84%
The tree breathes
out oxygen, and it

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:33.350 align:middle line:90%
breathes in carbon dioxide.

00:38:33.350 --> 00:38:35.930 align:middle line:84%
The tree absorbs
energy from the sun.

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:38.360 align:middle line:84%
The tree absorbs nutrients
and water from the earth

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:39.590 align:middle line:90%
and from the rain.

00:38:39.590 --> 00:38:43.610 align:middle line:84%
It's sitting there, encountering
the phenomena of the planet,

00:38:43.610 --> 00:38:46.155 align:middle line:84%
and we call ourselves
intelligent?

00:38:46.155 --> 00:38:47.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:49.760 align:middle line:84%
So this happened, what--
was it three times?

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:50.850 align:middle line:84%
Three attempts
before you finally--

00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:51.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REYNOLDS: Four.

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:53.210 align:middle line:90%
We got it on the fourth attempt.

00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:56.870 align:middle line:84%
Each time, I got a
little more savvy

00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:59.550 align:middle line:84%
about how to handle
myself there.

00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And I was definitely
out of my element

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:06.150 align:middle line:84%
and don't ever want
to do it again.

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:17.690 align:middle line:84%
But it was impressive, to me,
to see that if you kept at it,

00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:20.870 align:middle line:90%
people will start hearing you.

00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And it had to do with
Governor Bill Richardson, too.

00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:30.110 align:middle line:84%
He's a thinker, and
he's a good governor.

00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:31.150 align:middle line:90%
He was a good governor.

00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And he saw that what we were
doing could make some sense.

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:40.870 align:middle line:84%
He said, you're on to
something, and he ended up

00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:42.040 align:middle line:90%
signing the bill.

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:45.910 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, there are a lot
of legislators that--

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:47.710 align:middle line:84%
they have-- I
remember, there's one

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:51.280 align:middle line:84%
in the movie that just says,
global warming is a myth.

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:53.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's fine,
let him think that.

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:56.200 align:middle line:84%
I don't think he
thinks that now.

00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:57.730 align:middle line:90%
Things are changing.

00:39:57.730 --> 00:39:59.290 align:middle line:90%
You can't convince people.

00:39:59.290 --> 00:40:00.820 align:middle line:90%
You have to show people.

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And I don't really ever
challenge people in an agro way

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:10.160 align:middle line:90%
or anything.

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:14.524 align:middle line:84%
You simply have to put it
out there, here's water.

00:40:14.524 --> 00:40:15.940 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to
drink it, or do you

00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:17.981 align:middle line:84%
want to wait a while until
you're dying of thirst

00:40:17.981 --> 00:40:19.474 align:middle line:90%
and drink it?

00:40:19.474 --> 00:40:21.640 align:middle line:84%
That's a way we're trying
to put this out there now.

00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:23.620 align:middle line:84%
Not cram it down
people's throats,

00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:26.060 align:middle line:90%
just, here is what we've found.

00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:28.900 align:middle line:90%


00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:34.150 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the ways I look
at what we're doing now is--

00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:38.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a genius that
thought up all of this stuff.

00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:40.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm just using
biology and physics

00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:44.230 align:middle line:84%
that's already there, eighth
grade biology and physics.

00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:47.800 align:middle line:84%
The way I look at what we're
doing is I compare it to like,

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:51.370 align:middle line:84%
you're in a subway and
the subway caved in,

00:40:51.370 --> 00:40:56.230 align:middle line:84%
and you've got 70 people there
in pitch black total darkness.

00:40:56.230 --> 00:41:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And I looked over and I saw a
teeny, teeny, little pinpoint

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:01.390 align:middle line:90%
of light.

00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:03.800 align:middle line:84%
I went over there, and I
started pulling a few rocks away

00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:04.600 align:middle line:90%
from it.

00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:05.980 align:middle line:90%
And it got a little bigger.

00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And other people saw that
and came over and started

00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:11.590 align:middle line:90%
helping me pull rocks away.

00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:12.730 align:middle line:90%
That's what's going on.

00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:15.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have to
show people a better way.

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:19.390 align:middle line:84%
So you were able to get
the permits and such to be

00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:22.840 align:middle line:90%
able to do the subdivision.

00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:25.990 align:middle line:84%
You won, but you were building
repetitive little houses.

00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things that really

00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:31.090 align:middle line:84%
got me was hearing from the
other people in the community

00:41:31.090 --> 00:41:35.350 align:middle line:84%
saying, when this
mindset came in,

00:41:35.350 --> 00:41:36.940 align:middle line:84%
they felt like they
lost their ability

00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:39.880 align:middle line:90%
to really dream any longer.

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And you said, we
lost our ability

00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:45.774 align:middle line:84%
to simply make mistakes
and learn from them.

00:41:45.774 --> 00:41:46.690 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:41:46.690 --> 00:41:52.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REYNOLDS: Well, I think, in
our world, our developed world

00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:55.450 align:middle line:90%
today, a mistake is a lawsuit.

00:41:55.450 --> 00:41:57.865 align:middle line:84%
A mistake is a take
your credentials.

00:41:57.865 --> 00:42:01.030 align:middle line:84%
A mistake is a bad
reputation and a bad review

00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:04.480 align:middle line:90%
on the internet.

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:06.040 align:middle line:90%
Mistakes are considered bad.

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:08.530 align:middle line:84%
Just like human waste
is considered bad,

00:42:08.530 --> 00:42:11.905 align:middle line:84%
garbage is considered bad,
mistakes are considered bad.

00:42:11.905 --> 00:42:14.800 align:middle line:84%
I look at all of those
things as positives.

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:19.130 align:middle line:84%
We learned this thing that
we're doing from trial and error

00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:24.070 align:middle line:84%
mistakes, and I've made
millions of mistakes.

00:42:24.070 --> 00:42:26.430 align:middle line:84%
But each one, I
learned a little more.

00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:28.660 align:middle line:84%
If you do something
that's successful,

00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:30.380 align:middle line:90%
you haven't learned anything.

00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:33.190 align:middle line:84%
And so we just keep
making the mistakes

00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:35.710 align:middle line:84%
and learning more
about the earth,

00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:38.290 align:middle line:84%
about the phenomena
of the earth.

00:42:38.290 --> 00:42:41.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's an education
that's ongoing for us.

00:42:41.770 --> 00:42:47.080 align:middle line:84%
And so we on this planet,
in this day and age,

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:49.210 align:middle line:90%
mistakes are taboo.

00:42:49.210 --> 00:42:51.310 align:middle line:84%
I think that should
be changed, too.

00:42:51.310 --> 00:42:55.780 align:middle line:84%
We should encourage mistakes and
not have the stigma around them

00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:56.815 align:middle line:90%
that we have today.

00:42:56.815 --> 00:42:58.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think
there's a university--

00:42:58.600 --> 00:42:59.620 align:middle line:90%
the name is eluding me.

00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:02.620 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a
university in California,

00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:05.570 align:middle line:84%
its theme is the
university of failure,

00:43:05.570 --> 00:43:07.760 align:middle line:90%
which is how you learn.

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:08.920 align:middle line:90%
I love that idea.

00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:11.470 align:middle line:84%
Because in life,
everyone, every parent

00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:13.360 align:middle line:84%
will say, oh, we learn
through mistakes.

00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:15.400 align:middle line:84%
But once it gets to an
institutional level,

00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:18.070 align:middle line:84%
once it becomes something
under someone else's purview,

00:43:18.070 --> 00:43:20.125 align:middle line:84%
you're not allowed to
make mistakes anymore.

00:43:20.125 --> 00:43:24.350 align:middle line:90%


00:43:24.350 --> 00:43:27.610 align:middle line:84%
Was that a bit of a heavy
hearted moment for you,

00:43:27.610 --> 00:43:30.020 align:middle line:84%
to know that everything you
were going to do now was

00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:32.500 align:middle line:84%
going to be closely
scrutinized and regulated?

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:35.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REYNOLDS: Well, yes it was.

00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:38.590 align:middle line:84%
I always squirm around and
figure out a way, I guess.

00:43:38.590 --> 00:43:42.610 align:middle line:84%
But I have found myself
in recent history--

00:43:42.610 --> 00:43:46.360 align:middle line:84%
we've won some battles, and
we are able to do some things.

00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:49.100 align:middle line:90%


00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:52.270 align:middle line:84%
The world is evolving
to the extent

00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:57.094 align:middle line:84%
that one out of every 10
regulators is aware of the fact

00:43:57.094 --> 00:43:58.510 align:middle line:84%
that we need to
make some changes.

00:43:58.510 --> 00:44:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And they will go there with an
earthship idea, and they'll go,

00:44:02.350 --> 00:44:03.250 align:middle line:90%
I love those things.

00:44:03.250 --> 00:44:04.750 align:middle line:90%
I want it to happen.

00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:06.890 align:middle line:90%
We'll help you get through.

00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:09.410 align:middle line:84%
Then there's a bunch of
them that say, no way.

00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:15.640 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, on this
planet, it's getting to be more

00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:18.130 align:middle line:90%
and more people are aware of it.

00:44:18.130 --> 00:44:21.970 align:middle line:84%
But there are places on
this planet that I run to.

00:44:21.970 --> 00:44:24.970 align:middle line:84%
I went to Indonesia,
to a deserted island,

00:44:24.970 --> 00:44:27.340 align:middle line:84%
and we built there
with no rules.

00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:29.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is so cool.

00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:31.570 align:middle line:90%
I want to get to that.

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:35.930 align:middle line:84%
Let's bring it up to the
year 2005 and the tsunami.

00:44:35.930 --> 00:44:39.450 align:middle line:84%
Were you the one that was
contacted by this one man

00:44:39.450 --> 00:44:41.170 align:middle line:90%
in the Andaman Islands?

00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:43.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REYNOLDS: Yeah.

00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:45.910 align:middle line:84%
Even then, it was
out around the world,

00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:49.030 align:middle line:84%
to some extent, what we were
doing and attempting to do.

00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:51.160 align:middle line:84%
So an architect from
the tsunami islands--

00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:54.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, from the Andaman
Islands contacted me and said,

00:44:54.970 --> 00:44:57.510 align:middle line:84%
the time for-- it was
a very short message--

00:44:57.510 --> 00:45:00.950 align:middle line:84%
the time for dropping
meds and food is over.

00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:03.400 align:middle line:84%
It's time for something
real to happen,

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:07.130 align:middle line:84%
to help us get out of
this and grow out of it.

00:45:07.130 --> 00:45:10.180 align:middle line:90%
And will you come and help us?

00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:14.260 align:middle line:84%
So I went to my bank-- and
I've got a good rapport

00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:18.100 align:middle line:84%
with the bank-- and I
said, I need $50,000

00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:20.297 align:middle line:90%
to go help these people.

00:45:20.297 --> 00:45:21.380 align:middle line:90%
And that was on a Tuesday.

00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:22.810 align:middle line:90%
On a Thursday, I had the money.

00:45:22.810 --> 00:45:24.160 align:middle line:90%
We got our shots, and we went.

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:27.450 align:middle line:90%


00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:29.915 align:middle line:90%
But I learned from that.

00:45:29.915 --> 00:45:31.060 align:middle line:90%
We do that a lot now.

00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:33.680 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
Puerto Rico now, too.

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:42.310 align:middle line:84%
But I found that a major
disaster is a hole in dogma.

00:45:42.310 --> 00:45:44.270 align:middle line:90%
They are so needy from--

00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:45.070 align:middle line:90%
they need water.

00:45:45.070 --> 00:45:45.910 align:middle line:90%
They need shelter.

00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:47.110 align:middle line:90%
They need everything.

00:45:47.110 --> 00:45:49.630 align:middle line:84%
They don't care about
any rules or regulations.

00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:51.260 align:middle line:90%
They just need water.

00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:52.510 align:middle line:10%
They need shelter.

00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:55.600 align:middle line:10%
And so when those things happen,
like that earthquake in Haiti

00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:59.050 align:middle line:10%
and so on, the people,
as well as the regulators

00:45:59.050 --> 00:46:02.670 align:middle line:10%
and the people that
run the government,

00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:05.225 align:middle line:10%
there's just a giant hole in
dogma, and we go through it.

00:46:05.225 --> 00:46:06.850 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
creativity can flourish

00:46:06.850 --> 00:46:07.960 align:middle line:10%
under those conditions.

00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:11.770 align:middle line:10%
So with this particular
experience, first of all 3/4

00:46:11.770 --> 00:46:14.620 align:middle line:10%
of the population was gone.

00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:16.980 align:middle line:84%
Peoples' families were
completely broken apart.

00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:20.200 align:middle line:90%
They really, truly had nothing.

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:22.060 align:middle line:84%
At the end, seeing
this little dome

00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:25.060 align:middle line:84%
and seeing these gutters that
allowed for the rainwater

00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:28.220 align:middle line:84%
to be captured and seeing
the little, green hand-pump

00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:30.460 align:middle line:84%
inside so that they
could literally

00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:33.340 align:middle line:84%
source their own water
from inside their dwelling,

00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:37.330 align:middle line:84%
I just found so
inspiring and beautiful.

00:46:37.330 --> 00:46:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And you say, they
called it magic.

00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:44.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REYNOLDS: Yeah, they do.

00:46:44.350 --> 00:46:47.290 align:middle line:84%
Several times, it's been
called magic, what we do.

00:46:47.290 --> 00:46:52.030 align:middle line:84%
But really, magic is
simply understanding

00:46:52.030 --> 00:46:55.570 align:middle line:84%
the phenomena of this
planet and going with them.

00:46:55.570 --> 00:46:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And we keep getting
better at that.

00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And we do go to places
after disasters for one,

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:07.870 align:middle line:84%
to help the people with what
we've learned, but also,

00:47:07.870 --> 00:47:11.500 align:middle line:84%
because we get to learn there,
and we have a place there

00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:14.780 align:middle line:84%
where we are not
regulated and controlled.

00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:20.510 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a mutual situation,
a mutual beneficiary situation.

00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:22.660 align:middle line:84%
And like I say, we
have made a practice

00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:25.980 align:middle line:84%
of going to those
places after disasters.

00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:28.580 align:middle line:90%
We're in Puerto Rico right now.

00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And then we also go to places
where there is no disaster,

00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:34.330 align:middle line:90%
but where there's no people.

00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:36.250 align:middle line:90%
And that's fantastic, too.

00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:40.270 align:middle line:84%
In other words, to go to
some deserted island and just

00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:42.370 align:middle line:84%
start doing what we know
how to do because we

00:47:42.370 --> 00:47:45.370 align:middle line:84%
can go to an island
where there's nothing

00:47:45.370 --> 00:47:49.690 align:middle line:84%
and end up, like in Indonesia,
with two little earthships that

00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:52.960 align:middle line:84%
have 6,000 gallons of
water, high speed internet,

00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:57.140 align:middle line:84%
electricity, the best
flushing toilet in Indonesia.

00:47:57.140 --> 00:48:01.030 align:middle line:84%
We know we can settle the
earth in a way that is not

00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:03.790 align:middle line:84%
hurting the earth, and you
don't need infrastructure

00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:06.280 align:middle line:90%
of any kind to do this.

00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And what we need
to do, though, is

00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:12.040 align:middle line:84%
we need to be able to do
it to practice and learn,

00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:16.510 align:middle line:84%
and you can't do that unless
you create a law, like we did,

00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:17.950 align:middle line:90%
to practice and learn.

00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:22.180 align:middle line:84%
But that law, it
still has limitations.

00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:24.460 align:middle line:84%
We got the law passed,
but they're still

00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:28.480 align:middle line:84%
squeezing the law, not out of
malice or anything like that,

00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:31.832 align:middle line:90%
but just out of ignorance.

00:48:31.832 --> 00:48:33.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: First of all,
that little house took,

00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:35.100 align:middle line:84%
what, two weeks
to build, roughly?

00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:35.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REYNOLDS: Yeah.

00:48:35.610 --> 00:48:37.401 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: The whole
community was watching.

00:48:37.401 --> 00:48:40.180 align:middle line:10%
Pretty much everyone left there
was watching, more or less.

00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:41.710 align:middle line:84%
You had that main
architect with you

00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:43.630 align:middle line:90%
who was really spearheading it.

00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:46.065 align:middle line:84%
And you said, you left behind
a very simple set of plans,

00:48:46.065 --> 00:48:46.510 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:47.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REYNOLDS: Yeah.

00:48:47.310 --> 00:48:51.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so really, did
they continue replicating these

00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:51.940 align:middle line:90%
there?

00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:52.740 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:55.090 align:middle line:10%
>>REYNOLDS: They continued
using the techniques

00:48:55.090 --> 00:48:57.310 align:middle line:10%
for various things.

00:48:57.310 --> 00:48:59.770 align:middle line:10%
That's another thing that
we've learned over the years,

00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:02.590 align:middle line:10%
and now, we're really
employing it in Puerto Rico.

00:49:02.590 --> 00:49:04.600 align:middle line:90%
We employed it on Easter Island.

00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:07.060 align:middle line:90%
We employed it in Sierra Leone.

00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And that is, we have to present
these techniques in such a way

00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:15.640 align:middle line:90%
that they can be replicated.

00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:17.980 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it's just
another learning experience.

00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:21.090 align:middle line:84%
It took us a while to figure
out that we have to make

00:49:21.090 --> 00:49:23.880 align:middle line:90%
these things easy to replicate.

00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And then that's like a
Petri dish or something.

00:49:28.650 --> 00:49:31.380 align:middle line:84%
A bacteria is not going to
grow, unless the temperature is

00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:36.630 align:middle line:84%
right, and the medium in
the Petri dish is right,

00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:39.040 align:middle line:84%
and there's enough
moisture, and so on.

00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:41.850 align:middle line:84%
We have to create
a situation where

00:49:41.850 --> 00:49:43.980 align:middle line:90%
these things can be replicated.

00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:46.110 align:middle line:84%
No matter how good they
are, if the people there

00:49:46.110 --> 00:49:49.350 align:middle line:84%
can't replicate them, we
haven't really succeeded.

00:49:49.350 --> 00:49:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're trying
to do now in Puerto Rico.

00:49:52.350 --> 00:49:54.690 align:middle line:10%
And it is working
in Puerto Rico.

00:49:54.690 --> 00:49:58.590 align:middle line:10%
We were down there a few
weeks ago, started building.

00:49:58.590 --> 00:50:01.740 align:middle line:10%
I actually got my architect's
license in Puerto Rico, too.

00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And we started
building, and they

00:50:04.050 --> 00:50:07.930 align:middle line:84%
have continued, at a slow
pace, with the project.

00:50:07.930 --> 00:50:10.050 align:middle line:84%
And now, we're going
back to show them more,

00:50:10.050 --> 00:50:13.330 align:middle line:84%
and it is working
like a virus there.

00:50:13.330 --> 00:50:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And in many places
around the world,

00:50:14.890 --> 00:50:16.560 align:middle line:90%
it is working like a virus.

00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:21.180 align:middle line:84%
We're just getting to understand
the magic of the virus.

00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:23.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
you say, a sixth grader

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:25.410 align:middle line:84%
could understand these
plans, for the most part.

00:50:25.410 --> 00:50:26.365 align:middle line:90%
They're that simple.

00:50:26.365 --> 00:50:27.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REYNOLDS: They are.

00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:29.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even though it has
geothermal implications and all

00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:30.810 align:middle line:90%
that, it's still--

00:50:30.810 --> 00:50:33.740 align:middle line:84%
there's digging in the dirt
and there's circulation,

00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:35.290 align:middle line:84%
and it's still
relatively simple.

00:50:35.290 --> 00:50:36.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REYNOLDS: It is.

00:50:36.090 --> 00:50:40.810 align:middle line:84%
It is simple, and it's just
got to be presented simple.

00:50:40.810 --> 00:50:45.510 align:middle line:84%
In the last seven or so years,
we've started an academy,

00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:47.100 align:middle line:84%
and we have an
earthship academy,

00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:51.000 align:middle line:84%
where we have 300 or
400 students a year

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.130 align:middle line:90%
come through the academy.

00:50:53.130 --> 00:50:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And we do the academy
in New Mexico,

00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:58.050 align:middle line:84%
and we do some sessions
around the world.

00:50:58.050 --> 00:51:01.680 align:middle line:90%
And the students are seeing--

00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:05.420 align:middle line:84%
they're resonating with
the potential of this.

00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And a very interesting
thing is, like say

00:51:07.950 --> 00:51:10.560 align:middle line:84%
we have a session that
has 40 students in it,

00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:14.220 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the
session, at least half

00:51:14.220 --> 00:51:16.110 align:middle line:84%
the students don't
want to leave.

00:51:16.110 --> 00:51:16.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm sure.

00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:17.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REYNOLDS: You graduate
from Yale or Harvard,

00:51:17.790 --> 00:51:19.890 align:middle line:84%
you want to get to hell
out of there, quick.

00:51:19.890 --> 00:51:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And you graduate from this,
and they don't want to leave.

00:51:22.830 --> 00:51:26.320 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to go back to
the other life that they had.

00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:29.130 align:middle line:84%
So we know that we're
resonating with something

00:51:29.130 --> 00:51:31.260 align:middle line:90%
that's in people already.

00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And we know that we've
got a long way to go,

00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:38.190 align:middle line:84%
but it is that little pinpoint
of light in the darkness.

00:51:38.190 --> 00:51:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And the more rocks we pull
away from it, the more--

00:51:41.850 --> 00:51:45.740 align:middle line:84%
the bigger that light
will be as a way out.

00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
important for me

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:53.130 align:middle line:84%
to realize that I didn't
invent or create that light.

00:51:53.130 --> 00:51:57.450 align:middle line:84%
I found it, and I'm trying to
make the hole through to it

00:51:57.450 --> 00:51:58.650 align:middle line:90%
bigger for everybody.

00:51:58.650 --> 00:52:00.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Very
true, and yet, you

00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:01.770 align:middle line:84%
have some earthly
obstacles, such as,

00:52:01.770 --> 00:52:03.060 align:middle line:90%
how do you get access to land?

00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:05.220 align:middle line:84%
How do you get
ownership of land?

00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:08.010 align:middle line:84%
How did you end up on
these deserted islands?

00:52:08.010 --> 00:52:10.270 align:middle line:90%
Did you have to buy the island?

00:52:10.270 --> 00:52:11.990 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:15.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REYNOLDS: All of these things,
the more you do, the more you

00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:17.880 align:middle line:90%
cause things to happen.

00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:19.560 align:middle line:84%
For instance, the
Indonesia island,

00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:23.460 align:middle line:84%
they contacted
me, because Bali--

00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:28.510 align:middle line:84%
which is a destination
resort area--

00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:31.980 align:middle line:84%
the reason people came there was
because of the beautiful coral

00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:33.397 align:middle line:90%
and the beauty and everything.

00:52:33.397 --> 00:52:35.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, now, with thousands and
thousands of people there,

00:52:35.730 --> 00:52:38.370 align:middle line:84%
sewage going into the
sea, diesel fluid going

00:52:38.370 --> 00:52:40.620 align:middle line:84%
into the sea for
power and energy,

00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:43.410 align:middle line:84%
they are ruining the
place that people--

00:52:43.410 --> 00:52:45.840 align:middle line:84%
they're ruining what
people came there to see.

00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:49.200 align:middle line:84%
And Indonesia has, I don't
know, thousands of islands,

00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:51.270 align:middle line:84%
and they don't want the
rest of their islands

00:52:51.270 --> 00:52:54.170 align:middle line:90%
to be going in that direction.

00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:56.970 align:middle line:84%
They've got on to what
they call sustainability.

00:52:56.970 --> 00:52:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's an overused
word, and a lot of people

00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:00.220 align:middle line:90%
don't know what it means.

00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:03.150 align:middle line:84%
But they want to develop
the rest of the islands

00:53:03.150 --> 00:53:06.060 align:middle line:84%
in a more sustainable way,
so they don't get destroyed.

00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:10.290 align:middle line:84%
They heard, through the
internet, that we do this,

00:53:10.290 --> 00:53:13.980 align:middle line:90%
or we attempt to do this.

00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:15.600 align:middle line:90%
It's a 30 acre island.

00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:19.800 align:middle line:84%
I was offered a third of the
island to do whatever I want

00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:22.980 align:middle line:84%
and then help them do the
same on the other 20 acres.

00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:26.010 align:middle line:84%
So that's how we ended up
with the island in Indonesia.

00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:28.080 align:middle line:84%
And that situation
started something.

00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:30.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting offered land
all over the world right now

00:53:30.570 --> 00:53:33.010 align:middle line:90%
on those terms.

00:53:33.010 --> 00:53:35.430 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I don't care
if I own the land.

00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:38.310 align:middle line:84%
The agreement says I get to
use the land for 35 years.

00:53:38.310 --> 00:53:39.630 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's enough for me.

00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:41.526 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That should do it.

00:53:41.526 --> 00:53:44.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REYNOLDS: So that's
the other thing.

00:53:44.690 --> 00:53:47.370 align:middle line:84%
We don't care who owns
the building or the land

00:53:47.370 --> 00:53:48.240 align:middle line:90%
or anything.

00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:49.830 align:middle line:84%
We want the building
to be there.

00:53:49.830 --> 00:53:51.430 align:middle line:90%
We want people to use it.

00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:53.430 align:middle line:90%
I was just in Puerto Rico.

00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And there, we had funders,
big corporations considering

00:53:59.340 --> 00:54:01.080 align:middle line:90%
funding us to go there.

00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And when they found out
we didn't know or care

00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:08.340 align:middle line:84%
who owned the land or who was
going to own the building,

00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:10.860 align:middle line:84%
we were just doing it
involving a bunch of people

00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:13.350 align:middle line:84%
and making it
happen, they said, we

00:54:13.350 --> 00:54:17.610 align:middle line:84%
can't function under
these loose situations.

00:54:17.610 --> 00:54:19.170 align:middle line:90%
And so we're funded.

00:54:19.170 --> 00:54:21.170 align:middle line:84%
We're getting funded
by people themselves.

00:54:21.170 --> 00:54:23.510 align:middle line:84%
People all over the
world are coming

00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:26.870 align:middle line:84%
and paying to come and help
us, and that funds the project.

00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:36.230 align:middle line:84%
So we're learning a way to
not be inhibited in any way,

00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:39.740 align:middle line:84%
to move through this
planet with a virus.

00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:43.040 align:middle line:90%
And so we're still learning.

00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:45.080 align:middle line:84%
We're way into
learning at this point.

00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:47.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, in the
Southwest, in particular,

00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:50.510 align:middle line:84%
it's not uncommon for people
to have a piece of land

00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:53.789 align:middle line:84%
and have a home but then
want to put a yurt or a kiva,

00:54:53.789 --> 00:54:54.830 align:middle line:90%
or something on the land.

00:54:54.830 --> 00:54:57.710 align:middle line:84%
So that also falls in alignment
with what you're saying.

00:54:57.710 --> 00:54:59.810 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's not your
primary dwelling,

00:54:59.810 --> 00:55:01.820 align:middle line:84%
to be able to create
these spaces--

00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:04.400 align:middle line:84%
maybe as an office, maybe
as a meditation space,

00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:06.860 align:middle line:84%
maybe as a guest
house for someone--

00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:09.950 align:middle line:84%
all these are within
possibility, right?

00:55:09.950 --> 00:55:12.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REYNOLDS: Yeah,
and we're learning

00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:16.530 align:middle line:90%
that you can't be a purist.

00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:19.190 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to go and
be a purist, and I

00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:22.730 align:middle line:84%
got all kinds of feedback,
blowback, and pushback.

00:55:22.730 --> 00:55:29.390 align:middle line:84%
But if I can take this
and make it not so pure,

00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:32.780 align:middle line:84%
make it just in the direction
of what I think is right,

00:55:32.780 --> 00:55:34.760 align:middle line:90%
then it can be accepted.

00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:39.020 align:middle line:84%
And you have to make things
palatable, not just to people

00:55:39.020 --> 00:55:40.700 align:middle line:84%
themselves, but you
have to make things

00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:43.610 align:middle line:90%
palatable to the powers that be.

00:55:43.610 --> 00:55:49.010 align:middle line:84%
You can't scare people with an
absolutely radical new idea.

00:55:49.010 --> 00:55:50.927 align:middle line:84%
You have to give it to
them very, very slowly.

00:55:50.927 --> 00:55:53.385 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So where are some
other places in the world right

00:55:53.385 --> 00:55:54.950 align:middle line:84%
now you're being
offered these lands?

00:55:54.950 --> 00:56:02.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REYNOLDS: India, in
Columbia, Australia.

00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:06.170 align:middle line:84%
I just was in
Australia and found

00:56:06.170 --> 00:56:08.360 align:middle line:84%
by going to the places
and them knowing--

00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:10.640 align:middle line:84%
they know about what we're
doing from the internet.

00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:13.322 align:middle line:90%


00:56:13.322 --> 00:56:15.530 align:middle line:84%
I could move there and live
there the rest of my life

00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:19.880 align:middle line:84%
and build the rest of
my life without permits.

00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:24.460 align:middle line:84%
There are many places
all over the planet

00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:28.680 align:middle line:84%
that we could do this, but
I don't want to stay there.

00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:30.950 align:middle line:84%
I can't just escape
to those places.

00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:34.100 align:middle line:84%
I've got to come back and try to
hammer it out in New York City.

00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And we are actually
doing sketches

00:56:36.380 --> 00:56:40.080 align:middle line:84%
for a project in New York City
that may or may not make it.

00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:44.180 align:middle line:84%
But it is important
to know, for me

00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:48.835 align:middle line:84%
to know, that I'm not
stuck by trying to do it

00:56:48.835 --> 00:56:50.210 align:middle line:84%
where it doesn't
want to be done,

00:56:50.210 --> 00:56:53.180 align:middle line:84%
because I got options to
do it where it can be done.

00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:54.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good for you.

00:56:54.570 --> 00:56:56.900 align:middle line:84%
So right now, what is
lighting your jets the most?

00:56:56.900 --> 00:56:59.180 align:middle line:84%
Your academy is-- how
many people a year

00:56:59.180 --> 00:57:01.130 align:middle line:84%
are you training,
basically, right now?

00:57:01.130 --> 00:57:04.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REYNOLDS: We have
about seven sessions

00:57:04.250 --> 00:57:07.790 align:middle line:84%
of 40 people, something
around 300 people a year.

00:57:07.790 --> 00:57:10.830 align:middle line:10%
And then they're from
all over the world.

00:57:10.830 --> 00:57:12.080 align:middle line:10%
So it's just crescendoing.

00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:16.640 align:middle line:10%
It is growing so that if
we want to put together

00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:20.480 align:middle line:10%
a very big project, we could
call together a couple thousand

00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:22.070 align:middle line:10%
people, and they'd come.

00:57:22.070 --> 00:57:25.110 align:middle line:10%
And they'd do it, and they
want to make a career of it.

00:57:25.110 --> 00:57:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And so it's getting
pretty exciting

00:57:27.410 --> 00:57:29.240 align:middle line:90%
to see where it's heading.

00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:32.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I just
have to say, thank you

00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:34.220 align:middle line:84%
on behalf of everyone,
that you've taken your life

00:57:34.220 --> 00:57:37.280 align:middle line:84%
to create this kind of
sustainability and beauty

00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:38.510 align:middle line:90%
for everybody.

00:57:38.510 --> 00:57:39.860 align:middle line:90%
I just love what you're doing.

00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:40.970 align:middle line:90%
You're a true inspiration.

00:57:40.970 --> 00:57:41.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REYNOLDS: Thanks.

00:57:41.770 --> 00:57:43.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you, Mike.

Earthship.

00:57:55.790 --> 00:57:57.950 align:middle line:10%
It's so refreshing to see
this kind of commitment.

00:57:57.950 --> 00:57:59.120 align:middle line:10%
It's running so deep.

00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:01.340 align:middle line:10%
And the intrinsic
beauty involved in this

00:58:01.340 --> 00:58:02.600 align:middle line:10%
is unsurpassed.

00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:04.850 align:middle line:84%
