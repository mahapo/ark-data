>>REGINA MEREDITH:
The afterlife is

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.570 align:middle line:10%
a source of great
mystery to human beings.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.169 align:middle line:84%
Throughout every
culture in history,

00:00:33.169 --> 00:00:34.960 align:middle line:84%
they've had their own
understanding of what

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.490 align:middle line:90%
that experience is like.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.490 align:middle line:84%
Mark Mirabello has been
digging deep into this research

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.470 align:middle line:84%
in his book, called
"A Traveler's Guide

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.640 align:middle line:90%
to the Afterlife."

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.670 align:middle line:84%
We're starting this conversation
with a strange dedication

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:46.780 align:middle line:90%
at the front of this book.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.490 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't
mind, Mark, I'm going

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.500 align:middle line:84%
to read it, because
I thought, what--

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.730 align:middle line:84%
what is he talking-- what
does he mean by this?

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:53.160 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MARK MIRABELLO:
Yes, very good.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:54.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.140 align:middle line:84%
"In an underground Mithraic
temple in Sarrebourg, France,

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.240 align:middle line:84%
archaeologists discovered
a human skeleton chained

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.320 align:middle line:90%
to the altar.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.200 align:middle line:84%
The door was found blocked,
so the nameless follower

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.470 align:middle line:84%
of Mithras had died
alone in the darkness.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.770 align:middle line:84%
To the unknown individual who
was murdered for his religion,

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.320 align:middle line:90%
I dedicate this book."

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wow,
that is powerful.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.920 align:middle line:90%
No less than Mithraic tradition.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.240 align:middle line:90%
What was this about?

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.510 align:middle line:10%
>>MIRABELLO: Well, the
message was, first of all,

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.600 align:middle line:10%
I thought it was an
interesting hook, so to speak,

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.860 align:middle line:10%
that would draw the reader in.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:24.490 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: It did.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.770 align:middle line:10%
>>MIRABELLO: And I was trying
to make the point that we were

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.140 align:middle line:10%
going to, in the course of
the book, through the travel,

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.270 align:middle line:10%
if you will, study all
kinds of traditions.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.220 align:middle line:84%
There is a tendency to assume
that right way/wrong way,

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.080 align:middle line:90%
wrong way/right way.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.250 align:middle line:84%
But the book, I try to explore
many, many, many different

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.050 align:middle line:90%
traditions.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.540 align:middle line:84%
We know about 3,500
known societies.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: And I
also try to study

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.460 align:middle line:84%
even some extinct
religions and so forth.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.340 align:middle line:84%
So modern religions
are discussed,

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.230 align:middle line:84%
traditional religions
are discussed,

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.660 align:middle line:84%
dead religions are discussed,
and in fact, I also

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.450 align:middle line:84%
tried to include a few
points from sciences.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.030 align:middle line:84%
And even for-- people would
discover while reading

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.690 align:middle line:84%
the book, even if
there is no God--

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm not trying to say that--
even if we do not have

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:06.730 align:middle line:90%
an immortal soul--

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.229 align:middle line:90%
I am not trying to say that--

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.590 align:middle line:84%
it's possible that we have
a continued existence.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.440 align:middle line:90%
And so I thought--

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.270 align:middle line:84%
and also the powerful message
of the way that person died.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: And I should
throw in that because scholars

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.380 align:middle line:84%
dislike the sensational, many
anthropologists have tried

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.830 align:middle line:84%
to argue, and historians, that
that's not as it appears--

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.640 align:middle line:84%
that that body was placed
there to contaminate the site.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.650 align:middle line:90%
It was a sacred site to Mithras.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And by putting a
body in there, they

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.260 align:middle line:90%
were driving out the demon.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260 align:middle line:84%
Because in monotheism,
there is only a god.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.700 align:middle line:90%
Everything else is demonic.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.083 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: But I
disagree with that.

00:02:43.083 --> 00:02:45.310 align:middle line:84%
Clearly this was someone
who was murdered.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And every religion
can have its martyrs.

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:48.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And the Mithraic
tradition is one

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.100 align:middle line:84%
that's been largely
lost to humanity today,

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.810 align:middle line:84%
so it has a lot of interesting
historical connotations

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:57.610 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And getting into
this whole subject,

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.477 align:middle line:84%
we can't do that without
getting into you a little bit.

00:03:01.477 --> 00:03:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And you say toward the
beginning of the book

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.630 align:middle line:90%
that you have cancer.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: It's really
curious, because all my life,

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.560 align:middle line:84%
I've been interested in
the history of thought.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And this is the really
ultimate question--

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.790 align:middle line:90%
what happens to us when we die.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:14.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: And after
my father's death,

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.090 align:middle line:84%
this really was the final spark
to start working in this area,

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.860 align:middle line:84%
because frankly I wanted to
see him again, and my mother.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:25.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: And I thought,
we must prepare for this.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And then in the course
of the research,

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.410 align:middle line:90%
I discovered I had cancer.

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.430 align:middle line:84%
It's multiple myeloma,
which is a blood cancer.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just tell us what
that is and how that works.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: It's
just a blood cancer.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.880 align:middle line:90%
It can--

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is it kind
of like leukemia?

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: It's a cousin
of it, very similar.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.310 align:middle line:90%
They're different.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And oddly enough-- and I
consider myself educated--

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.240 align:middle line:84%
I'd never heard of it
till I had the diagnosis.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.497 align:middle line:84%
And initially the symptoms
are rather curious.

00:03:55.497 --> 00:03:57.080 align:middle line:84%
That's what brought
me to the doctor--

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What were they?

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: My eye was
starting to bulge, my left eye.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And literally at one
point, when I would blink,

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.220 align:middle line:84%
the eyelashes were
touching my spectacles.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.630 align:middle line:84%
And then also, I developed what
I thought was a stiff neck.

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, it turned out, because
this attacks the bones,

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.660 align:middle line:84%
I have-- in fact, even now
I've got a broken neck,

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.339 align:middle line:90%
and I'm just living with it.

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And the eye, they were
actually able to treat that.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.487 align:middle line:84%
It was sort of a blood
tumor behind the eye.

00:04:25.487 --> 00:04:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And it was quite
remarkable, because I

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.710 align:middle line:84%
went through a period of
this radiation therapy.

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.262 align:middle line:84%
And without losing any
sight or even altering--

00:04:33.262 --> 00:04:34.062 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Amazing.

00:04:34.062 --> 00:04:35.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: --my eye
went back to normal.

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, before that
happened, I starting

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.046 align:middle line:84%
to look like a 1950s
cheap horror film.

00:04:42.046 --> 00:04:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And I think, oddly
enough, that's

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:44.830 align:middle line:84%
what brought me into
the doctor's office,

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.746 align:middle line:84%
because I always joke,
I don't mind being sick

00:04:46.746 --> 00:04:47.737 align:middle line:90%
as long as I look good.

00:04:47.737 --> 00:04:49.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.046 align:middle line:84%
Better to look good
than feel good, right?

00:04:51.046 --> 00:04:52.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: Yes, yes.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.500 align:middle line:84%
So that brought me
in and in a sense

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.710 align:middle line:84%
saved my life, because
they can't cure it,

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.390 align:middle line:90%
but they can control it.

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And they're giving me these
really expensive drugs.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And I've been able to complete
the book, buy a house,

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.392 align:middle line:90%
get married, and--

00:05:06.392 --> 00:05:07.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You've done it all.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.516 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: Yes, yes.

00:05:08.516 --> 00:05:12.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you think that
living with that condition

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.267 align:middle line:84%
at the base of your
life and knowing--

00:05:14.267 --> 00:05:15.850 align:middle line:84%
you're not sure
exactly how it's going

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.670 align:middle line:84%
to turn out, except
that you can manage it

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:18.670 align:middle line:90%
and you are managing it.

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.070 align:middle line:84%
You've already outlived what
they thought to begin with.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.130 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that that inspired
you to dive into life so deeply

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:25.610 align:middle line:90%
and with such relish?

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:26.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: Yes.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.240 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, it made
me grow up, because I

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.942 align:middle line:90%
was a bachelor all those years.

00:05:29.942 --> 00:05:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And I was living in an
apartment with literally

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:32.980 align:middle line:90%
plastic furniture.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.140 align:middle line:90%
I was sitting on lawn furniture.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.930 align:middle line:90%
And it made me grow up.

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.660 align:middle line:84%
I found the perfect woman
that I had loved for years,

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:41.980 align:middle line:90%
and she loved me.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And it just, I thought--
we have to grow up and make

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.640 align:middle line:90%
this choice.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.610 align:middle line:84%
And the houses, I couldn't
have put my perfect wife

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:49.575 align:middle line:90%
in the ugly apartment.

00:05:49.575 --> 00:05:51.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it was
lawn chair furniture.

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:52.570 align:middle line:84%
No, I don't think she
would have stuck around.

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:53.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: That's
the furniture too.

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:54.750 align:middle line:90%
That's her influence.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:55.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.800 align:middle line:84%
So it really pushed you into
making some bold decisions,

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.590 align:middle line:84%
stepping up into life, which
you hear about a lot with people

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:04.630 align:middle line:84%
who, for example, find they
actually have a very short time

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:05.430 align:middle line:90%
to live.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:06.940 align:middle line:84%
It's like they start
living suddenly

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:08.500 align:middle line:84%
like a bat out of
hell, everything

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.540 align:middle line:84%
they've held back
from themselves.

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And I find that journey
itself fascinating.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.360 align:middle line:90%
I did something similar.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.160 align:middle line:90%
It was crazy.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.890 align:middle line:84%
When I was 27 years old,
I didn't know anything

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:19.450 align:middle line:84%
about anything,
except that I knew

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:20.825 align:middle line:84%
if there were any
lumps anywhere,

00:06:20.825 --> 00:06:21.760 align:middle line:90%
you were going to die.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.620 align:middle line:90%
I thought I knew that, right?

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.030 align:middle line:90%
And I was on a trip in Europe.

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:26.530 align:middle line:90%
And I discovered this.

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.139 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh
my god, this is

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:29.680 align:middle line:84%
the first couple of
days of the trip,

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.001 align:middle line:90%
and I had three weeks to go.

00:06:31.001 --> 00:06:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't say
anything to anyone.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.070 align:middle line:84%
But of course, falling asleep at
night, I'm gonna be dying soon.

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And I did live like
a bat out of hell.

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.980 align:middle line:90%
I did anything I wanted.

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.672 align:middle line:84%
And I cried when I said
goodbye to my sister, thinking,

00:06:44.672 --> 00:06:45.880 align:middle line:90%
oh, I'll never see her again.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.081 align:middle line:84%
It was really quite a
dramatic 27-year-old scenario

00:06:49.081 --> 00:06:50.080 align:middle line:90%
that was all in my head.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.454 align:middle line:84%
As it turned out,
it was nothing.

00:06:51.454 --> 00:06:55.330 align:middle line:84%
But just brushing up
with the potential of it

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:59.180 align:middle line:84%
showed me how I'd been
holding back in my own life.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:06:59.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: 27.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.420 align:middle line:90%
That was three years ago?

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:02.753 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, three years ago.

00:07:02.753 --> 00:07:06.130 align:middle line:90%
Exactly, in a couple of months.

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:08.650 align:middle line:84%
So it sounds like
in a more sane way,

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:11.200 align:middle line:84%
you chose to mature into
the things you've been

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.660 align:middle line:90%
holding yourself back from.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: It's
probably my personality.

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:15.790 align:middle line:84%
I know it's
difficult to believe,

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:20.350 align:middle line:84%
as I tell my college
students, I'm not a partier.

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:22.712 align:middle line:84%
Although I do tell them on
occasion regarding dance,

00:07:22.712 --> 00:07:24.170 align:middle line:84%
I like to shake it
out on occasion.

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:25.379 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, there you go.

00:07:25.379 --> 00:07:26.878 align:middle line:84%
So you shook it
out, and you married

00:07:26.878 --> 00:07:28.240 align:middle line:90%
this beautiful, beautiful woman.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.915 align:middle line:84%
And she seems like
an angel herself.

00:07:29.915 --> 00:07:30.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: Oh, yes.

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:32.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And so here you are.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And so how did that
play into your writing

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.540 align:middle line:84%
this book, that
sense of mortality?

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:38.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: Oh.

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:39.720 align:middle line:90%
Well, it basically focused--

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.420 align:middle line:84%
I have a tendency to
never stop the research.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.380 align:middle line:84%
I just keep going
and going and going.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And this convinced
me that I had to--

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.040 align:middle line:84%
I literally thought
at one point,

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.891 align:middle line:84%
they gave me as little,
as few as two years.

00:07:50.891 --> 00:07:52.390 align:middle line:84%
So I thought I'd
better finish this.

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:55.550 align:middle line:84%
So it put some fire under me,
and I started to focus and say,

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:56.860 align:middle line:90%
this has to stop.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:58.897 align:middle line:84%
My trouble is, I do
everything backward

00:07:58.897 --> 00:07:59.980 align:middle line:90%
when it comes to research.

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:03.020 align:middle line:84%
Most people will first pitch
the idea, sell the book.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:03.820 align:middle line:90%
I don't do that.

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.440 align:middle line:90%
I write the book.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.570 align:middle line:84%
And plus, I never
know how the book

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:11.830 align:middle line:84%
will be until it's finished,
because it grows organically.

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:14.170 align:middle line:84%
And so this is why
this one-- which

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:17.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm really proud of, because
I view all these as children.

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:19.240 align:middle line:90%
And this is a special child.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It is indeed, and a
tremendous amount of research

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:23.110 align:middle line:90%
embedded in here.

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:24.550 align:middle line:90%
This is amazing.

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:29.140 align:middle line:84%
So after you went through
all of this research

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:31.430 align:middle line:84%
and you delved into the
different countries and belief

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:34.270 align:middle line:84%
systems, what was the
thing that maybe popped out

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:38.076 align:middle line:84%
and surprised you most
within this research?

00:08:38.076 --> 00:08:40.659 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: To tell the truth,
I don't think I was surprised.

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:43.289 align:middle line:84%
Because I've been doing this so
long and reading this so long,

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:45.100 align:middle line:90%
and perhaps there's a sense of--

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:46.510 align:middle line:84%
just like the
heroin addict who's

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:50.580 align:middle line:84%
constantly taking the drug,
it's difficult to get the rush.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:54.820 align:middle line:84%
And so I realized going
in that there's just

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:56.990 align:middle line:90%
a wide number of traditions.

00:08:56.990 --> 00:09:00.580 align:middle line:84%
Buddha talks about 84,000
paths to enlightenment.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And what I was trying to
do, though, is simplify.

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:07.824 align:middle line:84%
So many professors
complicate things.

00:09:07.824 --> 00:09:09.407 align:middle line:84%
They take the simple
and complicate it

00:09:09.407 --> 00:09:10.750 align:middle line:84%
and think that's
intellectualism.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:11.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.000 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: I like to take
the complex and make it simple.

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:14.176 align:middle line:90%
And that's--

00:09:14.176 --> 00:09:15.259 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Congratulations.

00:09:15.259 --> 00:09:19.319 align:middle line:84%
I thank you on behalf of
all your students for that.

00:09:19.319 --> 00:09:21.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: But by the way,
another point in the book,

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:22.780 align:middle line:90%
I never really try to--

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:27.040 align:middle line:84%
I hope I succeed in this--
sell any agenda, that I

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.470 align:middle line:84%
want equal treatment
of everything,

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:31.450 align:middle line:84%
because I think people
should have information

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:32.994 align:middle line:90%
to make an informed choice.

00:09:32.994 --> 00:09:34.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I was
trying to achieve.

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:35.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You did.

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.820 align:middle line:84%
You didn't load it
any direction at all.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.210 align:middle line:84%
But what you did is toward
the beginning of the book,

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:43.600 align:middle line:84%
you had all these assumptions
that we, across the world,

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.650 align:middle line:90%
have about death itself.

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:47.500 align:middle line:84%
What happens after
death, in the afterlife?

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.120 align:middle line:84%
And so what I
thought we'd do is go

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.230 align:middle line:90%
into some of those assumptions.

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:51.063 align:middle line:90%
You have 50 of them.

00:09:51.063 --> 00:09:52.570 align:middle line:90%
We can't do all 50 of them.

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:55.670 align:middle line:84%
So I just kind of picked
and chose, so to speak.

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:57.490 align:middle line:90%
So let's start into them.

00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And the first one I have here
is that, number one, the dead,

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.690 align:middle line:84%
don't assume-- so every one of
these sentences will begin with

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:05.530 align:middle line:90%
"don't assume that"--

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:07.830 align:middle line:84%
the death experience is
the same for everyone.

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:08.630 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:08.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: Yes.

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:10.785 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
pretty much acknowledged

00:10:10.785 --> 00:10:12.777 align:middle line:84%
by just the breadth
of your research.

00:10:12.777 --> 00:10:14.110 align:middle line:90%
Now let's go into the specifics.

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:17.440 align:middle line:84%
Don't assume that the dead know
where they are once they've

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.630 align:middle line:90%
passed out of the physical.

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:21.130 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that for a bit.

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:22.838 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: That's
an interesting point.

00:10:22.838 --> 00:10:25.749 align:middle line:90%
I think we often ignore that.

00:10:25.749 --> 00:10:28.040 align:middle line:84%
And again, when you're talking
from Eastern traditions,

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:29.498 align:middle line:84%
they understand
this automatically.

00:10:29.498 --> 00:10:31.850 align:middle line:84%
This was more of
a Western setback.

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:33.350 align:middle line:84%
Because they point
out, they believe

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:34.790 align:middle line:90%
in transmigration of souls.

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:37.340 align:middle line:84%
But they don't remember
their previous lives.

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:39.500 align:middle line:84%
But they also talk
about someone may

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.600 align:middle line:84%
be in a hellish
existence-- for example,

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.630 align:middle line:84%
in Hinduism and Buddhism--
and not really realize

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:48.590 align:middle line:84%
what got them there, just
as, for example, if someone

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:52.700 align:middle line:84%
is born, the famous statement,
a young girl in the palace

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:56.750 align:middle line:84%
of kings, which is supposed
to be a positive rebirth,

00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:01.430 align:middle line:84%
she won't remember what
she did to get there.

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And when she's there,
there's also the issue of,

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:08.080 align:middle line:84%
we have no idea, in
fact, where we are now.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.380 align:middle line:84%
There's a Greek notion
I also refer to,

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:14.130 align:middle line:84%
Euripides said, we
could be dead now,

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:16.675 align:middle line:84%
that the Cathars in the Middle
Ages, who were considered

00:11:16.675 --> 00:11:19.700 align:middle line:84%
a medieval heresy, they thought,
actually, this is really hell.

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:21.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is hell,
and the other side is life.

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:22.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: Yes.

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's very possible
that we could be--

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:27.230 align:middle line:84%
when we die here,
we so fear death,

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:28.930 align:middle line:90%
but we could be going to life.

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:30.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.004 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: And they
notice, for example--

00:11:32.004 --> 00:11:33.420 align:middle line:84%
the ancient Greeks,
in particular,

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:36.900 align:middle line:84%
notice that, oddly enough,
the most traumatic experience,

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:39.650 align:middle line:84%
unless we die in a
really colorful way,

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:43.000 align:middle line:84%
the most horrifying experience
we've had will be our births.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, we tend, properly speaking,
to focus on the mother,

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:47.990 align:middle line:84%
because it's really
traumatic for the mother.

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:50.240 align:middle line:84%
But the child also goes
through horrible trauma.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:54.020 align:middle line:84%
He's in a dark, warm,
protected place,

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:56.510 align:middle line:84%
and then suddenly he's
thrust into this place of--

00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:57.385 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Separation.

00:11:57.385 --> 00:11:59.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: --light,
noise, so forth.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.920 align:middle line:90%
And so the Greeks thought--

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.320 align:middle line:84%
and they also, I should
mention, pointed out that death,

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.694 align:middle line:84%
strangely enough, especially
violent deaths-- now, again,

00:12:05.694 --> 00:12:08.930 align:middle line:84%
not to encourage the
audience to do this--

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:11.120 align:middle line:84%
appear to be
virtually pleasurable.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:13.160 align:middle line:84%
And in fact they will
notice that soldiers

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.710 align:middle line:84%
on the battlefield will die
in a state of sexual arousal.

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:16.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:17.660 align:middle line:90%
I read that.

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:20.810 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little bit about what
the Greeks said was actually

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:24.240 align:middle line:84%
happening at this point of
leaving the body in this highly

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.040 align:middle line:90%
charged--

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.170 align:middle line:84%
obviously, there's a lot
of adrenaline in battle,

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:28.400 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:29.445 align:middle line:90%
What did they say this?

00:12:29.445 --> 00:12:31.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: Well, oddly enough,
there's a widespread notion--

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:32.540 align:middle line:90%
now, it's not universal.

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:36.740 align:middle line:84%
Some cultures will endorse the
natural death from old age,

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:39.080 align:middle line:84%
dying in your sleep
is the best way.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:43.454 align:middle line:84%
But many cultures argue that
a violent death-- now again,

00:12:43.454 --> 00:12:45.120 align:middle line:84%
not to encourage this
with the audience.

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:48.780 align:middle line:84%
But a violent death releases
the soul in a purer state.

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:50.510 align:middle line:90%
Heraclitus refers to this.

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:52.170 align:middle line:90%
And it's more powerful.

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:54.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, in contrast,
in Nigeria, there's

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:56.300 align:middle line:84%
the idea that if someone
who dies of old age

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:59.960 align:middle line:84%
has a strong soul because
they've lived so long--

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:01.820 align:middle line:84%
so again, we don't know
the correct answer.

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:05.230 align:middle line:84%
But there is-- and I should
mention, I do refer to this.

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:07.790 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes, there seems
to be, you could argue,

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:11.630 align:middle line:84%
an agenda going on,
especially attached to ethics.

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:14.230 align:middle line:84%
They're encouraging
certain behavior patterns.

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:16.474 align:middle line:90%
A warrior culture, the Aztecs--

00:13:16.474 --> 00:13:18.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're going to
elevate the experience of death

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:20.810 align:middle line:84%
at the end of a sword,
a bayonet, or whatnot.

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:21.610 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: Yes.

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:24.050 align:middle line:90%
The Aztecs, Medieval Vikings.

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:27.680 align:middle line:84%
Medieval Vikings refer to
the straw death with disdain.

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.530 align:middle line:90%
It's old age or sickness in bed.

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:31.990 align:middle line:90%
They slept on straw.

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:32.790 align:middle line:90%
So they're trying--

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:34.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a very
good point you're making.

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:35.540 align:middle line:90%
It's a social statement.

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:37.852 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: Yes So I
kind of caution regarding

00:13:37.852 --> 00:13:38.810 align:middle line:90%
this ethical component.

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:42.664 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we don't really see
ethics appear in the afterlife

00:13:42.664 --> 00:13:44.330 align:middle line:84%
until you reach the
civilizations, which

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.310 align:middle line:90%
makes it rather suspicious.

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:47.370 align:middle line:90%
Not that it's not true.

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:49.411 align:middle line:84%
I'm not trying to say
people go out there and sin

00:13:49.411 --> 00:13:51.892 align:middle line:84%
because they read it
in my book, it's OK.

00:13:51.892 --> 00:13:53.600 align:middle line:84%
But there seems to be
a connection that--

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:56.290 align:middle line:84%
because ordinary
poor people will say,

00:13:56.290 --> 00:14:00.920 align:middle line:84%
like, why is this person
wealthy and beautiful,

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:05.380 align:middle line:84%
and I'm ugly and misery
and living in squalor?

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:08.370 align:middle line:84%
But if society teaches
them, well, just be strong

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:12.020 align:middle line:84%
and in the next life,
that rich, powerful person

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:14.270 align:middle line:84%
will be miserable
and you'll be happy.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:15.950 align:middle line:84%
But it is rather
suspicious that it

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:19.250 align:middle line:84%
does seem to enter
when civilization does.

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:21.326 align:middle line:84%
And also what's
rather curious is--

00:14:21.326 --> 00:14:23.450 align:middle line:84%
and I think Americans are
especially prone to this,

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:25.460 align:middle line:90%
and Western Europeans--

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:29.570 align:middle line:84%
we assume, like Immanuel
Kant and Socrates,

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:32.420 align:middle line:84%
moral absolutism,
that what is good

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:34.220 align:middle line:90%
is always good in every context.

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:35.550 align:middle line:90%
But that's not the case.

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:38.570 align:middle line:90%
It's a function of how we live.

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:41.660 align:middle line:84%
Being humble and
loving and nonviolent

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:45.470 align:middle line:84%
will not work if you're
an Eskimo or Inuit

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:48.470 align:middle line:84%
hunter in the Arctic
in the 18th century.

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:51.450 align:middle line:84%
You're on the edge of
death, people depend on you.

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:52.450 align:middle line:90%
And you must be violent.

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:54.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's more a
matter of civilization,

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:57.950 align:middle line:84%
civilizing society so they can
get on together peacefully.

00:14:57.950 --> 00:14:59.980 align:middle line:84%
But that isn't appropriate
in all situations.

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:00.740 align:middle line:90%
That's what you're saying.

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:01.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: Exactly.

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:02.738 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
would carry over

00:15:02.738 --> 00:15:05.120 align:middle line:84%
into the death scenario
as well then, right?

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: Yes.

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:10.130 align:middle line:84%
And for example, in
our culture, the death

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:12.406 align:middle line:84%
in honor of-- let's
say, a generous death.

00:15:12.406 --> 00:15:14.780 align:middle line:84%
That would be probably the
highest in the Judeo-Christian

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:17.820 align:middle line:84%
tradition, where you die on
behalf of someone else to save

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:18.620 align:middle line:90%
them--

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:20.610 align:middle line:84%
which you also see in
Buddhism, for example.

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:24.110 align:middle line:84%
That brings you-- if
your last thing you do

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:26.190 align:middle line:84%
is to help someone
else, you will be

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:28.002 align:middle line:90%
reborn as a god or a goddess.

00:15:28.002 --> 00:15:29.460 align:middle line:84%
By the way, you
can switch genders.

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:32.640 align:middle line:84%
You won't always be female,
I won't always be male.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And while I'm on
it, I should mention

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:37.230 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of confusion
regarding reincarnation

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:40.560 align:middle line:84%
in the West and
transmigration of souls.

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:41.970 align:middle line:90%
We're too linear about it.

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:44.910 align:middle line:84%
We think that, for
example, our next lives

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:46.710 align:middle line:90%
will be in the future.

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:49.260 align:middle line:84%
But the Hindus call
it Brahma time.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.647 align:middle line:90%
All time exists simultaneously--

00:15:52.647 --> 00:15:53.730 align:middle line:90%
past, present, and future.

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:56.050 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere your
great-great-grandfather

00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:58.210 align:middle line:90%
is a two-year-old.

00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:01.080 align:middle line:90%
Somewhere you're 14 years old.

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:03.120 align:middle line:90%
Somewhere you're much older.

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:03.920 align:middle line:90%
Somewhere--

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:06.522 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So these incarnations
are existing simultaneously?

00:16:06.522 --> 00:16:08.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: Well, what can
happen is your next life,

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:11.720 align:middle line:84%
you may be actually
a Roman soldier

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:15.810 align:middle line:84%
standing at the foot of
the cross, your next life.

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:17.820 align:middle line:84%
Your next life,
you may be actually

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:22.290 align:middle line:84%
2,000 years in the future
on a Martian colony.

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:24.270 align:middle line:84%
You can be born any
time, any place.

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:25.770 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in the
East, they actually

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:29.149 align:middle line:84%
think there are other inhabited
worlds, and you may go there.

00:16:29.149 --> 00:16:30.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's another
important point,

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:33.690 align:middle line:84%
is your next life tends to
be-- especially Buddhism, it's

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:36.975 align:middle line:84%
really clear, is determined
by your very last thing--

00:16:36.975 --> 00:16:38.640 align:middle line:90%
so you talked about death.

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:41.130 align:middle line:84%
What you're doing
at the end will

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:43.230 align:middle line:90%
determine your very next life.

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:47.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, you normally don't escape
karmic consequences, they say.

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.320 align:middle line:84%
So if you commit a
crime, you will be

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.490 align:middle line:90%
paying for that at some point.

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:53.827 align:middle line:90%
But let's say you are--

00:16:53.827 --> 00:16:54.660 align:middle line:90%
I shouldn't say you.

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:57.110 align:middle line:84%
Let's say someone
is a serial killer

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:58.740 align:middle line:84%
and has killed many,
many people and

00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:01.060 align:middle line:90%
committed horrible atrocities.

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:04.859 align:middle line:84%
If at the very end he's
rescuing a four-year-old child

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:07.900 align:middle line:84%
from a fire and
dies as a result,

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:10.680 align:middle line:84%
he can come back as a
god in the next life.

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.599 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's rather
curious to us,

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:16.260 align:middle line:84%
because we tend to have this
idea that you live one life,

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:19.569 align:middle line:84%
and it'll be added up and
subtracted, good and evil,

00:17:19.569 --> 00:17:22.020 align:middle line:84%
and you go forever
into heaven or hell.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:25.740 align:middle line:84%
In Jainism, the future
pathfinder, the Jains,

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:28.560 align:middle line:84%
which come from India,
they teach at some point,

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.630 align:middle line:84%
humans will become so
corrupt-- and by the way,

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:middle line:90%
they think of time as circular--

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:36.750 align:middle line:84%
humans will become so corrupt
that religion will disappear,

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:39.510 align:middle line:84%
we will be three feet
tall, we'll live 18 years,

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:41.040 align:middle line:90%
and we'll be totally ignorant.

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:42.020 align:middle line:90%
We'll be like animals.

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:43.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yikes.

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:45.030 align:middle line:90%
That's real dystopian future.

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:45.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: Yes.

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:47.940 align:middle line:84%
When the circle
of time continues,

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:49.870 align:middle line:90%
it starts to improve.

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:52.560 align:middle line:84%
And one of the--
there's 24 pathfinders.

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:54.210 align:middle line:84%
They're kind of
similar to prophets

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:57.330 align:middle line:84%
in the Western tradition, except
they don't get information

00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:58.200 align:middle line:90%
from a god.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:01.800 align:middle line:84%
They discover it, kind of like
the way we think of science.

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And the next pathfinder
when the cycle returns,

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:10.332 align:middle line:84%
right now he's in
hell for a crime.

00:18:10.332 --> 00:18:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that I always
was interested in in some

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:16.890 align:middle line:84%
of these traditions is you're
never beyond redemption.

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:20.760 align:middle line:84%
You can always, shall we
say-- you may be punished

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.650 align:middle line:84%
for a crime, but
the Buddhist hell

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:26.190 align:middle line:84%
lasts 590 million years for
the most heinous crimes,

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:28.229 align:middle line:90%
but eventually you're out.

00:18:28.229 --> 00:18:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And I should mention, even
in Christian tradition

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:31.830 align:middle line:90%
you see this.

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:35.040 align:middle line:84%
The Mormons, Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints,

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.320 align:middle line:84%
have the concept, you
can escape from hell.

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:38.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: You can convert.

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:40.248 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I found
that interesting.

00:18:40.248 --> 00:18:41.190 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: Yes.

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:44.740 align:middle line:84%
So the idea that you're
never beyond redemption--

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:47.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, that's a
beautiful universal thought,

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:50.160 align:middle line:84%
though, that each one of
these religions, no matter how

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.470 align:middle line:84%
harsh and punishing
some of them may be,

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:54.870 align:middle line:84%
do believe that there is
time and there is grace.

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And one can always
recover themselves.

00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: Well, not to insert
my own ideas into the book,

00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:01.970 align:middle line:90%
but I have a feeling it's more--

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:07.140 align:middle line:84%
I like to think that, that
we can always, shall we say,

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:10.360 align:middle line:90%
repair the damage we've done.

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, I
should mention--

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:14.370 align:middle line:84%
this is often misunderstood
in the West as well-- people

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:19.920 align:middle line:84%
realize that we have literally
billions or trillions of lives,

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.730 align:middle line:84%
according to the Hindus
the Jains, the Buddhists.

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:24.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Their time
frames are so extensive,

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:26.520 align:middle line:90%
it's in the trillions of years.

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:31.777 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: And every completed
act produces a complete life.

00:19:31.777 --> 00:19:33.360 align:middle line:84%
So right now, during
this life, you're

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.990 align:middle line:84%
producing thousands
of other lives.

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:38.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you get some
traditions, such as Diamond

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.950 align:middle line:84%
Vehicle Buddhism, which
you find in Tibet,

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:42.390 align:middle line:90%
they try to, in a sense--

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:44.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean to be funny by
this, but game the system,

00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:46.770 align:middle line:90%
and escape in one life.

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:49.500 align:middle line:84%
There are teaching
techniques to escape all

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.490 align:middle line:90%
of these future consequences.

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:55.470 align:middle line:84%
But I think most Westerners
think that there's--

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:57.320 align:middle line:90%
again, thinking in our terms--

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.850 align:middle line:84%
that an individual lives
his, let's say, 90 years,

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:01.590 align:middle line:84%
and then they subtract
good and evil.

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:02.790 align:middle line:90%
And that produces one life.

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:04.740 align:middle line:84%
It's thousands and
thousands of lives.

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:05.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:07.970 align:middle line:84%
This whole notion-- again,
this is very Western--

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:10.820 align:middle line:84%
of thinking that we're
on a type of a soul

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:12.750 align:middle line:90%
progression of sorts--

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:14.820 align:middle line:84%
that you refined this
part of your thinking

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:16.920 align:middle line:84%
or your actions or
your life, and then

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:18.750 align:middle line:84%
that takes you onto
another opportunity

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:20.130 align:middle line:90%
to refine another part.

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And so it's kind of
like this flowing upward

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:27.750 align:middle line:84%
and onward into more
refinement, a potential

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:30.660 align:middle line:84%
for a different kind of choice
down the road somewhere.

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:33.450 align:middle line:84%
But what you're saying,
if I'm understanding it,

00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:36.832 align:middle line:84%
is all these time frames are
happening simultaneously.

00:20:36.832 --> 00:20:38.790 align:middle line:84%
If you're dipping into
what we know is the past

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:41.100 align:middle line:84%
and what we know
is the future, how

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:43.945 align:middle line:84%
could there be a progression
of anything, so to speak?

00:20:43.945 --> 00:20:45.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: Well, that's where
you get into these problems.

00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:47.520 align:middle line:84%
By the way, the progression,
especially found

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:49.478 align:middle line:84%
in a really modernist
faith, which oddly enough

00:20:49.478 --> 00:20:51.120 align:middle line:84%
comes from around
the Baha'i faith,

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:55.330 align:middle line:84%
which I really don't discuss
at length, because it's

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:56.460 align:middle line:90%
so modernist.

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And most people
just-- it's talking

00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:01.594 align:middle line:84%
about equal rights and no racism
and feminism and so forth.

00:21:01.594 --> 00:21:02.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's very Utopian.

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:04.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: Yes, yes.

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, even
Christian Scientists

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:07.380 align:middle line:90%
have a similar notion.

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:08.421 align:middle line:90%
I don't really get into--

00:21:08.421 --> 00:21:10.560 align:middle line:84%
I do have one quote from
them, but it's basically

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:13.560 align:middle line:84%
this idea of suffering is
not real, death is not real,

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:15.900 align:middle line:90%
we're going to progress.

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.100 align:middle line:90%
But it's unclear.

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:19.350 align:middle line:84%
Now incidentally,
I should mention,

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:21.560 align:middle line:84%
because I don't mean to
indicate that I'm just

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.310 align:middle line:84%
talking about some of
these unusual ideas,

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:26.550 align:middle line:84%
but Emanuel Swedenborg, which
I talk about in the book,

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:27.662 align:middle line:90%
he gives a really--

00:21:27.662 --> 00:21:29.370 align:middle line:84%
those interested in
Christian traditions,

00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:31.630 align:middle line:84%
he's a really interesting
person to discuss,

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:34.640 align:middle line:84%
or I should say
read, 18th century.

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:37.410 align:middle line:84%
And he gave all these
detailed descriptions as well

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:39.570 align:middle line:84%
as-- because we
just talked earlier,

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:42.360 align:middle line:84%
how can heaven and
hell exist forever?

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:44.040 align:middle line:84%
He has a really
rational explanation

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:46.080 align:middle line:84%
in a Christian context
how that could occur.

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.205 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, share that.

00:21:47.205 --> 00:21:50.100 align:middle line:84%
Because I have him on the
list to ask you about.

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:52.316 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: The notion is--

00:21:52.316 --> 00:21:55.740 align:middle line:84%
and by the way, I even mentioned
the really infamous character,

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:59.210 align:middle line:84%
Aleister Crowley, who actually
coins the term "drug fiend."

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:02.100 align:middle line:84%
He was a pansexual, having
sex with everything,

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:04.140 align:middle line:90%
including animals.

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:05.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not my
favorite character.

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:06.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: Yes.

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:08.640 align:middle line:84%
He talks about how he'd
be miserable in heaven

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:12.240 align:middle line:84%
because he likes the wild
women and the crimes.

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And oddly enough, Swedenborg
says that we actually gravitate

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:17.926 align:middle line:90%
according to our ruling love.

00:22:17.926 --> 00:22:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And I think he's right
on that, in one sense,

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:22.530 align:middle line:90%
that not everybody is the same.

00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And oddly enough, there
are, shall we say,

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:26.520 align:middle line:84%
Hell's Angels
types that would be

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:29.222 align:middle line:84%
miserable in a traditional
Christian heaven.

00:22:29.222 --> 00:22:30.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not enough
simulation, perhaps.

00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:31.730 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: Yes.

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And they kind of like biker
bars and they like fistfights

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.360 align:middle line:90%
and they like the wild girls.

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.420 align:middle line:84%
And other people like
the more placid life.

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:41.670 align:middle line:90%
Well, according to Swedenborg--

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:43.200 align:middle line:84%
he says that when
we die, most of us

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:46.069 align:middle line:84%
go to a world of spirits
for about 30 years,

00:22:46.069 --> 00:22:47.610 align:middle line:84%
where we see loved
ones and so forth.

00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:50.330 align:middle line:84%
But over time, we then
gravitate towards a ruling love.

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:53.070 align:middle line:84%
And he describes these
really clear visions

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:56.640 align:middle line:84%
of heavens where
there are actually

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:59.850 align:middle line:84%
beautiful homes and
clear, nice beautiful

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:03.530 align:middle line:84%
pastures and blue skies,
and all of these good people

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:04.330 align:middle line:90%
are living there.

00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:06.282 align:middle line:84%
They even have a
government, and so forth.

00:23:06.282 --> 00:23:07.740 align:middle line:84%
And they're doing
good, and they're

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:09.320 align:middle line:90%
very placid and peaceful.

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:10.810 align:middle line:90%
Then he describes these--

00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:13.840 align:middle line:84%
really, what look to us,
like almost violent crime--

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:15.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hellish realms, yes.

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:15.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: Yes.

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:18.050 align:middle line:84%
They look like urban
centers, and people there

00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:21.730 align:middle line:84%
are raping and attacking
and doing violence.

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And he said, just
as, for example,

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:28.780 align:middle line:84%
a frog would be miserable in
a beautiful spring pasture,

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:33.460 align:middle line:84%
he wants the swamp with its
slime and stench and insects

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:34.750 align:middle line:90%
that he can eat.

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:39.250 align:middle line:84%
An evil person will gravitate
towards a hellish realm,

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:41.230 align:middle line:90%
because that's what he wants.

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And according to
Swedenborg, it's

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:46.090 align:middle line:90%
not a god who sends us there.

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:48.045 align:middle line:84%
We're actually doing
that, going there.

00:23:48.045 --> 00:23:49.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
it's our own field

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:50.950 align:middle line:84%
of residence, what
we are already

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:52.960 align:middle line:90%
relating to energetically.

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:55.000 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I've
read this before.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.190 align:middle line:84%
So he's saying that
the death realm may not

00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:59.207 align:middle line:84%
look all that different
to the living realm

00:23:59.207 --> 00:24:00.790 align:middle line:84%
because you're going
to be gravitating

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:03.130 align:middle line:84%
toward the same
kind of experience.

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And I remember reading Ruth
Montgomery's "The World Beyond"

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:08.590 align:middle line:90%
many, many years ago.

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:12.460 align:middle line:84%
And this one sad little scene
really struck me in the book,

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:15.730 align:middle line:84%
where Arthur Ford is telling
her his observations over there.

00:24:15.730 --> 00:24:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And it was about a woman who
had a very dull life, who

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:24.839 align:middle line:84%
really, she spent a lot of
time ironing, ironing clothing.

00:24:24.839 --> 00:24:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And that on the
other side, the woman

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:28.900 align:middle line:84%
had no idea where she
was, what was going on.

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:30.785 align:middle line:84%
She just ironed
all day every day.

00:24:30.785 --> 00:24:33.020 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, ay, ay.

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:35.020 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of what you'd
want to get away from.

00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:36.760 align:middle line:84%
But the point that
Swedenborg is making

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:38.680 align:middle line:90%
is, no, what you are persists.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:40.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: And oddly enough,
he also makes the point

00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:43.600 align:middle line:84%
that the dead, because
we've been conditioned

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:45.780 align:middle line:84%
to think the other
world is very different,

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:47.824 align:middle line:84%
that many dead people
don't realize they're dead.

00:24:47.824 --> 00:24:49.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what I was
asking about originally.

00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:51.370 align:middle line:84%
They don't know that
this has happened.

00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:52.840 align:middle line:84%
There's no real
awareness, right?

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: Yes, exactly.

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:56.020 align:middle line:84%
He has a wonderful
passage, I refer to it,

00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:57.790 align:middle line:84%
where he has a group
of freethinking,

00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:01.186 align:middle line:84%
atheistic, scientific
types, having a meeting

00:25:01.186 --> 00:25:03.310 align:middle line:84%
in a hellish realm, where
they're talking about God

00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:05.060 align:middle line:84%
doesn't exist and
there's no immortal soul

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:06.380 align:middle line:90%
and there's no afterlife.

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And they're having
these lectures on it.

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:09.940 align:middle line:84%
And they don't realize
they're actually

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:11.106 align:middle line:90%
dead and in a hellish realm.

00:25:11.106 --> 00:25:12.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:15.070 align:middle line:84%
There is a part of you wrote
about-- it cracked me up.

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:17.710 align:middle line:90%
I found it so interesting.

00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:21.220 align:middle line:84%
Some belief systems say
the other side is really

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:22.630 align:middle line:90%
no different from this side.

00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:26.280 align:middle line:84%
Maybe just a little less
materially physical.

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:31.247 align:middle line:84%
But I was reading the part about
where the Chinese belief is,

00:25:31.247 --> 00:25:32.830 align:middle line:84%
that's why you have
to have your coins

00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:34.913 align:middle line:84%
and your money stored up
to take to the other side

00:25:34.913 --> 00:25:37.860 align:middle line:84%
so you can make your bribes
on the other side too,

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:39.860 align:middle line:90%
to bribe favor.

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:40.660 align:middle line:90%
I thought it was--

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:42.201 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously
from my standpoint,

00:25:42.201 --> 00:25:45.389 align:middle line:84%
I find it interesting,
but also kind of amusing.

00:25:45.389 --> 00:25:47.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: It will
be just as it is here.

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, it's
interesting too that--

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:49.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Gotta
bribe the officials.

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:50.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: --the
Chinese have the concept

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:52.840 align:middle line:84%
that you must behave
yourself over there,

00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:55.180 align:middle line:84%
because if you misbehave,
you'll be thrown out.

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:56.995 align:middle line:84%
We tend to think
it's a one-way trip--

00:25:56.995 --> 00:25:59.620 align:middle line:84%
especially in the West, I should
say, not so much in the East--

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:04.360 align:middle line:84%
that once you qualify,
you've passed your ACT test,

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:06.100 align:middle line:84%
and you're admitted
into the place,

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:09.580 align:middle line:84%
to use a university metaphor,
that you're there to stay.

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:11.560 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, that's
not the case.

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:13.440 align:middle line:84%
Which reminds me too,
the ancient Egyptians

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:17.270 align:middle line:84%
had this wonderful concept
that it's a continuous journey.

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And every night
you may be killed.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they went
to such great lengths

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:25.540 align:middle line:90%
to prepare the dead person.

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:28.975 align:middle line:84%
And they have salvation
by magic, in a sense.

00:26:28.975 --> 00:26:33.730 align:middle line:84%
The dead person is equipped
with magical words of power.

00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:36.250 align:middle line:90%
And every morning, he's--

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:38.710 align:middle line:84%
in fact, this is originally
the sun god does this--

00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:43.750 align:middle line:84%
he's born from the womb of
his mother, the sky goddess.

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:46.140 align:middle line:84%
And he travels across the
celestial Nile, which they

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:47.980 align:middle line:90%
view as a river in the sky.

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:50.770 align:middle line:84%
And then every night
he dies in the arms

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:52.622 align:middle line:90%
of his mother, the sky goddess.

00:26:52.622 --> 00:26:54.080 align:middle line:84%
And then he has to
go through the--

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:55.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Through the
descent of darkness,

00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:56.930 align:middle line:90%
back to the daylight again.

00:26:56.930 --> 00:26:59.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: And he goes
through nine or 12 gates guarded

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:02.460 align:middle line:84%
by monsters, and
he needs passwords,

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:04.090 align:middle line:84%
and he needs to
know their names.

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:06.180 align:middle line:84%
That's a really
common idea in magic--

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:08.770 align:middle line:90%
the name controls the thing.

00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:10.990 align:middle line:10%
In the Old Testament,
no one is allowed

00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:13.000 align:middle line:10%
to know the name of
Yahweh or Jehovah.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.583 align:middle line:10%
We don't even know
how it's pronounced

00:27:14.583 --> 00:27:17.747 align:middle line:10%
because it was secret, we think
it was because it was sacred,

00:27:17.747 --> 00:27:19.830 align:middle line:10%
but it almost certainly
is from a magical concept.

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:23.042 align:middle line:84%
If you know the name, even of
a god, you can control him.

00:27:23.042 --> 00:27:24.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, interesting.

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:26.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: So the
deceased-- and by the way,

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.036 align:middle line:84%
another interesting thing
about the Egyptians,

00:27:28.036 --> 00:27:30.250 align:middle line:84%
their afterlife is
actually here, in a sense.

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:32.830 align:middle line:84%
Because if you have the
proper magical rituals,

00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:35.860 align:middle line:84%
you join the sun
god in this journey,

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:37.240 align:middle line:90%
you must know the passwords.

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:39.190 align:middle line:84%
You must pass
through the dangers.

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And then you're born
into this world again.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, not physically born,
but you're here again

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:46.060 align:middle line:90%
among the living.

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:49.402 align:middle line:84%
Because Egyptians, the family
idea triumphs over the grave.

00:27:49.402 --> 00:27:51.235 align:middle line:84%
We find this in many
cultures-- the Chinese,

00:27:51.235 --> 00:27:53.410 align:middle line:90%
the Ancient Romans, Greeks.

00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:55.757 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to be
with their families.

00:27:55.757 --> 00:27:57.715 align:middle line:84%
And they will live here
in the daylight-- well,

00:27:57.715 --> 00:27:59.890 align:middle line:84%
I should say, exist
here, not live--

00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:02.680 align:middle line:84%
and then they go through
the process each night.

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And they thought we were not
by nature immortal, which

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:07.810 align:middle line:90%
is interesting.

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:11.170 align:middle line:84%
They also thought on Earth we
weren't by nature immortal.

00:28:11.170 --> 00:28:12.730 align:middle line:84%
You're killed by
magic, essentially.

00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:14.146 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you're
shot by a gun, it's

00:28:14.146 --> 00:28:16.840 align:middle line:84%
because someone put a
hex on you, typically.

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:19.672 align:middle line:84%
But then just
you're killed here,

00:28:19.672 --> 00:28:20.880 align:middle line:90%
even though it's not natural.

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:24.520 align:middle line:84%
And then in the next world, you
can also survive through magic.

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:26.104 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's
talk about that.

00:28:26.104 --> 00:28:27.561 align:middle line:84%
There's another
one in there that I

00:28:27.561 --> 00:28:28.780 align:middle line:90%
found absolutely fascinating.

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And it was the
aboriginal understanding

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:34.610 align:middle line:84%
of what happens in death and
the whole process of sleeping

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:37.810 align:middle line:84%
on the dead's head, a close
family member, for three days

00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:40.690 align:middle line:84%
after the death following
the smoke and so forth.

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:42.680 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain that
whole thing to us?

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:44.200 align:middle line:90%
It's really interesting.

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: The
Egyptians-- and I

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:48.170 align:middle line:84%
should mention the aboriginal
people and the Egyptians share

00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:51.640 align:middle line:84%
the same concept that you're not
by nature immortal, in a sense.

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:54.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me clarify this--
that all death is caused by--

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:55.876 align:middle line:90%
is caused, I should say.

00:28:55.876 --> 00:28:57.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They don't think death
is a natural effect in life.

00:28:57.610 --> 00:28:58.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: Right, that's
what I meant to say.

00:28:58.140 --> 00:28:59.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It has to be
caused by something.

00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:00.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: Right.

00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:01.720 align:middle line:90%
Now, in their case--

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.490 align:middle line:84%
and now, incidentally,
the British

00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:05.020 align:middle line:90%
arrived in the 18th century.

00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:07.540 align:middle line:10%
They disparage these
people because they

00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:10.570 align:middle line:10%
didn't have the bow and arrow,
they've never seen water boil,

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:15.070 align:middle line:10%
they were naked, they
couldn't count beyond three,

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:16.880 align:middle line:10%
because they had no need to.

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.910 align:middle line:84%
And much like the
modern Americans,

00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:20.860 align:middle line:84%
we judge on how
many-- technology.

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:22.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Very
arrogant, a big mistake.

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:23.862 align:middle line:90%
Because they had magic.

00:29:23.862 --> 00:29:25.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: And also,
what's interesting

00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:27.100 align:middle line:84%
about the aboriginal
people, especially

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:28.474 align:middle line:84%
the central
Australians that were

00:29:28.474 --> 00:29:30.170 align:middle line:84%
in the desert, really
inhospitable areas

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:32.830 align:middle line:84%
of Australia, because they
were preserving really

00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:35.860 align:middle line:84%
ancient ideas, almost certainly
the ideas from the dawn

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:37.180 align:middle line:90%
of the human race.

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:40.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, as Americans, most people
think new is good, old is bad.

00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:42.340 align:middle line:90%
But that's not really true.

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:46.030 align:middle line:84%
Old can indicate the truth
that has become corrupted.

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And they talked
about-- for example,

00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:50.620 align:middle line:84%
they thought, again,
as we just mentioned,

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:52.840 align:middle line:84%
that no death was
really natural.

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:54.280 align:middle line:90%
So every death was a murder.

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:55.302 align:middle line:90%
So there were rituals.

00:29:55.302 --> 00:29:57.510 align:middle line:84%
That's what they're doing
about sleeping on the head.

00:29:57.510 --> 00:29:58.240 align:middle line:90%
Another one was--

00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:00.406 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You didn't die
unless somebody was putting

00:30:00.406 --> 00:30:01.720 align:middle line:90%
some bad or black juju on you.

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:02.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: Right.

00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And then also, another one was,
not only sleeping on the head

00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:07.690 align:middle line:84%
and then dreaming of
who killed this person,

00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:11.530 align:middle line:84%
but also they would burn the
body and then follow the smoke

00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:13.949 align:middle line:84%
and oddly enough kill the
first person they encountered.

00:30:13.949 --> 00:30:15.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That, I
thought, was harsh.

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:17.290 align:middle line:90%
When I read that, I thought, ay.

00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:21.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they just assumed that
wherever the smoke was leading

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:22.150 align:middle line:90%
them was to the murderer.

00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:23.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: Right.

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:26.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, by the way, 18th,
19th century British types

00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:28.630 align:middle line:84%
were looking at this
saying, how backward is this

00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:29.470 align:middle line:90%
and how savage?

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:33.160 align:middle line:84%
I remind people, though,
that the aboriginal people

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:35.920 align:middle line:84%
apparently were
there from 50,000 BC.

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:37.840 align:middle line:84%
If they were the only
people on the planet,

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:39.010 align:middle line:90%
they would be here indefinitely.

00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:41.009 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're ending
up destroying the planet,

00:30:41.009 --> 00:30:44.800 align:middle line:84%
destroying this place we
live, and oddly enough,

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:46.462 align:middle line:90%
even overpopulation.

00:30:46.462 --> 00:30:48.670 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean to say we go
back to this killing people

00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:50.380 align:middle line:90%
every time someone dies.

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:52.384 align:middle line:84%
But their numbers
are really stable.

00:30:52.384 --> 00:30:54.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, they were
living in complete harmony

00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:57.700 align:middle line:84%
with not only nature
and an elemental world,

00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:01.390 align:middle line:84%
but also with spiritual worlds
and the worlds of ancestors.

00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And I've read some
rare documents

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:07.060 align:middle line:84%
on the way they used magic
and the actual processes

00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:09.700 align:middle line:84%
of magic they used
that are very real.

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:13.247 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, I can understand
why the white man, when

00:31:13.247 --> 00:31:14.830 align:middle line:84%
he first encounters
this, would think,

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:17.140 align:middle line:84%
this might just look
savage in a way.

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:20.440 align:middle line:84%
But they are much more in tune
with the processes of life

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:21.740 align:middle line:90%
than we are.

00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:22.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: And by the
way, I should mention,

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:25.265 align:middle line:84%
we talked about the Caucasians
viewing these people,

00:31:25.265 --> 00:31:29.410 align:middle line:84%
it got so savage among the
white side, in Tasmania--

00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:32.830 align:middle line:84%
now incidentally, in Tasmania,
they were kind of cut off.

00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:34.449 align:middle line:84%
They had forgotten
how to make fire.

00:31:34.449 --> 00:31:36.490 align:middle line:84%
That's, again-- there's
been a couple of cultures

00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:38.260 align:middle line:84%
in the 19th century,
they had no idea.

00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:40.870 align:middle line:84%
The Andaman Islanders
in the Bay of Bengal,

00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:43.240 align:middle line:84%
and the aboriginal
people in Tasmania,

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:46.330 align:middle line:84%
they would keep it burning,
but they couldn't make it.

00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:47.955 align:middle line:84%
And the British
just dismissed this,

00:31:47.955 --> 00:31:49.780 align:middle line:90%
like, how savage can this be?

00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:52.780 align:middle line:84%
And they organized
aboriginal hunts,

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:54.530 align:middle line:84%
where even ministers
would participate,

00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:57.670 align:middle line:84%
hunting them as if they were
killing deer, which even today,

00:31:57.670 --> 00:31:58.890 align:middle line:90%
some people object to that.

00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:01.410 align:middle line:90%
But these were humans.

00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:04.765 align:middle line:84%
And it's a shame that we tend
to judge on material things.

00:32:04.765 --> 00:32:05.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:07.723 align:middle line:84%
Do you think there might
have even been some fear?

00:32:07.723 --> 00:32:09.430 align:middle line:84%
Because they do
have these powers

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:13.630 align:middle line:84%
that seem to transcend anything
that the white man is aware of.

00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:16.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've read the books,
we've seen the films, even,

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:19.390 align:middle line:84%
on what happened to the
Aboriginals in Australia

00:32:19.390 --> 00:32:21.490 align:middle line:84%
and taken away,
separated from family,

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:25.570 align:middle line:84%
put in a very rigid Western
type of educational system that

00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:28.270 align:middle line:84%
is completely the opposite
of the way they're

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:29.677 align:middle line:90%
able to function in life.

00:32:29.677 --> 00:32:31.010 align:middle line:90%
Do you think there's fear there?

00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:33.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: Well, oddly
enough, 19th century Europeans

00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:35.950 align:middle line:84%
in general and Americans,
we forget this.

00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And again, I'll mention
it as a historian.

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:41.250 align:middle line:84%
They were so arrogant,
they were convinced

00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:43.050 align:middle line:90%
that they had the answers.

00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:47.500 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of this abuse
of Aboriginal people,

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:49.150 align:middle line:84%
as the Native
Americans over here,

00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:51.940 align:middle line:84%
is everything the
Europeans were witnessing

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:53.860 align:middle line:90%
was just savage and backward.

00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:56.590 align:middle line:84%
You see similar things
occurring in Africa.

00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:58.240 align:middle line:90%
And they wanted to root it out.

00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:00.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, infamously
you had the Spanish experience

00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:04.780 align:middle line:84%
in Central and South America
destroying these cultures.

00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:07.290 align:middle line:84%
They were absolutely convinced
that they were helping them.

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And incidentally,
I remind people,

00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:11.770 align:middle line:84%
it's so easy to
judge to the past.

00:33:11.770 --> 00:33:13.270 align:middle line:90%
We do the same thing today.

00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:17.020 align:middle line:84%
We forget that even when we
export Peace Corps workers--

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:20.140 align:middle line:84%
not to criticize these young
people and old people now

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:21.740 align:middle line:84%
helping others in
their own mind--

00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:25.176 align:middle line:84%
but we're corrupting
other societies sometimes.

00:33:25.176 --> 00:33:26.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: Now,
in contrast, India

00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:31.660 align:middle line:84%
has preserved hunters
and gatherers,

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:35.470 align:middle line:84%
horticulturalists, farmers,
all the way up to-- they

00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:38.200 align:middle line:84%
have the space program
and nuclear weapons.

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:41.110 align:middle line:84%
And I often joke in my classes,
if aliens were to come here,

00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:42.730 align:middle line:84%
they wouldn't visit
New York City.

00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:45.280 align:middle line:84%
They would go to India,
because it's a museum piece.

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:47.710 align:middle line:90%
Everything has been preserved.

00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And George Catlin, who is
a 19th century American,

00:33:51.370 --> 00:33:56.110 align:middle line:84%
went out into the Great Plains
and other places in the 1830s.

00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:59.470 align:middle line:84%
He really admired the way of
life of the bison hunters.

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:02.904 align:middle line:84%
And he talks about, it's a shame
these people will be destroyed.

00:34:02.904 --> 00:34:05.320 align:middle line:84%
And instead of setting up
places like Yellowstone National

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:06.910 align:middle line:84%
Park, why we couldn't
have walled off

00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:09.790 align:middle line:84%
Nebraska-- or I should say,
part of Texas and so forth--

00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:11.649 align:middle line:84%
and let those people
live their lives.

00:34:11.649 --> 00:34:13.690 align:middle line:84%
Because we've corrupted
Native Americans as well.

00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:14.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We have.

00:34:14.490 --> 00:34:17.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the government gave
them some reservation land,

00:34:17.170 --> 00:34:19.466 align:middle line:84%
but it's really not
a good way they've

00:34:19.466 --> 00:34:20.590 align:middle line:90%
been forced to live at all.

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:23.085 align:middle line:90%


00:34:23.085 --> 00:34:25.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: And again, we
can't blame the British,

00:34:25.210 --> 00:34:26.419 align:middle line:90%
because we do the same thing.

00:34:26.419 --> 00:34:27.459 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, absolutely.

00:34:27.459 --> 00:34:28.360 align:middle line:90%
We're right up there.

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:29.217 align:middle line:90%
We're their spawn.

00:34:29.217 --> 00:34:30.550 align:middle line:90%
This brings me to another point.

00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:34.962 align:middle line:84%
And that is, do not assume,
if heaven does exist,

00:34:34.962 --> 00:34:37.420 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to stay there
and hang out there forever.

00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:37.909 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: Exactly.

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:39.540 align:middle line:84%
That's a really common
one in the West.

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:43.179 align:middle line:84%
It's possible that's the case,
but it's rather interesting,

00:34:43.179 --> 00:34:45.159 align:middle line:84%
for example, in these
Eastern traditions,

00:34:45.159 --> 00:34:46.690 align:middle line:84%
even if you come
back as a god, you

00:34:46.690 --> 00:34:48.280 align:middle line:84%
have all kinds of
bliss and power,

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:50.949 align:middle line:84%
they always fall because
they're corrupted.

00:34:50.949 --> 00:34:52.850 align:middle line:84%
If you're reborn as
a god or goddess,

00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:55.210 align:middle line:84%
you have so much bliss and
power, you're corrupted

00:34:55.210 --> 00:34:57.610 align:middle line:90%
and you'll fall.

00:34:57.610 --> 00:34:59.527 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're bound
to overextend, exploit,

00:34:59.527 --> 00:35:00.326 align:middle line:90%
or whatnot?

00:35:00.326 --> 00:35:01.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: Yes,
it's just simply--

00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:03.075 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We can't
win for losing.

00:35:03.075 --> 00:35:03.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: Exactly.

00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:05.546 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you come back
as a bug, it's one thing.

00:35:05.546 --> 00:35:06.970 align:middle line:84%
If you come back
as a god, you're

00:35:06.970 --> 00:35:09.400 align:middle line:84%
going to be tempted
into another fall.

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:10.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: Right.

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:11.260 align:middle line:90%
And it's kind of curious.

00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:13.660 align:middle line:90%
We often, in our pop culture--

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:15.970 align:middle line:84%
for example, the
legendary TV series,

00:35:15.970 --> 00:35:20.350 align:middle line:84%
"Dallas," we show what money
and power can do to people

00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:24.280 align:middle line:84%
and if you can indulge
all of your wishes.

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:27.870 align:middle line:84%
But we often forget, what
happens if we go to heaven,

00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:31.360 align:middle line:84%
and we have this
perfect happiness,

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:32.716 align:middle line:90%
and everything we want is there?

00:35:32.716 --> 00:35:34.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do we start
itching for some drama?

00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:36.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: Yeah,
could it corrupt us?

00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:38.440 align:middle line:84%
There's a famous
statement against--

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:40.960 align:middle line:84%
I think it was Nietzsche
says, against boredom, even

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:42.640 align:middle line:90%
the gods struggle in vain.

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:43.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:47.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: So it's possible
that it could be very

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:48.790 align:middle line:90%
different, and it may change.

00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:49.590 align:middle line:90%
Won't be forever.

00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:52.720 align:middle line:84%
&Gt;>REGINA: Well, and
these creative beings,

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:56.404 align:middle line:84%
beings with the ability to
create, you would think that--

00:35:56.404 --> 00:35:58.070 align:middle line:84%
that would make a
good argument for what

00:35:58.070 --> 00:35:59.950 align:middle line:84%
you're saying,
that ultimately you

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:02.470 align:middle line:84%
would have a need to express
yourself in a new way again.

00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:03.010 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: Yes.

00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:05.385 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that this would
keep the tension or whatnot

00:36:05.385 --> 00:36:07.180 align:middle line:84%
moving forward, so
you would continue

00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:08.510 align:middle line:90%
this wheel of incarnations.

00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:09.310 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: Yes.

00:36:09.310 --> 00:36:10.976 align:middle line:84%
And look at the creator
of Harry Potter.

00:36:10.976 --> 00:36:13.300 align:middle line:84%
She may be the first
novelist to have

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:15.962 align:middle line:84%
become a billionaire through
creating these characters.

00:36:15.962 --> 00:36:17.920 align:middle line:84%
Now she's bored, wants
to do some other things.

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:19.480 align:middle line:90%
That's very human.

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:21.290 align:middle line:84%
Wants to be recognized
for something else.

00:36:21.290 --> 00:36:22.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:36:22.090 --> 00:36:23.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: And if
we're in paradise,

00:36:23.830 --> 00:36:24.960 align:middle line:90%
maybe we become bored.

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And maybe, again,
bliss is overrated.

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:29.826 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:36:29.826 --> 00:36:30.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:32.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, so let's go to
hell then, all right?

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:32.925 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: OK, yes.

00:36:32.925 --> 00:36:35.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So do not assume
that hell is necessarily

00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:38.957 align:middle line:84%
less pleasant than the
upper worlds, right?

00:36:38.957 --> 00:36:41.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: That's found in
many-- in fact, by the way,

00:36:41.290 --> 00:36:42.520 align:middle line:90%
it's really curious.

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:45.944 align:middle line:84%
Once again, hell develops
when farming develops.

00:36:45.944 --> 00:36:47.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, explain that.

00:36:47.110 --> 00:36:48.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: You get
hunters and gatherers.

00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:48.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That was interesting.

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:50.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: Well, you
get hunters and gatherers.

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:52.430 align:middle line:90%
And then we develop agriculture.

00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:54.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, up to a couple of
decades ago, they always

00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:57.702 align:middle line:84%
assumed that the
farmer was an advance,

00:36:57.702 --> 00:37:00.160 align:middle line:84%
and they used to wonder what
took so long, because it's now

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:04.090 align:middle line:84%
estimated maybe 99.9% of
our existence, hunters

00:37:04.090 --> 00:37:04.990 align:middle line:90%
and gatherers.

00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:07.660 align:middle line:84%
Why did it take the human race
so long to become farmers?

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:09.417 align:middle line:90%
Now, when the farmer develops--

00:37:09.417 --> 00:37:11.500 align:middle line:84%
and oddly enough, they're
the first town dwellers.

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:13.960 align:middle line:84%
We think of farmers as out in
the middle of nowhere today,

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:16.146 align:middle line:84%
but in fact, you
couldn't plant a crop

00:37:16.146 --> 00:37:17.339 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of nowhere.

00:37:17.339 --> 00:37:18.880 align:middle line:84%
So they would build
these strongholds

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:20.800 align:middle line:90%
and farm the land around it.

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:24.610 align:middle line:84%
So they would
invent, eventually,

00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:28.570 align:middle line:84%
metalworking, writing, things we
consider positive developments.

00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:30.880 align:middle line:90%
But they also developed slavery.

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:33.340 align:middle line:84%
The farmer develops
human sacrifice.

00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:35.920 align:middle line:84%
You don't find that among
hunters and gatherers.

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:40.037 align:middle line:84%
Hierarchy, the tyrant, all
of this comes from farmers.

00:37:40.037 --> 00:37:41.620 align:middle line:84%
In fact, most Americans
don't realize,

00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:44.290 align:middle line:84%
we talk about the modernism
and the American way

00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:46.795 align:middle line:84%
of life, that's what primitive
people-- and I don't mean

00:37:46.795 --> 00:37:48.045 align:middle line:90%
primitive as a negative sense.

00:37:48.045 --> 00:37:51.730 align:middle line:84%
But gender equality,
lack of hierarchy,

00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:56.080 align:middle line:84%
no tyrants, everybody basically
is governed through consensus.

00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And oddly enough, even
in the issue of abortion

00:37:58.270 --> 00:38:01.750 align:middle line:84%
and infanticide,
farmers historically

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:03.010 align:middle line:90%
practiced infanticide.

00:38:03.010 --> 00:38:05.050 align:middle line:84%
They kill babies
after they're born.

00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:07.540 align:middle line:84%
Romans would consider it
ridiculous, in fact, even

00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:11.290 align:middle line:84%
a crime, to murder a baby in
the womb before you look at it.

00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:14.270 align:middle line:84%
But if the child were
puny, misshapen, sick,

00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:15.070 align:middle line:90%
they killed it.

00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:15.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They didn't
want the burden.

00:38:15.970 --> 00:38:16.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: Right.

00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:18.416 align:middle line:84%
Ancient Greeks did
the same thing.

00:38:18.416 --> 00:38:19.915 align:middle line:84%
So the farmers
practiced infanticide

00:38:19.915 --> 00:38:23.020 align:middle line:84%
and think abortion
is stupid and evil.

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:25.214 align:middle line:84%
But now the primitive
people practice abortion.

00:38:25.214 --> 00:38:26.630 align:middle line:84%
They have all kinds
of techniques.

00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:27.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The hunters
and gatherers.

00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:28.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: Yes.

00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:30.330 align:middle line:84%
And again, I shouldn't
use that term.

00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:32.410 align:middle line:84%
I think of primitive
actually as pure,

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:34.390 align:middle line:84%
and I keep forgetting
that people often

00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:36.010 align:middle line:90%
view it as a different way.

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:38.584 align:middle line:84%
They have techniques through
herbs and also-- now, again,

00:38:38.584 --> 00:38:40.250 align:middle line:84%
no one should try
this, it's dangerous--

00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:41.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
not recommending it.

00:38:41.490 --> 00:38:43.198 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: --through
belly manipulation

00:38:43.198 --> 00:38:44.304 align:middle line:90%
to cause the miscarriage.

00:38:44.304 --> 00:38:46.595 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And certain herbs
that were used historically

00:38:46.595 --> 00:38:48.290 align:middle line:84%
in the Egyptians
cultures as well, yes.

00:38:48.290 --> 00:38:49.090 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: Yes.

00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:51.410 align:middle line:84%
But our modern value
system is actually

00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:54.244 align:middle line:84%
reverting back,
essentially, to the hunting

00:38:54.244 --> 00:38:56.410 align:middle line:84%
and gathering moral system,
which is rather curious,

00:38:56.410 --> 00:38:57.610 align:middle line:90%
at that level--

00:38:57.610 --> 00:38:58.440 align:middle line:90%
in some ways.

00:38:58.440 --> 00:38:59.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:03.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: But we've
kept the urban, the notion

00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:05.350 align:middle line:84%
of cooperation,
love, and so forth,

00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:07.725 align:middle line:84%
because we have
to live together.

00:39:07.725 --> 00:39:09.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I
was going to say,

00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:12.460 align:middle line:84%
with that advancement
into agrarian societies,

00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:14.870 align:middle line:84%
how did they view the
afterlife compared, again, to--

00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:15.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: Yes.

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:18.610 align:middle line:84%
That's where you get the idea
of a good place and a bad place.

00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:21.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, curiously enough, for
example, the Melanesian people

00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:23.370 align:middle line:90%
from the Pacific--

00:39:23.370 --> 00:39:25.210 align:middle line:84%
they [INAUDIBLE]
the aboriginal--

00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:27.250 align:middle line:84%
they put the afterlife
on this earth.

00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:29.110 align:middle line:90%
You never leave the earth.

00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And we're always thinking
of going somewhere else.

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And one point-- and I,
again, refer to this--

00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:36.550 align:middle line:84%
is modern people always
think, if God exists

00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:38.770 align:middle line:84%
and if the dead exist,
there's somewhere else.

00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:41.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, 19th century people
did try to rationalize

00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:45.070 align:middle line:84%
this with science and say, it
could be in another dimension.

00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:46.480 align:middle line:84%
That emerges in
the 19th century.

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:48.610 align:middle line:84%
The dead are there,
God is there.

00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:52.740 align:middle line:84%
But most people today think the
spirit is not really physical

00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:58.000 align:middle line:84%
anyway, and it's disconnected
from our modern world.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.450 align:middle line:84%
But the Melanesian people
think you go to the West.

00:40:01.450 --> 00:40:04.030 align:middle line:90%
And there's no place of torment.

00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:06.520 align:middle line:84%
In fact, again, to
refer to the aboriginal,

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:08.590 align:middle line:84%
the soul is the size
of a grain of sand.

00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:11.080 align:middle line:84%
You go to a sacred site
where the ancestors go,

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:13.880 align:middle line:84%
typically a waterfall or
a mountain or so forth.

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:16.007 align:middle line:84%
And when the proper
woman comes along,

00:40:16.007 --> 00:40:17.215 align:middle line:90%
they select her and are born.

00:40:17.215 --> 00:40:19.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's interesting
that they say

00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:22.390 align:middle line:84%
the reason younger women
give birth and not older

00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:24.320 align:middle line:84%
is because the
soul wants to make

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:25.830 align:middle line:90%
certain he's taken care of.

00:40:25.830 --> 00:40:26.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:28.450 align:middle line:84%
So he needs someone there
for a longer period of time.

00:40:28.450 --> 00:40:29.230 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: Yes, yes.

00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:30.688 align:middle line:84%
And it's nothing
to do with ethics.

00:40:30.688 --> 00:40:32.140 align:middle line:90%
They simply make a choice.

00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And frankly, when the aboriginal
people first saw the British,

00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:38.020 align:middle line:84%
they thought they were
the ancestors returning.

00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:39.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:39.010 --> 00:40:39.940 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:42.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's go-- you touched
on it just a little bit,

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:44.160 align:middle line:84%
but let's go to the
Egyptian Bardos a bit.

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:45.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: Mm-hmm.

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:46.420 align:middle line:90%
The Tibetan Bardo, you mean?

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:47.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
Tibetan Bardos, yes.

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:48.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: Yes.

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:50.140 align:middle line:84%
It's just simply
the notion that--

00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:51.115 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The Tibetan
Book of the Dead.

00:40:51.115 --> 00:40:52.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: And
this is called--

00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:54.100 align:middle line:84%
and the connection,
everybody notices

00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:55.974 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptian Book of
the Dead and the Tibetan

00:40:55.974 --> 00:40:58.100 align:middle line:84%
Book of the Dead are very
similar in some respects.

00:40:58.100 --> 00:40:58.899 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:58.899 --> 00:41:00.160 align:middle line:90%
One was passed from the other.

00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:00.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: Yes.

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:05.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Tibetans, which
by the way, for example,

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:08.500 align:middle line:84%
Diamond Vehicle Buddhism
has the idea of--

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:11.920 align:middle line:84%
it's actually, strangely
enough, tantra practices,

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:13.600 align:middle line:90%
which is a short path.

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:16.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's left-hand
tantra and right-hand tantra.

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:19.240 align:middle line:84%
The Dalai Lama represents
right-hand tantra.

00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:22.870 align:middle line:84%
Left-hand tantra is basically
you achieve enlightenment

00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:28.150 align:middle line:84%
through orgies, drugs,
forbidden things, eating beef,

00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:31.540 align:middle line:84%
for example, and
forbidden foods.

00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:34.300 align:middle line:84%
But the Dalai Lama is from
the right-hand tantra,

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:35.710 align:middle line:90%
which again, is information.

00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:37.540 align:middle line:84%
And they think--
and it's connected

00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:39.190 align:middle line:90%
to a large point of view.

00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:42.910 align:middle line:84%
Everything is thought,
according to this tradition.

00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:44.860 align:middle line:84%
There's no real
matter in energy.

00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:46.510 align:middle line:90%
This is a dream, in a sense.

00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:47.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That we've created?

00:41:47.170 --> 00:41:47.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: Yeah.

00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:49.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, in some reversions,
these are created.

00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:50.991 align:middle line:84%
In some versions, somebody
else has created it,

00:41:50.991 --> 00:41:52.270 align:middle line:90%
and it's a dream.

00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:53.800 align:middle line:84%
They call it
non-dualist thought.

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:55.360 align:middle line:90%
Everything is thought.

00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:57.940 align:middle line:84%
So when the person dies,
the Tibetan Book of the Dead

00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:01.180 align:middle line:84%
gives really interesting details
what the dead person will

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:06.220 align:middle line:84%
experience, and also how to get
the best possible next life,

00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:07.510 align:middle line:90%
or even release.

00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:08.800 align:middle line:90%
So it's what to look for.

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And what's curious is
if they're correct--

00:42:11.830 --> 00:42:13.900 align:middle line:84%
and they say it's based
on-- now, they call it,

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:15.130 align:middle line:90%
it's one of their termas.

00:42:15.130 --> 00:42:19.210 align:middle line:84%
These are hidden treasures
that are given by wise sages,

00:42:19.210 --> 00:42:22.210 align:middle line:84%
and they're hidden till the
human race is ready for it.

00:42:22.210 --> 00:42:24.421 align:middle line:84%
And they say, these are
people who consciously went

00:42:24.421 --> 00:42:26.170 align:middle line:84%
through the death
experience and came back

00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:28.830 align:middle line:90%
to tell us what occurs.

00:42:28.830 --> 00:42:30.050 align:middle line:90%
And if they are correct--

00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:31.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm not trying to say they
are, but if they're correct,

00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:33.710 align:middle line:84%
we're completely
misinterpreting what's going on.

00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:34.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, what do
they say is correct?

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:36.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: Well, for
example, I should mention--

00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:38.830 align:middle line:84%
some years ago, fascinating
book, Raymond Moody,

00:42:38.830 --> 00:42:39.670 align:middle line:90%
"Life After Life"--

00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:40.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, loved it.

00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:43.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: --generated the
really interesting research

00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:45.520 align:middle line:90%
on near-death experience.

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Moody, who both has
an MD and a psychology PhD,

00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:54.290 align:middle line:84%
he noticed that people
were sharing experiences--

00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:58.040 align:middle line:84%
the light, often beckoning
figures, and so forth.

00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:02.210 align:middle line:84%
But if the Tibetans are correct,
we will all experience this,

00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:03.926 align:middle line:90%
but it's only the initial stage.

00:43:03.926 --> 00:43:05.800 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't understand
what we're seeing,

00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:07.540 align:middle line:90%
it's going to take us down.

00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:09.480 align:middle line:84%
They say that when
you first die,

00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:12.600 align:middle line:84%
you encounter the clear
light of the void, which

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:17.430 align:middle line:84%
is brighter than 1,000 suns
and louder than 1,000 thunder

00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:18.270 align:middle line:90%
strikes.

00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:19.844 align:middle line:90%
And most people shrink back.

00:43:19.844 --> 00:43:21.510 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, it's
really interesting.

00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:24.040 align:middle line:84%
You don't have a
body, a mental body.

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:25.806 align:middle line:90%
You're just in the light.

00:43:25.806 --> 00:43:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And most people
will shrink back,

00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:29.430 align:middle line:84%
and that starts
to take you down.

00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:31.920 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a secondary
experience with the light.

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:33.750 align:middle line:90%
Most people will shrink back.

00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:36.150 align:middle line:90%
And then you start this process.

00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:39.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, you will see
beautiful entities.

00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:42.180 align:middle line:84%
And the Tibetans say,
if you're Christian,

00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:43.558 align:middle line:90%
you'll see angels or Jesus.

00:43:43.558 --> 00:43:45.266 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You see what
you expect to see.

00:43:45.266 --> 00:43:46.182 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: Yes, yes.

00:43:46.182 --> 00:43:48.570 align:middle line:84%
But they say, don't
approach them.

00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:50.310 align:middle line:90%
They're not really there.

00:43:50.310 --> 00:43:52.590 align:middle line:84%
And it could seduce
you off the proper way.

00:43:52.590 --> 00:43:54.570 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is really jarring to--

00:43:54.570 --> 00:43:57.870 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not saying the Tibetans
are right, and we're wrong,

00:43:57.870 --> 00:43:58.680 align:middle line:90%
but it's jarring.

00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:01.500 align:middle line:84%
Even if you see loved
ones over there,

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:03.160 align:middle line:84%
you're not supposed
to embrace them.

00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:03.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:08.730 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I was told that
by some of the entities

00:44:08.730 --> 00:44:10.150 align:middle line:90%
that I've been associated with.

00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And they said, don't ever
touch the [INAUDIBLE],

00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:13.671 align:middle line:84%
when you're passing
through from dream time

00:44:13.671 --> 00:44:16.230 align:middle line:84%
back through that realm
into the body again.

00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
having one experience

00:44:17.730 --> 00:44:21.600 align:middle line:84%
that was profound one day,
where I ended up being aware.

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:24.420 align:middle line:84%
I was passing through that
dimension to enter my body.

00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:28.110 align:middle line:84%
And this one woman wanted
my attention so badly.

00:44:28.110 --> 00:44:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And she was coming up,
walking up to me to touch me

00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:32.970 align:middle line:84%
because she wanted me
to acknowledge her.

00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:34.950 align:middle line:90%
And I remembered, don't touch.

00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:36.480 align:middle line:90%
Don't let her touch you.

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And I acknowledged
her and told her

00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:42.910 align:middle line:84%
I could see, telepathically,
what a beautiful entity she'd

00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:43.710 align:middle line:90%
been in that life.

00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:45.260 align:middle line:90%
And she shrunk back.

00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as
she shrunk back, I

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:50.430 align:middle line:84%
was able to then enter my
body back to a wakeful state.

00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:53.010 align:middle line:84%
And it was interesting to
have that awareness there,

00:44:53.010 --> 00:44:55.110 align:middle line:90%
even at that time.

00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:57.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: Even Jesus
says, don't touch me yet,

00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:58.560 align:middle line:84%
during the Resurrection
descriptions.

00:44:58.560 --> 00:44:59.518 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:44:59.518 --> 00:45:00.515 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:45:00.515 --> 00:45:02.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: Now, the
Tibetans say that all of this

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:04.230 align:middle line:84%
is from the contents
of your mind.

00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:06.881 align:middle line:84%
That's why a Christian sees
this and a Muslim sees this.

00:45:06.881 --> 00:45:09.130 align:middle line:84%
And Westerners misunderstand
that, because they think,

00:45:09.130 --> 00:45:11.880 align:middle line:84%
well, this is just
an hallucination.

00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:13.960 align:middle line:84%
But remember, to
the Tibetans, this

00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:15.210 align:middle line:90%
is basically an hallucination.

00:45:15.210 --> 00:45:16.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:16.010 --> 00:45:20.279 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: So it's equally
real as this universe is to us.

00:45:20.279 --> 00:45:21.820 align:middle line:84%
And then they say,
after about seven,

00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:25.707 align:middle line:84%
eight days, you start to
see monstrous entities that

00:45:25.707 --> 00:45:28.530 align:middle line:84%
are frightening, that'll
rip off your head,

00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:31.500 align:middle line:84%
rip out your intestines,
rip out your viscera,

00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:33.150 align:middle line:90%
tear out your kidneys.

00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And they say, do not be
afraid because this is

00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:39.660 align:middle line:90%
from the content of your mind.

00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:43.380 align:middle line:84%
The important part through this
is to be calm and detached.

00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:44.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:46.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: And then,
after this period,

00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:48.180 align:middle line:84%
you start to-- if
you haven't escaped,

00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:51.610 align:middle line:84%
and they give you information
how to achieve release,

00:45:51.610 --> 00:45:53.820 align:middle line:84%
and if you haven't
escaped at this point,

00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:56.360 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be
drawn into another body.

00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:58.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's actually
more complex than this,

00:45:58.110 --> 00:45:59.940 align:middle line:84%
but generally speaking
for most, there'll

00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:02.850 align:middle line:84%
be six possible
levels of rebirth.

00:46:02.850 --> 00:46:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And then they tell
you what to look for.

00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:08.280 align:middle line:84%
This will bring you
back as an animal.

00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:11.190 align:middle line:84%
This will take you back
as a god, as a demigod,

00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:14.750 align:middle line:84%
as a human, and a hellish
being, and a hungry ghost.

00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And oddly enough,
they view the human

00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:20.610 align:middle line:84%
as the best possible rebirth,
even above a god or a demigod.

00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:22.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, that
was interesting.

00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:22.910 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:25.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: Because we
have the most choice.

00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:28.650 align:middle line:84%
If you're an animal, you're
plunged in ignorance.

00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:31.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of Westerners
idolize animals now,

00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:32.490 align:middle line:90%
because we've lost this.

00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And they think, this is
a beautiful experience.

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:36.090 align:middle line:90%
I want to come back as my cat.

00:46:36.090 --> 00:46:37.152 align:middle line:90%
He gets to lie around.

00:46:37.152 --> 00:46:38.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Somewhat
limited, but OK.

00:46:38.610 --> 00:46:39.030 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: Yes.

00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, they would say
that's a bad one, because it

00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:42.900 align:middle line:84%
will require millions
of lives to get

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:44.460 align:middle line:90%
back up to the human level.

00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:46.260 align:middle line:84%
If you come back as
a cat or a horse,

00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:49.170 align:middle line:84%
it's going to require millions
of lives to reach human level.

00:46:49.170 --> 00:46:52.230 align:middle line:84%
If you come back as
a god or a demigod,

00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:55.110 align:middle line:84%
they again have too much
power, and they're plunged in--

00:46:55.110 --> 00:46:56.520 align:middle line:90%
especially the demigods.

00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:58.320 align:middle line:84%
They're characterized
by jealousy.

00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:00.330 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
go after the gods.

00:47:00.330 --> 00:47:02.740 align:middle line:90%
And you can't get out.

00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:06.210 align:middle line:84%
But the human has
the greatest choices.

00:47:06.210 --> 00:47:07.140 align:middle line:90%
He's in the middle.

00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:10.530 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like the
"Goldilocks and the Three

00:47:10.530 --> 00:47:12.190 align:middle line:90%
Bears" sort of thing.

00:47:12.190 --> 00:47:13.590 align:middle line:90%
And we are in the middle part.

00:47:13.590 --> 00:47:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's viewed-- it usually
requires 8 million lives

00:47:16.170 --> 00:47:18.360 align:middle line:90%
to achieve human status.

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:20.880 align:middle line:84%
And then this will be
the way to get out.

00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:24.630 align:middle line:84%
So they view being a human
as a special opportunity.

00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:25.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:26.590 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:47:26.590 --> 00:47:30.630 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to hop on to
Zoroastrians and their belief--

00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:33.497 align:middle line:84%
I loved it-- that a good man,
the soul spends three nights

00:47:33.497 --> 00:47:34.330 align:middle line:90%
on top of the body--

00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:35.829 align:middle line:84%
I have written
here-- and it's going

00:47:35.829 --> 00:47:37.980 align:middle line:90%
to be filled with joy, virgins.

00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:40.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a really
interesting take

00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:44.790 align:middle line:84%
on the notion of the
beautiful, milky-skinned virgin

00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:46.690 align:middle line:84%
and what she says
to the departed.

00:47:46.690 --> 00:47:47.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: Yes.

00:47:47.490 --> 00:47:49.340 align:middle line:90%
In fact, he sees--

00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:51.810 align:middle line:84%
and again, you were talking
about the good person dies,

00:47:51.810 --> 00:47:55.490 align:middle line:84%
and there's these
beautiful fragrant scents,

00:47:55.490 --> 00:47:58.530 align:middle line:84%
and he sees beautiful things,
and then he starts a journey.

00:47:58.530 --> 00:48:01.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, the reason that he is
there for roughly three days

00:48:01.650 --> 00:48:04.230 align:middle line:84%
is because that's when
decomposition begins.

00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:06.220 align:middle line:84%
So that's how they always
think that-- we think

00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:08.840 align:middle line:84%
of death as a quick,
you're now dead,

00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:11.180 align:middle line:84%
we can harvest your organs
and put them in someone else.

00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:13.509 align:middle line:84%
They think death is a
process, which it really is.

00:48:13.509 --> 00:48:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And then he begins
the journey and he

00:48:15.050 --> 00:48:17.236 align:middle line:90%
sees this beautiful female.

00:48:17.236 --> 00:48:18.485 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 15 years old, right?

00:48:18.485 --> 00:48:19.285 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: Yes.

00:48:19.285 --> 00:48:20.900 align:middle line:84%
Oddly enough, it
shows the culture

00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:22.480 align:middle line:90%
that they're doing that young.

00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:24.221 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:24.221 --> 00:48:25.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: And he
thinks-- he tells her,

00:48:25.970 --> 00:48:29.330 align:middle line:84%
she's the most beautiful
damsel he's ever seen.

00:48:29.330 --> 00:48:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And she replies,
I am not a damsel.

00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:34.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm your beautiful thoughts,
your beautiful words,

00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:36.590 align:middle line:90%
and your beautiful deeds.

00:48:36.590 --> 00:48:39.344 align:middle line:84%
And he then goes to
a sort of a paradise.

00:48:39.344 --> 00:48:41.510 align:middle line:84%
By the way, the word
"paradise" is actually Persian.

00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:43.160 align:middle line:84%
That's where it comes
from in the Bible.

00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:43.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:46.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's
fascinating because we've

00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:52.340 align:middle line:84%
been so overexposed to the
notions of the negatively

00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:56.390 align:middle line:84%
perceived aspects of Islamism,
where you risked your life

00:48:56.390 --> 00:49:00.050 align:middle line:84%
for Allah because of
the promise of virgins,

00:49:00.050 --> 00:49:01.400 align:middle line:90%
serviced by virgins.

00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:03.710 align:middle line:84%
This puts it in a much
more refined light,

00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:05.450 align:middle line:84%
that that embodiment
of everything

00:49:05.450 --> 00:49:07.430 align:middle line:84%
feminine and
beautiful is actually

00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:09.650 align:middle line:84%
the embodiment of the
goodness in yourself,

00:49:09.650 --> 00:49:11.650 align:middle line:84%
and that she's just
reflecting that back to you.

00:49:11.650 --> 00:49:13.233 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: And
it's also interesting

00:49:13.233 --> 00:49:14.670 align:middle line:90%
that they depict the negative.

00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:18.840 align:middle line:84%
If you're evil, you see this
really revolting haggish

00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:19.700 align:middle line:90%
female.

00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:22.570 align:middle line:84%
And the deceased, who's
been evil, he says,

00:49:22.570 --> 00:49:25.070 align:middle line:90%
my gosh, you're so revolting.

00:49:25.070 --> 00:49:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And she replies, I'm
not a hag or a woman.

00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:30.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm your evil thoughts,
evil words, evil deeds.

00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And apparently it would
be reversed for the women.

00:49:34.290 --> 00:49:37.060 align:middle line:84%
So they would encounter perhaps
a beautiful handsome man

00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:38.440 align:middle line:90%
or revolting man.

00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:39.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:43.100 align:middle line:84%
No, I found that to be
actually quite beautiful.

00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:44.900 align:middle line:84%
Gosh, we only have
about five minutes left.

00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:46.774 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to skip
through some of these.

00:49:46.774 --> 00:49:49.860 align:middle line:84%
The Fijians believe
that in your afterlife

00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:52.760 align:middle line:84%
you remain the same as you
were at the time of death.

00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And I was pondering
that, because I've

00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:56.120 align:middle line:84%
seen other people,
including myself,

00:49:56.120 --> 00:49:59.012 align:middle line:84%
have had the opposite
experiences, where

00:49:59.012 --> 00:50:01.220 align:middle line:84%
the person who's died,
especially if they're elderly,

00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:03.510 align:middle line:84%
often comes back in a
younger form of themselves.

00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:04.870 align:middle line:90%
That's more preferred.

00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:06.495 align:middle line:90%
So take off on that one.

00:50:06.495 --> 00:50:08.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: I think that
could also be encouragement to,

00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:10.290 align:middle line:90%
again, perhaps die younger.

00:50:10.290 --> 00:50:11.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:13.377 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to be
wrinkled in the afterlife.

00:50:13.377 --> 00:50:15.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: I should mention,
what's a really beautiful

00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:17.060 align:middle line:90%
concept you'll find--

00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:18.890 align:middle line:84%
for example, Eurasia,
and then frankly

00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:20.675 align:middle line:84%
it seems to be a
Celtic tradition

00:50:20.675 --> 00:50:21.800 align:middle line:90%
that everything's reversed.

00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:24.960 align:middle line:84%
According to the Eurasians,
Siberian cultures,

00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:27.620 align:middle line:84%
it's all-- for example, it's
summer here, it's winter there.

00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:30.410 align:middle line:84%
If there's a famine here,
there's plenty there.

00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:32.610 align:middle line:90%
And you age backwards.

00:50:32.610 --> 00:50:34.970 align:middle line:84%
So if you go there
very old-- we also

00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:36.590 align:middle line:84%
seem to have been
a Celtic tradition.

00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:36.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:50:36.890 --> 00:50:38.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: If you arrive
as an elderly person--

00:50:38.170 --> 00:50:39.185 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In the after--

00:50:39.185 --> 00:50:39.380 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:40.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: Yes.

00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:41.880 align:middle line:90%
Everything is reversed.

00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:46.062 align:middle line:84%
So here you grow older and
older, and in the afterlife,

00:50:46.062 --> 00:50:47.270 align:middle line:90%
you grow younger and younger.

00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:49.280 align:middle line:84%
So there would be
advantages, in some respects,

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:52.460 align:middle line:84%
going there elderly, because
you become younger and younger.

00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And then, oddly enough,
you turn into a baby

00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:56.940 align:middle line:90%
again, being reborn.

00:50:56.940 --> 00:50:59.009 align:middle line:84%
The Ancient Greeks
actually noticed--

00:50:59.009 --> 00:51:01.550 align:middle line:84%
now incidentally, these are all
Indo-European cultures, hence

00:51:01.550 --> 00:51:03.050 align:middle line:90%
the similarities.

00:51:03.050 --> 00:51:04.550 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Greeks
noticed that--

00:51:04.550 --> 00:51:06.440 align:middle line:84%
not to be critical,
as I'm on my way there

00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:08.180 align:middle line:84%
myself, but elderly
people show a lot

00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:10.530 align:middle line:90%
of characteristics of babies.

00:51:10.530 --> 00:51:13.190 align:middle line:84%
For example, they
lose their hair,

00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:15.740 align:middle line:84%
they may lose their teeth,
they may lose control

00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:19.820 align:middle line:84%
over bowels and urine and so
forth, they can't walk anymore.

00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:22.880 align:middle line:84%
And the Greeks thought
this really old person

00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:24.502 align:middle line:90%
was turning into a baby again.

00:51:24.502 --> 00:51:25.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
that's interesting.

00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:26.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: It's a beautiful
way of looking at it.

00:51:26.930 --> 00:51:27.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:51:27.730 --> 00:51:29.450 align:middle line:84%
I saw a documentary
on men and women.

00:51:29.450 --> 00:51:30.740 align:middle line:90%
When you're born, you develop.

00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:32.740 align:middle line:84%
And you age and you--
just before death.

00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:34.809 align:middle line:84%
And it was fascinating
because not only did it

00:51:34.809 --> 00:51:36.350 align:middle line:84%
show that same
characteristic, but it

00:51:36.350 --> 00:51:39.170 align:middle line:84%
showed the male and female
body start the same.

00:51:39.170 --> 00:51:40.670 align:middle line:84%
And from behind--
they showed them

00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:43.670 align:middle line:84%
all through developmental
stages naked from behind,

00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:48.195 align:middle line:84%
end up looking the same
behind before they pass on.

00:51:48.195 --> 00:51:50.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: Even what we think
is tragedy of Alzheimer's, loss

00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:54.480 align:middle line:84%
of memory, babies cannot
form memories, really.

00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:55.280 align:middle line:90%
They forget.

00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:56.488 align:middle line:90%
And this is what's happening.

00:51:56.488 --> 00:51:59.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's just a beautiful way
of looking at the tragedy--

00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:01.070 align:middle line:84%
we view as the
tragedy of old age.

00:52:01.070 --> 00:52:03.300 align:middle line:84%
The Greeks view it as
you're being renewed.

00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:04.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:05.660 align:middle line:90%
OK, a couple more here.

00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:08.780 align:middle line:84%
The Aztecs believed that if
a woman died in childbirth,

00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:10.970 align:middle line:84%
that was a very
esteemed way to go,

00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:13.560 align:middle line:84%
and she would come back
with a sun god, right?

00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:15.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: Yes, yes.

00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:18.340 align:middle line:84%
I should mention, by
the way, that the idea--

00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:22.870 align:middle line:84%
a lot of warrior cultures
consider a woman's death

00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:25.160 align:middle line:84%
in childbirth as the
female equivalent of war.

00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:26.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:27.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: Now, a
lot of Western scholars

00:52:27.350 --> 00:52:28.891 align:middle line:84%
because they're too
specialized, they

00:52:28.891 --> 00:52:30.080 align:middle line:90%
miss this among the Vikings.

00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:34.740 align:middle line:84%
They also have Freyja as
this field where women go.

00:52:34.740 --> 00:52:37.340 align:middle line:84%
She takes actually
half the slain.

00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:39.770 align:middle line:84%
Valhalla takes half
the heroic slain,

00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:42.199 align:middle line:84%
and then Freyja
gets another half.

00:52:42.199 --> 00:52:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of what modern
scholars-- because everybody's

00:52:44.490 --> 00:52:47.750 align:middle line:84%
so specialized-- think,
she's taking half of the men.

00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:51.230 align:middle line:84%
It's clearly a reference to
the female equivalent of war.

00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:54.160 align:middle line:84%
She's a fertility goddess, and
she's taking the heroic women.

00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:57.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, tragically we don't
realize this in the West.

00:52:57.260 --> 00:52:59.315 align:middle line:84%
On an average year, even
today, if you're not

00:52:59.315 --> 00:53:02.450 align:middle line:84%
in some really outlandish
war, more women

00:53:02.450 --> 00:53:05.175 align:middle line:84%
die giving birth
than men die in war.

00:53:05.175 --> 00:53:06.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:53:06.050 --> 00:53:09.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: We've managed to
eliminate in the Western world.

00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:11.280 align:middle line:84%
Today it's really a
shocking experience

00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:14.490 align:middle line:84%
when a young woman or a
woman gives birth or dies

00:53:14.490 --> 00:53:16.140 align:middle line:90%
or dies during the process.

00:53:16.140 --> 00:53:19.290 align:middle line:84%
But in the Third World, it's
still quite common, sadly.

00:53:19.290 --> 00:53:22.510 align:middle line:90%
And hence the equation.

00:53:22.510 --> 00:53:26.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, now, let's
reverse that view of it.

00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:29.850 align:middle line:84%
Plato believed that if you're
a cowardly man that you would

00:53:29.850 --> 00:53:31.950 align:middle line:90%
have to come back as a woman.

00:53:31.950 --> 00:53:33.787 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: That's
clearly-- by the way,

00:53:33.787 --> 00:53:35.620 align:middle line:84%
I've always talked about
this in my classes,

00:53:35.620 --> 00:53:36.703 align:middle line:90%
not this particular point.

00:53:36.703 --> 00:53:39.090 align:middle line:84%
But we idealize
the Ancient Greeks,

00:53:39.090 --> 00:53:41.410 align:middle line:84%
but they're probably
the greatest misogynists

00:53:41.410 --> 00:53:42.500 align:middle line:90%
who have ever existed.

00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:43.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: True.

00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:45.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: We're not even
certain if Greek women had

00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:46.974 align:middle line:90%
first names because--

00:53:46.974 --> 00:53:47.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:53:47.890 --> 00:53:48.990 align:middle line:90%
They were just property?

00:53:48.990 --> 00:53:51.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: Well,
they were nicknames.

00:53:51.490 --> 00:53:54.840 align:middle line:84%
Phryne is actually-- she was
noted for beauty-- was actually

00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:55.770 align:middle line:90%
a prostitute.

00:53:55.770 --> 00:53:56.580 align:middle line:90%
That means toad.

00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:59.190 align:middle line:84%
Who's going to name
their daughter Toad?

00:53:59.190 --> 00:54:02.132 align:middle line:84%
And they often will not
translate these names.

00:54:02.132 --> 00:54:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, even the
Romans don't really

00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:05.400 align:middle line:90%
have names for girls.

00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:07.620 align:middle line:84%
They just feminize
the father's name.

00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:09.401 align:middle line:84%
So that's where
Julia comes from.

00:54:09.401 --> 00:54:11.775 align:middle line:84%
And if he had three daughters,
they were all named Julia.

00:54:11.775 --> 00:54:13.650 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like George
Foreman, in a sense,

00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:16.290 align:middle line:84%
with naming all
the kids the same.

00:54:16.290 --> 00:54:18.540 align:middle line:90%
But the Greeks were really--

00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:21.420 align:middle line:84%
in fact, that's why they
institutionalized bisexuality,

00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:22.530 align:middle line:90%
because the Greeks--

00:54:22.530 --> 00:54:25.950 align:middle line:84%
now, all Greek men were expected
to marry and have children.

00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:27.907 align:middle line:84%
But they viewed
boys for pleasure.

00:54:27.907 --> 00:54:29.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, they'd all end
up in prison today

00:54:29.490 --> 00:54:32.880 align:middle line:84%
because they thought
sex between adult men

00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:35.310 align:middle line:90%
was actually weird to them.

00:54:35.310 --> 00:54:41.620 align:middle line:84%
But they viewed the elder adult
male having sex with a boy,

00:54:41.620 --> 00:54:44.920 align:middle line:84%
it was part of the education
process, strangely enough.

00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:45.837 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, indeed.

00:54:45.837 --> 00:54:47.294 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: So
the reason Plato is

00:54:47.294 --> 00:54:49.760 align:middle line:84%
going to be expressing that
is-- it's a really anti-female

[INAUDIBLE].

00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:52.020 align:middle line:84%
&Gt;>REGINA: It's quite an
insult. If you were a coward,

00:54:52.020 --> 00:54:53.580 align:middle line:90%
you were coming back as a woman.

00:54:53.580 --> 00:54:56.150 align:middle line:84%
So on that note, since
we're out of time,

00:54:56.150 --> 00:55:01.140 align:middle line:84%
which of all of these
mythologies and such

00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:02.610 align:middle line:84%
did you most
personally relate to,

00:55:02.610 --> 00:55:04.620 align:middle line:84%
or do you think
would be the most

00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:07.230 align:middle line:84%
pleasant, agreeable,
or logical of them all?

00:55:07.230 --> 00:55:08.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: The
one thing I think--

00:55:08.850 --> 00:55:10.558 align:middle line:84%
personally speaking
now, not in the book.

00:55:10.558 --> 00:55:12.855 align:middle line:84%
But I'm really convinced
of this notion that--

00:55:12.855 --> 00:55:14.520 align:middle line:84%
and it's discussed
in many traditions--

00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:17.400 align:middle line:84%
that you will encounter
what you expect.

00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:20.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
person's thoughts should

00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:22.170 align:middle line:90%
be directed at a certain way.

00:55:22.170 --> 00:55:26.040 align:middle line:84%
So people literally
should basically

00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:27.540 align:middle line:84%
study all the
traditions and say,

00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:29.262 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to go for this one.

00:55:29.262 --> 00:55:30.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Choose, yeah.

00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:32.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: This is the idea
that our minds are creating

00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:33.306 align:middle line:90%
all of this, if you will.

00:55:33.306 --> 00:55:34.680 align:middle line:84%
In a sense--
because I mentioned,

00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:38.220 align:middle line:84%
the Comanche really will
encounter the happy hunting

00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:41.160 align:middle line:84%
ground with the bison
and the cherry juice.

00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And the Viking will
find his Valhalla.

00:55:45.150 --> 00:55:47.940 align:middle line:84%
And the Christian
will find his heaven.

00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:51.487 align:middle line:84%
And the Jewish person will
go into the Garden of Eden,

00:55:51.487 --> 00:55:53.070 align:middle line:84%
which they believe--
they don't really

00:55:53.070 --> 00:55:55.201 align:middle line:84%
have a-- heaven is
for God in Judaism.

00:55:55.201 --> 00:55:56.700 align:middle line:84%
They believe that
the Garden of Eden

00:55:56.700 --> 00:55:59.090 align:middle line:84%
still exists because
Genesis points it out.

00:55:59.090 --> 00:56:02.580 align:middle line:84%
When Adam and Eve are expelled,
the Eden is still there.

00:56:02.580 --> 00:56:05.150 align:middle line:90%
So that's where they will go.

00:56:05.150 --> 00:56:09.570 align:middle line:84%
But the most important
part is, we understand

00:56:09.570 --> 00:56:12.880 align:middle line:84%
that if you don't plan for
retirement, if you don't lay up

00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:16.800 align:middle line:84%
a pension, if you don't invest,
that's immature behavior.

00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think if
you don't consider

00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:22.410 align:middle line:84%
the possibility there's another
level of existence after this

00:56:22.410 --> 00:56:24.330 align:middle line:84%
and you do nothing
to prepare, that's

00:56:24.330 --> 00:56:27.090 align:middle line:84%
reckless, immature,
childish behavior,

00:56:27.090 --> 00:56:29.985 align:middle line:84%
and should not be,
shall we say, practiced.

00:56:29.985 --> 00:56:31.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with you.

00:56:31.110 --> 00:56:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And one other thing
we didn't get to

00:56:32.540 --> 00:56:34.831 align:middle line:84%
and I think it was very
important-- we'll just throw it

00:56:34.831 --> 00:56:36.990 align:middle line:84%
out there-- is that it
was only when Christendom

00:56:36.990 --> 00:56:39.470 align:middle line:84%
came into being that eternal
hell and damnation ever

00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:40.270 align:middle line:90%
came up.

00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:41.740 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't exist anywhere else.

00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:44.450 align:middle line:84%
This notion of eternal suffering
is exclusively Christian.

00:56:44.450 --> 00:56:46.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: It is curious that
we're not altogether certain

00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:48.241 align:middle line:90%
how that developed, by the way.

00:56:48.241 --> 00:56:50.120 align:middle line:84%
But clearly the first
time we see it--

00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:51.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It
controls people well.

00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:51.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRABELLO: Yes.

00:56:51.810 --> 00:56:53.190 align:middle line:84%
Now I should
mention, although it

00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:57.720 align:middle line:84%
was among the early Christians,
there was debate on this issue.

00:56:57.720 --> 00:57:01.080 align:middle line:10%
For example, they had the
concept of Universalism origin

00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:03.660 align:middle line:10%
in the second century,
that he thought

00:57:03.660 --> 00:57:08.100 align:middle line:10%
that God was so good, ultimately
even Satan would be forgiven

00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:09.720 align:middle line:10%
and taken into heaven.

00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:11.930 align:middle line:10%
And by the way, we
talked about Zoroaster,

00:57:11.930 --> 00:57:14.620 align:middle line:10%
he talked in terms of
ultimately everybody is saved.

00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:15.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:57:15.420 --> 00:57:17.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABELLO: But oddly
enough, by the emergence--

00:57:17.670 --> 00:57:21.540 align:middle line:84%
you've got orthodoxy emerging
in the fourth and fifth century.

00:57:21.540 --> 00:57:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And it kind of
quashed these ideas.

00:57:24.210 --> 00:57:27.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm not altogether certain
why, but eternal damnation

00:57:27.630 --> 00:57:28.650 align:middle line:90%
seems to be--

00:57:28.650 --> 00:57:32.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's reckless
and irresponsible as well,

00:57:32.220 --> 00:57:34.950 align:middle line:84%
as not considering what
might be next for us.

00:57:34.950 --> 00:57:36.570 align:middle line:84%
I just forgot to
put that out there.

00:57:36.570 --> 00:57:39.240 align:middle line:84%
So again, Mark, it's
absolutely fascinating.
