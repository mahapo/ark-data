[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:27.115 align:middle line:90%


00:00:27.115 --> 00:00:28.490 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
I think you're

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.130 align:middle line:10%
going to be fascinated
by this conversation.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.490 align:middle line:10%
Klaire D. Roy is a medium for
a being who identifies himself

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.160 align:middle line:10%
as Djwhal Khul, a nom de plume.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.460 align:middle line:10%
In previous times, he used
Alice Bailey as his scribe.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.740 align:middle line:84%
In her new book,
"Circle of Initiates,"

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.830 align:middle line:84%
Khul explains the levels of
initiation of public figures

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.840 align:middle line:84%
from both the
present and the past.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.910 align:middle line:84%
It is done to help
the reader understand

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.680 align:middle line:84%
how these rays of consciousness
express themselves

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.480 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.280 align:middle line:84%
As we talk about a little
later, not to judge one another.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see there's a third
person with us, who is Josee.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.974 align:middle line:90%
Jhozay" or "Jhozee?"

00:01:00.974 --> 00:01:02.056 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSEE DI SARIO: Jhozay."

00:01:02.056 --> 00:01:03.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: "Jhozay."

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.120 align:middle line:84%
And you are the editor
of "Circle of Initiates,"

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.410 align:middle line:90%
and you're also a translator.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And this is because
Klaire is French Canadian.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.016 align:middle line:84%
And she speaks
English quite well,

00:01:11.016 --> 00:01:12.515 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes gets
a little nervous.

00:01:12.515 --> 00:01:15.320 align:middle line:84%
So if she's
struggling for a word,

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.440 align:middle line:84%
then Josee will be able
to fill in really quickly.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.210 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing
I want to know--

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.760 align:middle line:84%
and I think everybody
will want to know-- is, A,

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.970 align:middle line:90%
how you became a medium for--

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.540 align:middle line:84%
he's known as "The Tibetan"--
for The Tibetan to begin with.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:37.310 align:middle line:10%
>>KLAIRE D. ROY: So one night
I was in a state of meditation.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.110 align:middle line:84%
I was in my 20s,
a long time ago.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.300 align:middle line:90%
And I saw a man in front of me.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.860 align:middle line:90%
He appears in front of me.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And he told me that
I have to change

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.440 align:middle line:84%
some way of my meditation,
the way I meditate.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.010 align:middle line:90%
And I say, oh.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.410 align:middle line:84%
And he told me that I have
to be more concentrate,

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.840 align:middle line:84%
and he gave me some
advice about my life.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.060 align:middle line:90%
And I say OK.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And for the first time, it's the
only thing that he said to me.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And I did not know who
he was, but he came back

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.487 align:middle line:90%
in my meditation-- regularly?

00:02:14.487 --> 00:02:15.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Regularly.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.940 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: During many years.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.430 align:middle line:84%
And I did not know
who he was, really.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And one day, I read a book
written by Alice Bailey.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's a book from the
Tibetan master Djwhal Khul,

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.020 align:middle line:84%
and I was very
fascinating about what

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.320 align:middle line:84%
he transmit in the teaching--
he transmitted in the books.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.340 align:middle line:84%
A month later, he revealed
that he is The Tibetan.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.425 align:middle line:84%
And I don't believe him,
because I'm a very, very--

00:02:46.425 --> 00:02:47.225 align:middle line:90%
septical?

00:02:47.225 --> 00:02:48.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Skeptical woman, yes.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.208 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Skeptical woman.

00:02:49.208 --> 00:02:53.510 align:middle line:84%
And I told him, I
said, it's impossible.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.600 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, I have to slow down my--

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.330 align:middle line:84%
and finally, he asked
me to work for him.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:03.530 align:middle line:90%
And I say, oh, no.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.709 align:middle line:84%
I don't want because I lack
of confidence in me and--

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You don't
have enough confidence.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: Enough confidence
in me to do that.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.875 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did he say why
he chose you to do this?

00:03:12.875 --> 00:03:13.675 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yes.

00:03:13.675 --> 00:03:18.080 align:middle line:84%
He explained to me
because the first thing

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.850 align:middle line:84%
he told me that I was a
disciple-- one of disciple

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.510 align:middle line:90%
in many life, in my past life.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:26.630 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And he told me that I
have a ray one mental.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.125 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A what?

00:03:30.125 --> 00:03:37.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: A ray one, the ray that
influenced my mental body.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What?

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:38.360 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSEE DI SARIO: Mental.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.210 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Mental body.

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:40.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.450 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Is a ray one.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:42.680 align:middle line:90%
And it's a very--

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What is a "rewan"?

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: A ray one, it's
explained in the book.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.285 align:middle line:90%
The ray one is a ray of energy.

00:03:49.285 --> 00:03:50.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, ray.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.110 align:middle line:90%
Yes, ray.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.410 align:middle line:90%
Ray.

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:52.280 align:middle line:90%
Gotcha.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.134 align:middle line:90%
Ray one.

00:03:53.134 --> 00:03:53.934 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Ray one.

00:03:53.934 --> 00:03:55.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, got you.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.830 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Thank you.

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:56.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The first ray.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:57.260 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yeah.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.500 align:middle line:90%
The first ray.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.300 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's very essential
to do the work

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.400 align:middle line:84%
he want me to do
for him because it's

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.710 align:middle line:90%
a ray that very concentrate.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:12.024 align:middle line:84%
And it can't hold
on high energy--

00:04:12.024 --> 00:04:13.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: High energy, yeah.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.800 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yeah.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.600 align:middle line:90%
This ray.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.459 align:middle line:90%
And I said OK.

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And he told me that I
have the level initiation

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.010 align:middle line:90%
enough to do this with him.

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.800 align:middle line:90%
But I refuse again.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.330 align:middle line:90%
He ask me twice and I refuse.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And finally, the third
time he said, just try.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:40.670 align:middle line:84%
And will just transmit to you
a little text, and we will see.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.970 align:middle line:90%
And finally, I accept.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And I write for
him a little text.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.500 align:middle line:90%
And it begin like this.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.340 align:middle line:90%
It's OK?

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's OK.

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:51.800 align:middle line:90%
We understand you perfectly.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.390 align:middle line:84%
Your English is
actually very good.

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.780 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Thank you.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:54.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But I
understand you're

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.100 align:middle line:90%
a stubborn woman, apparently.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.600 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yes.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.507 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I am.

00:04:57.507 --> 00:04:58.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And a skeptical woman.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:59.640 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yes.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this was a
little bit for you to take on.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.680 align:middle line:84%
Were you initially a little
self-conscious about it?

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.840 align:middle line:90%
Did you keep it to yourself?

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:09.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yes.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.490 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:16.355 align:middle line:84%
A long, long time I keep
it for me because I thought

00:05:16.355 --> 00:05:19.540 align:middle line:90%
that people think I was a fool.

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:20.540 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:29.728 align:middle line:84%
And I take-- finally I met a
man who is my teacher, my--

00:05:29.728 --> 00:05:31.660 align:middle line:90%
how can I say, physical teacher?

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:32.460 align:middle line:90%
>>DI SARIO: Mhm.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: And I began
to talk about what

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm experience in my
meditation with this master.

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And he told me, I think it's
the real one, and you have to--

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.090 align:middle line:90%


00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Step up.

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: Yes, and
to work with him.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.500 align:middle line:90%
And I say OK.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And after, when
I begin to write,

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.520 align:middle line:90%
Josee was [INAUDIBLE] my editor?

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:10.250 align:middle line:84%
[SPEAKING FRENCH] And she look
at what she gave it to her.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's hey, it's not the
way you write habitually.

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.050 align:middle line:84%
Because it's like
an English person

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.790 align:middle line:84%
who try to write in
French, because it

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:24.020 align:middle line:90%
talk to me in French.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And you did a little
mistake in French language.

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.410 align:middle line:90%
Now it's better.

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it
indicated the authenticity

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.930 align:middle line:90%
of the experience also, right?

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.509 align:middle line:84%
These little mistakes made
it even more authentic

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:41.050 align:middle line:84%
that this person
was speaking to you.

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:41.390 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yes.

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:41.800 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:42.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.590 align:middle line:84%
And I bring this up for a
reason, because many people--

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:50.240 align:middle line:84%
you know, I just have a
particular question about it,

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.160 align:middle line:90%
bug about it.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.710 align:middle line:84%
Many people say
they're channeling,

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.290 align:middle line:84%
but they're not
actually channeling.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And many people confuse
mediumship with channeling.

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And so from your point
of view, you're a medium.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:04.920 align:middle line:84%
Explain the difference
between the two so

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.540 align:middle line:84%
people understand
that to begin with.

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.070 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: OK.

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:13.500 align:middle line:84%
A channel is a person that
channels another entity or--

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:19.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- But to do that,
they have to get out of--

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:21.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Step aside.

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:22.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Step aside.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And often they don't remember
what the entity said, OK?

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:32.160 align:middle line:90%
But imagine, like me, I can see.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.430 align:middle line:90%
I hear what he said.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:37.410 align:middle line:84%
And sometime, like I said,
I can't argue with him.

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:38.715 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Argue.

00:07:38.715 --> 00:07:41.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: Yes, because
I'm stubborn.

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And sometime I want to
understand more what he said.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.040 align:middle line:90%
And he is very patient.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:48.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Patient.

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Patient.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And he explain the thing
of many ways for me

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:59.790 align:middle line:84%
to be able to understand
what he want to transmit.

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:05.312 align:middle line:84%
And when you're a channel, you
are not able, no, to do that.

00:08:05.312 --> 00:08:06.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, you're removed.

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.797 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yeah.

00:08:07.797 --> 00:08:08.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:10.530 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for explaining
that just so we're

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:12.570 align:middle line:90%
clear on what's going on here.

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:14.670 align:middle line:90%
And so the relationship began.

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And I want to take this back
historically a little bit.

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.480 align:middle line:84%
He also spoke through
Alice Bailey, right?

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yes.

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:27.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it seems that
he comes through someone

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:31.110 align:middle line:84%
at a period of history when
a certain type of lesson

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:34.850 align:middle line:84%
or message needs to be
relayed to humanity.

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And in those days, did
he ever talk to you

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:40.549 align:middle line:84%
about what really was
needed in those times,

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:44.550 align:middle line:84%
in coming through Alice Bailey,
for example, in those days?

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:45.410 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yes.

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:50.310 align:middle line:84%
What he transmit to Alice
Bailey, it was very precious.

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:51.220 align:middle line:90%
It's talk about--

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:52.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Precious.

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:53.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Precious.

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And he explained
a lot of things.

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:58.100 align:middle line:90%
We said occulting--

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Occult.

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:01.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Does it mean "hidden"?

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.140 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: And he explained
a lot of things

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.330 align:middle line:90%
that people want to know.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:13.500 align:middle line:84%
But now he think that people
are ready to integrate what

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:17.671 align:middle line:90%
he teach in this previous book.

00:09:17.671 --> 00:09:19.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What you were
teaching in the previous book.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.750 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: And now he
wants to be more

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:27.490 align:middle line:84%
practical with his
teaching because he

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:32.190 align:middle line:84%
think that people are ready
to experiment what he said.

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:33.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:33.930 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: It's OK?

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:34.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I understand
what you're saying.

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.750 align:middle line:84%
He's saying in
times past, he was

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:39.060 align:middle line:84%
helping, through
Alice Bailey, people

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:43.839 align:middle line:84%
explore the occult or the hidden
realities that underlie life,

00:09:43.839 --> 00:09:45.630 align:middle line:84%
because there was a
great curiosity of that

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:46.430 align:middle line:90%
in those days.

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:48.440 align:middle line:84%
Metaphysics was
being given birth to

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.290 align:middle line:90%
in that era in a new way.

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And today he's saying
we need practical advice

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.660 align:middle line:84%
to begin working and
experimenting with, right?

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:56.460 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yes.

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:57.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right so far?

00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:57.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yes.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:57.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:58.350 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:00.391 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: Before it was just
like giving information

00:10:00.391 --> 00:10:02.850 align:middle line:90%
and people want just to know.

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:05.860 align:middle line:84%
But now, people want
to practice, integrate.

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:06.660 align:middle line:90%
To do.

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:07.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To do.

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And so how did the idea of
this particular book, "Circle

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:14.190 align:middle line:90%
of Initiates," come about?

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:18.090 align:middle line:84%
Why did he decide to
pass this understanding

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:20.700 align:middle line:84%
of the rays of initiation
through in terms

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.380 align:middle line:90%
of public figures?

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: To help us
to understand what

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:27.250 align:middle line:90%
is the influence of the ray.

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:28.240 align:middle line:90%
I pronounce correctly?

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:28.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The ray.

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:29.620 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: The rays.

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:36.220 align:middle line:84%
And he gave with this
initiates information

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:41.090 align:middle line:84%
that it's easy to
us to recognize.

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:45.730 align:middle line:84%
And with this example,
we understand why

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:48.157 align:middle line:90%
this person act a certain way.

00:10:48.157 --> 00:10:49.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The way they do.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.380 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: The way they do.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:56.560 align:middle line:84%
And when we read about
a certain initiate,

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:59.530 align:middle line:84%
we can understand
who we are more.

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:03.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We can recognize those
characteristics in ourselves

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.410 align:middle line:90%
and the people around us.

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:09.340 align:middle line:84%
So it's-- because someone's
public, you're public.

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:11.110 align:middle line:90%
It's up for review.

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:12.970 align:middle line:90%
Your life does become public.

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:15.700 align:middle line:84%
And he's saying, let's
take advantage of that

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.790 align:middle line:84%
and look at it so that
we can all see ourselves

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:20.170 align:middle line:90%
in these various people--

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:20.560 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yes.

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:21.300 align:middle line:90%
You can recognize, yes.

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.133 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and understand
our world better.

00:11:23.133 --> 00:11:25.940 align:middle line:84%
Because some of it is
not what we would expect.

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:27.940 align:middle line:84%
Some people, you know,
you look through the book

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:30.050 align:middle line:84%
and you think, OK, I've
got to get to this page.

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:32.710 align:middle line:84%
Who was-- oh, well, you know
who we're starting out with--

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:33.780 align:middle line:90%
Donald Trump, of course.

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:34.757 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:34.757 --> 00:11:35.890 align:middle line:90%
We're here in America.

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:36.190 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yes.

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:36.440 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But OK,
even Michelangelo,

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:42.980 align:middle line:84%
let's see what Michelangelo
came out as on this scale.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:45.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's an overall
number that's given from--

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:50.410 align:middle line:84%
I think the top person the book
was something like 4.7, or 4.8.

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:51.880 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: A little bit more.

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:57.410 align:middle line:84%
I have two that
reach almost a 7.

00:11:57.410 --> 00:11:58.210 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:11:58.210 --> 00:11:59.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Who were they, again?

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:01.130 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember off hand?

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:01.930 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.730 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, most
of the people were

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:06.380 align:middle line:90%
falling in between 5 and 1.

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:07.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yes.

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:09.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Except for a couple
very extraordinary people,

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.224 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sorry I can't
remember, either.

00:12:11.224 --> 00:12:13.000 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: Well, most
of the people are

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.690 align:middle line:84%
prepared to do their
first initiation.

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:19.710 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to
specify something.

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:24.330 align:middle line:84%
It's not the personality
will be initiated.

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:25.130 align:middle line:90%
It's the soul.

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:25.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The soul.

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:26.985 align:middle line:90%
And this is really important.

00:12:26.985 --> 00:12:27.320 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: It's different.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.650 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it's important.

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And the soul is here to
experiment a lot of things.

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:34.150 align:middle line:90%
The soul likes to experiment.

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:35.000 align:middle line:90%
And we have--

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.872 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we have
many lives to experience.

00:12:39.872 --> 00:12:41.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, to experiment.

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.660 align:middle line:84%
To grow, to continue
to refine ourselves.

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:45.550 align:middle line:84%
So there is no
judgment in these?

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:48.310 align:middle line:84%
He's not-- this being
is not judging anything.

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:51.220 align:middle line:84%
They're simply saying,
these are the factors.

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:52.930 align:middle line:84%
These are kind of
the numeric values

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:55.130 align:middle line:84%
on these different
parts of their lives

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:57.100 align:middle line:90%
that are influencing them.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:58.240 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: But in the book--

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.980 align:middle line:90%
I just want to say something.

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:05.440 align:middle line:84%
In the book, the majority of
the book, it's about initiates.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:08.660 align:middle line:84%
But at the end, we
explain what is the rays,

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:10.030 align:middle line:90%
the function of the rays.

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:13.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So before we get
into the actual calibrations

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:15.070 align:middle line:90%
of the initiates--

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:18.097 align:middle line:84%
and we're really not going into
great detail in any of them--

00:13:18.097 --> 00:13:19.930 align:middle line:84%
we're going into just
the primary thing that

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:23.530 align:middle line:84%
influences them, for good or for
worse, and a baseline number.

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:25.030 align:middle line:90%
So people can get--

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:27.880 align:middle line:84%
even though it's not supposed
to be about comparisons--

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:31.330 align:middle line:84%
you can get a
comparative understanding

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:32.710 align:middle line:90%
of the level of development.

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:34.910 align:middle line:84%
OK, that's maybe a
better way to say it.

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:37.480 align:middle line:84%
So first tell us about
rays one through seven.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.740 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about the
value of each ray.

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:40.540 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: OK.

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:43.330 align:middle line:84%
The Tibetan master
explained in the book

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.100 align:middle line:84%
written by Alice
Bailey that there

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:54.300 align:middle line:84%
are seven rays that
influence all the kingdom who

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:57.010 align:middle line:90%
are in this Earth.

00:13:57.010 --> 00:14:02.710 align:middle line:90%
And we have five bodies--

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:05.650 align:middle line:90%
human kind have five bodies--

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:08.574 align:middle line:84%
physical bodies, astral
bodies, mental bodies--

00:14:08.574 --> 00:14:09.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mental body.

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:10.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Mental.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:10.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mental.

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:11.305 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Mental.

00:14:11.305 --> 00:14:11.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, that's it.

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:12.190 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Sorry.

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:12.990 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:14.950 align:middle line:90%
Mental body.

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:17.260 align:middle line:90%
Personality, the soul.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:18.700 align:middle line:90%
And we have the Monad.

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:21.384 align:middle line:84%
But the Monad is so far
up from us that we don't--

00:14:21.384 --> 00:14:23.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're not
consciously aware of that.

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:23.620 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: No.

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:24.550 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:29.090 align:middle line:84%
And each of our bodies
is influenced by a ray--

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:32.350 align:middle line:90%


00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:35.140 align:middle line:90%
a ray that influences our soul.

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:37.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's the only
one that didn't--

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:38.140 align:middle line:90%
don't change.

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:39.181 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Doesn't change.

00:14:39.181 --> 00:14:41.620 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: Doesn't change
with our incarnation.

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:46.960 align:middle line:84%
It's the one that we keep during
all our incarnations on Earth.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:48.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if
there are seven rays,

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:51.040 align:middle line:84%
maybe you're influenced
by the first,

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.397 align:middle line:84%
or I'm influenced by
the second, or you're

00:14:53.397 --> 00:14:54.480 align:middle line:90%
influenced by the seventh.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.010 align:middle line:90%
Is it like that?

00:14:56.010 --> 00:15:00.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: The soul chooses a ray
that you will be influenced.

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:02.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The primary influence.

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:04.840 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: During all its
incarnations on Earth.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:09.250 align:middle line:84%
But it choose other
four rays to experiment

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:10.690 align:middle line:90%
because you want to know--

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:14.800 align:middle line:84%
the soul wants to know what is
the influence of all the rays.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And to do that, soul is feminine
or the soul has to experiment

00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:20.730 align:middle line:90%
with all the rays--

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:22.240 align:middle line:90%
the influence of the rays.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:26.320 align:middle line:84%
So you have the ray
one, and the ray one

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.180 align:middle line:90%
is the will and the power.

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:39.800 align:middle line:84%
So a person who has this ray
in his configuration of rays

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.030 align:middle line:90%
will experiment will and power.

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:43.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
you're at that ray.

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:44.460 align:middle line:90%
You said you--

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:48.610 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: In my mental,
yes, I have this.

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:52.190 align:middle line:84%
You have the ray two,
who is love and wisdom.

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:55.460 align:middle line:84%
So I have a ray two
in my personality.

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:57.650 align:middle line:84%
So the ray two is
very sensitive.

00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:03.550 align:middle line:90%
It likes to work with people.

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:09.020 align:middle line:84%
The ray three is adaptability
and active intelligence.

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:12.580 align:middle line:84%
So this kind of people want
to experiment a lot of things

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:15.900 align:middle line:84%
and they want to
understand a lot of things.

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:19.810 align:middle line:90%
The ray four is for the artist.

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:24.120 align:middle line:90%
It's beauty and it's conflict--

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:24.920 align:middle line:90%
no.

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:26.420 align:middle line:90%
Harmony through conflict?

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:27.314 align:middle line:90%
>>DI SARIO: Right.

00:16:27.314 --> 00:16:28.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How do
you say it again?

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:29.672 align:middle line:84%
>>DI SARIO: Harmony
through conflict.

00:16:29.672 --> 00:16:31.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Harmony
through conflict.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yes.

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:38.240 align:middle line:84%
Often when you have a ray four,
you will live up and down.

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.040 align:middle line:90%
But it's very [STAMMERING].

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:40.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Artistic.

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:41.490 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Artistic?

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:42.290 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:47.130 align:middle line:84%
The ray five is the ray of
intelligence, scientific.

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:49.445 align:middle line:84%
So this kind of
people are very--

00:16:49.445 --> 00:16:53.780 align:middle line:90%


00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:55.520 align:middle line:90%
>>DI SARIO: Drawn to.

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:57.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Concerned about science.

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:01.250 align:middle line:84%
They want the proof
of everything.

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:02.720 align:middle line:90%
They want to-- OK?

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I understand.

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:05.790 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: And you have the ray six.

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:09.839 align:middle line:84%
The ray six is the
idealist and devotion.

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:11.707 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Idealism,
mhm, and devotion.

00:17:11.707 --> 00:17:12.540 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: And devotion.

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:13.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:18.819 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: And the ray seven
is the ceremonial order

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:21.130 align:middle line:90%
and the magic aspect.

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:21.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:22.730 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:24.530 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: So this is
the seven rays.

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:28.400 align:middle line:84%
In the book, we
explain at the end

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:34.549 align:middle line:84%
what is the influence
of the ray on each body.

00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:35.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, and that's good.

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:36.960 align:middle line:84%
That glossary's
in the background

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:38.335 align:middle line:84%
because it just
fleshes out our--

00:17:38.335 --> 00:17:42.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: So they help
us to recognize us

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:46.730 align:middle line:84%
in the way we are in
the relationship we

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:48.552 align:middle line:90%
have with others, OK?

00:17:48.552 --> 00:17:50.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Relationship
with others.

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:52.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: Yes, like if
you put something--

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:54.930 align:middle line:90%
I can give an example?

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:55.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:55.730 --> 00:18:00.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: If you put in a team
a ray one with a ray two,

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:04.220 align:middle line:84%
it was difficult for the ray
two to work with the ray one.

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:09.260 align:middle line:84%
Because a ray one is
power and is the will.

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:13.350 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter what
the feeling of the others.

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:15.320 align:middle line:84%
He just wants to
do what he wants

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:17.900 align:middle line:90%
to do, and to go to the goal.

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:22.880 align:middle line:84%
But for the person with a
ray two, very sensitive,

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:25.760 align:middle line:84%
who like the relationship with
your nurse is very difficult

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:30.230 align:middle line:84%
because often it
will be 'blesser'?

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:33.510 align:middle line:84%
Hurt by the action
of the ray one.

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:34.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And we see this not only
among families and friends

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.170 align:middle line:84%
and people at
large in countries,

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:41.850 align:middle line:84%
but these are also
existing within ourselves,

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:44.030 align:middle line:84%
where we have these
competing factions to come

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:45.840 align:middle line:90%
into this understanding, right?

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:46.640 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yeah.

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we have
internal conflict or harmony

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:50.540 align:middle line:90%
through conflict.

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:51.340 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yeah.

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:54.770 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's the game
of the rays inside of us.

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:56.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:57.627 align:middle line:90%
That makes sense.

00:18:57.627 --> 00:18:58.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very good.

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:01.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: So in various
circumstances,

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:05.660 align:middle line:84%
we are focused on
our astral body,

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:09.540 align:middle line:90%
so we are influenced with--

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:13.360 align:middle line:84%
for example, if I have a
ray six in my astral body,

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:17.930 align:middle line:84%
I will very warm, but very
possessive and jealous.

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:19.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Very
possessive and jealous.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:23.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: And jealous, maybe
if I have the negative.

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:27.719 align:middle line:84%
Because each ray have
a positive aspect--

00:19:27.719 --> 00:19:28.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And a negative.

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:32.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: And negative aspect.

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:36.830 align:middle line:84%
I give an example in the book
that if I went to a party

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:45.440 align:middle line:84%
and I saw my lover with a
beautiful woman, I can become--

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:48.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can become
jealous and possessive

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:51.590 align:middle line:84%
if you have the ray six
in your astral body.

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:55.130 align:middle line:84%
So all of these things
contribute to the whole

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:57.360 align:middle line:90%
of our expression in the world.

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:58.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yes.

00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:59.040 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:19:59.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.820 align:middle line:84%
By the way, your English
is doing really well.

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:03.110 align:middle line:90%
You're doing very well.

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:04.070 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Thank you.

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:04.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very, very well.

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:05.635 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: OK, thank you.

00:20:05.635 --> 00:20:07.520 align:middle line:90%
I just want to--

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:11.960 align:middle line:84%
in the book we put
the initiation level,

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:15.110 align:middle line:90%
but we don't explain it.

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:17.750 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do
this in the next book

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:23.030 align:middle line:84%
because we don't want that
people be too concerned

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:27.230 align:middle line:90%
about initiation level.

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:29.720 align:middle line:84%
We have to know
before our rays--

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:32.530 align:middle line:84%
the influence of our
rays in our life.

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And after, we can
go and experiment

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:39.590 align:middle line:90%
with initiation level.

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:40.560 align:middle line:90%
It's OK?

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:41.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, I understand
what you're saying.

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:42.593 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, because it is.

00:20:42.593 --> 00:20:44.940 align:middle line:84%
You give kind of a
numeric, a number.

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:47.400 align:middle line:84%
And then there are
personality traits and such

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.820 align:middle line:84%
that follow that, but you
don't go into deep explanation

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:50.620 align:middle line:90%
of the rays there.

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:51.740 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: No, not in this book.

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:52.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:56.250 align:middle line:84%
But it's enough that you get
a glimpse into the deeper

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:59.490 align:middle line:84%
underpinnings or workings
of that person's being

00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:02.170 align:middle line:84%
and how it's expressing
himself in the world.

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:04.080 align:middle line:84%
OK, well I think we
should probably just

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.970 align:middle line:90%
launch right in then, OK?

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:10.560 align:middle line:84%
So the first one we're going
to start with is Donald Trump.

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:13.170 align:middle line:84%
And this was written well
before he was president.

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:14.850 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yes, many years before.

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:15.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:20.280 align:middle line:84%
So let's go into that,
because I think it matters.

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to tell
you that I called

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:25.380 align:middle line:84%
upon other systems
of calibration

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:29.280 align:middle line:84%
independently to also
look at Donald Trump

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:31.170 align:middle line:84%
in particular to
see if there was

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:34.440 align:middle line:84%
an overlay, if that system
indicated the same features

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:37.320 align:middle line:84%
and levels of
consciousness awareness.

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And everything really
totally validated each other.

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:42.930 align:middle line:84%
So I just wanted to
do that for myself.

00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:46.200 align:middle line:84%
So with that said, let's
go into Donald Trump.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.310 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: OK.

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:48.750 align:middle line:90%
So you want me to talk about it?

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:50.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Mhm, you
can talk about it.

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:51.370 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: OK.

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:54.800 align:middle line:84%
The first thing,
I was very upset

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:59.430 align:middle line:84%
when the election go
on in the United States

00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:04.690 align:middle line:84%
because Mr. Trump, he
is a young initiate.

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:08.520 align:middle line:90%
So he is only 1.2.

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:11.970 align:middle line:90%
So it's a young soul.

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And when you are a young
soul, you want to experiment,

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:21.410 align:middle line:84%
but you are not able to see
the positive action of the rays

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:22.210 align:middle line:90%
on you.

00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:23.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:25.920 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm understanding,
as young souls,

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:29.770 align:middle line:84%
you're more experiencing the
negative aspect of the rays.

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:33.380 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: Yeah, you are
almost a victim of the ray.

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:34.470 align:middle line:90%
Almost.

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:38.040 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to panic,
but you have to be--

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.620 align:middle line:90%


00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:44.790 align:middle line:84%
more you are able
to play with the ray

00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:48.995 align:middle line:84%
and to go to the
positive aspect.

00:22:48.995 --> 00:22:49.795 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:49.795 --> 00:22:51.410 align:middle line:90%
Well, that makes sense.

00:22:51.410 --> 00:22:56.784 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: And Mr. Trump has a
ray one in his physical body.

00:22:56.784 --> 00:22:57.825 align:middle line:90%
And it's very important--

00:22:57.825 --> 00:22:58.625 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Will.

00:22:58.625 --> 00:22:59.880 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Will.

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.280 align:middle line:90%
This is the will and power.

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's important to
know it because if he

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:09.540 align:middle line:90%
is a young initiate--

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:14.040 align:middle line:84%
and when you are young,
you are focusing very

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.600 align:middle line:90%
hard on your physical body.

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:19.980 align:middle line:84%
So the ray one
influence is bringing

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:22.320 align:middle line:90%
to the way he was thinking.

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:26.400 align:middle line:84%
So he want to experiment
the will and power.

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.566 align:middle line:84%
Just want to do
[SPEAKING FRENCH].

00:23:28.566 --> 00:23:29.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What did you say?

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:30.640 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: [SPEAKING FRENCH].

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:31.220 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:32.303 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, parentheses.

00:23:32.303 --> 00:23:33.600 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yeah, parentheses.

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:34.714 align:middle line:90%
Because--

00:23:34.714 --> 00:23:36.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is all
parenthetical, OK.

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:41.080 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: Your show, "Open
Minds," is very interesting,

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:44.530 align:middle line:84%
because with the
first initiation,

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:48.080 align:middle line:90%
it's the open heart.

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:49.827 align:middle line:84%
And after, it's
open mind, because--

00:23:49.827 --> 00:23:50.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:53.960 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: Because you begin--
between the one and two

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.020 align:middle line:90%
initiation--

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:59.850 align:middle line:84%
you begin the
mental polarization.

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:03.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's the open
mind to the universe.

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:04.230 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:07.650 align:middle line:84%
So for me, yes, I think
that your audience

00:24:07.650 --> 00:24:15.180 align:middle line:84%
it's maybe more than one
initiation it already did.

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:16.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, I think so.

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:17.800 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I would agree with that.

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:18.600 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yeah.

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And the people who
live here, the majority

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:26.442 align:middle line:84%
has not done their
first initiation.

00:24:26.442 --> 00:24:27.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
majority of Americans

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:29.858 align:middle line:84%
have not reached the
first level of initiation.

00:24:29.858 --> 00:24:30.720 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yeah.

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.274 align:middle line:10%
But it's all over the world.

00:24:32.274 --> 00:24:33.440 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes, I understand.

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:38.640 align:middle line:10%
>>ROY: The humanities prepare
to do their first initiation.

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:47.100 align:middle line:84%
And American people, the
majority has not do this.

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:49.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Has not
done this, yes.

00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:55.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: And they have
some lessons to learn

00:24:55.740 --> 00:25:00.360 align:middle line:90%
about love and about the power.

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:07.100 align:middle line:84%
Because each country
has rays to influence

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:08.730 align:middle line:90%
the energy in the country.

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:11.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So what is the US ray?

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:12.880 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Six.

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:13.770 align:middle line:90%
Idealist--

00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:14.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Idealism.

00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:17.490 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: And devotion.

00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And for the ray six
personality, so it's--

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:27.880 align:middle line:90%
how can I say?

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.760 align:middle line:84%
When you are young,
it's black or white.

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:32.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very much true here.

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:34.610 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yeah.

00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:37.630 align:middle line:84%
The majority of
people are influenced

00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:40.270 align:middle line:90%
by the energy of the country.

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:44.430 align:middle line:90%
So they are great idealists.

00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:46.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Idealism.

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:48.800 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: You have good English.

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And they have to lose some
illusion about themselves.

00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:59.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It becomes so complex.

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:03.490 align:middle line:84%
You may have a soul that
actually is showing itself

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:06.490 align:middle line:84%
through these means
and calibration to you

00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:10.270 align:middle line:84%
or others as a certain level,
but then becoming caught up

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:13.000 align:middle line:84%
in world affairs, and
agendas, and making deals,

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.820 align:middle line:84%
and all of this seems
to indicate they

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:17.170 align:middle line:90%
might be something different.

00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:17.840 align:middle line:90%
You see what I'm saying?

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:18.640 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yes.

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.830 align:middle line:84%
Mhm, because the
rays are different

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:23.150 align:middle line:84%
and the influence of
the rays are different.

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:24.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:28.950 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: The difference between
Obama and Madame Clinton--

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:32.350 align:middle line:84%
they have the same
initiation level,

00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:40.570 align:middle line:84%
but he have a seven-ray
soul and is the perfection--

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:41.370 align:middle line:90%
order.

00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:43.750 align:middle line:84%
He wants to make
order in the country.

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:51.690 align:middle line:84%
Because with this
level of initiation,

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:55.840 align:middle line:84%
the soul has an
influence on him.

00:26:55.840 --> 00:27:01.480 align:middle line:84%
The same thing for Mrs.
Clinton, but she has a ray two.

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:03.460 align:middle line:90%
It's loving compassion.

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:07.260 align:middle line:84%
And she has a ray six
in her astral body,

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:08.890 align:middle line:90%
and she is a woman.

00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And when we are a
woman, we are more

00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:15.460 align:middle line:90%
influenced by our astral body.

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:18.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that one can go
into some negative aspects.

00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:19.660 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yes.

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:20.826 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So each of these--

00:27:20.826 --> 00:27:22.740 align:middle line:84%
I think this is a
good part to mention.

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:26.590 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of one's overall
number that we're looking at,

00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:29.500 align:middle line:84%
the 2.3 or whatever,
that these rays

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:32.590 align:middle line:84%
are impacting us either
positively or negatively

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:33.490 align:middle line:90%
at any given time.

00:27:33.490 --> 00:27:36.600 align:middle line:84%
We may have four of the
different aspects positive,

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:39.670 align:middle line:84%
but two negative that we
haven't learned to contend with.

00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And that could be the
influence we're actually

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:42.940 align:middle line:90%
seeing in that person.

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:43.840 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yes.

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And you know when you pass
your second initiation,

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:48.077 align:middle line:90%
there is an arrogance.

00:27:48.077 --> 00:27:49.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: After your
second initiation

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:50.910 align:middle line:90%
there's an arrogance?

00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:52.000 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yeah.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.920 align:middle line:84%
At this time, you
know that-- you

00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:01.960 align:middle line:84%
see you have a larger vision
than the people in general.

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:07.270 align:middle line:84%
And you are sure that
you can do better

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:09.740 align:middle line:90%
for them, for the people.

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:15.970 align:middle line:84%
And I think that Madame Clinton
has this illusion in her.

00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:18.040 align:middle line:90%
Not necessarily Obama.

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:18.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:19.600 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:21.016 align:middle line:84%
He was more pragmatic
in his view.

00:28:21.016 --> 00:28:22.725 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: More pragmatic, yes.

00:28:22.725 --> 00:28:24.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's look at
one final political figure,

00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:27.910 align:middle line:90%
and that's Mikhail Gorbachev.

00:28:27.910 --> 00:28:29.844 align:middle line:90%
That was interesting.

00:28:29.844 --> 00:28:31.540 align:middle line:90%
Please tell us about him.

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:33.970 align:middle line:84%
We all know what happened
under his watch--

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:36.730 align:middle line:84%
perestroika, the
world that we knew

00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:41.420 align:middle line:84%
before the Iron Curtain
came down, so to speak,

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:43.090 align:middle line:90%
and the Soviet Union.

00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And that was under
Mikhail Gorbachev's watch.

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:47.904 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about his
level of initiation.

00:28:47.904 --> 00:28:49.320 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: I was very
surprised when I

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:56.930 align:middle line:90%
know his level initiation, 3.2.

00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:57.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 3.2

00:28:57.730 --> 00:29:01.510 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: So he is a
very interesting man.

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And he was very aware of
the suffering of the people.

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's his level of
initiation that give it to him.

00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:15.816 align:middle line:84%
And he was very
tuned with his soul.

00:29:15.816 --> 00:29:17.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Attuned with his soul.

00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:19.300 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Attuned with his soul.

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:25.286 align:middle line:84%
When you meet a man who
has this initiation--

00:29:25.286 --> 00:29:26.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Initiation
level of 3.2.

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:32.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: You know that
now he is ready to work

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:34.810 align:middle line:90%
behind the scenes.

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:38.500 align:middle line:84%
Because now he don't
want to be in front

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:43.960 align:middle line:84%
because he wants to help
humanity in the other way.

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And Gorbachev did
the most he can

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:56.290 align:middle line:84%
with what he have
to deal in Russie.

00:29:56.290 --> 00:30:02.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think he did a lot of
things for his people there.

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:09.130 align:middle line:84%
And what helped him,
that he has a ray--

00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:12.200 align:middle line:90%
the ray of his soul is a three.

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:16.720 align:middle line:10%
So it's adaptability
and active intelligence.

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:22.180 align:middle line:84%
So he is a very
good diplomatic man.

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:28.510 align:middle line:10%
So he can see many ways
of the same situation.

00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:30.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Many sides
of the same situation.

00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:31.490 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Sorry.

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:33.040 align:middle line:90%
Sides of the same situation.

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:38.670 align:middle line:10%
And he can see what he
can do for amelioration--

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:40.477 align:middle line:10%
[SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:30:40.477 --> 00:30:41.560 align:middle line:10%
>>DI SARIO: To ameliorate.

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:43.090 align:middle line:10%
>>ROY: To ameliorate
the situation.

00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:45.006 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: To ameliorate
the situation, gotcha.

00:30:45.006 --> 00:30:48.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: He is very a
person of great heart.

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:49.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:52.330 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I mean, I was surprised--

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:55.720 align:middle line:84%
not shocked, but a little
surprised, considering what's

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.910 align:middle line:90%
going on right now.

00:30:57.910 --> 00:30:59.320 align:middle line:90%
So thank you for that.

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:00.940 align:middle line:84%
One of the people
that actually had

00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:05.170 align:middle line:84%
a fairly high level of
initiation here in the book

00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:08.040 align:middle line:90%
was Helena Blavatsky.

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:08.840 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yes.

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:09.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:13.030 align:middle line:84%
And she was, of
course, an occultist

00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:17.830 align:middle line:84%
of the day in the '20s
and '30s in America.

00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:20.340 align:middle line:84%
And she was from Russia
initially, right?

00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:21.140 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yes.

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:21.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:25.690 align:middle line:84%
And she understood,
certainly, occult concepts,

00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:29.650 align:middle line:84%
the hidden realities of
life, on a very deep level.

00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:31.390 align:middle line:84%
But even so, I was
surprised that she

00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:34.540 align:middle line:84%
calibrated that high-- one of
the higher ones in the book.

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:41.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: But if-- do you
already read her life?

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:42.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Her life story?

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:43.120 align:middle line:90%
I've never read her life--

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:43.994 align:middle line:90%
I know I should have.

00:31:43.994 --> 00:31:46.210 align:middle line:90%
I've only read-- I mean, the--

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:47.170 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:31:47.170 --> 00:31:49.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: It's a very
passionate life.

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And you realize when
you read his life

00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:56.200 align:middle line:90%
that she did a lot of things.

00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:03.800 align:middle line:10%
And she always wanted to be the
server, to serve the master.

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:09.780 align:middle line:10%
She met master when she
went to the Himalayas.

00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:12.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To the Himalayas,
she met with the master.

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:13.320 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yes.

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:17.420 align:middle line:84%
And his master was
El Morya Khan and is

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:20.910 align:middle line:90%
the master of the first ray.

00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The master of
the first three rays?

00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:25.580 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yes, El Morya Khan..

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:29.500 align:middle line:90%
So she is a part of his ashram.

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:31.630 align:middle line:84%
So she have the
will and the power

00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:34.690 align:middle line:84%
to do what the
master want to do.

00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:38.830 align:middle line:10%
She has to have this
level of initiation

00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:45.680 align:middle line:10%
to do what she did because
it was very hard at that time

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:53.200 align:middle line:10%
to go through the
unconscious of the people.

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:58.360 align:middle line:84%
Yes, the unconsciousness
of the people.

00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:01.810 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: And she worked
with Djwhal Khul, too.

00:33:01.810 --> 00:33:06.790 align:middle line:84%
She was the first
with Djwhal Khul

00:33:06.790 --> 00:33:11.330 align:middle line:84%
work to transmit
to his teaching.

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:12.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:13.338 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Worked as a scribe.

00:33:13.338 --> 00:33:16.543 align:middle line:90%
I call it as a scribe, but yes.

00:33:16.543 --> 00:33:17.530 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: OK.

00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:19.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So yes, and
so she did come out

00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:24.340 align:middle line:84%
at a very interesting
number, 4.5.

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't have
a great understanding

00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:30.370 align:middle line:84%
for a lot of the higher
hidden concepts of the basis,

00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:31.640 align:middle line:90%
the nature of reality.

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:35.620 align:middle line:84%
And the parts about her
work that I have read,

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:37.240 align:middle line:90%
I have had respect for.

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:39.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, politics
always gets into it.

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:42.090 align:middle line:90%
That day was rife with politics.

00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:44.620 align:middle line:84%
It was a very interesting
time, the emergence

00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:47.930 align:middle line:84%
of all of these occultists
back in the teens,

00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:49.990 align:middle line:90%
'20s, and '30s in America.

00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:52.900 align:middle line:84%
So that said, she wasn't
necessarily the most popular.

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:54.880 align:middle line:90%
Some people disliked her.

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:56.146 align:middle line:90%
Very powerful, strong woman.

00:33:56.146 --> 00:33:57.645 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless,
at the core, you're

00:33:57.645 --> 00:33:59.800 align:middle line:84%
saying there was this
high level of mastery.

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:01.480 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at Deepak Chopra.

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:02.320 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Oh, yeah.

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:05.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Deepak Chopra,
which came in at a 2.3,

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:06.940 align:middle line:84%
the same level we're
looking at in--

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:09.389 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: I thought he was higher.

00:34:09.389 --> 00:34:19.239 align:middle line:84%
When Djwhal Khul explained
to me why he is only a 2.3,

00:34:19.239 --> 00:34:20.510 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:24.100 align:middle line:90%
So he has--

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:26.380 align:middle line:84%
I like him very
much, Deepak Chopra.

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:31.110 align:middle line:84%
But he has a certain
arrogance that because he

00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:37.010 align:middle line:84%
has work to do with the mass
of the people, and for me,

00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:39.670 align:middle line:84%
it's a kind of
sacrifice that he did,

00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:45.820 align:middle line:84%
because he wanted
to be understand.

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:47.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To be understood.

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:49.826 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: To be understood
by, and he wanted

00:34:49.826 --> 00:34:51.520 align:middle line:90%
to understand the people.

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And when you are too high,
you have difficulty sometimes

00:34:57.090 --> 00:34:57.890 align:middle line:90%
to understand.

00:34:57.890 --> 00:34:59.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Relate to the people.

00:34:59.110 --> 00:34:59.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Relate.

00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:00.350 align:middle line:90%
Ah, relate.

00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:00.710 align:middle line:90%
It's good.

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:01.510 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:03.600 align:middle line:90%
To the people.

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And Deepak Chopra
did a very good job.

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And for me, he help
a lot of people.

00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have to stuck
about his level of initiation

00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:21.700 align:middle line:84%
because his teaching
is very good

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:25.200 align:middle line:90%
and he helps a lot of people.

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:27.180 align:middle line:90%
And it's important for me.

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:31.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, he came in at a
particular level of expression

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:33.790 align:middle line:84%
to be able to be heard
and seen and have people

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:37.600 align:middle line:84%
relate to him for what he had
to teach at that moment in time.

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:39.550 align:middle line:84%
So he could just
as easily come back

00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:43.060 align:middle line:84%
in the next incarnation, when
humanity's level of initiation

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:45.910 align:middle line:84%
has risen, and have a
completely different way

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:47.110 align:middle line:90%
of showing himself.

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:48.350 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yes.

00:35:48.350 --> 00:35:48.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:48.940 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:49.740 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:51.670 align:middle line:84%
And Carlos Castaneda,
I chose him.

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:54.710 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Oh, gosh.

00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:57.490 align:middle line:84%
OK, I was surprised
because I'm not

00:35:57.490 --> 00:36:00.970 align:middle line:90%
comfortable with his teaching.

00:36:00.970 --> 00:36:02.980 align:middle line:90%
But he is 3.--

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:03.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 2.

00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:08.520 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: 3.2.

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:14.980 align:middle line:84%
DK, Djwhal Khul, said that he
would be probably more evolved

00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:19.000 align:middle line:90%
if he was not a white sorcerer?

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm, a white magician.

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:24.040 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: White magician,
because he played too much

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:26.530 align:middle line:90%
with this kind of energy.

00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And he liked to play
with this, and he

00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:35.150 align:middle line:84%
start to evolve in-- we
said in the vertical?

00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:35.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:36.750 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yes.

00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:40.570 align:middle line:84%
He'd always experiment
on the horizontal plane.

00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:43.310 align:middle line:90%


00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:48.460 align:middle line:84%
But he has a way to teach
that makes me uncomfortable.

00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:49.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, OK.

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:51.690 align:middle line:84%
But then you probably
were speaking--

00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:54.000 align:middle line:84%
when he was telling you
this, you were saying, no,

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:54.946 align:middle line:90%
[SPEAKING FRENCH].

00:36:54.946 --> 00:36:56.330 align:middle line:10%
>>ROY: No, no.

00:36:56.330 --> 00:36:57.130 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:36:57.130 --> 00:36:59.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm sure you
were arguing with him.

00:36:59.510 --> 00:37:00.310 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:02.750 align:middle line:90%
So now L. Ron Hubbard--

00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:03.550 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Oh, yes.

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:05.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: The Scientology--

00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:07.360 align:middle line:90%
I've got to bring this one up.

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:09.490 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: I was so surprised, too.

00:37:09.490 --> 00:37:10.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 3.7.

00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:13.850 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yeah, it's so high.

00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:16.660 align:middle line:90%
No, I understand.

00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:20.020 align:middle line:84%
This man was, I think
in his past life,

00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:23.262 align:middle line:90%
was a very interesting person.

00:37:23.262 --> 00:37:30.764 align:middle line:84%
DK mentioned he will be probably
Leonardo da Vinci, I think?

00:37:30.764 --> 00:37:31.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Leonardo da Vinci.

00:37:31.930 --> 00:37:32.730 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yeah.

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:37.870 align:middle line:84%
And in this life, he
has the great potential

00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:39.590 align:middle line:90%
to do a lot of things.

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:42.880 align:middle line:90%
And he do a lot of things.

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:52.660 align:middle line:84%
But for me, he's always on
the razor's edge on the side

00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:59.690 align:middle line:90%
of to be OK or not OK, to be--

00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:01.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK not OK in what way?

00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:04.420 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: In what way, eh?

00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:10.770 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I think he was a
little bit on the negative way.

00:38:10.770 --> 00:38:14.260 align:middle line:90%
And he manipulates people.

00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:16.990 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not sure--

00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:21.070 align:middle line:90%
I think he will--

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:25.100 align:middle line:84%
he wants to do that in a
good way for the people.

00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:33.840 align:middle line:84%
But when you look with a step
back, I'm not sure he did.

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:36.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It said in the
book that he actually

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:40.797 align:middle line:84%
regressed from what he came
in as within this lifetime.

00:38:40.797 --> 00:38:41.630 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: I'm not sure.

00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:43.963 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I think that's
what it said in the book,

00:38:43.963 --> 00:38:45.630 align:middle line:84%
what Djwhal Khul
said, is that he--

00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:48.190 align:middle line:84%
I think by his death, he
had started regressing.

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:49.040 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: OK.

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:50.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:38:50.370 --> 00:38:54.370 align:middle line:84%
Maybe he didn't carry out the
intention in the full integrity

00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:56.485 align:middle line:90%
that his soul had intended.

00:38:56.485 --> 00:39:00.070 align:middle line:84%
Because when you looked at the
work from 40 years ago about

00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:03.730 align:middle line:84%
this self-empowering way
of viewing your life--

00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:05.744 align:middle line:84%
deconstructing and
reconstructing your life--

00:39:05.744 --> 00:39:07.660 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning, he
looked at it and thought,

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:09.160 align:middle line:90%
well, that makes sense.

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:12.220 align:middle line:84%
But it turned into a
cult kind of movement

00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:13.345 align:middle line:90%
with a different directive.

00:39:13.345 --> 00:39:14.150 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: I agree.

00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:17.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So maybe one of those
rays started impacting his ego

00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:18.490 align:middle line:90%
and need for power.

00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:18.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yes.

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:20.384 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And maybe
that's what started

00:39:20.384 --> 00:39:26.020 align:middle line:84%
taking the original ideal
he came in with down

00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:28.697 align:middle line:84%
to where he regressed by his
death, something like that.

00:39:28.697 --> 00:39:29.530 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: I agree, yes.

00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:31.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's kind
of how I took that.

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:33.880 align:middle line:90%
So Michelangelo.

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:39.790 align:middle line:84%
Michelangelo, he was a
high-level initiate, 3.8.

00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:42.470 align:middle line:84%
But what surprised
me about him--

00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:43.270 align:middle line:90%
not surprised me.

00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:45.790 align:middle line:84%
But what I find
interesting about that,

00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:49.230 align:middle line:84%
both he and Leonardo da Vinci--
which I think da Vinci was

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:51.220 align:middle line:90%
a 3.2, they're both up there--

00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:55.480 align:middle line:84%
is that we need to understand
the times they lived in.

00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:58.210 align:middle line:84%
They were these
levels of initiation

00:39:58.210 --> 00:40:01.600 align:middle line:84%
in times that were darker
in understanding than what

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:03.880 align:middle line:90%
we're swimming in today.

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:06.820 align:middle line:84%
So actually, the differential
between the level

00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:09.850 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness among the
people and where they were

00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:12.432 align:middle line:90%
was quite a disparity.

00:40:12.432 --> 00:40:14.140 align:middle line:84%
They were way ahead
of their time-- well,

00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:16.060 align:middle line:84%
certainly they were very
high-level initiates

00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:17.230 align:middle line:90%
of their day.

00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:20.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: For me, I think
it was very difficult

00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:24.210 align:middle line:90%
for them to live at that epoch?

00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:25.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, in that epoch.

00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:34.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: And it was, I'm sure,
very difficult to be understood

00:40:34.350 --> 00:40:35.150 align:middle line:90%
by people.

00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:39.240 align:middle line:84%
It's not possible for
people to understand them.

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And they have to live their
life [SPEAKING FRENCH].

00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:48.560 align:middle line:90%
>>DI SARIO: Even.

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:50.127 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Even?

00:40:50.127 --> 00:40:51.254 align:middle line:90%
>>DI SARIO: No.

00:40:51.254 --> 00:40:52.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In spite of.

00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:52.850 align:middle line:90%
>>DI SARIO: Regardless.

00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:53.933 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Regardless, yes.

00:40:53.933 --> 00:40:56.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: Regardless of what
people think about them.

00:40:56.280 --> 00:41:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And the soul push hard on them
to do what they have to do.

00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:08.007 align:middle line:90%
And they did beautiful things.

00:41:08.007 --> 00:41:09.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, magnificent.

00:41:09.090 --> 00:41:09.890 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yes.

00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:13.485 align:middle line:84%
Spiritual things that
inspire us now again.

00:41:13.485 --> 00:41:15.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Truly
inspired thought, yeah.

00:41:15.110 --> 00:41:17.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: Because in
each epoch they

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:21.410 align:middle line:90%
are initiate at that level.

00:41:21.410 --> 00:41:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's very
difficult for them.

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:26.030 align:middle line:90%
It's a sacrifice for them.

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:31.580 align:middle line:84%
Now people evolve
and there are more

00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:33.810 align:middle line:90%
evolved people on the planet.

00:41:33.810 --> 00:41:34.610 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:42.680 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, often when you
are prepared to pass initiation

00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:45.530 align:middle line:90%
you did alone.

00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:47.300 align:middle line:90%
But now--

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:48.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There's more support.

00:41:48.830 --> 00:41:50.460 align:middle line:90%
Humanity can be more supportive.

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:51.260 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yes.

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:55.880 align:middle line:84%
But now we can pass our
initiation in group.

00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:57.800 align:middle line:90%
So we are more support.

00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:59.212 align:middle line:90%
It's less difficult.

00:41:59.212 --> 00:42:01.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and that's why
I just wanted to bring it up,

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:04.220 align:middle line:84%
is we have to also
look at this as it

00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:07.820 align:middle line:84%
was bathed within the times,
the consciousness of the times.

00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:09.760 align:middle line:90%
OK, we have another one.

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And this will get us to
kind of a final observation,

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:15.310 align:middle line:90%
I noticed, in these numbers.

00:42:15.310 --> 00:42:16.460 align:middle line:90%
And this is Oprah Winfrey.

00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:17.302 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yeah.

00:42:17.302 --> 00:42:18.565 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES SOFTLY]

00:42:18.565 --> 00:42:20.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And Oprah
came in at 1.2,

00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:23.130 align:middle line:84%
very similar to
Donald Trump and Bush.

00:42:23.130 --> 00:42:23.970 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: OK.

00:42:23.970 --> 00:42:25.490 align:middle line:90%
I was surprised, too.

00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And he explained that
she did a lot of things--

00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:34.275 align:middle line:84%
young soul, when they
want to do a good thing,

00:42:34.275 --> 00:42:38.750 align:middle line:84%
they put all their
energy to do that.

00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And Oprah, she has a
very good motivation.

00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:46.090 align:middle line:90%
She wants to help people.

00:42:46.090 --> 00:42:47.760 align:middle line:90%
She has a ray six.

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:48.560 align:middle line:90%
She is devoted--

00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:49.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Idealistic?

00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:50.360 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Idealistic.

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:53.840 align:middle line:84%
And she is devoted
to help people.

00:42:53.840 --> 00:43:09.940 align:middle line:84%
But she has a certain arrogance
that maybe cannot help her

00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:12.890 align:middle line:90%
to progress more in this life.

00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:18.490 align:middle line:84%
But the work she
do, will help her.

00:43:18.490 --> 00:43:20.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Will help.

00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:23.530 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the mass
consciousness were

00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:27.160 align:middle line:84%
helped by even Dr. Phil
coming on and saying, well,

00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:28.660 align:middle line:90%
you have a part in this, too.

00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:32.440 align:middle line:84%
It's your own damn fault.
For people, instead of--

00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:34.810 align:middle line:84%
I think in that sense,
a lot of her guests

00:43:34.810 --> 00:43:36.970 align:middle line:84%
and so forth help
people climb out

00:43:36.970 --> 00:43:40.360 align:middle line:84%
of really base
victimhood up into taking

00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:42.740 align:middle line:90%
some self-responsibility.

00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:46.630 align:middle line:84%
So I think Oprah was a
big part of helping people

00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:49.380 align:middle line:84%
look at their lives and start
taking some responsibility

00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:50.180 align:middle line:90%
for their lives.

00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:54.220 align:middle line:84%
So in that sense, as
a pop star in America,

00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:57.100 align:middle line:84%
she served that, as you
say, that idealistic purpose

00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:59.200 align:middle line:84%
of trying to help
people in that way.

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And what I wanted to add to
this was that I look through

00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:05.860 align:middle line:90%
at the various--

00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:08.140 align:middle line:84%
not every single chart,
but most of them.

00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the people
in American culture

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:16.210 align:middle line:84%
that are the quote, "popular
leaders of culture"--

00:44:16.210 --> 00:44:19.150 align:middle line:84%
movie stars, and
directors, and so forth--

00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:23.830 align:middle line:84%
all came in at the same level
as Trump and where Oprah is.

00:44:23.830 --> 00:44:26.740 align:middle line:90%
So Trump was actually--

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:32.200 align:middle line:84%
we're being bathed in a
sea of propaganda that

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:34.850 align:middle line:84%
supports these pop
figures, all of who

00:44:34.850 --> 00:44:39.910 align:middle line:84%
are young souls with not a
well-developed sense of purpose

00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:41.930 align:middle line:90%
yet, per se.

00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And so if that is what we're
living in-- that's what

00:44:44.590 --> 00:44:47.620 align:middle line:84%
our media is
projecting 24/7 to us--

00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:51.460 align:middle line:84%
is it a surprise that something
in our collective consciousness

00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:56.620 align:middle line:84%
would have elected a man that
matches that level of baseline

00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:57.950 align:middle line:90%
consciousness in America?

00:44:57.950 --> 00:44:58.750 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:44:58.750 --> 00:44:59.700 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Mhm.

00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:00.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:01.870 align:middle line:90%
Well, enough said about that.

00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:02.777 align:middle line:90%
OK, we'll move on.

00:45:02.777 --> 00:45:04.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: But you know
that they are more

00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:07.090 align:middle line:90%
evolved than the population.

00:45:07.090 --> 00:45:10.114 align:middle line:84%
The population is less
than 1, so Trump--

00:45:10.114 --> 00:45:11.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's
still a step up.

00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:12.330 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yes.

00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:14.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's still
a step up en masse.

00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:16.744 align:middle line:90%
Now, Bill Gates is interesting.

00:45:16.744 --> 00:45:18.910 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of people
have a lot of thoughts about

00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:19.710 align:middle line:90%
Bill Gates.

00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:21.820 align:middle line:84%
Some people think he's
part of the evil cabal

00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:24.540 align:middle line:84%
and other people think,
well, he offered a good thing

00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:25.340 align:middle line:90%
to the planet.

00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:28.390 align:middle line:90%
And so he comes out at a 3.1.

00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:31.320 align:middle line:84%
What was your thought on
it, your perception when

00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:32.120 align:middle line:90%
he told you this?

00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:33.950 align:middle line:90%
Did you argue with DK on it?

00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:39.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: Yes, I argued,
because generally the money

00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:43.840 align:middle line:90%
goes with young souls.

00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:47.770 align:middle line:84%
The young soul wants to
experiment the physical plan,

00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:51.010 align:middle line:84%
and they need money
to do that, OK?

00:45:51.010 --> 00:45:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And Bill Gates has
a lot of money.

00:45:55.750 --> 00:46:01.590 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that he
was maybe 1.5 maximum.

00:46:01.590 --> 00:46:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And when the DK
said, hey, it's 3.1,

00:46:05.530 --> 00:46:07.580 align:middle line:90%
I say, oh no, it's impossible.

00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:08.970 align:middle line:90%
And he said, look.

00:46:08.970 --> 00:46:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And he explained to me what
is the purpose of his life,

00:46:14.350 --> 00:46:17.950 align:middle line:84%
of Bill Gates, is to
help and to help people

00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:20.530 align:middle line:90%
not only on the physical plan.

00:46:20.530 --> 00:46:21.330 align:middle line:90%
Plan?

00:46:21.330 --> 00:46:21.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Plane.

00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:22.970 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: But he wants--

00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:23.420 align:middle line:90%
plane.

00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:23.690 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:46:23.690 --> 00:46:24.490 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:46:24.490 --> 00:46:32.100 align:middle line:84%
And is to help them to
grow in a different way.

00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:33.910 align:middle line:90%
They want responsible--

00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:35.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To evolve
in a different way.

00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:39.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: And they
help them, but they

00:46:39.010 --> 00:46:42.850 align:middle line:84%
want them to be
more responsible,

00:46:42.850 --> 00:46:45.240 align:middle line:90%
to be assume their life.

00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:48.430 align:middle line:90%


00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:51.880 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't want just gave
money and do what you want.

00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:53.710 align:middle line:90%
They help, they teach.

00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:55.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Give people tools.

00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:55.540 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yes.

00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:56.460 align:middle line:90%
Ah, good.

00:46:56.460 --> 00:46:56.810 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:46:56.810 --> 00:46:58.143 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To educate themselves.

00:46:58.143 --> 00:46:59.990 align:middle line:84%
So he brought those
tools out to the planet.

00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:01.620 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: Because he
has an open mind.

00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:03.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He has an open
mind and brought these tools

00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:06.850 align:middle line:84%
to the planet to be able to
have empowerment to access

00:47:06.850 --> 00:47:08.080 align:middle line:90%
information on their own.

00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:09.570 align:middle line:90%
So it did make sense.

00:47:09.570 --> 00:47:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's really-- because
we could go on and on.

00:47:12.970 --> 00:47:15.220 align:middle line:84%
But I just wanted to
get a little flavor

00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:18.370 align:middle line:84%
so people that we all
know in this country

00:47:18.370 --> 00:47:22.480 align:middle line:84%
could see this
principle in action.

00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And so we don't have any more
people we need to look at.

00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:28.000 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a
good one to close on.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.560 align:middle line:84%
The next book coming, what is
it you're going to be featuring?

00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:34.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ROY: OK, we're going to
be featuring 100 initiates,

00:47:34.970 --> 00:47:38.260 align:middle line:84%
but we're going to explain
what is initiation, too,

00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:40.004 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the book.

00:47:40.004 --> 00:47:42.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, it will be more
explained than in this book.

00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:42.810 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yeah.

00:47:42.810 --> 00:47:43.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:44.280 align:middle line:90%
I found it fascinating.

00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:46.210 align:middle line:84%
We were going through
it like, [GASPS] can

00:47:46.210 --> 00:47:47.190 align:middle line:90%
you believe that one?

00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:50.920 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] And it
kind of surprises.

00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:53.110 align:middle line:10%
I mean, some of it
wasn't surprising

00:47:53.110 --> 00:47:56.860 align:middle line:10%
if I really followed someone's
life or work more closely.

00:47:56.860 --> 00:48:00.366 align:middle line:10%
But by and large, there are
surprises galore in here.

00:48:00.366 --> 00:48:02.490 align:middle line:10%
And it really helps us take
judgment out of things,

00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:06.630 align:middle line:10%
too, to look at, this is a young
soul who's working off now,

00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:09.150 align:middle line:10%
as you say, the negative
aspect of the rays,

00:48:09.150 --> 00:48:13.350 align:middle line:10%
trying to overcome those denser
influences so they can go more

00:48:13.350 --> 00:48:16.980 align:middle line:10%
up into the sublime and
refined aspects of what's

00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:18.570 align:middle line:10%
possible on that ray.

00:48:18.570 --> 00:48:19.860 align:middle line:90%
And then it makes sense.

00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:22.950 align:middle line:84%
Because we're all on some aspect
of that journey ourselves.

00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:23.920 align:middle line:90%
>>ROY: Yes.

00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:24.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:25.920 align:middle line:84%
It's not just to
poke fun at people.

00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:27.440 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:28.770 align:middle line:10%
So I want to thank you so much.

00:48:28.770 --> 00:48:30.970 align:middle line:10%
And I have to say, I think
you did a beautiful job.

00:48:30.970 --> 00:48:33.600 align:middle line:10%
And thank you so much,
Josee, for helping

00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:36.915 align:middle line:10%
with the translation of this
and coming along today, as well.

00:48:36.915 --> 00:48:38.040 align:middle line:10%
>>ROY: Thank you very much.

00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:39.510 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You're welcome.

00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:41.460 align:middle line:10%
I found this
absolutely fascinating

00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:42.810 align:middle line:10%
and I hope you have, too.

00:48:42.810 --> 00:48:44.580 align:middle line:84%
Again, the title of
the book is "Circle

00:48:44.580 --> 00:48:47.710 align:middle line:84%
of Initiates," which you can
find at major booksellers.

00:48:47.710 --> 00:48:49.650 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:48:49.650 --> 00:48:51.680 align:middle line:90%
on "Open Minds."

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:57.899 align:middle line:90%
