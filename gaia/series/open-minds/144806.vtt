00:00:27.472 --> 00:00:28.930 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
We're picking up

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.540 align:middle line:10%
with part two of our
conversation with Jay Dyer, who

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.640 align:middle line:10%
analyzes hidden
symbolism in film

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.110 align:middle line:10%
to give us an idea
of how Hollywood

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.990 align:middle line:10%
might engaged in the
programming of our minds.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.545 align:middle line:84%
In this show, we cover
"Eyes Wide Shut,"

00:00:40.545 --> 00:00:42.860 align:middle line:84%
"The Kingsman," "Ex Machina,"
and "Casino Royale."

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.136 align:middle line:84%
So last time we were
doing three films,

00:00:45.136 --> 00:00:46.760 align:middle line:84%
we barely even
mentioned the third one.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And since we're
trying to do four now,

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.860 align:middle line:84%
I thought we'd start
booking right through this.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:50.830 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY DYER: OK

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.413 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So first
of all, we're going

00:00:52.413 --> 00:00:55.720 align:middle line:84%
to start with "The Kingsman,"
which is such a kooky, silly,

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.557 align:middle line:90%
fun film.

00:00:56.557 --> 00:00:59.140 align:middle line:84%
But there there's a fair amount
embedded in it, and of course,

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.710 align:middle line:84%
just the shocking aspect
of the plot itself.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.720 align:middle line:84%
So lay out a little
bit of the plot.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the key stars
are Colin Firth and Samuel L

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:09.530 align:middle line:90%
Jackson.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:10.896 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: And Michael Caine.

00:01:10.896 --> 00:01:13.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
and Michael Caine.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.960 align:middle line:84%
And Samuel L Jackson has
a very pronounced lisp.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.279 align:middle line:90%
He's the gentle type.

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:20.320 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: But a psychopath.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, a psychopath.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.020 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: Well it's
funny that you mention

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.020 align:middle line:10%
it being goofy and silly,
because a lot of times

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.770 align:middle line:10%
satirical films are the ones
that will have a lot of truth,

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.040 align:middle line:10%
and even some of these
deeper archetypal symbols

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.840 align:middle line:10%
and so forth.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.500 align:middle line:84%
So what's interesting about
"Kingsman" is that the title

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.945 align:middle line:84%
itself, I think,
identifies the roundtable,

00:01:38.945 --> 00:01:42.190 align:middle line:84%
the idea of the Arthurian
legends and so forth,

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.900 align:middle line:90%
and the Grail, and all this.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And what's funny about
the Templars, which

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.520 align:middle line:84%
is connected to that idea,
is that in the history

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.730 align:middle line:84%
of actual black operations
and intelligence operations,

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.150 align:middle line:84%
there have been groups
in deep secret societies

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.082 align:middle line:84%
that are calling
themselves the Templars.

00:02:00.082 --> 00:02:01.540 align:middle line:84%
In fact, William
Colby who was head

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.150 align:middle line:84%
of the CIA for a while,
his secret group,

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.350 align:middle line:90%
he called them the Templars.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.979 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Some of the Templars
would be ashamed to hear that.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: It's just a name that
has been appropriated, right?

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.930 align:middle line:10%
So definitely, if you
can go all the way back

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.210 align:middle line:10%
to the beginning of
the Templars and how

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.250 align:middle line:10%
they were treated,
and even the Vatican

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.485 align:middle line:10%
itself has rescinded that
condemnation of the Templars.

00:02:22.485 --> 00:02:23.860 align:middle line:10%
And we get the
impression that it

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.920 align:middle line:10%
was at the behest
of the Frankish king

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.470 align:middle line:10%
that the Templars
were prosecuted.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.870 align:middle line:90%
It was made up.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.780 align:middle line:84%
So what's funny about
this film is that you

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.190 align:middle line:90%
do have a lot of these themes.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.500 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned William
Colby in the CIA.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.124 align:middle line:84%
You have these themes
of, in this case,

00:02:36.124 --> 00:02:38.530 align:middle line:84%
British intelligence
utilizing people

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.450 align:middle line:84%
that they've recruited
from the lower

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.140 align:middle line:84%
classes of British society
into making them into genteel,

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.950 align:middle line:84%
or into one of the agents
of the elite, essentially.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.161 align:middle line:10%
And in the case of Valentine
that you talked about,

00:02:51.161 --> 00:02:52.660 align:middle line:10%
the Samuel L Jackson
character, he's

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.590 align:middle line:10%
this big tech giant
who he's dead set

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.450 align:middle line:10%
on depopulating the world.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.000 align:middle line:90%
And of course, as always--

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For
environmental purposes.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And as always, there's
the breakaway civilization

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.600 align:middle line:90%
for the elite.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.680 align:middle line:84%
They're going to go off
and have their own palaces

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.040 align:middle line:84%
and whatnot, and
kill the rest of us.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They've got
their little chips.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly.

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.610 align:middle line:84%
So that's what's key to this is
that he utilizes the cell phone

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:16.440 align:middle line:90%
technology.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.370 align:middle line:84%
Last time we mentioned
Brzezinski's book

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.580 align:middle line:90%
in ELF/VLF technology.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.817 align:middle line:84%
And this is what Valentine
is doing in the film,

00:03:22.817 --> 00:03:24.400 align:middle line:84%
is that he's utilizing
this technology

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.900 align:middle line:84%
to alter people's brainwaves to
essentially make them maniacs.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:28.840 align:middle line:10%
They go nuts, right?

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.670 align:middle line:10%
Killing each other,
attacking each other.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.600 align:middle line:90%


00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's the role that Michael
Caine plays Eggsy's handler,

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.130 align:middle line:84%
and recruit him into this secret
cabal of British intelligence

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.930 align:middle line:90%
agency.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And his role is to, he
thinks, foil this plot.

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.470 align:middle line:84%
But as we discover,
spoiler alert,

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.410 align:middle line:84%
Michael Caine actually
works with Valentine.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.014 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
that was interesting.

00:03:52.014 --> 00:03:53.680 align:middle line:84%
That happens toward
the end of the film,

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.638 align:middle line:84%
so erase if you want to
see it, doesn't matter.

00:03:55.638 --> 00:03:56.710 align:middle line:90%
Still a fun film.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.590 align:middle line:84%
But you know, I found
this compelling.

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting that
you made that correlation

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.926 align:middle line:84%
with the knight Templar,
because the original knight

00:04:02.926 --> 00:04:07.840 align:middle line:84%
Templar were purely
ascetic individuals.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.090 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: They were tasked
with guarding the pilgrims

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.260 align:middle line:10%
to the Holy Land, correct.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.093 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They were.

00:04:12.093 --> 00:04:15.070 align:middle line:84%
And they usually were of
the higher class initially,

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.022 align:middle line:90%
often of nobility.

00:04:16.022 --> 00:04:17.230 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Warrior monks, right.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Warrior monks.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.709 align:middle line:84%
They gave up
personal possessions.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.130 align:middle line:90%
They followed a certain dictate.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.990 align:middle line:84%
But that dictate was
actually to protect

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.680 align:middle line:84%
assets from confiscation by
royalty in the day in England,

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.690 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.210 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, they considered
themselves quite

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.150 align:middle line:90%
righteous warriors.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.300 align:middle line:10%
Now, we know the story gets
distorted as time goes on.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.300 align:middle line:10%
But I bring that up because
in one clip of the film,

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.580 align:middle line:10%
Colin Firth, his character--

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.260 align:middle line:10%
I think his last name is Hart--

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.470 align:middle line:10%
is explaining to Eggsy,
little street boy who's

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.830 align:middle line:10%
just trying to keep it real,
the nature of this organization.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.455 align:middle line:10%
Let's take a look at
that clip of film.

00:04:56.455 --> 00:04:56.750 align:middle line:10%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.916 align:middle line:10%
- And in this case, I'm
offering you the opportunity

00:04:58.916 --> 00:05:00.620 align:middle line:10%
to become a Kingsman.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.080 align:middle line:10%
- A tailor?

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.680 align:middle line:10%
- A Kingsman agent.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.150 align:middle line:10%
- Like a spy?

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.010 align:middle line:10%
- Of sorts.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.950 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:10.783 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, when you
come back from this,

00:05:10.783 --> 00:05:13.300 align:middle line:84%
you think, well, the poor kid's
had a really rough go of it

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.290 align:middle line:90%
in life.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And on one hand this man is
offering him an opportunity

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.600 align:middle line:90%
at perfecting himself.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.460 align:middle line:90%
Excellence across the board.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.070 align:middle line:84%
And keeping peace and calm
within his being at all times

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.350 align:middle line:90%
amidst all of this.

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.680 align:middle line:84%
Yet at the same time, it's
all in the name of state

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.600 align:middle line:90%
and agendas of the state.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.560 align:middle line:10%
And Eggsy, he's buying it.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.340 align:middle line:10%
He's like, I have nothing to
lose, like he says, you know?

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Yeah, he's
streetwise, and that's

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:39.680 align:middle line:84%
why he's useful to
the intelligence

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.790 align:middle line:90%
apparatus in the film.

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:44.097 align:middle line:84%
And what we see in the process
of the training, I think,

00:05:44.097 --> 00:05:44.930 align:middle line:90%
is the most telling.

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.596 align:middle line:84%
Because what they do
is they continually

00:05:46.596 --> 00:05:48.770 align:middle line:90%
traumatize all their recruits.

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.230 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
culmination, the climax

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.380 align:middle line:84%
of this traumatization is you've
got to kill an animal or a pet

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.160 align:middle line:90%
that you really found dear.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When I saw the movie
the first time, I hated that.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:00.560 align:middle line:90%
I hated it.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Well that
is perfectly what

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.270 align:middle line:84%
we see in actual
training of, for example,

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:06.830 align:middle line:90%
the Phoenix program in Vietnam.

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.720 align:middle line:84%
The soldiers there were
tasked with actually

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.160 align:middle line:90%
killing women and children.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.062 align:middle line:84%
And that was in order
to traumatize them.

00:06:12.062 --> 00:06:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And there's a great book
that deals with some of this

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.210 align:middle line:84%
called "Programmed to
Kill" by Dave McGowan.

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.630 align:middle line:10%
And in that book, he
talks about killing pets,

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.920 align:middle line:10%
and that this is an actual
aspect of ritual abuse.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.460 align:middle line:84%
So that we see a parallel
between the secret societies

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.090 align:middle line:84%
and the ritual abuse aspect
of things and the way

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:32.390 align:middle line:84%
that the intelligence apparatus
cultivates and marinates

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.120 align:middle line:84%
people in trauma before they're
ready to go out into the field,

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.590 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to see
that with Bond, too.

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:38.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, OK.

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:41.300 align:middle line:84%
So killing in the
name of the state

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.672 align:middle line:90%
is considered an honorable duty.

00:06:42.672 --> 00:06:43.880 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: It's a virtue, right.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's a virtue.

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.350 align:middle line:84%
So you have to
traumatize the individual

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.230 align:middle line:84%
to be able to do what is
unconscionable, right?

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And yet at the
same time, there's

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:56.390 align:middle line:84%
this sexy quality of
being a gentleman that

00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:00.370 align:middle line:84%
is well rounded, well
educated, can defend himself,

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:01.170 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:05.210 align:middle line:84%
And this creates an interesting
split in our own psyche.

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:09.710 align:middle line:10%
Because women are totally
turned on by Bond, right?

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And by someone like
Colin in "The Kingsman."

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.336 align:middle line:84%
So what's going on
there more archetypally?

00:07:16.336 --> 00:07:17.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: This is the
idea of ubermensch,

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.390 align:middle line:84%
or the idea of a
psychopathic killer

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:22.200 align:middle line:84%
who can also play
different roles.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And of course, in
intelligence work

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:25.610 align:middle line:90%
you have this ability to act.

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:27.500 align:middle line:84%
That's why all the way
back to Shakespeare,

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.490 align:middle line:84%
in that time period, actors
have been used as spies.

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:33.500 align:middle line:90%
This is an ancient profession.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.110 align:middle line:10%
And the ability to
play another role

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:40.400 align:middle line:10%
is crucial to fooling
whoever you need to fool.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.830 align:middle line:84%
It also plays into
sex espionage.

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And this film does
touch on a lot

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:48.150 align:middle line:84%
of sexual issues, as
Bond will, of course.

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:51.200 align:middle line:84%
But if you go back to,
say, the NKVD of Stalin,

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:55.430 align:middle line:84%
and the way that Stalin would
actually recruit Russian sex

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:58.550 align:middle line:84%
operatives was out of
orphanages or out of the streets

00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:59.366 align:middle line:90%
with prostitutes.

00:07:59.366 --> 00:08:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And what they would do is
they would bring them in,

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:02.819 align:middle line:90%
and they would degrade them.

00:08:02.819 --> 00:08:05.360 align:middle line:84%
So I know that it sounds like
they might already be degraded,

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.735 align:middle line:84%
they're prostitutes,
but the goal

00:08:06.735 --> 00:08:08.720 align:middle line:84%
was to degrade them
as far as possible so

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.300 align:middle line:84%
that they no longer had any
taboos or moral hangups.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.610 align:middle line:84%
And then that's when you've
created the perfect killer,

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:16.560 align:middle line:84%
because they're not bound by
any of the morals of society.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.519 align:middle line:84%
No taboos, no
moral restrictions.

00:08:18.519 --> 00:08:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's happening
to Eggsy in the film.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.060 align:middle line:84%
He's already
streetwise, and they're

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:25.520 align:middle line:84%
taking him through
this process, even

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.490 align:middle line:84%
though it's under the guise
of the good of the state.

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:30.650 align:middle line:84%
But it reminds me of
a famous conversation

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:32.855 align:middle line:84%
that Bond has in the
beginning of "Casino

00:08:32.855 --> 00:08:35.057 align:middle line:90%
Royale" in the novel.

00:08:35.057 --> 00:08:36.890 align:middle line:84%
And he's talking to, I
believe, Vesper Lynd.

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not trying to get ahead
of us, but it applies to this.

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:43.500 align:middle line:84%
Because Vesper Lynd,
or someone says,

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.940 align:middle line:90%
why do you do what you do?

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.904 align:middle line:84%
I'm working for the
Soviets, I'm doing

00:08:47.904 --> 00:08:49.320 align:middle line:84%
the exact same
thing you're doing,

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.120 align:middle line:90%
it's just a different side.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:50.630 align:middle line:90%
Who cares?

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:51.590 align:middle line:90%
And Bond says, you know what?

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:52.390 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:54.330 align:middle line:90%
It's Manichean dialectics.

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:55.130 align:middle line:90%
He says this.

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:57.520 align:middle line:84%
He says it operates on
Manichean dialectics.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.390 align:middle line:84%
And so since it doesn't
matter, he says,

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:00.880 align:middle line:90%
I've transcended good and evil.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's directly out
of Nietzsche's philosophy

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:07.100 align:middle line:84%
of ubermensch, that you can
be beyond good and evil.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:10.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's a perfect
ideology for a killer.

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And so it's that
class of persons

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:15.490 align:middle line:90%
that are given that worldview.

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:18.140 align:middle line:10%
They're cultivated and
programmed with that worldview

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:21.050 align:middle line:10%
that there is no good or
evil, and you're beyond it,

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:23.060 align:middle line:10%
you make a great killer.

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:27.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're usually
an ideologue of some kind.

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:29.330 align:middle line:84%
Just like the people
I've interviewed

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.670 align:middle line:84%
that have been involved
with intelligence, and some

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:32.600 align:middle line:90%
that I've known.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:36.360 align:middle line:84%
There has to be a chink in the
character just to be recruited.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.160 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Absolutely.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there has to
be extremely high potential

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:42.210 align:middle line:84%
in terms of their ability
to develop themselves.

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:42.650 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:45.066 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so this is what
we're finding through Eggsy,

00:09:45.066 --> 00:09:46.130 align:middle line:90%
the guy from the hood.

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:46.910 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yeah, the profile.

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:48.830 align:middle line:84%
He fit their profile, what
they wanted, what they needed.

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:49.400 align:middle line:90%
Correct.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:50.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:56.510 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's talk about the
public's complicity in this.

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:59.330 align:middle line:84%
It looked like an Apple release
of the first iPhone, right?

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:00.130 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly.

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:02.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh my god, people
are lined up for miles

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.670 align:middle line:84%
down the street to
get the free SIM card.

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:06.640 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
that part of the story.

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: The session
with the tech gadgetry

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.375 align:middle line:84%
is a big part of
Valentine's plan.

00:10:10.375 --> 00:10:11.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And free.

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:12.500 align:middle line:90%
The word, free.

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:12.890 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:14.515 align:middle line:84%
And we think of all
the marketing ploys

00:10:14.515 --> 00:10:16.522 align:middle line:84%
that we see around
tech gadgetry, right?

00:10:16.522 --> 00:10:18.230 align:middle line:84%
And I think in the
last episode we talked

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:20.510 align:middle line:84%
about the Schwitzgebel
machine, which it's

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:23.960 align:middle line:84%
an actual device that's about
tracking and tracing everything

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:27.362 align:middle line:84%
that you do and all of your
health issues, and so forth.

00:10:27.362 --> 00:10:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
happening in this film,

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:33.390 align:middle line:84%
is the same principle of under
the guise of free baubles

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:35.400 align:middle line:84%
and trinkets, you're
actually signing

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.340 align:middle line:84%
on to something
that's very, very bad.

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And the SIM cards, as
we said, ultimately

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:46.390 align:middle line:84%
result in a kind of ELF/VLF
manipulation of human brain

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:47.190 align:middle line:90%
frequencies.

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:52.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To the limbic system,
which has to do with violence.

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:52.980 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly.

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
Brzezinski talked about.

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.830 align:middle line:84%
There's other Pentagon
documents that

00:10:56.830 --> 00:11:00.000 align:middle line:84%
talk about psychological
warfare, "MindWar to PsyWar"

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.080 align:middle line:90%
by Colonel Aquino.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.000 align:middle line:84%
This document talks
about the utilization

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.570 align:middle line:84%
of these same frequencies
and of harp type technology

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:08.560 align:middle line:84%
to mind control
mass populations.

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:09.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And even our antagonist
in this, Colin Firth,

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:17.460 align:middle line:90%
finds himself subject to this.

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And let's take a quick
look at that clip of film.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.160 align:middle line:84%
What happens once those SIM
cards have been activated

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.820 align:middle line:90%
in the Church of bigots.

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.370 align:middle line:90%
We said this was silly.

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:29.202 align:middle line:84%
And we'll just watch
it for a little bit.

Firth came out of this

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:46.410 align:middle line:90%
and said, what did you do?

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:47.460 align:middle line:90%
What did you do to me?

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:49.110 align:middle line:90%
I could not control myself.

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:50.291 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't help myself.

It's really more like a cartoon
in terms of the violence.

00:12:02.905 --> 00:12:05.700 align:middle line:84%
So everybody has at it,
and this happens just

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:08.820 align:middle line:84%
by tweaking the frequency
of those SIM cards globally.

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:10.830 align:middle line:84%
And they can create it
in zones of the world

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:16.230 align:middle line:84%
to foment political unrest,
or stage it at certain events.

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:17.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to ask you this.

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:23.010 align:middle line:84%
How real do you think that
technology is right now?

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: There was a early 2000s
article from the Boston Globe

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.340 align:middle line:84%
that reported on
this very technology.

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:32.130 align:middle line:84%
And it was about DARPA's
ELF and VLF towers.

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And could these be used
to send out frequencies?

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.622 align:middle line:84%
It's very hard to find that
article on the internet now.

00:12:37.622 --> 00:12:39.330 align:middle line:84%
Maybe if you logged
into the Boston Globe

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.038 align:middle line:84%
archives or something,
you could find it.

00:12:41.038 --> 00:12:42.810 align:middle line:84%
But it's not easily
findable, and I

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:43.900 align:middle line:90%
think that's for a reason.

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:47.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's because even though
this technology is real,

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:50.190 align:middle line:90%
it's not easily discoverable.

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:53.130 align:middle line:84%
So how many public statements
have we had about this?

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:55.780 align:middle line:84%
Only a couple that I can think
of from big policy people,

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:58.860 align:middle line:84%
from white papers,
from big tomes,

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:00.930 align:middle line:90%
from people like Brzezinski.

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:04.680 align:middle line:84%
So even though they'll
kind of gradually

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.887 align:middle line:84%
let these things be
known to the public--

00:13:06.887 --> 00:13:08.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't think
they're worried about people

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:10.280 align:middle line:90%
reading Brzezinski's books.

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:11.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:13.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: But but
they will gradually

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.120 align:middle line:84%
let this stuff be
known, and I think

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.500 align:middle line:84%
that the end of
the space program

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.810 align:middle line:84%
is an example of something
that has been gradually

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:20.280 align:middle line:90%
they've let out details.

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:22.021 align:middle line:84%
Or the Manhattan
Project over time.

00:13:22.021 --> 00:13:24.020 align:middle line:84%
But they keep things
secret for several decades.

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:25.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But they
exploded this one

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.333 align:middle line:84%
as the bomb right in
the middle of this film

00:13:27.333 --> 00:13:30.670 align:middle line:84%
that millions upon millions
of people have seen.

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:33.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Well, this
is I think I titled

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.330 align:middle line:84%
this the ultimate conspiracy
film of all time, right?

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:39.481 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's so conspiratorial,
and it's so real because--

00:13:39.481 --> 00:13:41.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so silly, of
course, embedded in satire.

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:43.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: As satire,
that's another technique

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:44.340 align:middle line:90%
of psychological warfare.

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:46.693 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was shocked when
I saw the film the first time

00:13:46.693 --> 00:13:48.692 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, here it
is hiding in plain sight.

00:13:48.692 --> 00:13:51.570 align:middle line:84%
This is more than plain sight,
it's in your face, literally.

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:52.935 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And the whole film
is about depopulation.

00:13:52.935 --> 00:13:54.960 align:middle line:84%
It's about eugenics,
it's about getting rid

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.540 align:middle line:84%
of a majority of the
population of the Earth.

00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:01.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, it may not come in
such a cartoonish fashion

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:02.045 align:middle line:90%
as it is in the film.

00:14:02.045 --> 00:14:03.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As peoples'
brains exploding.

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:05.460 align:middle line:90%
Which is really just funny.

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:09.330 align:middle line:84%
Little colorful clouds
of brains exploding.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.314 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Glitter, I
think, comes out.

00:14:11.314 --> 00:14:12.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Glitter comes out.

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:16.230 align:middle line:84%
But this brings
me to a question.

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:19.410 align:middle line:84%
How do the producers and
directors, on one hand,

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:21.960 align:middle line:84%
we think, how do they
get away with that?

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.510 align:middle line:84%
Again, this is a
really negative agenda.

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:27.210 align:middle line:84%
We talked about this a
little in the last show.

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:29.730 align:middle line:84%
How do they get away with
such a film being produced

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:31.500 align:middle line:84%
unless there's some
ulterior motive for us

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:33.480 align:middle line:90%
being exposed to this concept?

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: I think
in the film world,

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:37.350 align:middle line:84%
you have different
motives at times.

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:39.510 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes people
will write screenplays,

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:41.902 align:middle line:84%
or they'll produce a film
with good intentions,

00:14:41.902 --> 00:14:43.860 align:middle line:84%
and they really want to
get a good message out.

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.530 align:middle line:84%
I have friends that have worked
in different media fields

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:49.130 align:middle line:84%
and art fields that
I think are sincere.

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And so they'll put
conspiracy related themes

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:54.600 align:middle line:84%
or these kinds of
things into their works

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.890 align:middle line:90%
to try to raise awareness.

00:14:56.890 --> 00:14:59.370 align:middle line:84%
But I think other times
you also have a technique--

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:01.050 align:middle line:84%
it's been written
about, actually--

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:02.635 align:middle line:84%
where as I mentioned
in the last show,

00:15:02.635 --> 00:15:04.260 align:middle line:84%
Revelation of the
Method, where you can

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.570 align:middle line:84%
condition people to
acceptance of these things.

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:09.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No one's going
to accept that, though.

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:10.830 align:middle line:84%
You watch this film,
you can't imagine

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:14.550 align:middle line:84%
how there could be any program
to essentially get people

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:17.100 align:middle line:84%
into a state of acceptance
of this kind of technology.

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:18.307 align:middle line:90%
It's abhorrent.

00:15:18.307 --> 00:15:20.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Maybe not for
the technology itself,

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:23.084 align:middle line:84%
but what I'm saying is
that you can embed messages

00:15:23.084 --> 00:15:25.500 align:middle line:84%
into people's subconscious
through these kinds of programs

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.080 align:middle line:90%
that conditions them.

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.851 align:middle line:84%
And they might grumble
about it, they're

00:15:28.851 --> 00:15:31.350 align:middle line:84%
not going to do anything about
it when these kinds of things

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:32.150 align:middle line:90%
are instituted.

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:34.154 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
it already exists.

00:15:34.154 --> 00:15:35.820 align:middle line:84%
It's just that we're
not as aware of it.

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:38.400 align:middle line:84%
Because if there's
one article that

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:41.040 align:middle line:84%
speaks of the DARPA ELF/VLF
towers that's been scrubbed

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.540 align:middle line:90%
from the internet, I mean--

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:44.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I hear you on that.

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:47.330 align:middle line:84%
But again, looking at it was
so blatant, in your face,

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:48.159 align:middle line:90%
and abhorrent.

00:15:48.159 --> 00:15:49.200 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: It's gaslighting.

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That you
think, no, there's

00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:52.620 align:middle line:84%
no one that caught
this that would

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:56.290 align:middle line:84%
succumb to that kind of
programming in the future.

00:15:56.290 --> 00:16:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we know that there is
a very interesting relationship,

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:03.360 align:middle line:84%
I think, even in terms
of headquarters proximity

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.510 align:middle line:84%
to each other between
the CIA and Hollywood.

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:08.190 align:middle line:84%
We know that the
CIA has their hand

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:11.695 align:middle line:84%
in any film of any presence
at all, unless it's

00:16:11.695 --> 00:16:13.140 align:middle line:90%
an Adam Sandler film.

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:16.060 align:middle line:90%
Maybe even then, I don't know.

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:18.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Well, this
is interesting,

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.190 align:middle line:84%
because I go into that
in my book quite a bit.

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And you can go all the way back
to the beginning of Hollywood.

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:25.890 align:middle line:84%
The early days, the
golden age, silver age.

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:28.080 align:middle line:84%
And the Pentagon and the
Department of Defense

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:30.840 align:middle line:84%
have been working directly
in films for a long time.

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:34.450 align:middle line:84%
Take the character of Howard
Hughes, right the billionaire

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:36.060 align:middle line:90%
aerospace engineer.

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:37.974 align:middle line:84%
Howard Hughes used
to make movies.

00:16:37.974 --> 00:16:39.390 align:middle line:84%
He made "Hell's
Angels," which was

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:41.931 align:middle line:84%
the biggest film of his day, it
was like the big blockbuster.

00:16:41.931 --> 00:16:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And it was a war
propaganda film.

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:45.410 align:middle line:84%
So this has been going
on for a long time.

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:46.850 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing new.

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:49.200 align:middle line:84%
And you can even look at
"Twilight Zone" episodes.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.380 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them are
made in cooperation

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:52.715 align:middle line:90%
with the Department of Defense.

00:16:52.715 --> 00:16:55.340 align:middle line:84%
So they were intended to be kind
of recruitment propaganda, war

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:56.779 align:middle line:90%
propaganda.

00:16:56.779 --> 00:16:58.820 align:middle line:84%
There have been whole
academic journals and books

00:16:58.820 --> 00:16:59.757 align:middle line:90%
written on this.

00:16:59.757 --> 00:17:01.340 align:middle line:84%
There's a book,
"Hollywood in the CIA"

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:03.560 align:middle line:84%
by Tricia Jenkins out of
the University of Texas.

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:04.880 align:middle line:90%
Her book is really good.

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:05.990 align:middle line:90%
My book's good.

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:08.210 align:middle line:84%
And I trace a lot
of these examples

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:12.170 align:middle line:84%
and how they do see these
things into films on purpose.

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:14.099 align:middle line:84%
And we don't always
know the intention.

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:15.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I can't--

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:18.089 align:middle line:84%
on this one, this is a tough
one because it's so blatant.

00:17:18.089 --> 00:17:19.880 align:middle line:84%
I can't understand what
the intention would

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.770 align:middle line:84%
be except to have people
alert enough to say,

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:24.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm not buying into whatever's
is coming down the pike.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: There's a similar
film from the '70s called

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:29.090 align:middle line:84%
"Logan's Run" that I
dealt with in my book,

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:34.880 align:middle line:84%
and it has the same idea of
a superstate dystopia that

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:37.010 align:middle line:84%
is killing everybody,
and they intend

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:39.222 align:middle line:84%
to kill everybody who
reaches the age of 30.

00:17:39.222 --> 00:17:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And then you go through
this religious ceremony

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:45.110 align:middle line:84%
where you float up, and
then you're incinerated.

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:48.800 align:middle line:84%
But they've cultivated this
through a religious mythology

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:51.497 align:middle line:84%
to convince the
population that you go off

00:17:51.497 --> 00:17:53.330 align:middle line:84%
to Valhalla or whatever
when you incinerate.

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:55.797 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's like "Soylent
Green," except 60, 62,

00:17:55.797 --> 00:17:56.630 align:middle line:90%
something like that.

00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:57.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yeah.

00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And so it's that
same idea, I think

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:01.460 align:middle line:84%
you can look at why
are they showing us?

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:05.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think if you look
at the '70s dystopias,

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:09.111 align:middle line:84%
the trend was to
expose these things.

00:18:09.111 --> 00:18:10.610 align:middle line:84%
You've got so many
films to do that.

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:12.980 align:middle line:84%
You've got "Omega Man,"
you've got "Logan's Run."

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:15.560 align:middle line:84%
Even "Zardoz," that goofy
film with Sean Connery running

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:19.040 align:middle line:84%
around in underwear, that film
actually exposes a lot of this.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.709 align:middle line:90%
It has a good positive message.

00:18:20.709 --> 00:18:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And then I think we
see a shift as we

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:25.130 align:middle line:84%
get into the '90s and the
2000s, where the films

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:26.840 align:middle line:90%
take a much darker turn.

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.790 align:middle line:90%
They take a very cynical turn.

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:33.260 align:middle line:84%
And they are, I
think, nihilistically

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:36.050 align:middle line:84%
showing what's going to happen,
or what they plan to do.

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:39.080 align:middle line:84%
And so I guess you can debate
what the purpose of that is.

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:40.580 align:middle line:84%
But I see it as
a kind of, again,

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:42.454 align:middle line:84%
what we talked about
last time, brutalization

00:18:42.454 --> 00:18:43.460 align:middle line:90%
and desensitization.

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:45.560 align:middle line:84%
Even though it's
satirical and in the end

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:49.050 align:middle line:84%
the bad guys are foiled,
will they be foiled?

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:51.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, what it seems
people walk away with is,

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:52.460 align:middle line:90%
that's pretty weird.

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:55.010 align:middle line:84%
They just dial in a frequency,
my cell phone's in my pocket,

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:59.240 align:middle line:84%
and I start hitting my mother
in the face, or my baby?

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.040 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Well, yeah.

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:02.390 align:middle line:84%
That may be a little
Hollywoodized, right?

00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:04.765 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's Hollywoodized,
but that's what I'm saying.

00:19:04.765 --> 00:19:05.990 align:middle line:90%
People are looking at--

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:08.947 align:middle line:84%
I would go away from that
if I didn't know any of this

00:19:08.947 --> 00:19:10.860 align:middle line:84%
and think, gosh, I
mean, I wonder what

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:12.507 align:middle line:90%
they can do with SIM cards?

00:19:12.507 --> 00:19:14.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Well, that
technology is real.

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:15.079 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:19:15.079 --> 00:19:16.370 align:middle line:90%
And I'd be thinking about that.

00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:18.920 align:middle line:84%
That's why I say, that's the
only question I had about it.

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:21.770 align:middle line:84%
It's so in your face
that certainly it

00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:24.320 align:middle line:84%
can't be just part of a
predictive programming.

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:25.170 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:26.878 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to give the
benefit of the doubt

00:19:26.878 --> 00:19:29.500 align:middle line:84%
and say that they would like
to get a good message out.

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: One of the people you
talked about is Colonel Michael

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:31.850 align:middle line:90%
Aquino.

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:32.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Mhm.

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Talk about that for
just a minute before we wrap up

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:34.700 align:middle line:90%
on this.

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:37.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Well, what's interesting
in terms of his relationship

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:38.796 align:middle line:84%
to this film, as I
mentioned, is that he

00:19:38.796 --> 00:19:41.090 align:middle line:84%
wrote a famous psychological
warfare document called

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:43.650 align:middle line:90%
"From MindWar to PsyWar."

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:45.800 align:middle line:84%
And he was in charge of
army PSYOPS for a while.

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.758 align:middle line:84%
He was basically saying
that what we need to do

00:19:47.758 --> 00:19:51.110 align:middle line:84%
is transition out of these older
forms of military propaganda

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:55.010 align:middle line:84%
and think in terms of
a new tech dominated

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:58.310 align:middle line:84%
strategy of changing people's
minds and perceptions.

00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And so he also echoes
Brzezinski's statements

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.770 align:middle line:84%
about the ELF, the
electromagnetic frequency

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:05.600 align:middle line:90%
manipulation through the towers.

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And he even mentions
chem trails,

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:11.090 align:middle line:84%
he even mentions geoengineering,
and spraying the skies,

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:13.860 align:middle line:90%
and altering the biosphere.

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:15.860 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just about
changing men's minds,

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:19.670 align:middle line:84%
it's also about the changing
of man's whole environment

00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:21.146 align:middle line:90%
and atmosphere in totality.

00:20:21.146 --> 00:20:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
reason that people

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:24.020 align:middle line:84%
can't conceive of
these things is

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:26.990 align:middle line:84%
that it's so outlandish
and so wide scope.

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:30.200 align:middle line:10%
Full spectrum dominance
in the fullest sense,

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.120 align:middle line:10%
including the biosphere.

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:34.850 align:middle line:10%
But Aquino is interesting
because what he talks about

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:36.470 align:middle line:10%
in his, I believe
that was written

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:38.930 align:middle line:10%
in the late '80s, early
'90s, that document,

00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:41.270 align:middle line:10%
with another Colonel.

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:49.490 align:middle line:84%
It deals with the possibility
of radical forms of manipulation

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:55.040 align:middle line:84%
of human biology and
human thought processes

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:56.780 align:middle line:90%
through these frequencies.

00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:58.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's
so frightening.

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:02.495 align:middle line:84%
But I don't want to give off
the impression of being fearful.

00:21:02.495 --> 00:21:04.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we should be
fearful of these things,

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:05.540 align:middle line:90%
because we know about them.

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:07.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we always
hold the trump cards.

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:08.678 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: We don't
have to be afraid.

00:21:08.678 --> 00:21:13.790 align:middle line:84%
But he was explicitly involved
in his satanic group, right?

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:15.254 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Was Douglas Dietrich?

00:21:15.254 --> 00:21:17.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: He has exposed some
of that, correct, right.

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:18.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I interviewed him.

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:19.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: OK, great.

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:22.430 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the group that
he was involved with,

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:28.070 align:middle line:84%
I think that their idea
of black operations

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:32.240 align:middle line:84%
is borrowed from black magic
and ancient philosophies

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:33.735 align:middle line:90%
of black magic, if you will.

00:21:33.735 --> 00:21:35.360 align:middle line:84%
And so they've applied
those techniques

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:40.186 align:middle line:84%
to psychological warfare in
this document that he authored.

00:21:40.186 --> 00:21:41.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
fascinating about it,

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:43.310 align:middle line:84%
is that you see these
ancient techniques.

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:44.810 align:middle line:84%
Again, we mentioned
Plato last time.

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:46.920 align:middle line:84%
These ancient techniques
are being reflected now.

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:47.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, I'm really happy
you said-- and we're having fun.

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:54.290 align:middle line:84%
We're just kind of showing
what they're up to.

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:56.390 align:middle line:84%
What Hollywood and the
CIA are up to, just kind

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:58.070 align:middle line:84%
of pulling back
the curtain a bit,

00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:01.760 align:middle line:84%
and it really is not meant
to instill fear in anybody.

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:04.167 align:middle line:84%
The reality is, these
kind of programs and games

00:22:04.167 --> 00:22:05.750 align:middle line:84%
have been going on,
and the nice thing

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:07.820 align:middle line:84%
about doing this
kind of program is

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:09.950 align:middle line:90%
that we can just almost laugh.

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:10.890 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly.

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:11.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:12.490 align:middle line:90%
Once you see it--

00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:15.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: An affront to us
when you see it right there,

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:18.530 align:middle line:84%
that it's believed
that we're so stupid.

00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:19.430 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't look at
it fearfully at all.

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:24.110 align:middle line:84%
I just look at it as,
isn't that interesting?

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:27.290 align:middle line:84%
And now we know one
more area to avoid.

00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:30.940 align:middle line:90%
So now, "Eyes Wide Shut."

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:33.680 align:middle line:84%
That's not a happy film, but
it's one that always comes up.

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:38.660 align:middle line:84%
Stanley Kubrick, Nicole
Kidman, and Tom Cruise.

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And who knows what was going
on in their personal life?

00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:44.130 align:middle line:84%
But whenever it was was
complicated, as we all know.

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:47.630 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk about that
matrix of players, characters,

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:49.310 align:middle line:90%
and the beginning of the film.

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:53.060 align:middle line:84%
The two towers, yeah,
she's undressing, right?

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:54.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Interesting
that we have,

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:58.880 align:middle line:84%
I think, Kubrick again showing
us what really goes on.

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:00.650 align:middle line:84%
We saw this with
"2001," we've seen it

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:02.180 align:middle line:90%
in basically all of his films.

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:05.270 align:middle line:84%
"Dr. Strangelove," it
parodies the Rand Corporation.

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:09.670 align:middle line:84%
"Barry Lyndon" parodies the
class structure of Britain.

00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:12.440 align:middle line:90%
"Lolita" deals with pedophilia.

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:15.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, every one of
these films is amazingly

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:17.090 align:middle line:90%
insightful to the real world.

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:19.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How did he
get away with all that?

00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:20.540 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: I don't know.

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:25.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, his daughter
Vivian, she argues

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:28.610 align:middle line:84%
that he was an honest
artist, and he really

00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:30.320 align:middle line:90%
wanted to get the truth out.

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And I've read a lot
of biographies on him,

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:34.130 align:middle line:84%
and dealt with a
lot of information.

00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:36.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what's
your opinion?

00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:40.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: I think that
the attention to detail,

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:42.550 align:middle line:90%
and the interest in his art--

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:48.020 align:middle line:84%
and he was known for being
such a hyper-specified, detail

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:51.080 align:middle line:84%
oriented person, and so
difficult to get along with,

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:54.620 align:middle line:84%
that to me suggests that he
put his life into his artwork.

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And somebody that
would do that, I

00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:58.390 align:middle line:84%
find that hard to believe
that they would be--

00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:00.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Being
controlled and manipulated

00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:01.970 align:middle line:90%
by the intelligence community?

00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:04.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Now, I think that NASA
and different intelligence

00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:07.169 align:middle line:84%
agencies were very interested
in the work that he was doing,

00:24:07.169 --> 00:24:09.320 align:middle line:84%
and they wanted him to put
things in a certain way.

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:10.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Like Philip K Dick.

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:11.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly.

00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:16.082 align:middle line:84%
But I see him as
a genuine artist.

00:24:16.082 --> 00:24:17.540 align:middle line:84%
But what we see in
"Eyes Wide Shut"

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:23.210 align:middle line:84%
is the presentation of how
the class structure really

00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:24.620 align:middle line:90%
works in society.

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:27.730 align:middle line:10%
And what's interesting about
Bill and Alice Harford,

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:30.919 align:middle line:10%
and that's the Nicole
and Tom Cruise character,

00:24:30.919 --> 00:24:33.460 align:middle line:10%
is that they think that they're
at the top of the totem pole.

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:37.460 align:middle line:84%
They're elite New York
physicians, or she's an artist

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:38.570 align:middle line:90%
and he's a physician.

00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:39.980 align:middle line:84%
They think that that's
the top of the totem pole.

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:41.930 align:middle line:84%
They don't realize
that above them there's

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:45.036 align:middle line:84%
a whole other power structure
of the invisible hand,

00:24:45.036 --> 00:24:47.160 align:middle line:84%
the cryptocracy, shadow
government, whatever you're

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:49.700 align:middle line:84%
going to call it, who
are immensely more

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:52.440 align:middle line:90%
wealthy than they can imagine.

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:56.660 align:middle line:84%
And they are able to
basically construct reality

00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:59.840 align:middle line:84%
in the film's presentation
such that it leads Bill Harford

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.934 align:middle line:90%
down this path of initiation.

00:25:01.934 --> 00:25:03.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way
I see the film,

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:07.340 align:middle line:84%
is that Bill is being
initiated into this cult.

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:10.160 align:middle line:84%
It is a sex cult.
It's a sex magic cult.

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:12.020 align:middle line:84%
It's a human sacrifice
cult, because that's

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:15.740 align:middle line:84%
what they do with the girl
who's the beauty pageant woman.

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:17.360 align:middle line:90%
She's sacrificed at the end.

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:19.730 align:middle line:90%
And they take it very seriously.

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And they don't take Bill's
flippant attitude lightly.

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:27.750 align:middle line:90%


00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:30.170 align:middle line:84%
So what they do is
they profile him,

00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:32.510 align:middle line:84%
they reveal to
him his own flaws.

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:35.540 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned earlier the chink
in the armor about recruitment

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:38.185 align:middle line:84%
for intelligence
agencies and assets.

00:25:38.185 --> 00:25:40.640 align:middle line:84%
Cults and intelligence
agencies have operated the same

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:42.848 align:middle line:84%
for a long time, and that's
what they do in the film.

00:25:42.848 --> 00:25:45.530 align:middle line:84%
They know his weakness,
his marital problems.

00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:46.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:47.720 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Sexual issues.

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And they exploit that and expose
him at the end of the film,

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:54.050 align:middle line:84%
and he's made to be the
fool and the hypocrite.

00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:57.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that the cult
was right in their actions.

00:25:57.450 --> 00:25:59.630 align:middle line:84%
But part of the film is
trying to show to him

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:02.810 align:middle line:90%
his hypocrisy and his error.

00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:04.400 align:middle line:84%
Because he thinks
he knows it all.

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:07.370 align:middle line:10%
And he simultaneously
knowing it all,

00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:10.070 align:middle line:10%
he doesn't even know
who's running things.

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:12.566 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, that's never
answered in any film.

00:26:12.566 --> 00:26:13.940 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look
at a clip early

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:19.550 align:middle line:84%
on in the film, where it's
explained to him by Ziegler,

00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:20.930 align:middle line:90%
you need to stay away from this.

00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:22.070 align:middle line:90%
You don't want to go here.

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.340 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:23.801 align:middle line:90%
We'll take a quick peek.

00:26:23.801 --> 00:26:25.750 align:middle line:10%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:28.195 align:middle line:10%
- Why would they do that?

00:26:28.195 --> 00:26:31.050 align:middle line:10%
- Why?

00:26:31.050 --> 00:26:35.880 align:middle line:10%
In plain words, to scare
the living shit out of you.

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:36.680 align:middle line:10%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:39.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So of course,
he goes there anyway.

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:42.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, he can't help
but follow the thread.

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:45.460 align:middle line:90%


00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:48.980 align:middle line:84%
Because he is being inspired
by his marriage difficulties

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:51.320 align:middle line:90%
in this moment, right?

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:55.970 align:middle line:10%
So one of the things as you
get into this part of the film

00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:59.510 align:middle line:10%
at the initiation of
the ritualistic events

00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:02.060 align:middle line:10%
is that elite--

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:05.330 align:middle line:10%
the elite have exhausted
every simple pleasure

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:07.414 align:middle line:10%
there is in life, in general.

00:27:07.414 --> 00:27:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And we see this all
the time with anyone

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:11.390 align:middle line:84%
who gets ends up with
quick money, quick fame,

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:12.190 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:13.730 align:middle line:84%
They start
immediately exhausting

00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:15.530 align:middle line:84%
meaningful, simple
pleasures, and you

00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:18.630 align:middle line:84%
have to go on to greater, and
greater, and greater stimuli.

00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:23.180 align:middle line:84%
And really, this party
scene-- which we won't show

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:27.580 align:middle line:84%
because it's a little too
graphic, and a lot of nudity--

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:32.780 align:middle line:84%
is showing what it takes to
even feel anything anymore

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:34.502 align:middle line:90%
for these people.

00:27:34.502 --> 00:27:35.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: That's a
great point, yeah.

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:37.910 align:middle line:84%
We mentioned earlier
that desensitization

00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:40.540 align:middle line:84%
on the last show that
happens to the population.

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:43.267 align:middle line:84%
And really it's a reflection
of the desensitization that's

00:27:43.267 --> 00:27:45.600 align:middle line:84%
happened on the part of the
elite, and perhaps the views

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.870 align:middle line:84%
that they might
have been raised in.

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And so that kind of produces
this dissociative state

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:52.397 align:middle line:90%
where you don't feel emotions.

00:27:52.397 --> 00:27:54.230 align:middle line:84%
We know that about
psychopaths, that there's

00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:55.760 align:middle line:84%
certain actions
that are required

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:58.160 align:middle line:84%
for them that are very brutal
for them to feel anything.

00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:58.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:00.800 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: And so I think
that the goal here

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:06.770 align:middle line:10%
is to show the psychology, the
psychopathy of not just Bill's

00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:09.920 align:middle line:10%
class of persons,
but also the elite,

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:11.630 align:middle line:10%
and also the class
of persons that

00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:14.420 align:middle line:10%
might be below Bill
because of his interactions

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:16.670 align:middle line:10%
with the prostitutes.

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And so we get a picture
of the psychology

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:21.230 align:middle line:84%
of all these classes, and their
motivations, and their actions.

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And what we see, I think,
that's the most revealing

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:28.790 align:middle line:84%
about this film is that
there's a somewhat obscure book

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:31.400 align:middle line:84%
by a guy named John
Fowles, who's a postmodern

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:32.560 align:middle line:90%
author in the last century.

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote a book
called "The Magus."

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:37.610 align:middle line:84%
And in "The Magus," there
is a Greek billionaire

00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:42.770 align:middle line:84%
who essentially organizes these
large scale trickery, deception

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:45.980 align:middle line:84%
machinations that involve
actors and different people.

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:49.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's all to play
a trick on this sort

00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:51.290 align:middle line:84%
of nihilistic young
academic scholar

00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:53.390 align:middle line:90%
from Oxford named Nicholas Urfe.

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And Nicholas is being brought
through a process of revelation

00:28:56.810 --> 00:28:58.310 align:middle line:84%
just like Bill
Harford in this film.

00:28:58.310 --> 00:29:00.980 align:middle line:84%
So there's amazing parallels
between these two films.

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:04.980 align:middle line:84%
And the ritual aspects,
the degradation aspects,

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:07.700 align:middle line:84%
all of that, that is part of
the trauma based mind control

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:09.170 align:middle line:90%
that we mentioned last time.

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:13.160 align:middle line:10%
And so it's really
a difficult question

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:17.180 align:middle line:10%
to nail down if Alice herself
is part of this cult or not.

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:19.610 align:middle line:84%
I tend to lean towards thinking
that she is, because she

00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:22.160 align:middle line:90%
places the mask on the pillow.

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:24.560 align:middle line:84%
She has the dream
about the situation

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:27.080 align:middle line:84%
that she's just been at, or
that Bill has been at, the orgy

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:28.100 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:30.697 align:middle line:84%
And I find it hard to believe
that she could do these things.

00:29:30.697 --> 00:29:32.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, the ways
she messed with his head.

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:34.910 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly.

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:38.480 align:middle line:84%
There's a scene also where
she mentions having money.

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And Bill walks in and she's
reading to the daughter

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:43.260 align:middle line:90%
about math problems.

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And she says, so-and-so
has more money.

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:50.152 align:middle line:84%
And she looks up, and that's
indicating to Bill that I

00:29:50.152 --> 00:29:51.360 align:middle line:90%
know who you're dealing with.

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.840 align:middle line:84%
You're dealing with
people that are above you,

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.910 align:middle line:84%
and they have a lot
more money than you do.

00:29:55.910 --> 00:29:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
a key indicator

00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:58.490 align:middle line:90%
that she's part of it.

00:29:58.490 --> 00:30:02.780 align:middle line:84%
And she's probably been raised
in this cult, too, from youth.

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:05.420 align:middle line:84%
And so she's unfortunately
locked into that.

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:09.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And she's both
beguiling to him on one hand,

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:11.310 align:middle line:84%
and totally traumatizing
to him the other.

00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:13.310 align:middle line:84%
Very classic of how she
would have been trained.

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:14.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly.

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:16.370 align:middle line:84%
She would have been
probably brutalized

00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:19.250 align:middle line:84%
and traumatized, perhaps
like their daughter will be.

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:20.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:21.643 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting,
because again, I

00:30:21.643 --> 00:30:25.430 align:middle line:84%
keep going back to the notion
that whoever these elite are

00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:28.760 align:middle line:84%
are dancing on the
razor's edge, yet

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:32.260 align:middle line:84%
in a world of extreme
refinement, and beauty,

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:36.860 align:middle line:84%
and classical music, making it
look so seductive to outsiders

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:38.810 align:middle line:84%
who don't have access
to these things.

00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:41.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Yeah the that's
exemplified at the beginning

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:44.720 align:middle line:84%
at the Christmas ball, where
you have this Hungarian guy,

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:48.100 align:middle line:84%
Sandor Szavost, which
is very close to--

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:49.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Slimy.

00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:51.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: But very
close to the idea

00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:54.680 align:middle line:90%
of Anton Szandor La Vey, right?

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:59.570 align:middle line:84%
And Szavost cites Ovid's
books on the seduction

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:01.017 align:middle line:90%
of married people.

00:31:01.017 --> 00:31:03.100 align:middle line:84%
Ovid is the Latin poet,
and he cites Ovid on that.

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:05.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, that was
an interesting comment.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.416 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Because he's trying
to seduce her at the same time

00:31:07.416 --> 00:31:11.520 align:middle line:84%
that these two British girls are
trying to seduce the Tom Cruise

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:12.320 align:middle line:90%
character, Bill.

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:13.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And what happens is
that they're both being tempted

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:19.729 align:middle line:90%
to commit marriage infidelity.

00:31:19.729 --> 00:31:21.770 align:middle line:84%
And I think that what most
people don't recognize

00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:24.170 align:middle line:84%
about that scene is
that it is specifically

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:26.720 align:middle line:84%
mentioned that the two
girls are Windsors.

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.260 align:middle line:90%
One of them is Nuala Windsor.

00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:31.280 align:middle line:84%
So we get the idea that these
are British elites, right?

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And that is a constant
theme in Kubrick films.

00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:36.899 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick oftentimes
does this, where

00:31:36.899 --> 00:31:39.440 align:middle line:84%
he pictures the British elite
as very decadent, and so forth.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.139 align:middle line:90%
He lived in London, right?

00:31:41.139 --> 00:31:42.680 align:middle line:84%
So he would probably
know about that.

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's also shown in the
scene at the costume shop owner

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:48.590 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:51.490 align:middle line:84%
Where he is actually
pimping out his daughter,

00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:53.020 align:middle line:90%
played by Leelee Sobieski.

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:55.804 align:middle line:84%
And you have to have
the subtitles on

00:31:55.804 --> 00:31:58.220 align:middle line:84%
to see this part of the film
or you won't hear it, but she

00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:00.170 align:middle line:84%
at a certain point
whispers in Bill's ear

00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:02.660 align:middle line:84%
when he's there to purchase
a costume, she says,

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:05.280 align:middle line:90%
you'll need an ermine cloak.

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:10.000 align:middle line:84%
An ermine cloak is what was
worn by European nobility.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Royalty, yeah.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.050 align:middle line:90%
That part was fascinating.

00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And as you're saying this
character, this Hungarian suave

00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:19.070 align:middle line:84%
man who's courting Nicole
Kidman in the film,

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:21.620 align:middle line:84%
and she's kind of
drunkenly or silly playing

00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:23.660 align:middle line:90%
along so to speak.

00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:27.560 align:middle line:84%
This comment he made
about marital relations,

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:30.830 align:middle line:84%
and the beauty is that each
has to involve themselves

00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:33.090 align:middle line:84%
in the mutual
deception to the other.

00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, whoa,
it's really twisted.

00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:37.310 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: It is.

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:39.890 align:middle line:84%
And again, that's from
Ovid's book on how

00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:42.360 align:middle line:90%
to seduce married persons.

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:44.020 align:middle line:84%
So you have this
famous Latin poet

00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:46.040 align:middle line:84%
writing this old
famous treatise on how

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:49.280 align:middle line:84%
to wreck marriages, basically,
and social climb your way up

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.160 align:middle line:90%
the ladder.

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:54.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What was the
purpose of the Christmas trees

00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:55.960 align:middle line:90%
amongst this?

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:59.450 align:middle line:84%
All throughout the
movie were depictions

00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:03.260 align:middle line:84%
and lit up Christmas trees,
from the prostitute's apartment

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:04.310 align:middle line:90%
to the galas?

00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:06.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: I think that the
impression that we're

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:09.230 align:middle line:84%
given about this cult is
that they have a very dark,

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:11.030 align:middle line:90%
nefarious tone about them.

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:15.895 align:middle line:84%
And so that would suggest to
me that it's some form of,

00:33:15.895 --> 00:33:17.270 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say
outright Satanism,

00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:20.160 align:middle line:84%
but some form of the dark
side of the cult operation.

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:21.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why Christmas trees?

00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:26.287 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Well, what happens is
that for some occultic groups,

00:33:26.287 --> 00:33:28.370 align:middle line:84%
the idea is that you can
take things that are good

00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:29.380 align:middle line:90%
and invert them.

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And that that produces a
kind of black magic effect

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:35.600 align:middle line:90%
that the good thing is inverted.

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea of Christmas
being, well, it's about Jesus,

00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:39.010 align:middle line:90%
it's about happy--

00:33:39.010 --> 00:33:39.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Happy
connection, yeah.

00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:40.410 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly.

00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
sometimes we'll see

00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:44.780 align:middle line:84%
a lot of possibly high
profile occult things

00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:46.250 align:middle line:90%
that happen on Christmas.

00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:49.130 align:middle line:84%
So for example, when
did JonBenét Ramsey die?

00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:50.480 align:middle line:90%
It was Christmas, right.

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:54.104 align:middle line:84%
So those kinds of things are
done, I think, intentionally.

00:33:54.104 --> 00:33:55.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think what
Kubrick is saying

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:57.894 align:middle line:84%
is that it's Christmas time,
but it's not what you think.

00:33:57.894 --> 00:34:01.160 align:middle line:84%
This is a dark Christmas,
where we're not

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.652 align:middle line:90%
getting a picture into--

00:34:02.652 --> 00:34:04.735 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Santa won't be
coming down your chimney.

00:34:04.735 --> 00:34:07.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Or the stories about
Jesus' sacrifice or anything

00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:10.310 align:middle line:84%
like that, it's going to
be a dark sacrifice, which

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:11.449 align:middle line:90%
is how the film ends.

00:34:11.449 --> 00:34:13.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right and
they're also there

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:17.090 align:middle line:84%
in, I'm guessing
it's FAO Schwarz,

00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:19.550 align:middle line:84%
they're in a Christmas store
that looks like FAO Schwarz

00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:20.540 align:middle line:90%
shopping.

00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:25.219 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a game on the
shelf called the magic circle

00:34:25.219 --> 00:34:26.030 align:middle line:90%
game.

00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:28.010 align:middle line:84%
So talk about that
scene and what

00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:29.763 align:middle line:90%
that means in the larger sense.

00:34:29.763 --> 00:34:31.429 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: At the original
Christmas party,

00:34:31.429 --> 00:34:34.170 align:middle line:84%
there are a large, lit
up inverted pentagrams.

00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And so there's
nothing inherently

00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:37.190 align:middle line:90%
evil about a pentagram.

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:40.130 align:middle line:84%
But in certain, as I
mentioned, trends of cults

00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:42.199 align:middle line:84%
and the dark side
of things, they

00:34:42.199 --> 00:34:43.850 align:middle line:84%
believe that the
inversion of things

00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:46.053 align:middle line:90%
signifies the dark power.

00:34:46.053 --> 00:34:47.719 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's an
inverted pentagram.

00:34:47.719 --> 00:34:48.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly.

00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:50.225 align:middle line:84%
At the Christmas party,
you'll see the lights

00:34:50.225 --> 00:34:51.850 align:middle line:84%
in the background,
of Bill and Alice--

00:34:51.850 --> 00:34:53.719 align:middle line:84%
and quite consistently
through the film

00:34:53.719 --> 00:34:55.889 align:middle line:90%
there are inverted pentagrams.

00:34:55.889 --> 00:34:58.660 align:middle line:90%
So in the magic circle scene--

00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:00.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: On the floor included.

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:00.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yes.

00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:03.050 align:middle line:84%
In the magic circle scene,
when the game is set up

00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:05.390 align:middle line:84%
and FAO Schwarz, the
game includes inverted--

00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:06.890 align:middle line:84%
and there's inverted
pentagrams up

00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:09.311 align:middle line:84%
on the rafters, as well,
part of the display.

00:35:09.311 --> 00:35:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
intentional, especially

00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:14.030 align:middle line:84%
if you understand the attention
to detail that Kubrick

00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:14.869 align:middle line:90%
has in his films.

00:35:14.869 --> 00:35:15.910 align:middle line:90%
There's not going to be--

00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:18.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Nothing is
there by accident.

00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:23.780 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: So we get the idea that
this is a symbolic portrayal

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:25.820 align:middle line:10%
of manifestations of--

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:27.710 align:middle line:10%
well, sometimes films
will force signify

00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:29.720 align:middle line:10%
what's going to happen
through symbolism.

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:32.420 align:middle line:84%
And so the earlier pentagrams,
and the earlier versions

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:35.320 align:middle line:84%
of circles and so forth,
this is the magic circle

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:37.300 align:middle line:90%
that's at the occult ritual.

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:38.171 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:38.171 --> 00:35:40.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And so the magic circle
in the final scene, I think,

00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:44.480 align:middle line:84%
suggests the possibility that
their eyes are no longer wide

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:45.779 align:middle line:90%
shut, they're now wide open.

00:35:45.779 --> 00:35:48.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Once they step into
the middle of the circle.

00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:50.180 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly.

00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:53.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And also, we'll
get to the end in a minute.

00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:58.930 align:middle line:84%
But Tom Cruise, left hand over
the heart, thumb pointing up.

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:03.220 align:middle line:84%
This has overlays
with Aleister Crowley?

00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:06.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: In Crowley's system,
he would borrow a lot of ideas

00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:07.480 align:middle line:90%
from Masonry.

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:09.640 align:middle line:84%
Because he was kind
of a upper level,

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:12.550 align:middle line:84%
he believed,
post-graduate Mason.

00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:14.626 align:middle line:10%
And so a lot of the
symbols are borrowed.

00:36:14.626 --> 00:36:15.750 align:middle line:90%
And so you have a kind of--

00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:17.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But taking it
to the really dark side.

00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:18.970 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: Oh, absolutely.

00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And so you have the idea of
just a kind of oath of secrecy

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:24.100 align:middle line:90%
is what that signifies.

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:27.070 align:middle line:90%
And so I'm speculating there.

00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:29.054 align:middle line:84%
I can't prove that,
nor do I know for sure.

00:36:29.054 --> 00:36:29.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm just saying that--

00:36:29.970 --> 00:36:30.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're just noticing
that that hand symbol--

00:36:30.970 --> 00:36:33.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: I'm noticing
that that could

00:36:33.010 --> 00:36:38.690 align:middle line:84%
signify the possibility of Bill
realizing some sort of secrecy.

00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:41.960 align:middle line:10%
I mean, he's going to have to
keep the secrets that he's--

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:43.820 align:middle line:10%
I mean, he's delving
so deeply into this,

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:45.319 align:middle line:10%
and he's seeing how
society's really

00:36:45.319 --> 00:36:47.130 align:middle line:10%
run, who's he going to go to?

00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:49.490 align:middle line:10%
Can't go to the press,
because the film shows that--

00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:50.740 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: They own everything.

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:51.990 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: They own the press.

00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:55.280 align:middle line:10%
They control the story of
how the beauty queen dies.

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:56.449 align:middle line:10%
Who's he going to go to?

00:36:56.449 --> 00:36:58.490 align:middle line:10%
So he's going to have to
keep an oath of secrecy.

00:36:58.490 --> 00:37:00.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
felt, because Ziegler

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:05.390 align:middle line:84%
tried to basically assuage
his fears and say, look,

00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:07.040 align:middle line:90%
this was just a show for you.

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:08.870 align:middle line:90%
The whole thing was a setup.

00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:10.460 align:middle line:84%
And you know, he
starts-- and now

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:14.330 align:middle line:84%
Tom Cruise's mind is really
kind of broken at this point.

00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:18.950 align:middle line:84%
He's like, OK, but I
know, I saw what I saw.

00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:22.250 align:middle line:84%
I went to her apartment,
I talked to her roommate.

00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:25.870 align:middle line:10%
And so what is your take on
what actually happens there

00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:27.000 align:middle line:10%
at the end of the film?

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: I think that Ziegler
is lying with seeds of truth.

00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:31.860 align:middle line:84%
So I do think that
it's partly true.

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:33.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just like the media.

00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:33.560 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Mhm.

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:35.390 align:middle line:84%
It's partly true that
a lot of these events

00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:37.490 align:middle line:90%
are organized for Bill.

00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:42.800 align:middle line:84%
And I think that if the cult
really was worried, or wasn't

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:46.070 align:middle line:84%
interested in bringing Bill in,
they could have taken him out,

00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:46.870 align:middle line:90%
easily.

00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:49.272 align:middle line:84%
They killed a beauty
queen, no problem.

00:37:49.272 --> 00:37:51.480 align:middle line:84%
They could have gotten rid
of Bill if they wanted to.

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:53.450 align:middle line:10%
But they are
intentionally leading Bill

00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:57.650 align:middle line:10%
down this long road, this
long process of initiation

00:37:57.650 --> 00:37:59.990 align:middle line:10%
and alchemical revelation.

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:03.470 align:middle line:10%
It's what one writer calls
a self transformative psycho

00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:04.460 align:middle line:10%
drama.

00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's what Bill
is participating in.

00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And we as the
audience, I believe,

00:38:08.330 --> 00:38:10.235 align:middle line:84%
are participating with
Bill in this process.

00:38:10.235 --> 00:38:11.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was just
going to say that.

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:15.800 align:middle line:84%
They're taking you into
all of the revelations,

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:18.740 align:middle line:84%
and eeriness of that
initiation process

00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:20.390 align:middle line:84%
into the decadence
of their world,

00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:24.470 align:middle line:84%
into the lack of compassion,
the expendability of women.

00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:26.429 align:middle line:84%
Women are totally expendable
creatures in this.

00:38:26.429 --> 00:38:28.719 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Yeah, we get the
impression that they basically

00:38:28.719 --> 00:38:31.340 align:middle line:84%
got all these girls out of the
supermodel world, or beauty

00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:33.750 align:middle line:84%
queen world, and they can
do whatever they want.

00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:34.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:36.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And to advance to
the next level, perhaps,

00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:40.460 align:middle line:84%
in their careers, you're forced
with the choice of you join

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:41.499 align:middle line:90%
the cult, or you don't.

00:38:41.499 --> 00:38:43.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then again, it's
the same in all these films,

00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:46.130 align:middle line:84%
and it's the same in the
way this film portrayed it.

00:38:46.130 --> 00:38:48.250 align:middle line:84%
Again, you get
into really basic--

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:50.000 align:middle line:84%
we're interfacing with
our brains in this.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.350 align:middle line:84%
Our behavior, our
emotions and such

00:38:52.350 --> 00:38:55.820 align:middle line:84%
are reactions that are
happening in our brains.

00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:58.130 align:middle line:10%
And again, this
combination of the limbic

00:38:58.130 --> 00:39:00.650 align:middle line:10%
center where you have the
centers of violence and sex

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:04.990 align:middle line:10%
literally rubbing up
against each other, right?

00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:07.310 align:middle line:10%
And that part
figures prominently,

00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:12.200 align:middle line:10%
and it's always at the
expense of the weaker

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:13.700 align:middle line:10%
ones, the disposable ones.

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:15.420 align:middle line:84%
Which in this case
are the women.

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:18.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Yes this is that
social Darwinian perspective

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:22.100 align:middle line:84%
that originates out
of the Royal Society

00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:23.930 align:middle line:90%
and the British elite class.

00:39:23.930 --> 00:39:26.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying everybody,
or the British people,

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.820 align:middle line:84%
but I'm saying that you
have a trend from Thomas

00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:33.620 align:middle line:84%
Malthus in the late 1700s into
characters like Charles Gault

00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:38.510 align:middle line:84%
and Darwin, characters
like Aldous Huxley.

00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:42.290 align:middle line:84%
And they write openly about the
social Darwinian perspective

00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:44.300 align:middle line:84%
that's then applied
to all of society.

00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
we get eugenics.

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:49.100 align:middle line:10%
Eugenics comes out
of this philosophy

00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:52.520 align:middle line:10%
of fighting and scrapping
to get to the top,

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:54.770 align:middle line:10%
and it doesn't matter who
you smash on the way there.

00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:58.659 align:middle line:10%
And that, therefore, dictates
that the weaker species,

00:39:58.659 --> 00:40:00.950 align:middle line:10%
so to speak, anybody that
you can just trample on them.

00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:05.390 align:middle line:10%
Because it's psychopathy,
and basically it's evil.

00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:07.340 align:middle line:10%
And that's what we
see in that film.

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:11.180 align:middle line:10%
And I think Kubrick consistently
presents those kinds of persons

00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:13.200 align:middle line:10%
as running things.

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:14.810 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well, they are.

00:40:14.810 --> 00:40:18.290 align:middle line:10%
And I mean, I've had for
whatever reason-- go ahead.

00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:20.850 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: Well I'm reminded
of the other Kubrick film

00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:23.180 align:middle line:10%
from an Anthony Burgess
novel, The Clockwork Orange.

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:23.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:24.976 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And in
"Clockwork Orange,"

00:40:24.976 --> 00:40:28.460 align:middle line:84%
you have that elite British
social engineering class that

00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:33.100 align:middle line:84%
are obsessed with that that
they take the character

00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:36.620 align:middle line:84%
that McDowell plays in
Alex and they basically

00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:38.120 align:middle line:84%
run him through him
through MK Ultra

00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:40.400 align:middle line:84%
to put him in a catatonic
state to civilize him,

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:42.680 align:middle line:84%
to make him part
of civil society.

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:45.740 align:middle line:10%
And the institutionalization
of everything,

00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:49.400 align:middle line:10%
of every aspect of life, be it
education, be it university,

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:51.660 align:middle line:10%
be it public schooling,
that is, again,

00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:54.320 align:middle line:10%
what Michel Foucault talked
about in his writings

00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:56.160 align:middle line:10%
on the prison system,
the punishment system.

00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:57.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:40:57.050 --> 00:40:59.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So that is real,
and it's exemplified

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:02.330 align:middle line:90%
in the films of Kubrick.

00:41:02.330 --> 00:41:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And he's presenting it
originating out of that older

00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:10.825 align:middle line:90%
British model of Malthusianism.

00:41:10.825 --> 00:41:11.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:15.830 align:middle line:84%
And I have had the experience
of knowing a lot of British men

00:41:15.830 --> 00:41:19.100 align:middle line:84%
as friends, and I was married
to one Brit which gave me

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:20.720 align:middle line:90%
access to a lot of Brits.

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And all of them went
to public school,

00:41:22.650 --> 00:41:25.070 align:middle line:84%
which is private school,
elite private schools.

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And they started
talking to me privately.

00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:28.490 align:middle line:84%
They would tell me
about what it was

00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:32.090 align:middle line:84%
like being inside those
environments, and the cruelty,

00:41:32.090 --> 00:41:34.520 align:middle line:84%
although they couldn't
even see it as such.

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:37.490 align:middle line:84%
The cruelty even begin
age six and seven of what

00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:38.990 align:middle line:90%
they do to these little guys.

00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:39.950 align:middle line:90%
I was in tears.

00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, this
is child abuse.

00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:43.550 align:middle line:90%
But they didn't see it that way.

00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:45.660 align:middle line:84%
Oh, no, it's just
to toughen us up.

00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:48.170 align:middle line:84%
Finally one said,
it's to toughen us up

00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:50.630 align:middle line:84%
to the extent we will
carry out anything

00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:52.190 align:middle line:90%
when we come into power.

00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:54.327 align:middle line:84%
Because we've been
completely desensitized.

00:41:54.327 --> 00:41:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And he actually got
out of the system,

00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:58.250 align:middle line:84%
but it was a very brave--
and one of my interviewees

00:41:58.250 --> 00:41:59.460 align:middle line:90%
said that actually, too.

00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:01.910 align:middle line:84%
That's a very brave
thing to admit

00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:04.700 align:middle line:84%
and to be able to discover,
where others completely

00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:06.530 align:middle line:84%
bought into it and buy
into it to this day

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:09.343 align:middle line:84%
that they were simply
raised as the privileged.

00:42:09.343 --> 00:42:12.770 align:middle line:90%


00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:14.842 align:middle line:84%
Relationships are
often hard for them.

00:42:14.842 --> 00:42:17.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And you can see why
that social darwinism fits well

00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:18.480 align:middle line:90%
with that perspective.

00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:19.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:22.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Because
it is dog eat dog,

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:24.950 align:middle line:84%
and the idea is that to
defeat any other enemies,

00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:27.710 align:middle line:84%
I would have to be more
wicked than my enemy.

00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:31.190 align:middle line:84%
And amazingly, if you look at
the history of we mentioned

00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:32.960 align:middle line:84%
intelligence
operations, there's been

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:37.250 align:middle line:84%
a long rivalry between Russia
and the British empire.

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:39.890 align:middle line:84%
And the British perfected
their intelligence operations.

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:41.390 align:middle line:84%
When I mentioned
"Kingsman" earlier,

00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:43.223 align:middle line:84%
they perfected their
intelligence operations

00:42:43.223 --> 00:42:46.240 align:middle line:84%
through this long time rivalry
between the other empire.

00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:49.400 align:middle line:90%


00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:51.830 align:middle line:84%
The Soviets or KGB have
said about the British

00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:54.506 align:middle line:84%
that they're the most nefarious,
and the most double dealing.

00:42:54.506 --> 00:42:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not talking
about the British people,

00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:57.090 align:middle line:90%
I'll make that clear.

00:42:57.090 --> 00:42:58.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're talking
about the elite.

00:42:58.770 --> 00:43:02.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: But even the specific
families of like the Galtons,

00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:06.470 align:middle line:84%
and the Malthus, and
these different characters

00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:09.800 align:middle line:84%
like that that write
about how to mind

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:11.010 align:middle line:90%
control large populations.

00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:11.885 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:43:11.885 --> 00:43:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And we talk about mind control
and some of the techniques

00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:17.910 align:middle line:84%
and protocols used
in MK Ultra and such,

00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:20.930 align:middle line:84%
we'll just go to a really
good, nasty college

00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:22.640 align:middle line:90%
hazing in the elite schools.

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:24.810 align:middle line:84%
That's starting to
prepare for both.

00:43:24.810 --> 00:43:27.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And that's borrowed
from older military tactics

00:43:27.290 --> 00:43:29.930 align:middle line:84%
of how you put people
through boot camp.

00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:32.310 align:middle line:84%
What's another one of
Kubrick's top films?

00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:33.790 align:middle line:90%
"Full Metal Jacket."

00:43:33.790 --> 00:43:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And you get the character
who basically goes nuts

00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:40.290 align:middle line:84%
from this mind control
trauma of boot camp.

00:43:40.290 --> 00:43:41.270 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:43.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so that
takes care of that.

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:44.535 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
wrap up "Eyes Wide

00:43:44.535 --> 00:43:48.440 align:middle line:84%
Shut," unless you have the
final wrap statement on that.

00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:52.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: "Eyes Wide Shut" is
Kubrick's symbolic presentation

00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:56.450 align:middle line:84%
of how the elite are
able to manipulate us

00:43:56.450 --> 00:43:59.840 align:middle line:84%
through understanding the
basics of human psychology

00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:02.480 align:middle line:84%
and the manipulation
of our baser drives.

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:05.310 align:middle line:84%
That is the essence
of that film.

00:44:05.310 --> 00:44:06.390 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes, OK.

00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:08.520 align:middle line:10%
And it was kind of
painful to watch again.

00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:10.490 align:middle line:10%
I have to say, I didn't
particularly enjoy it.

00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:12.270 align:middle line:10%
But I did take good notes.

00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:13.950 align:middle line:10%
OK, now we're into
a more modern film.

00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:18.390 align:middle line:84%
I think it was '14
or '15, "Ex Machina."

00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:19.950 align:middle line:90%
It's a relatively new film.

00:44:19.950 --> 00:44:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And this whole notion, again,
of the rational obsession

00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:28.930 align:middle line:84%
with technology in the
place of human interface.

00:44:28.930 --> 00:44:30.731 align:middle line:90%
So lay this out for us.

00:44:30.731 --> 00:44:31.980 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yes this is very real.

00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:35.190 align:middle line:84%
I've recently done an
extended lecture series

00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:37.070 align:middle line:84%
on Carroll Quigley's
"Tragedy and Hope."

00:44:37.070 --> 00:44:39.690 align:middle line:84%
Carroll Quigley was the
professor from Georgetown

00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:41.760 align:middle line:84%
who was actually able
to write this 1300 page

00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:44.910 align:middle line:90%
tome from the CFR archives.

00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:47.520 align:middle line:84%
So what we're getting here is
the Western establishment's

00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:52.170 align:middle line:84%
apologetic and defense
of its own operations

00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:54.860 align:middle line:84%
in the last 100 years,
including both world wars.

00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:58.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, what Quigley says at
the culmination of that book

00:44:58.230 --> 00:45:01.500 align:middle line:84%
is that we're entering
the era of quantification.

00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:03.630 align:middle line:84%
He wrote that in
1966, and he's saying

00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:07.410 align:middle line:84%
that we're entering the
age of AI, cybernetics.

00:45:07.410 --> 00:45:10.620 align:middle line:84%
And by quantification,
what he means

00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:15.060 align:middle line:84%
is viewing everything in
reality as purely mathematically

00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:16.840 align:middle line:90%
regimented and quantifiable.

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:17.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:20.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And that's getting rid
of qualitative aspects of life

00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:22.530 align:middle line:90%
that would be good, bad.

00:45:22.530 --> 00:45:24.030 align:middle line:84%
None of those things
matter anymore.

00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:26.910 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that
matters is, do the math,

00:45:26.910 --> 00:45:29.880 align:middle line:90%
does it justify xyz?

00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:32.580 align:middle line:84%
This comes from an
older British tradition

00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:35.400 align:middle line:84%
that we mentioned in the
last show of utilitarianism.

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:37.929 align:middle line:84%
Utilitarians thought that--
I'm not making this up.

00:45:37.929 --> 00:45:39.470 align:middle line:84%
This is how goofy
the philosophy is--

00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:42.095 align:middle line:84%
that you can do moral calculus,
that you could actually come up

00:45:42.095 --> 00:45:44.340 align:middle line:84%
with an equation
that would tell you

00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:46.200 align:middle line:90%
which actions were good or bad.

00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And it would be based on
the pleasure principle.

00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:49.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:50.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And so this
is utterly ridiculous,

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:54.540 align:middle line:84%
but it's the logical
result of a fallacy

00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:57.180 align:middle line:90%
of reductionist materialism.

00:45:57.180 --> 00:46:00.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, "Ex Machina"
presents the culmination

00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:03.360 align:middle line:84%
of this long tradition
of materialism.

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:06.810 align:middle line:84%
This idea that can we
create a synthetic version

00:46:06.810 --> 00:46:08.072 align:middle line:90%
of everything, basically?

00:46:08.072 --> 00:46:09.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Including us.

00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:10.230 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Including us.

00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:13.440 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes to the
android, or the cyborg,

00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:16.140 align:middle line:84%
or the replicant, I think
that in sci-fi there's

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:18.180 align:middle line:84%
a long tradition
that really reaches

00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:20.030 align:middle line:90%
a peak in "Blade Runner."

00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:21.450 align:middle line:84%
And in "Blade
Runner," what we see

00:46:21.450 --> 00:46:23.940 align:middle line:84%
is this really
crucial connection

00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:28.000 align:middle line:84%
between sexuality, sex
operatives, mind control,

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:28.800 align:middle line:90%
and AI.

00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:31.437 align:middle line:90%


00:46:31.437 --> 00:46:34.020 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to touch on it,
but there is a deep connection

00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:34.860 align:middle line:90%
between those.

00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:38.220 align:middle line:84%
So even though it sounds like
what would AI and transhumanism

00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:41.461 align:middle line:84%
have to do with MK Ultra and
sex operatives or mind control?

00:46:41.461 --> 00:46:42.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's those
experiments that we

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:44.550 align:middle line:84%
talked about earlier
where they began

00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:46.680 align:middle line:84%
implanting electrodes
and dealing

00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:48.450 align:middle line:84%
with the possibility
of splitting the mind

00:46:48.450 --> 00:46:51.930 align:middle line:84%
and so forth that we get the
progression of moving man

00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:53.380 align:middle line:90%
into being a robot.

00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:54.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:56.138 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And that's what
we see in "Ex Machina,"

00:46:56.138 --> 00:46:59.580 align:middle line:84%
is this idea of
a grand test that

00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:02.279 align:middle line:84%
is not a test on
who we think it is,

00:47:02.279 --> 00:47:03.570 align:middle line:90%
at least initially in the film.

00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:04.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:05.468 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: So what is this test?

00:47:05.468 --> 00:47:07.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're going to
see if maybe the older

00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:09.720 align:middle line:84%
idea of the Turing
test of Alan Turing,

00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:12.930 align:middle line:84%
can a robot prove it has
self-consciousness or rational

00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:15.240 align:middle line:84%
choice between
different options?

00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:18.090 align:middle line:84%
And we think that in
the film, the character,

00:47:18.090 --> 00:47:20.915 align:middle line:84%
that sort of nerdy tech guy
that's brought in by this--

00:47:20.915 --> 00:47:22.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just kind
of a modest man

00:47:22.530 --> 00:47:24.210 align:middle line:90%
who's doing technical analysis.

00:47:24.210 --> 00:47:26.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: By this tech
genius guy who lives up

00:47:26.670 --> 00:47:27.710 align:middle line:90%
in the hills, mountains.

00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:28.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Total manipulator.

00:47:28.970 --> 00:47:30.053 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Total manipulator.

00:47:30.053 --> 00:47:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And he brings them in
under the guise of,

00:47:32.370 --> 00:47:35.610 align:middle line:84%
I want you to run the tests
on this new hot AI bot

00:47:35.610 --> 00:47:36.510 align:middle line:90%
that I've created.

00:47:36.510 --> 00:47:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to determine
if you think she can pass it.

00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And what we find out is
that the entire operation

00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:44.440 align:middle line:84%
is a psychological
manipulation on the guy.

00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:45.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:47.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And he's the
real test subject.

00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:52.770 align:middle line:84%
The AI is already essentially
conscious, for film purposes,

00:47:52.770 --> 00:47:53.790 align:middle line:90%
we'll say.

00:47:53.790 --> 00:47:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think the most
revelatory aspect to this film

00:47:58.610 --> 00:48:02.115 align:middle line:84%
is that there is this
idea of a global brain.

00:48:02.115 --> 00:48:04.500 align:middle line:84%
And this is, the
supercomputers are essentially

00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:06.570 align:middle line:84%
storing all the
data, and this would

00:48:06.570 --> 00:48:10.920 align:middle line:84%
be data based on everyone's
profile of their search history

00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:11.850 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:48:11.850 --> 00:48:14.080 align:middle line:10%
And so then it can be
tailored to that person.

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:18.060 align:middle line:10%
And so the AI bot played
by Alicia Vikander,

00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:22.320 align:middle line:10%
she plays this character who
is essentially everything

00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:23.230 align:middle line:10%
that he wants.

00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:25.650 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Match
his porn profiles.

00:48:25.650 --> 00:48:28.210 align:middle line:10%
Did you match my porn
profile in creating her?

00:48:28.210 --> 00:48:29.100 align:middle line:90%
That was interesting.

00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:31.308 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And so that's the
best way to manipulate him.

00:48:31.308 --> 00:48:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why I mentioned
earlier sex operatives and sex

00:48:34.110 --> 00:48:36.000 align:middle line:90%
espionage in mind control.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.150 align:middle line:84%
That was perfected in
MK Ultra operations,

00:48:39.150 --> 00:48:42.600 align:middle line:84%
in the NKVD's operations
with Russian orphans

00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:43.730 align:middle line:90%
and prostitutes.

00:48:43.730 --> 00:48:46.380 align:middle line:90%
They figured out how to do this.

00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:51.450 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, it's a robotic
version of sexual manipulation

00:48:51.450 --> 00:48:53.700 align:middle line:90%
that's applied to the guy.

00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:57.307 align:middle line:84%
And that's his weakness,
and he falls for it.

00:48:57.307 --> 00:48:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And we also get this
interesting scene

00:48:58.890 --> 00:49:04.290 align:middle line:84%
where the tech genius guy has
created other AI sex bots.

00:49:04.290 --> 00:49:05.740 align:middle line:90%
He's got like a wardrobe.

00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:09.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This man is
not skilled at interface

00:49:09.210 --> 00:49:11.360 align:middle line:90%
with humans.

00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:13.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Yeah, he's got
his wardrobe full of--

00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:14.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sex bots.

00:49:14.550 --> 00:49:15.570 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Sex bots.

00:49:15.570 --> 00:49:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And this is now reality, we see
news stories in the mainstream

00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:21.410 align:middle line:84%
now that the Japanese sex bots
are being created and stuff.

00:49:21.410 --> 00:49:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And this is going to replace
humans, and so forth.

00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:31.260 align:middle line:84%
So what is interesting is that
the human subconscious that

00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:34.380 align:middle line:84%
played out or Carl
Jung talked about,

00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:37.920 align:middle line:84%
this is being mimicked
on a synthetic level

00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:39.600 align:middle line:90%
with AI and super computers.

00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:42.900 align:middle line:84%
So for example, part of
free will or volition

00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:46.230 align:middle line:84%
is the idea that
influences or thought

00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:48.030 align:middle line:90%
processes arise from somewhere.

00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:49.680 align:middle line:90%
Our subconscious, presumably.

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:51.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of
how we have free will,

00:49:51.450 --> 00:49:53.550 align:middle line:90%
because we choose this or that.

00:49:53.550 --> 00:49:56.970 align:middle line:84%
The question is, for AI,
how do you mimic free will?

00:49:56.970 --> 00:49:59.680 align:middle line:84%
Because that's really the
defining characteristic

00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:00.480 align:middle line:90%
of a human being.

00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:00.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It just
has to come down

00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:02.130 align:middle line:84%
to the mathematical
probabilities

00:50:02.130 --> 00:50:03.030 align:middle line:90%
in their programming.

00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:04.238 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: In their mind, right.

00:50:04.238 --> 00:50:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And so what they need is a
mimic of the subconscious.

00:50:07.350 --> 00:50:08.650 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:50:08.650 --> 00:50:10.705 align:middle line:84%
You have a giant
supercomputer that stores--

00:50:10.705 --> 00:50:11.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Experience.

00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:14.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: --all of its
vast data from everyone.

00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:16.976 align:middle line:84%
That's what the supercomputers
and the NSA are there for.

00:50:16.976 --> 00:50:18.600 align:middle line:84%
So what they do is
they weaponize that,

00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:21.990 align:middle line:84%
and they create what they
think is the embodiment

00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:24.240 align:middle line:90%
of a conscious computer.

00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:30.176 align:middle line:84%
And it's this psychopathic
sexbot killer babe.

00:50:30.176 --> 00:50:32.290 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't go well for them.

00:50:32.290 --> 00:50:33.300 align:middle line:90%
It's a big mistake.

00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:33.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, no.

00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:34.470 align:middle line:90%
It turns on them.

00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:37.180 align:middle line:84%
Their own weakness
turns against them.

00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And again, they think
they can exploit, protect,

00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:44.040 align:middle line:84%
whatever, the feminine,
which actually these beings

00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:45.030 align:middle line:90%
turn on them.

00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:46.669 align:middle line:84%
These created
beings turn on them.

00:50:46.669 --> 00:50:48.210 align:middle line:84%
Which is interesting,
because they're

00:50:48.210 --> 00:50:52.710 align:middle line:84%
appealing to the flattery
and ability of men to succumb

00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:55.997 align:middle line:84%
to feminine flattery, just
like in the film "Her."

00:50:55.997 --> 00:50:58.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Absolutely I did
analysis of that film, as well.

00:50:58.330 --> 00:51:00.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah I mean, I
found that fascinating.

00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:02.200 align:middle line:84%
She's everything I
could ever want--

00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:04.950 align:middle line:84%
who would ever want anything
more than this person who's

00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:06.060 align:middle line:90%
there for you?

00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:09.870 align:middle line:84%
To see you, feel you,
hear you, hear you out.

00:51:09.870 --> 00:51:11.220 align:middle line:90%
Same thing in this film.

00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:13.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: There's
a funny film that

00:51:13.290 --> 00:51:16.500 align:middle line:84%
presents the exact same
theme in a B movie way,

00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:18.060 align:middle line:90%
and that's called "Cherry 2000."

00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:18.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I never saw that.

00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:19.400 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: You got to watch that.

00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:21.120 align:middle line:84%
It's goofy, but it
has Melanie Griffith

00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:23.760 align:middle line:84%
in it playing the
real human character,

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:25.989 align:middle line:84%
and this guy's whole quest
is after this AI bot.

00:51:25.989 --> 00:51:27.530 align:middle line:84%
So it's very similar
to "Ex Machina."

00:51:27.530 --> 00:51:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And what he learns at the
end of the whole story

00:51:29.530 --> 00:51:33.300 align:middle line:84%
is that actually, the human
that I've met this whole time

00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:35.680 align:middle line:84%
is the best match for me,
not this ideal thing that's

00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:36.480 align:middle line:90%
not real.

00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:37.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:40.260 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's look at let's
take a peek at a clip

00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:45.270 align:middle line:84%
from the film in which now she's
starting to manipulate him.

00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:46.187 align:middle line:90%

00:52:07.185 --> 00:52:08.410 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yeah, very deep film.

00:52:08.410 --> 00:52:10.340 align:middle line:84%
Very philosophical,
a lot of references

00:52:10.340 --> 00:52:12.620 align:middle line:90%
to philosophers in that film.

00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:16.280 align:middle line:84%
Two literary
subjects, and I think

00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:18.530 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of kabbalistic
symbolism in that film,

00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:21.710 align:middle line:84%
as well, which I think is
interesting for the notion

00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:23.030 align:middle line:90%
of computer technology.

00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:25.430 align:middle line:84%
Because computer technology
does historically

00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:30.905 align:middle line:84%
arise out of cryptography,
symbology, and kabbalism.

00:52:30.905 --> 00:52:34.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the whole notion
of being totally reliant

00:52:34.550 --> 00:52:39.980 align:middle line:84%
upon, again, the rational
aspect of the mind makes people,

00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:42.907 align:middle line:84%
but men seem to succumb more,
weaker rather than stronger.

00:52:42.907 --> 00:52:44.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: It reminds me of
the dialogue between Carl

00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:46.810 align:middle line:90%
Jung and Wolfgang Pauli.

00:52:46.810 --> 00:52:48.380 align:middle line:84%
Wolfgang Pauli was
a famous physicist

00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:52.370 align:middle line:84%
who was sort of a pioneer of
quantum physics and quantum

00:52:52.370 --> 00:52:53.220 align:middle line:90%
theory.

00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And he was having
personal problems,

00:52:56.120 --> 00:53:00.167 align:middle line:84%
psychological problems that he
felt he needed a psychiatrist.

00:53:00.167 --> 00:53:02.000 align:middle line:84%
So the best guy he could
find was Carl Jung,

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.520 align:middle line:84%
and Carl Jung said the problem
is that you're completely

00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:05.990 align:middle line:90%
dominant with left brain.

00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:09.440 align:middle line:84%
And you've forgotten your
right side, intuitive side.

00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:13.310 align:middle line:84%
And when he reconciled that,
he made some pretty amazing

00:53:13.310 --> 00:53:15.110 align:middle line:84%
discoveries because
he was able to combine

00:53:15.110 --> 00:53:16.100 align:middle line:90%
the left and the right brain.

00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:17.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and we talked
about this in the last show.

00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:18.890 align:middle line:90%
Hollywood seldom does this.

00:53:18.890 --> 00:53:23.250 align:middle line:84%
They didn't do it in this one,
but to disastrous consequences

00:53:23.250 --> 00:53:24.050 align:middle line:90%
for all parties.

00:53:24.050 --> 00:53:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is about--
and the man says this,

00:53:26.850 --> 00:53:29.870 align:middle line:84%
I forget the name of the
character the gajillionaire who

00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:33.170 align:middle line:90%
this is all his creation--

00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:37.710 align:middle line:84%
is that the goal is
to become God, right?

00:53:37.710 --> 00:53:38.510 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yes.

00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:39.426 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We are gods.

00:53:39.426 --> 00:53:43.280 align:middle line:84%
We create this technology
because we are gods.

00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:45.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Yeah, a lot of these
inventions that we've--

00:53:45.830 --> 00:53:47.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The mind is God.

00:53:47.330 --> 00:53:49.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Yeah, a lot of
these things that we've seen

00:53:49.610 --> 00:53:51.920 align:middle line:84%
come out, the
internet and so forth,

00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:53.110 align:middle line:90%
these arise out of DARPA.

00:53:53.110 --> 00:53:56.670 align:middle line:84%
These arise out of the
Pentagon military weaponization

00:53:56.670 --> 00:53:57.560 align:middle line:90%
apparatus.

00:53:57.560 --> 00:54:00.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a God
complex of humanity.

00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:01.721 align:middle line:84%
And this really
exemplifies that.

00:54:01.721 --> 00:54:03.470 align:middle line:84%
We only have a few
minutes left, and we've

00:54:03.470 --> 00:54:04.720 align:middle line:90%
got to get to "Casino Royale."

00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:06.630 align:middle line:84%
So any final
statements on "Ex--"

00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:08.510 align:middle line:84%
I say "Mackina."
you say "Machina."

00:54:08.510 --> 00:54:11.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: You're probably
right, it is Latin.

00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:15.370 align:middle line:84%
The name itself is an indicator
of what the film is about,

00:54:15.370 --> 00:54:16.990 align:middle line:90%
they use "ex machina."

00:54:16.990 --> 00:54:21.060 align:middle line:84%
And this is the old Greek idea
of, within literary tradition,

00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:24.620 align:middle line:84%
the god from within the
system is rolled out

00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:29.310 align:middle line:84%
as a kind of explanatory
power literary device.

00:54:29.310 --> 00:54:31.460 align:middle line:84%
It gives you an explanation
for all the events

00:54:31.460 --> 00:54:32.900 align:middle line:90%
that happened in the Greek play.

00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:33.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:54:33.700 --> 00:54:36.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And so in this case,
it's a statement about the idea

00:54:36.650 --> 00:54:41.540 align:middle line:84%
that God, in the
transhumanist Darwinian sense,

00:54:41.540 --> 00:54:44.090 align:middle line:84%
will arise within the
eminent history itself

00:54:44.090 --> 00:54:47.700 align:middle line:90%
to basically become God, right?

00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And this is how Ray Kurzweil
and other transhumanist say.

00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:53.630 align:middle line:84%
Ray Kurzweil says, I
don't believe in God yet,

00:54:53.630 --> 00:54:56.270 align:middle line:90%
but I'll know when I'm God.

00:54:56.270 --> 00:55:00.955 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're right,
not a fan of his.

00:55:00.955 --> 00:55:02.697 align:middle line:90%
So OK, let's wrap that up.

00:55:02.697 --> 00:55:04.530 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, that was a
beautiful explanation.

00:55:04.530 --> 00:55:06.380 align:middle line:84%
Let's go on with our
last few minutes left

00:55:06.380 --> 00:55:09.470 align:middle line:84%
to "Casino Royale," which
was, I think for myself

00:55:09.470 --> 00:55:12.930 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of women, of course,
it was perhaps my favorite Bond

00:55:12.930 --> 00:55:13.730 align:middle line:90%
film--

00:55:13.730 --> 00:55:15.350 align:middle line:90%
I think I've seen all of them--

00:55:15.350 --> 00:55:17.930 align:middle line:84%
simply because there
was a human element that

00:55:17.930 --> 00:55:21.120 align:middle line:84%
extended beyond all of his
other training and programming,

00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:23.360 align:middle line:90%
that's called love.

00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:24.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: When I did
my graduate work,

00:55:24.890 --> 00:55:28.160 align:middle line:84%
I was really impressed
with the actual depth

00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:30.200 align:middle line:84%
behind a lot of
these Fleming stories

00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:32.780 align:middle line:84%
that are not perceptible
on the surface.

00:55:32.780 --> 00:55:36.770 align:middle line:84%
We tend to think of it as pulp
fiction, or goofy, or silly.

00:55:36.770 --> 00:55:38.231 align:middle line:84%
But when you learn
about Fleming,

00:55:38.231 --> 00:55:40.730 align:middle line:84%
you realize that he actually
worked in British Naval PSYOPS.

00:55:40.730 --> 00:55:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And he was very
intimately involved

00:55:42.740 --> 00:55:46.636 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of black and covert
operations in World War II.

00:55:46.636 --> 00:55:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And so when he's
writing these stories,

00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:50.870 align:middle line:84%
he's writing from what he's
actually seeing in the world.

00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:52.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, he does combine
a lot of fiction,

00:55:52.550 --> 00:55:55.297 align:middle line:84%
and combines characters
that he knew in real life

00:55:55.297 --> 00:55:56.630 align:middle line:90%
into these fictional characters.

00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:58.296 align:middle line:84%
But that's what makes
it so interesting,

00:55:58.296 --> 00:56:02.090 align:middle line:84%
is that he himself being an
agent of Her Majesty's Secret

00:56:02.090 --> 00:56:04.160 align:middle line:84%
Service, he can
understand what it's

00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:07.430 align:middle line:84%
like to be a character who
works at the behest of the state

00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:09.080 align:middle line:90%
and kills for the state.

00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think that Fleming was
at least sincere in showing us

00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:17.210 align:middle line:84%
in the first novel, "Casino
Royale," that inner struggle,

00:56:17.210 --> 00:56:19.220 align:middle line:90%
that that kind of a person has.

00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:20.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Has to be.

00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:23.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So you're given
the impression that it's

00:56:23.690 --> 00:56:25.580 align:middle line:90%
a virtue to kill for the state.

00:56:25.580 --> 00:56:28.040 align:middle line:84%
But you've been
traumatized by the state

00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:29.510 align:middle line:90%
to be in that position.

00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:32.501 align:middle line:84%
So for example, the 00 status,
that's actually a real thing

00:56:32.501 --> 00:56:33.500 align:middle line:90%
in British intelligence.

00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:36.380 align:middle line:84%
That's not me, that's
in public books.

00:56:36.380 --> 00:56:40.056 align:middle line:84%
There's a book called "Art of
Betrayal" by Gordon Corera,

00:56:40.056 --> 00:56:41.930 align:middle line:84%
where he talks about
the 00 status being real

00:56:41.930 --> 00:56:43.730 align:middle line:84%
in the history of
British intelligence.

00:56:43.730 --> 00:56:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And the way that
you get that as you

00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:46.880 align:middle line:84%
have to have a certain
number of kills.

00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And Bond the character
has reached this status,

00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:51.189 align:middle line:90%
and he's now de-sensitized.

00:56:51.189 --> 00:56:52.730 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't have
regard for human life

00:56:52.730 --> 00:56:55.160 align:middle line:84%
anymore, because he's that
psychopathic machinelike

00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:59.990 align:middle line:84%
killer programmed, and MK Ultra
does play into the Bond novels.

00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:02.630 align:middle line:84%
"You Only Live Twice,"
he specifically goes

00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:03.860 align:middle line:90%
through mind control.

00:57:03.860 --> 00:57:06.500 align:middle line:84%
So unfortunately that's
happened to Bond,

00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:09.920 align:middle line:84%
and you're right to bring
up Vesper Lynd, who's

00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:12.640 align:middle line:84%
his love interest in both
the film and the novel.

00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:14.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Eva Green, wonderful.

00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:16.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: The film is pretty
close to the novel, actually.

00:57:16.690 --> 00:57:19.700 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is that
he feels betrayed by her,

00:57:19.700 --> 00:57:22.314 align:middle line:84%
and so that was his
last sort of flirtation.

00:57:22.314 --> 00:57:24.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But he allowed himself
to completely go there with her

00:57:24.980 --> 00:57:26.630 align:middle line:84%
before that, as
much as you could--

00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:31.130 align:middle line:84%
I could never fathom that a
Bond with that conditioning

00:57:31.130 --> 00:57:33.830 align:middle line:84%
could go there, and could
go into the depth of a love

00:57:33.830 --> 00:57:36.020 align:middle line:84%
relationship with
someone, even to the point

00:57:36.020 --> 00:57:37.230 align:middle line:90%
of planning their future.

00:57:37.230 --> 00:57:39.980 align:middle line:84%
Their domestic-- as much
as it can be-- exciting

00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:41.390 align:middle line:90%
domestic life.

00:57:41.390 --> 00:57:43.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: It's funny,
because in the novels,

00:57:43.550 --> 00:57:46.800 align:middle line:84%
Fleming actually later
has Bond get married.

00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:48.050 align:middle line:90%
So he keeps trying.

00:57:48.050 --> 00:57:50.300 align:middle line:84%
He keeps being sort of pulled
back into the world of--

00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:51.591 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He wants to be human.

00:57:51.591 --> 00:57:52.490 align:middle line:90%
He wants to be human.

00:57:52.490 --> 00:57:54.030 align:middle line:90%
And this I found fascinating.

00:57:54.030 --> 00:57:56.690 align:middle line:84%
This one particular scene,
let's look at this one scene.

00:57:56.690 --> 00:58:00.800 align:middle line:84%
To me this just, I was in tears
the first time I saw the movie.

00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:03.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, there was
something that was almost

00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:06.560 align:middle line:84%
left me with a state
of elation and tears

00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:10.194 align:middle line:84%
at the same time when she has
been chased and traumatized,

00:58:10.194 --> 00:58:12.110 align:middle line:84%
and she's sitting in the
bottom of the shower.

00:58:12.110 --> 00:58:13.318 align:middle line:90%
OK let's take a peek at that.

00:58:13.318 --> 00:58:16.196 align:middle line:10%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:58:16.196 --> 00:58:23.270 align:middle line:90%

[END PLAYBACK]

00:58:24.070 --> 00:58:25.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Women
all over the world,

00:58:25.570 --> 00:58:27.550 align:middle line:84%
when they saw that
scene, saw Bond

00:58:27.550 --> 00:58:29.177 align:middle line:90%
in a completely different way.

00:58:29.177 --> 00:58:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And you were pulling
for something new

00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:33.540 align:middle line:90%
to emerge from this character.

00:58:33.540 --> 00:58:34.940 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Bond loves Vesper Lynd.

00:58:34.940 --> 00:58:35.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:58:35.740 --> 00:58:38.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And that is what, in
the storyline of the reboot

00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:41.410 align:middle line:84%
and in the original novel,
is what hardens him.

00:58:41.410 --> 00:58:43.660 align:middle line:84%
So because he feels betrayed
by the person that he

00:58:43.660 --> 00:58:45.661 align:middle line:90%
actually finally did love--

00:58:45.661 --> 00:58:46.660 align:middle line:90%
and he's also an orphan.

00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:48.160 align:middle line:84%
That's important to the
story of Bond, because--

00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:49.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes, yes.

00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:53.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: --the state steps
in as his de facto mommy.

00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:55.570 align:middle line:90%
And so he works for Her Majesty.

00:58:55.570 --> 00:58:58.947 align:middle line:84%
He has a handler, M. Those
are his parental figures,

00:58:58.947 --> 00:59:01.280 align:middle line:84%
they're stand-ins for the
parental figures he never had.

00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:02.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's the only
family he ever had.

00:59:02.470 --> 00:59:04.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And I mentioned
earlier the NKVD,

00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:06.730 align:middle line:84%
why do you think they would draw
from orphans and prostitutes?

00:59:06.730 --> 00:59:08.980 align:middle line:84%
Because they're missing those
familial figures, right?

00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:10.990 align:middle line:84%
They make good
agents of the state.

00:59:10.990 --> 00:59:14.620 align:middle line:84%
So Bond feels betrayed
and hurt by the loss

00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:16.300 align:middle line:84%
of the last possibility
he has for love.

00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
basically sends him

00:59:17.950 --> 00:59:20.630 align:middle line:84%
on this sort of psychopathic
Nietzschean program killing

00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:21.430 align:middle line:90%
spree.

00:59:21.430 --> 00:59:22.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:59:22.230 --> 00:59:25.510 align:middle line:84%
Anything else you'd like
to embed in that quickly?

00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:28.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: There's amazing
revelations in "Casino Royale."

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:31.270 align:middle line:84%
We have the idea
of the put options.

00:59:31.270 --> 00:59:34.722 align:middle line:84%
So the Le Chiffre character,
played by Mads Mikkelsen--

00:59:34.722 --> 00:59:35.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 9/11 in that.

00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:37.040 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly, exactly.

00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:38.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: American
and United Airlines.

00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And so even
though this is after 9/11,

00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:42.700 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of hinting at the
possibility of what went down

00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:43.540 align:middle line:90%
on 9/11.

00:59:43.540 --> 00:59:45.790 align:middle line:84%
Mads Mikkelsen is actually
based on the character

00:59:45.790 --> 00:59:47.280 align:middle line:90%
of Aleister Crowley.

00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:49.300 align:middle line:84%
The Le Chiffre character
is based on Crowley.

00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:51.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Blood dripping
out of his ducts.

00:59:51.110 --> 00:59:51.910 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating.

00:59:51.910 --> 00:59:54.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: The name, Le
Chiffre, means cipher.

00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:55.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:59:55.450 --> 00:59:56.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, fascinating.

00:59:56.500 --> 00:59:58.840 align:middle line:10%
And again, I just
wanted to say, I

00:59:58.840 --> 01:00:00.940 align:middle line:10%
appreciate your work
as a philosopher

01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:04.390 align:middle line:10%
of film and cinematography
to analyze these things

01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:07.060 align:middle line:10%
and help us take a look
at how we're constantly

01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:10.280 align:middle line:10%
being controlled and manipulated
if we're not paying attention.

01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:11.080 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: Right.

01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:11.880 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:14.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think we have reason
to get back together again.

01:00:14.370 --> 01:00:16.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure we'll be
seeing you back on Gaia.

01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:16.730 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: OK.

01:00:16.730 --> 01:00:17.402 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Thanks, Jay.

01:00:17.402 --> 01:00:17.804 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: Sounds great.

01:00:17.804 --> 01:00:19.010 align:middle line:10%
Had a good time.

01:00:19.010 --> 01:00:20.710 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Again, for
continued analysis,

01:00:20.710 --> 01:00:22.420 align:middle line:10%
you can pick up a
copy of "Esoteric

01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:25.270 align:middle line:10%
Hollywood" at major booksellers,
and go to jaysanalysis.com.

01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:30.000 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Open Minds.
