>>REGINA MEREDITH: The
deeper researchers dig

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.610 align:middle line:10%
into sacred geometry and
structures, the more complex

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.040 align:middle line:10%
the picture that emerges.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.660 align:middle line:84%
It's now believed that
ancient civilizations possess

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.570 align:middle line:84%
great knowledge of
esoteric science

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.130 align:middle line:84%
and our place
within the universe,

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.940 align:middle line:84%
and laid down in
stone the data so

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.760 align:middle line:84%
that it could withstand
catastrophic events.

Cort Lindahl is with
us today to speak

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.170 align:middle line:84%
about the connection between
the octagonal form Temple

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.420 align:middle line:84%
Mount, Constantine, and
even Thomas Jefferson.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.610 align:middle line:84%
Were they all
followers of the same?

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.610 align:middle line:90%
We're going to find out.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.110 align:middle line:90%
We have two hours together.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.170 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Cort.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.700 align:middle line:84%
I have to tell you,
your book-- normally

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm pretty good at getting
all the way through a book

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.560 align:middle line:90%
and grokking it.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.800 align:middle line:84%
This is so fat, so meaty, so
intricate in its connections

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.720 align:middle line:84%
that I ended up doing the
very thing I don't like to do.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.886 align:middle line:84%
I kept going down one
rabbit hole after another.

00:01:17.886 --> 00:01:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And I'd go off on a
strand of research.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.470 align:middle line:90%
And I shot all my research time.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.670 align:middle line:84%
But I got a good way
through, enough that we can

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.220 align:middle line:90%
have a conversation, I think.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.636 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT LINDAHL:
That's kind of how

00:01:26.636 --> 00:01:28.548 align:middle line:90%
the book was written, as well.

00:01:28.548 --> 00:01:30.870 align:middle line:84%
It took me a lot
of strange places

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.490 align:middle line:90%
and interesting places, as well.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I bet.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:34.630 align:middle line:90%
Well, I can tell that it did.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.349 align:middle line:84%
And it actually had some
huge personal aha moments,

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:39.140 align:middle line:84%
which I may share later
in our second hour.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.960 align:middle line:84%
But in any event, it's
called The Sacred Towers

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.470 align:middle line:90%
of the Axis Mundi.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.220 align:middle line:84%
So first and foremost, I
think it's important for us

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.210 align:middle line:84%
to set up what is
the axis mundi.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And what by way of
thought and philosophy

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.000 align:middle line:84%
has been based on it
throughout the ages?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.800 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: OK.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.070 align:middle line:10%
Well, primarily at first
from a practical perspective,

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.230 align:middle line:10%
the axis mundi was
used-- and still

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.000 align:middle line:10%
is-- to legally describe
property for rulers or royal

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.270 align:middle line:10%
interests.

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.720 align:middle line:10%
And over the centuries
it gained a lot

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.350 align:middle line:10%
of spiritual overtones related
to astrology, primarily

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.230 align:middle line:10%
because the arts of
astrology and astronomy

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.730 align:middle line:10%
have a lot of overlap
and calculating arcs

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.090 align:middle line:10%
on the globe and directions on
the globe from a central point.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.430 align:middle line:84%
So that's one way that
the general public could

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.760 align:middle line:84%
relate to what it
is, or the place

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.200 align:middle line:90%
where star logs are collected.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.770 align:middle line:84%
So primarily, they'll collect
star logs at these places.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And then they can
build other temples

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.330 align:middle line:84%
on the face of the Earth
that can be compared

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.500 align:middle line:84%
to the point where the first
temple is by collecting

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.440 align:middle line:90%
ephemerous or other star logs.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And then oftentimes
the main axis

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.330 align:middle line:84%
would have a specific shape
like an octagon or a hexagon

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.620 align:middle line:84%
that suggested these specific
directions on the globe.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.360 align:middle line:84%
So these buildings would
actually point to places.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.210 align:middle line:84%
So it's like if you took a stop
sign and put it on the ground

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.280 align:middle line:84%
and arranged candles
or something else--

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: At each corner--

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.790 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Right.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:12.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --intersection.

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.373 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: And it pointed to.

00:03:13.373 --> 00:03:15.930 align:middle line:84%
You could even put one
a little farther away

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.040 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.090 align:middle line:84%
So it can be kind of a
random arrangement, too.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.490 align:middle line:84%
But it all references the
center point, or the datum.

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.000 align:middle line:90%
That's another name for it too.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.400 align:middle line:90%
It even has the word date in it.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.160 align:middle line:84%
So this is all a time-based way
to calculate and measure time,

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.230 align:middle line:90%
as well, not just property.

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.210 align:middle line:84%
So from one point to the next
there can be various folklore

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.320 align:middle line:84%
and mythology associated
with each place,

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.612 align:middle line:84%
like at the Tower of the
Winds in Athens, for instance.

00:03:45.612 --> 00:03:46.411 align:middle line:90%
That's--

00:03:46.411 --> 00:03:48.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going there,
one of our first stops.

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:49.860 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Right.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And that had deities or gods
assigned to each direction that

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.290 align:middle line:90%
was associated.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And those directions had
thematic and folklore

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.420 align:middle line:84%
and stories oriented
to that God.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did it
have any orientation

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.080 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what we
would call magnetic,

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.580 align:middle line:84%
such as more an orientation
toward the true North,

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:12.380 align:middle line:90%
for example?

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.180 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Right.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, at first
there's a difference

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.978 align:middle line:84%
between the magnetic
pole and the Pole Star.

00:04:18.978 --> 00:04:20.269 align:middle line:90%
They're in different positions.

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.640 align:middle line:84%
So at first it was more
common to use the Pole Star.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.940 align:middle line:84%
Or in some cases you even
see the Catholic Church,

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:26.740 align:middle line:90%
for instance.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of their
churches aligned it

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.150 align:middle line:84%
with the equinox, which
is a little bit off

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.000 align:middle line:90%
of 90 degrees true north.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.260 align:middle line:90%
But it's very close.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And they might not have
even known the difference.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.780 align:middle line:84%
I can measure it with Google
Earth now, so I can tell.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:41.900 align:middle line:90%
But yeah.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.960 align:middle line:84%
Generally at first they
used the Pole Star.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.550 align:middle line:84%
The Great Pyramid is oriented
towards the Pole Star.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.720 align:middle line:84%
The Tower of the Winds in
Athens, many of the cathedrals

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.470 align:middle line:90%
are oriented that way.

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.670 align:middle line:90%
And that's just easier to do.

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.280 align:middle line:90%
You can just do a line of sight.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.290 align:middle line:84%
So when the compass
was developed later,

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.620 align:middle line:84%
they learned the difference
between the declamation

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.930 align:middle line:84%
between the Pole Star
and the magnetic pole

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.360 align:middle line:84%
to adjust for navigation
and things like that.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.270 align:middle line:84%
So no, at first, the
compass wasn't as important.

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.560 align:middle line:84%
They relied on
looking at the stars

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.040 align:middle line:84%
and comparing the angles and
positions of celestial bodies

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.440 align:middle line:90%
to fix their position.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.740 align:middle line:90%
So this is before the compass.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.370 align:middle line:84%
And that helped them
later, obviously,

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.260 align:middle line:84%
to navigate between one
point to the other as well.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is there another
overlay to it perhaps?

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.300 align:middle line:84%
If we're looking
at knowledge that

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.120 align:middle line:84%
is even thought
to have come down

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.430 align:middle line:84%
from ancient, ancient
Atlantian times

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.220 align:middle line:84%
in through Egyptian,
Sumerian, and other times.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.220 align:middle line:84%
What comes to my mind is
you're now looking at a more

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.470 align:middle line:90%
cosmic alignment, as well.

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And you're also--
taking the Piri Reis

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.680 align:middle line:90%
map is just one example.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.960 align:middle line:90%
There was an overview.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.180 align:middle line:84%
Information was
gotten from above.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:08.420 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have to navigate
by sight or compass, right?

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:09.220 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: No, No.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There was
knowledge passed on that

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:11.570 align:middle line:90%
was universal in nature.

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:12.370 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Right.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:13.600 align:middle line:90%
They could do that.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And there's all kinds of
like, the Egyptians used

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:20.240 align:middle line:84%
to actually reorient their
agricultural field using

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.610 align:middle line:90%
monuments.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.070 align:middle line:84%
There's a class of
[INAUDIBLE], or priests,

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.240 align:middle line:84%
that specifically
learned how to do that.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that this
is the way it probably

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.110 align:middle line:90%
developed first.

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.320 align:middle line:84%
We need to just define that
this is oak or this is corn,

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.740 align:middle line:90%
and do the same thing each year.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is a very simple
representation of using this.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: And you can see a
lot of spiritual overtones

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:41.160 align:middle line:90%
in that, too.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:41.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.335 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: So it
developed together.

00:06:43.335 --> 00:06:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it's only
in the modern age

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.750 align:middle line:84%
that we see a strict separation
of the way people view it.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And then there's still the
tradition and all the folklore

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.080 align:middle line:84%
there that people still value,
that kind of shaped our history

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.770 align:middle line:90%
in a lot of strange ways.

00:06:58.770 --> 00:06:59.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.940 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: I found out.

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like I said,
epiphany after epiphany

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:05.070 align:middle line:90%
reading your book.

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:05.960 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.207 align:middle line:84%
So you just brought up
local lore and legend.

00:07:08.207 --> 00:07:10.040 align:middle line:84%
So let's throw another
big one on the table,

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.240 align:middle line:84%
because somehow it'll
intersect down the road.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.330 align:middle line:84%
And that is the search
for the Holy Grail.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:20.070 align:middle line:84%
How do the axis mundi and
the search for the Holy Grail

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:20.870 align:middle line:90%
intersect?

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:22.700 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: Well, that's
a good question.

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:27.030 align:middle line:84%
What I've seen over time is that
this technique was used to hide

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:31.640 align:middle line:84%
or even suggest that
something was hidden.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And you only see a
certain class of people.

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:36.900 align:middle line:84%
As I said, it was used to
legally describe property

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:37.700 align:middle line:90%
at first.

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.320 align:middle line:90%
So royal interests.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And you can kind of see a
family tradition evolving.

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And then over time, different
branches of the royal groups

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:51.130 align:middle line:84%
seem to be privy to this or have
the skills to do it at a time

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:53.690 align:middle line:84%
when the average
person couldn't.

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:56.540 align:middle line:84%
And then after
more time went by,

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:59.100 align:middle line:84%
you see secret societies
and other groups

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:01.090 align:middle line:90%
like that doing it as well.

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:03.570 align:middle line:84%
So the search for
the Holy Grail is

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:06.600 align:middle line:84%
one of these kind of
quest legends that we see,

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:10.880 align:middle line:84%
I believe, developing from the
man in the mountain mythology

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.750 align:middle line:84%
that we see Charlemagne
being involved in.

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:15.540 align:middle line:90%
I believe he created a mystery--

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:18.255 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Explain the man in the
mountain mystery, or mythology.

00:08:18.255 --> 00:08:19.055 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Right.

00:08:19.055 --> 00:08:23.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is one of the tenets
even that Rosicrucian's value.

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:26.310 align:middle line:84%
You know, Christian
Rosenkreuz was

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:28.370 align:middle line:84%
interred in the mountain
with information

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:30.580 align:middle line:84%
that people are
supposed to quest for.

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.590 align:middle line:84%
So just even a little
bit before that,

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:36.980 align:middle line:84%
Charlemagne created the
same kind of mystery

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:38.500 align:middle line:90%
with his remains.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see that
time after time.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.539 align:middle line:84%
There's kind of a
funerary overlay

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:46.250 align:middle line:84%
to the origins of the modern
form of this that we're seeing.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And that it always involves the
search for a certain set relic.

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:53.730 align:middle line:84%
And that echoes
back to Egypt, too,

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:55.780 align:middle line:84%
because when Horus
was dismembered,

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:58.410 align:middle line:84%
his body parts were
in different temples.

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And people would make
pilgrimages to each place.

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:03.826 align:middle line:84%
So the Holy Grail
is like that too.

00:09:03.826 --> 00:09:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is one
of the things you

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:09.200 align:middle line:84%
can see that maybe this was
developed as a way to legally

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.730 align:middle line:90%
describe property, as I say.

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:12.790 align:middle line:84%
But people were smart
enough they realized

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:16.450 align:middle line:84%
they could use it to hide things
because the public at large

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:18.970 align:middle line:84%
wasn't aware of the
techniques that they

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:20.510 align:middle line:90%
needed to know to find it.

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:23.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: At the same time,
as I mentioned in the open,

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:27.350 align:middle line:84%
it also left information
hiding in plain sight

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:30.430 align:middle line:84%
for anyone with eyes to
see throughout history.

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:31.470 align:middle line:90%
Long periods of history.

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:32.270 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: True.

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And that takes some
development and study.

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:38.420 align:middle line:84%
It's taken me eight years
to get to the point I'm at.

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:41.610 align:middle line:84%
And you can see, I think,
some of these family groups

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:45.340 align:middle line:84%
actually being
prompted or being given

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.910 align:middle line:84%
some of the basic information
that they would need

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:49.261 align:middle line:90%
to go to one of these places.

00:09:49.261 --> 00:09:51.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As part of the
family lineage and knowledge.

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:52.310 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Yes.

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:53.530 align:middle line:90%
And figure out what it meant.

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:56.740 align:middle line:84%
And that ties also to the
legal description of property,

00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:01.540 align:middle line:84%
because as you see the
political winds of change

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:04.580 align:middle line:84%
go on in new places being
settled by Europeans,

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:06.920 align:middle line:84%
you can see the
same families that

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.730 align:middle line:84%
were involved in it in the old
world coming to the New World

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:11.729 align:middle line:84%
and doing it, which we'll
talk more about later.

00:10:11.729 --> 00:10:12.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, we will.

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:13.540 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:15.110 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking
about generally--

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:17.690 align:middle line:84%
most of what you're talking
about is an octagonal form.

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:22.390 align:middle line:84%
However, you say that
maybe some of the earlier

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:26.980 align:middle line:84%
sacred spaces and temples, they
were using hexagonal forms.

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And was there in
general a turning away

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:36.010 align:middle line:84%
from the hexagonal
form to the octagonal?

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:38.410 align:middle line:84%
Or were they simultaneous
around the planet

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:40.030 align:middle line:90%
in their development?

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:43.570 align:middle line:84%
Cause they're each very
different in what they project.

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:46.920 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: I think to some
degree, the hexagonal one

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:50.700 align:middle line:84%
you could generalize and say
it's more ancient pagan phase.

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.390 align:middle line:84%
And that also jives
with the Zodiac,

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:54.670 align:middle line:90%
the 12 points of the hexagon.

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:55.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:59.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: So that was a big part
of Sumerian faith and other

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.850 align:middle line:90%
cultures as well.

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
the octagon, you

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:08.130 align:middle line:84%
do see it having its origins
in Sumeria, and a value of it

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:12.540 align:middle line:84%
progressing through
kind of a female value.

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And then we see the Christians
adapting the octagon

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:19.240 align:middle line:84%
as their axis shape,
which even extends

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.550 align:middle line:84%
to the Knights
[INAUDIBLE], or the Knights

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:26.480 align:middle line:84%
of Malta, who even value the
beatitudes from the Bible,

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.230 align:middle line:90%
of which there are eight.

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:32.895 align:middle line:84%
And they even talk-- their
organizational structure

00:11:32.895 --> 00:11:38.290 align:middle line:84%
is split up into linguas,
which the Languedoc is

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:39.650 align:middle line:90%
the language of eight.

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:40.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Um hm.

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:41.320 align:middle line:90%
Languedoc.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.260 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Yes, exactly.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:43.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: France.

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:46.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: So that shape
and form, I believe,

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:49.610 align:middle line:84%
the first really
identifiable value of it

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:53.140 align:middle line:84%
does coincide with
Constantine in the adaptation

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:55.130 align:middle line:90%
of Christianity.

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know his
pagan beliefs too.

00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:58.860 align:middle line:90%
We know he was--

00:11:58.860 --> 00:11:59.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mithras.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.600 align:middle line:90%
He was a follower of Mithras.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: And I think
some Coptic beliefs,

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:08.690 align:middle line:84%
I would guess just from the
iconography you see in his

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:12.390 align:middle line:84%
architecture includes the
gnostic cross or the Ankh

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:17.680 align:middle line:84%
symbol that's referring to
kind of a Ptolemaic Greek view

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.265 align:middle line:90%
of Christianity, which--

00:12:19.265 --> 00:12:20.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Passed
down from Egypt.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:21.440 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Yeah.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:24.520 align:middle line:84%
It's basically Rosicrucianism,
and early form of it.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:27.530 align:middle line:84%
And Eastern Orthodox faith
has a lot more tenets

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:30.950 align:middle line:90%
of that than the Latin Church.

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:32.840 align:middle line:90%
So we'll see that progressing.

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:37.410 align:middle line:84%
And I think he had some
secret Coptic beliefs.

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And that he built these
octagonal structures,

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:44.590 align:middle line:84%
he built the Daphne
in Constantinople.

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:47.650 align:middle line:84%
He built the Domas Aria,
which was a copy of the Domas

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:50.910 align:middle line:90%
Aria of Nero in Antioch.

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And then I believe
Constantine built

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:55.370 align:middle line:90%
the original dome of the rock.

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:56.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:57.460 align:middle line:90%
We're going to go there too.

00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:01.390 align:middle line:84%
This is to me, it gets
really juicy at that point.

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:02.910 align:middle line:90%
Again, octagonal structures.

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:05.130 align:middle line:84%
Now the way you have
it in your book,

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:07.340 align:middle line:84%
you have some graphics
laid out where

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:11.170 align:middle line:84%
you see an octagonal structure,
one of them that you speak of.

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And then you see the
lines spinning off

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:15.050 align:middle line:90%
from each of the corners.

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:16.420 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Mm hm.

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:22.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If we were to look at
them dotted around the planet,

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.230 align:middle line:84%
would you see the lines often
going in the same directions?

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:26.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Yes.

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:27.600 align:middle line:84%
You see some of
them intersecting

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:31.900 align:middle line:84%
and additional axes
being built there.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.150 align:middle line:84%
For my information,
or my research,

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:38.880 align:middle line:84%
it seems like the optimal place
to build a structure of respect

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.495 align:middle line:84%
to the central axis is
along one of the rays

00:13:41.495 --> 00:13:45.110 align:middle line:84%
or arcs on the globe that
extend from the central axis,

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:48.290 align:middle line:84%
as suggested by the
hexagon or the octagon.

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:50.660 align:middle line:84%
But if a place
happens to develop

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:54.810 align:middle line:84%
as a colony or a valued place
that isn't in that context,

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:59.180 align:middle line:84%
then you build a temple that
does point to the central axis.

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And then that there
is a new axis.

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:04.060 align:middle line:84%
Sooner or later you will
have four or five of these.

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And you'll have a map that
with relative accuracy,

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.460 align:middle line:84%
even by today's
standards, will show you

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:11.450 align:middle line:90%
the positions of these things.

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:14.381 align:middle line:84%
And then from these you
can each map in the streets

00:14:14.381 --> 00:14:15.380 align:middle line:90%
and the smaller details.

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:16.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
have mapped this out?

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:17.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Yes.

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.530 align:middle line:90%
To some degree on Google Earth.

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:20.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:21.705 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: Which is
accurate enough.

00:14:21.705 --> 00:14:24.920 align:middle line:84%
I will say that really
all of this conforms

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:27.470 align:middle line:84%
to the technology
available at the time.

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:29.840 align:middle line:84%
None of it is as
accurate as Google Earth.

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And some of them are a few
hundreds of a degree off.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.320 align:middle line:90%
Or a mile from it.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:39.420 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of analyze based
on who built the structure,

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:42.040 align:middle line:84%
the philosophies involved,
and you look for connections

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:44.060 align:middle line:90%
then once you see a--

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:46.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, considering
during those times

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:48.817 align:middle line:84%
theoretically there
were not aerial views,

00:14:48.817 --> 00:14:50.150 align:middle line:90%
you know, it was quite accurate.

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.970 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: It was all imagined.

00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:53.260 align:middle line:84%
It's just like in Nazca,
we see people building

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.370 align:middle line:90%
huge shapes on the ground.

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And all the speculation
that goes with that.

00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:59.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean technically
you can do that

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.830 align:middle line:84%
with by driving a
rod in the ground

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:06.070 align:middle line:84%
and having a knotted rope, a
scale, and a scale drawing.

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:06.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:08.650 align:middle line:84%
In this confusing
time in history

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:10.940 align:middle line:84%
where we're trying to
put pieces together,

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:15.850 align:middle line:84%
you have to look at historically
if you go down the ET hole,

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:17.260 align:middle line:90%
whatever an ET might be.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.700 align:middle line:84%
I know that's even
being re-described now.

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:22.130 align:middle line:90%
You have flight.

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:25.120 align:middle line:84%
We've had flight theoretically
since the beginning of Earth.

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:29.150 align:middle line:84%
There have been means
of visitors or whomever

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:31.540 align:middle line:90%
coming in via flight.

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:34.320 align:middle line:84%
So that's one area
you can look at.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:37.370 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes we tend to
poke out into those theories

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:41.450 align:middle line:84%
before we even examine what was
possible with super intelligent

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:42.990 align:middle line:90%
beings here on the ground.

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:45.270 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of
terrestrial knowledge as well.

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:46.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: I agree.

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:49.961 align:middle line:84%
It's taken me a while
to be more open-minded,

00:15:49.961 --> 00:15:51.585 align:middle line:84%
because when I first
started, I wasn't.

00:15:51.585 --> 00:15:52.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:53.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: But the more
you get into it,

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:54.830 align:middle line:90%
I learned to accept it.

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:55.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You have to be.

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:56.445 align:middle line:90%
It's a hodgepodge.

00:15:56.445 --> 00:15:58.970 align:middle line:84%
You know, you start the
book out with a quotation,

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:02.030 align:middle line:84%
a very beautiful quotation
from Francis Bacon.

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:05.150 align:middle line:84%
And he's saying--
part of it was stating

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:09.770 align:middle line:84%
that he was "laying a foundation
in the human understanding

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:14.520 align:middle line:84%
for a holy temple after
the model of the world."

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:16.394 align:middle line:84%
So now that's kind
of at the axis

00:16:16.394 --> 00:16:17.560 align:middle line:90%
of what we're talking about.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.280 align:middle line:90%
Explain what that means to us?

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: Well, I think on a
really base level he's talking

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:23.900 align:middle line:90%
about defining the globe.

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.770 align:middle line:90%
You know, in an accurate manner.

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:28.030 align:middle line:84%
People had supposed
this long before him.

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Even the Egyptians
had forms of globes

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.220 align:middle line:84%
that weren't terribly
accurate, because they

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:37.030 align:middle line:84%
hadn't seen the entire world--
as far as we know, anyway.

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:38.550 align:middle line:84%
But that's what
he's trying to do.

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of the
philosophical and spiritual

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:43.600 align:middle line:84%
parts of it obviously
with Francis Bacon

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.970 align:middle line:84%
would be part of what
he's talking about, tying

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:50.930 align:middle line:84%
into the new Atlantis
concept that he came up with,

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:52.320 align:middle line:90%
and all of that.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And what he's saying
too is that he's

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:58.340 align:middle line:84%
going to show you what he's
talking about in the buildings,

00:16:58.340 --> 00:16:59.700 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:02.580 align:middle line:84%
It's not just a random--
but where it is, what it is,

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:07.770 align:middle line:84%
it all means something in
relation to a larger whole.

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:09.950 align:middle line:84%
And some of the things
you see about him knowing

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:12.700 align:middle line:84%
more ancient esoteric
knowledge and things like that

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:16.400 align:middle line:84%
might have been part of
the secret part of it.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.420 align:middle line:84%
Really what I think
is these people

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:21.289 align:middle line:84%
are compelling you
to learn something.

00:17:21.289 --> 00:17:22.089 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:22.089 --> 00:17:22.780 align:middle line:90%
Very much so.

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:24.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: It's not
just a treasure.

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:25.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean all the
treasure myths that

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:27.129 align:middle line:90%
are associated with these--

00:17:27.129 --> 00:17:28.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It may
not be pots of gold.

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:29.170 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: At all.

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:31.210 align:middle line:84%
Or later, people may
have hidden something,

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:33.190 align:middle line:90%
as I suggested before.

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:35.050 align:middle line:84%
But really if you
go through this,

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:39.230 align:middle line:84%
you're going to learn about
specific parts of the history

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:42.090 align:middle line:84%
where this temple is,
the people involved.

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:44.760 align:middle line:84%
It will expose hidden
truths that you wouldn't

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:47.450 align:middle line:90%
believe were there before.

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:51.940 align:middle line:84%
The true nature of the United
States and Europe and Royalty

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:54.480 align:middle line:84%
and people that you read
about your whole life

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:58.350 align:middle line:84%
that you wouldn't have a clue
as to what was really going on,

00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:02.600 align:middle line:84%
unless you became familiar
with these concepts.

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:03.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.150 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:08.360 align:middle line:84%
We're going to start moving
around to some of these places.

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:11.980 align:middle line:84%
Because we could go down
any number of streets

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:16.350 align:middle line:84%
in this conversation, right down
to why only certain people seem

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:18.860 align:middle line:84%
to have had or possessed
knowledge aside

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:20.840 align:middle line:84%
from the normal kind
of sequestering of it

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.600 align:middle line:90%
for whatever their reasons were.

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean that's
interesting in itself.

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:25.480 align:middle line:84%
There have always
been the masses.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.021 align:middle line:84%
And then there have
always been those

00:18:27.021 --> 00:18:28.240 align:middle line:90%
who are not of the masses.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And if you believe
in reincarnation,

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:33.370 align:middle line:84%
I think we've even slipped
back and forth ourself

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:35.220 align:middle line:84%
and blurred those
lines as souls.

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:37.830 align:middle line:84%
So we've experienced the
gamut of these things,

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:41.210 align:middle line:84%
and contain that knowledge
with within us, which takes you

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:44.340 align:middle line:84%
to a whole new
area of exploration

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:46.870 align:middle line:84%
when you're looking at
all of this too, I find.

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:47.670 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Right.

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:50.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's start
with the Great Pyramid

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:52.680 align:middle line:84%
and the International
Peace Arch.

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:53.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: OK.

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.420 align:middle line:84%
Or the International
Peace Garden.

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:56.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Garden.

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:57.840 align:middle line:90%
Peace Garden.

00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:59.950 align:middle line:10%
>>CORT: Both the Peace
Arch and the Peace Garden

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:03.030 align:middle line:10%
are on the border of the
United States and Canada.

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:04.630 align:middle line:84%
The Peace Arch
was actually built

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:07.170 align:middle line:84%
by a descendant of
George Washington's,

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:08.550 align:middle line:90%
which we'll get into that more.

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:08.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.710 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get into
all these families.

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:12.440 align:middle line:84%
Their second part
of our story is

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:13.800 align:middle line:90%
going to come to the Americas.

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:14.210 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Right.

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And he also built
the Stonehenge,

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:19.970 align:middle line:84%
which is interesting relating
back to the more ancient form.

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:23.420 align:middle line:84%
But at the pyramid, the pyramid
could be used as an axis.

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:25.620 align:middle line:84%
But as I studied
Egypt more, I came

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:28.855 align:middle line:84%
to believe that Heliopolis
was the actual temple

00:19:28.855 --> 00:19:31.390 align:middle line:90%
of axis mundi.

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:32.190 align:middle line:90%


00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:33.410 align:middle line:90%
I have a saying in the book.

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:37.120 align:middle line:84%
I say, "It's templars using
templets to create templum

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:38.760 align:middle line:90%
to create the temple fabric.

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.990 align:middle line:84%
So that's just a good
example using the Templars,

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:43.460 align:middle line:90%
because it involves their name.

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:45.370 align:middle line:84%
But I think that's
what they're doing.

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:51.530 align:middle line:84%
We're looking really at a people
who define time and space.

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:53.410 align:middle line:90%
You know, it sounds silly.

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:55.860 align:middle line:84%
They're just mapping from
a practical perspective.

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:58.450 align:middle line:84%
But from all of the
other overtones of it,

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:01.100 align:middle line:84%
that's the whole entire
world, like Francis Bacon

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:05.280 align:middle line:84%
was referring to about
how he would map that out.

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:08.740 align:middle line:84%
So even the philosophy and
this faith and spirituality

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:11.900 align:middle line:84%
that goes with it all is
controlled along with the time

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:13.200 align:middle line:90%
and space, I believe.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And space
being critical

00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:19.250 align:middle line:84%
in that all of these ancient
traditions saw the Earth

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:22.540 align:middle line:84%
is simply a point within
the cosmos of part

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:25.910 align:middle line:84%
of a much larger
fabric of not only time

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:29.710 align:middle line:84%
and space and orientation,
ancient civilizations

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:33.160 align:middle line:90%
and societies and such.

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:38.550 align:middle line:84%
So to me, I look at it and
it becomes more dimensional

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:41.450 align:middle line:84%
as you start inviting the cosmic
information, of which Francis

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:42.740 align:middle line:90%
Bacon was well aware of.

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:43.634 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: It was
three dimensional.

00:20:43.634 --> 00:20:44.470 align:middle line:90%
It 's a three dimensions--

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:46.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Three-- I don't
even know how many dimensions.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:47.826 align:middle line:84%
But certainly three
dimensions if you're

00:20:47.826 --> 00:20:48.930 align:middle line:90%
looking at it as a map.

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:51.820 align:middle line:84%
You also have space
included in that.

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And so how do the Great Pyramid
and the International Peace

00:20:57.980 --> 00:20:59.770 align:middle line:90%
Garden correlate?

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:00.570 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: OK.

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:04.710 align:middle line:84%
Those two sites do not point
to each other or anything.

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:07.290 align:middle line:84%
But the Great Pyramid
itself is very interesting,

00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:11.930 align:middle line:84%
because it points to
Serpent Mound in Ohio,

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:15.610 align:middle line:84%
a Native American site that's
very interesting that has

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:17.620 align:middle line:90%
some of the same overtones.

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:20.920 align:middle line:84%
And then if you go to
the Newark Earthworks,

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:23.180 align:middle line:84%
also in Ohio, a
little farther north

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:25.970 align:middle line:84%
there's an even
octagonal part of it

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:28.030 align:middle line:84%
of the circle and a
corridor connecting

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:31.150 align:middle line:84%
the two features of
earthworks there that point

00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:32.524 align:middle line:90%
to the Great Pyramid.

00:21:32.524 --> 00:21:33.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.356 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: In it we're
seeing two relations, even

00:21:35.356 --> 00:21:38.790 align:middle line:84%
with Native American,
North American groups.

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:42.230 align:middle line:84%
And that suggests you know,
was there intervention?

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:46.480 align:middle line:84%
Or did the Native Americans
possess these skills

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:47.850 align:middle line:90%
themselves?

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's a theme we see
through the invasion of Mexico

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.330 align:middle line:90%
by Cortez.

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:54.460 align:middle line:84%
He happens to show up on
a day that was predicted

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:55.080 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, the Native
Americans aren't the natives.

00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:59.154 align:middle line:84%
There were civilizations
many, many thousands of years

00:21:59.154 --> 00:22:00.945 align:middle line:84%
prior to what we call
the Native Americans.

00:22:00.945 --> 00:22:01.270 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Sure.

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:01.730 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:02.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I mean this goes--

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:03.103 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:22:03.103 --> 00:22:05.450 align:middle line:90%


00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:06.310 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Yes.

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:08.580 align:middle line:84%
And that had a huge
psychological effect

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:11.811 align:middle line:84%
on the Spanish and early
explorers of North America,

00:22:11.811 --> 00:22:13.310 align:middle line:84%
because they might
have been members

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:16.290 align:middle line:84%
of the secret sect
that value this

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:18.030 align:middle line:90%
in a clandestine way in Europe.

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:19.879 align:middle line:84%
And they come to
North America and--

00:22:19.879 --> 00:22:20.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And figure, hm.

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:21.790 align:middle line:90%
How did it end up here?

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:23.373 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: Or what are
these people doing

00:22:23.373 --> 00:22:25.000 align:middle line:90%
with our secret information?

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.890 align:middle line:90%
So it had some blowback.

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:29.680 align:middle line:84%
Whatever happened years ago
caused them some problems.

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.440 align:middle line:84%
I think that happened
in Mexico a lot.

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
the result of that,

00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:38.590 align:middle line:84%
they even made the Montezuma
family knights of Santiago

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:41.060 align:middle line:90%
and nobility in Spain.

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:42.784 align:middle line:84%
So that's an
interesting aspect too.

00:22:42.784 --> 00:22:43.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:44.520 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Yes.

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:45.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
we're going to get

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.770 align:middle line:84%
to the community to Santiago
as well, a little bit later.

00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:49.240 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm saying
is, that's why

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:52.780 align:middle line:84%
it was kind of hard
to do this, because so

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:55.990 align:middle line:84%
many different things seem to
appear to be interconnected.

00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:58.170 align:middle line:90%
More than I had even dreamed of.

00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:00.460 align:middle line:84%
But let's go back to the
Peace Garden for a moment,

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:03.050 align:middle line:84%
because that was
originally-- you

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:07.050 align:middle line:84%
say that might have been one
of the-- how did you state it?

00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:09.830 align:middle line:84%
The earliest points of
northern orientation

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:11.510 align:middle line:90%
from which to map America.

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:12.540 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Sure.

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:17.420 align:middle line:84%
I think some entity claimed
a large region from there.

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:21.970 align:middle line:84%
And certainly later, even
the Hudson Bay Company

00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:25.980 align:middle line:84%
used the same point
to define their land.

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:27.480 align:middle line:84%
And this will go
all the way back

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:31.840 align:middle line:84%
to Frederick II, Holy
Roman Emperor, who

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:34.990 align:middle line:84%
I believe was the person
that made points of claim

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:39.330 align:middle line:84%
at Oak Island, the
Newport Tower, possibly

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:42.710 align:middle line:84%
Jamestown, and the
International Peace Garden.

00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:46.050 align:middle line:84%
And you even see through time
his descendants maintaining

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:48.957 align:middle line:90%
control of these claims.

00:23:48.957 --> 00:23:51.290 align:middle line:84%
Even though they're English,
they're different countries

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:52.180 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:54.636 align:middle line:90%
It does go through all of that.

00:23:54.636 --> 00:23:56.260 align:middle line:84%
But the International
Peace Garden just

00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:58.246 align:middle line:90%
does conform to this tradition.

00:23:58.246 --> 00:24:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen through
the work of Scott Walter,

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:04.100 align:middle line:84%
it points to the
Kensington runestone.

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:04.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:06.100 align:middle line:90%
Now that's interesting.

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:08.470 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: So that's suggestive
of the date range.

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:11.520 align:middle line:84%
He's even given that as--
I'm saying it's just a little

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:12.540 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:15.710 align:middle line:84%
But the stone-- often
the stones or the towers,

00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:18.890 align:middle line:84%
are magdalas I even call
them-- sacred towers--

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:21.360 align:middle line:90%
are placed later in the actual--

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:22.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: --time of claim.

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:23.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:26.530 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: Great they might
mark it with a stone cairn

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:28.030 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:30.360 align:middle line:84%
And then you can
see their ancestors

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:33.290 align:middle line:84%
coming in later and
building the monuments.

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:35.940 align:middle line:84%
So many monuments
are built later

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:38.720 align:middle line:84%
to actually commemorate
something that they don't even

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:39.520 align:middle line:90%
tell you about.

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:40.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:42.450 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: And there
may be a hidden hit

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:44.280 align:middle line:84%
in the monument
in an inscription

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:45.280 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:48.840 align:middle line:84%
Or they may point to something
that will tell you the truth.

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:51.610 align:middle line:84%
So you have to go through
a little initiation

00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:55.650 align:middle line:84%
and processing of information
to try to get to the truth.

00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And there's often ways you
can prove you are right,

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:01.140 align:middle line:84%
because the same families were
involved, the same concepts.

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:01.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:02.671 align:middle line:90%
The same names keep showing up.

00:25:02.671 --> 00:25:04.680 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get into
some of that, as well.

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And in a minute, we're going
to get on to Constantine.

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:09.970 align:middle line:84%
I was wondering
if there might not

00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:14.340 align:middle line:84%
be ley line influences as
well, where these places are

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:16.820 align:middle line:90%
claimed or constructed.

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:19.180 align:middle line:84%
What comes to mind
right off is just more

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:21.470 align:middle line:84%
of a feeling of the
International Peace Garden.

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:24.140 align:middle line:90%
This place feels different.

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:25.456 align:middle line:90%
I love going there.

00:25:25.456 --> 00:25:27.330 align:middle line:84%
I love getting out of
my car when I'm waiting

00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:29.770 align:middle line:90%
to go through immigration.

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:31.930 align:middle line:10%
To be in that spot,
there's something

00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:34.210 align:middle line:10%
when you drive
into that spot that

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:36.600 align:middle line:10%
just opens up like a blossom.

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And I'm wondering, is it ley
lines passing through there

00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:40.040 align:middle line:90%
as well perhaps?

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:42.415 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: Well, I'm jealous,
because I've never been there,

00:25:42.415 --> 00:25:44.270 align:middle line:84%
even though I've written
about it so much.

00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:46.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I love
passing through every time.

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:47.506 align:middle line:90%
I've gone there quite a bit.

00:25:47.506 --> 00:25:49.201 align:middle line:90%
And I love that spot.

00:25:49.201 --> 00:25:50.450 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: I can understand that.

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:53.680 align:middle line:84%
Really what's interesting
about the Peace Garden

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:58.870 align:middle line:84%
is the Peace Temple in Rome
was built by Emperor Vespasian

00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:02.870 align:middle line:84%
about just after the sacking
of the temple in Jerusalem.

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:05.630 align:middle line:84%
So the actual treasure from
the temple in Jerusalem

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:09.570 align:middle line:84%
was displayed at the
Peace Garden in Rome.

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And the Peace Garden, along with
the Forum of Augustus, Julius

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:17.050 align:middle line:84%
Caesar, and Trajan,
forms a linear park

00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:19.360 align:middle line:84%
that's very much like
the International Peace

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:22.160 align:middle line:84%
Garden, which is
the modern evolution

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:24.400 align:middle line:90%
of the forums of Rome.

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:27.290 align:middle line:84%
There is even a feature in
the International Peace Garden

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:30.540 align:middle line:84%
that matches the Peace
Temple in plan view.

00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:32.610 align:middle line:90%
They reproduced.

00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:33.450 align:middle line:90%
So this--

00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:34.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Who's
responsible for that?

00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:37.220 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: These alignments point
to the International Peace

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:37.670 align:middle line:90%
Garden.

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:38.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:40.514 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: The Peace Temple
of Vespasian points

00:26:40.514 --> 00:26:41.930 align:middle line:84%
to the International
Peace Garden.

00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:45.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there is something
very special about that point.

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:45.900 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Right.

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:49.340 align:middle line:84%
I think in the most basic
level of interpretation there,

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:51.320 align:middle line:84%
you could assume that
the temple treasure

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:54.810 align:middle line:84%
is stored at the
International Peace Garden.

00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:57.100 align:middle line:84%
And now we're looking at
the movie National Treasure.

00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:57.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:01.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: And this system that
I have found I think maybe

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:04.640 align:middle line:84%
has something to do with
the true version of that.

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:07.620 align:middle line:84%
I think there is
something to that.

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:10.000 align:middle line:84%
And this is the way
you find it, I think.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm hoping.

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:12.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:16.190 align:middle line:84%
Now we have to go back to
the discussion to-- OK.

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:18.080 align:middle line:84%
Bring that up again
when we start getting

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:19.400 align:middle line:90%
into some of the American lore.

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:20.200 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
families and bloodlines.

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:22.520 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:25.709 align:middle line:84%
So now let's go to the Tower
of the Winds in Greece.

00:27:25.709 --> 00:27:27.125 align:middle line:84%
Because you start
your book there.

00:27:27.125 --> 00:27:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very
significant place.

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:31.580 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: It is very important.

00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:34.300 align:middle line:84%
It was built probably
in the first century

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:38.000 align:middle line:90%
by Andronicus of Cyrrhus.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And the Tower of
the Wind is just

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:42.540 align:middle line:90%
the archetype of what we see.

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:46.490 align:middle line:84%
It had a water clock in it that
allowed them to fix longitude.

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:50.360 align:middle line:84%
It had little apertures
in the east and west side

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:53.490 align:middle line:84%
so they could cite the
equinoxes, as well.

00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:56.660 align:middle line:84%
And it had a deity, or a god,
assigned to each direction

00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:59.140 align:middle line:90%
suggested by the octagon.

00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And here's one prime example--
Eric von Daniken cites,

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:06.310 align:middle line:84%
even though he's not in relation
to the Tower of the Winds,

00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:09.420 align:middle line:84%
he talks about Boreas,
how Apollo would

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:11.090 align:middle line:90%
visit the north every year.

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:14.370 align:middle line:84%
And this is indeed the North
God on the Tower of the Winds.

00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:17.000 align:middle line:84%
So there's probably
a similar mythology

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.670 align:middle line:84%
having to do with each of the
16 primary directions suggested

00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:24.200 align:middle line:84%
by the Tower of the
Winds in that way.

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And we do see the Tower
of the Winds points

00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:30.730 align:middle line:84%
to Avebury Circle in England,
which when I found that,

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:32.240 align:middle line:90%
I was just amazed.

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.300 align:middle line:84%
At first you don't
want to believe it.

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:35.510 align:middle line:90%
You know, one's Neolithic.

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:39.290 align:middle line:84%
One's more modern
classic Greece.

00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:43.090 align:middle line:84%
But both the structures seem
to have been constructed

00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:47.360 align:middle line:84%
for the same purpose-- to define
a temporal fabric, to observe

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:51.310 align:middle line:84%
the stars, and all the other
associated spiritual overtones,

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:52.120 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:55.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these
things were probably

00:28:55.670 --> 00:29:00.210 align:middle line:84%
sort of at first like
Avebury, like a nemeton,

00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:04.380 align:middle line:84%
druidic outdoor place of
worship, or a sacred grove.

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And even the Greeks
before developed

00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:08.120 align:middle line:84%
a thing called
the temenos, which

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:10.650 align:middle line:90%
is an outdoor temple as well.

00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:14.310 align:middle line:84%
So those aspects are
interesting as well.

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:16.960 align:middle line:84%
Later it became more
defined and more based

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.890 align:middle line:84%
on geometry as well in the
legal description of property.

00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:25.560 align:middle line:84%
But it's really possible
that all of these structures,

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:27.740 align:middle line:84%
the megalithic ones in
England, were even built

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:29.620 align:middle line:90%
for a very similar purpose.

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:31.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is it
possible-- I know

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:34.800 align:middle line:84%
at some point in the book
you even bring the term up--

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:38.820 align:middle line:84%
that these were utilized as
loosely termed stargates?

00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:39.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Yes.

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:42.040 align:middle line:84%
Really that kind
of leads to some

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:45.450 align:middle line:84%
of the possible
misinterpretations from the TV

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:47.870 align:middle line:90%
show Stargate and that concept.

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And I don't discount
that that's possible.

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:52.730 align:middle line:84%
But really when you're
observing the stars

00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:54.990 align:middle line:84%
and it's showing you and
teaching you what it is,

00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:58.400 align:middle line:84%
you could consider that
a stargate as well.

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.360 align:middle line:90%
It's opening gates for you.

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:03.540 align:middle line:84%
You're learning things you
would never have learned before.

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:05.170 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like
a mystery school.

00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:05.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:09.950 align:middle line:84%
And also the notion of, as
with any good mystery school,

00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:12.830 align:middle line:84%
of learning to allow
your mind to travel

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:14.800 align:middle line:90%
beyond time and space, i.e.

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:17.470 align:middle line:84%
remote viewing and other
such things, which are

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:20.020 align:middle line:84%
made more possible in
certain energy fields

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:21.900 align:middle line:90%
and among certain geometry.

00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:22.700 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Certainly.

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:25.450 align:middle line:10%
Well, even the ray
at the Vatican,

00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:28.230 align:middle line:10%
the obelisk in the windrows
markers, or the obelisk

00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:29.030 align:middle line:10%
originally.

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:32.410 align:middle line:84%
The windrows weren't
added until later.

00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:34.810 align:middle line:84%
The augurs, or a priesthood
of Rome-- and that's

00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:36.620 align:middle line:84%
what the priests
in Greece were also

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:41.630 align:middle line:84%
known as-- would interpret
the flight of the birds giving

00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:43.330 align:middle line:90%
directions as well.

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And that leads us to the
language of the birds.

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:46.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
flight of the birds.

00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:47.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Right.

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:48.500 align:middle line:84%
Exactly what you're
talking about.

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:49.958 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Having
an eagle eye view,

00:30:49.958 --> 00:30:52.790 align:middle line:84%
which is to be able to transcend
time and space with one's

00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:54.010 align:middle line:90%
own mind and see all.

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:54.500 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: From plain view.

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:54.855 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:30:54.855 --> 00:30:55.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Mm hm.

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:59.830 align:middle line:10%
So part of it is learning
to map your domain.

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:03.400 align:middle line:84%
You know, what you control
as a bird would see it.

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And also interpreting what the
bird's saying, because that's

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:10.390 align:middle line:84%
how you can learn to read the
metaphors and all the hidden

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:13.600 align:middle line:84%
signs that will lead you
to knowing that's true,

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:16.570 align:middle line:84%
but often making it very hard
to explain to other people who

00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:17.370 align:middle line:90%
aren't familiar.

00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:17.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:18.657 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:31:18.657 --> 00:31:21.115 align:middle line:84%
As you're saying that, what
I'm kind of seeing in my mind--

00:31:21.115 --> 00:31:24.240 align:middle line:84%
I tend to be rather visual
as I'm listening to people--

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:29.490 align:middle line:84%
is the notion that other domain
that you or your ancestors

00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:31.440 align:middle line:84%
have laid claim to,
so to speak, you

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:34.060 align:middle line:84%
have sovereignty
over that domain.

00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:38.700 align:middle line:84%
It would be very handy to have
either the ability yourself

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:41.770 align:middle line:84%
or access to the priests and
those who do have the ability

00:31:41.770 --> 00:31:45.820 align:middle line:84%
to be able to see
as the birds do over

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:51.450 align:middle line:84%
your domain for future action,
decisions, control in the worst

00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:52.950 align:middle line:90%
form of it.

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:55.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: Probably, often this
is where the rulers even

00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:57.050 align:middle line:90%
learned what it was.

00:31:57.050 --> 00:32:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And you see these priesthoods
are often composed

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:01.970 align:middle line:90%
of highly intelligent people.

00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:03.945 align:middle line:84%
And they would recruit
the brightest and best--

00:32:03.945 --> 00:32:04.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:06.153 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: --people they could get.

00:32:06.153 --> 00:32:07.900 align:middle line:84%
So these are just
early colleges, really.

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:08.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: And centers
of learning that even

00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:15.410 align:middle line:84%
went beyond what the rulers
could understand many times.

00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:18.740 align:middle line:84%
And you see sometimes the
priesthood holding sway

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:22.370 align:middle line:84%
and maybe having even more
influence in very hidden ways.

00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:23.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:24.000 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Which is interesting.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of what
we're getting to here.

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:27.037 align:middle line:90%
You can see what really happens.

00:32:27.037 --> 00:32:29.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, now we'll
go down that rabbit hole

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:29.680 align:middle line:90%
a little further.

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:32.040 align:middle line:84%
So the Egyptians had knowledge,
as you say in your book,

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:35.770 align:middle line:84%
of magnetite and lodestone,
as well in their history.

00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:38.330 align:middle line:84%
So they used these to
orient to true north.

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:41.569 align:middle line:84%
But there are other
implications of that knowledge.

00:32:41.569 --> 00:32:43.110 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
that a little bit?

00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:46.170 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: Well, they could have
made a compass using magnetite,

00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:47.260 align:middle line:90%
obviously.

00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:51.480 align:middle line:10%
And really, this would represent
just a huge economic advantage,

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:52.280 align:middle line:10%
because you--

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:54.160 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Long before
the compass was ever

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.720 align:middle line:10%
thought to have been
invented, for example.

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:58.220 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: There's a
lot of speculation

00:32:58.220 --> 00:32:59.750 align:middle line:90%
that it was around way before.

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:02.750 align:middle line:84%
It was even noted
cults of the Pole Star

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:06.200 align:middle line:84%
in Rome that they think
had compasses before.

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:09.690 align:middle line:84%
About 1,000 AD is the
generally accepted time frame.

00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:11.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So those are
useful on the ground.

00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:12.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Right.

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:14.570 align:middle line:84%
And as I was describing
before, these

00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:17.270 align:middle line:84%
temples you have
to take star logs.

00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
take enough readings

00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:23.330 align:middle line:84%
to be able to compare
them to each other.

00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:26.700 align:middle line:84%
So this is how land was
claimed even by Spain.

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:29.310 align:middle line:84%
The Dome of the Rock points
to the Solomon Islands,

00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:30.530 align:middle line:90%
for instance.

00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:30.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:31.770 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: On the Temple Mount.

00:33:31.770 --> 00:33:32.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: From the Temple Mount.

00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:33.640 align:middle line:84%
That's the name,
Solomon Islands.

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:34.440 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Right.

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:37.050 align:middle line:84%
So what the magnetic compass
would allow you to do

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:41.370 align:middle line:84%
is take the most direct route
from Alexandria to Rome,

00:33:41.370 --> 00:33:43.300 align:middle line:84%
and knowing the angle
using the compass,

00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:46.030 align:middle line:84%
because you know the angle of
the difference between the Pole

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:48.440 align:middle line:90%
Star and the magnetic pole.

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:50.520 align:middle line:84%
So if you know this
and your competition

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:54.495 align:middle line:84%
doesn't, you have a huge
business advantage, even.

00:33:54.495 --> 00:33:58.870 align:middle line:84%
That expediency, you know, you
can be the FedEx of the day,

00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:00.990 align:middle line:84%
and get it there
overnight or a lot quicker

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:03.870 align:middle line:90%
than your competition.

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:07.260 align:middle line:10%
This also allows you to just
take the Mediterranean basin,

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:09.219 align:middle line:10%
for example.

00:34:09.219 --> 00:34:13.280 align:middle line:84%
You could map the entire thing,
know where all the shoals are,

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:16.348 align:middle line:84%
shipwrecks or islands
are, and hidden places

00:34:16.348 --> 00:34:18.889 align:middle line:84%
that other people would have no
idea, because they would just

00:34:18.889 --> 00:34:21.620 align:middle line:84%
follow the currents or
the prevailing winds,

00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:24.380 align:middle line:84%
where you have the ability
to go any direction anywhere

00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:25.469 align:middle line:90%
you want.

00:34:25.469 --> 00:34:27.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you date this
back thousands and thousands

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:28.340 align:middle line:90%
of years?

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:29.140 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Yeah.

00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:32.570 align:middle line:84%
I think it could-- obviously
the Egyptians had it.

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:35.800 align:middle line:84%
Any kind of civilization
that possibly we

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:38.040 align:middle line:84%
don't know about
that Graham Hancock

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:41.719 align:middle line:84%
talks about and
other researchers.

00:34:41.719 --> 00:34:43.780 align:middle line:84%
They could have very
easily had those.

00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:46.909 align:middle line:84%
I think there's always an
element of highly intelligent

00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:48.400 align:middle line:90%
people that figure things out.

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:50.650 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter
of them getting it

00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:53.889 align:middle line:84%
into the public consciousness or
beyond the group of elite that

00:34:53.889 --> 00:34:57.280 align:middle line:84%
would want to control
whatever technology or ideas

00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:58.180 align:middle line:90%
they come up with.

00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And I really think during
this era of navigation,

00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:04.790 align:middle line:84%
you could compare
it to computers

00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:07.360 align:middle line:84%
or any other
technological advancement.

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:10.040 align:middle line:84%
If you can control that for
a significant amount of time

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:10.310 align:middle line:90%
before--

00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:11.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Big advantage.

00:35:11.090 --> 00:35:13.130 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: --it becomes
well known, then, yeah.

00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:15.336 align:middle line:84%
You're just that much
farther ahead of the curve.

00:35:15.336 --> 00:35:16.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
expansion of empires.

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.230 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: And then that, yeah.

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:21.050 align:middle line:84%
And that advantage just
becomes exponential now,

00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:23.350 align:middle line:84%
because then you're
going to dominate

00:35:23.350 --> 00:35:25.800 align:middle line:84%
all the other technology and
ideas that are happening.

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:27.740 align:middle line:90%
All the intelligent people.

00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:31.480 align:middle line:84%
They always seem to
promote, recruit,

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:33.670 align:middle line:84%
and look for all
the people that they

00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:37.020 align:middle line:84%
know are going to be able to
advance what their goals are.

00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:37.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:41.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: Well, this speaks to the
generational plans, I believe.

00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:43.250 align:middle line:90%
That families are involved in.

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:45.320 align:middle line:84%
And ever since
ancient times, they've

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:48.290 align:middle line:84%
had goals that have
lasted the whole time.

00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:53.500 align:middle line:84%
And part of these mystery
school structures and goings on

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:57.220 align:middle line:84%
are to help to teach the
newer family members.

00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:59.280 align:middle line:84%
Or if it ever becomes
unknown again,

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:03.110 align:middle line:84%
they'll have the capacity there
to go and figure out again

00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:05.590 align:middle line:90%
what was lost before.

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:08.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the concepts
like from the Pillars of Boaz

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:10.650 align:middle line:84%
and Jachin and
masonry and the Book

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:14.600 align:middle line:84%
of Enoch, where
they inscribed it

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:17.710 align:middle line:84%
with all the tenets of
science and mathematics

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:20.182 align:middle line:84%
so it would be preserved
through a catastrophe.

00:36:20.182 --> 00:36:22.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know, we
were talking off camera.

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of what we do and
other outlets as well falls

00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:34.820 align:middle line:84%
under the category of
conspiracy theory, which

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:40.720 align:middle line:84%
tends to paint various
subjects with the same color,

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:45.130 align:middle line:84%
the same kind of
motives, for example.

00:36:45.130 --> 00:36:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And I was saying to you off
camera that I can't do that

00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:51.380 align:middle line:84%
anymore, because it's far more
varied than that, textured

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:52.180 align:middle line:90%
than that.

00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And when we look at these
families passing down

00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:56.250 align:middle line:84%
this knowledge,
and always looking

00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:59.630 align:middle line:84%
for the most
intelligent to groom

00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:05.630 align:middle line:84%
to bring into the fold and
such, what is your view on all

00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:07.940 align:middle line:84%
of that after doing all
this research in terms

00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:10.250 align:middle line:90%
of toward what end?

00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:12.730 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get into
what their allegiances, what

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:16.100 align:middle line:84%
their maybe overarching
spiritual practices and such

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:17.554 align:middle line:90%
have been later.

00:37:17.554 --> 00:37:19.220 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: I think it
could relate to that.

00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:20.730 align:middle line:90%
Their spiritual practices.

00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:24.250 align:middle line:84%
But you definitely see them
using it to dominate commerce,

00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:27.786 align:middle line:90%
business, mining, railroads.

00:37:27.786 --> 00:37:28.600 align:middle line:90%
You name it.

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:31.070 align:middle line:90%
They control the Monopoly board.

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:32.630 align:middle line:90%
And they own all the utilities.

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:33.430 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:34.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Pretty much.

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:34.830 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Yeah.

00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:38.390 align:middle line:84%
That seems to be in Europe the
pattern ever since even Egypt,

00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:41.150 align:middle line:84%
that that has been one
of the goals of what

00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:45.960 align:middle line:84%
they're doing to maintain
just control over the economy.

00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And that as a
byproduct now, you have

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:52.390 align:middle line:84%
control over everything else--
the social mores, philosophy.

00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And then it seems like they even
tailor that to fit their goals.

00:37:57.310 --> 00:38:00.661 align:middle line:84%
We see how the media
is manipulated.

00:38:00.661 --> 00:38:03.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Pretty much everything
we can see in plain sight--

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:03.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: Strange things
hidden in movies and music.

00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:04.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --is manipulated.

00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:05.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Yeah.

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah

00:38:05.290 --> 00:38:06.248 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: It's all there.

00:38:06.248 --> 00:38:08.040 align:middle line:90%
These messages are there for us.

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And if you learn the
language of the birds,

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:13.450 align:middle line:84%
you can listen to a lot of
different music, or movies,

00:38:13.450 --> 00:38:16.820 align:middle line:84%
or watch a movie and interpret
it in a totally different way

00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:19.470 align:middle line:90%
that you know was meant to be.

00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:20.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:23.650 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: Jay Widener talks about
that a lot, and other people.

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:25.216 align:middle line:90%
It's definitely there.

00:38:25.216 --> 00:38:26.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I
mean, that's the kind

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:29.680 align:middle line:84%
of democracy of the
time is the ability

00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:31.440 align:middle line:84%
to have rapid access
to knowledge now

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:32.710 align:middle line:90%
that we didn't have before.

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:37.060 align:middle line:84%
Just like you can take
these incredible spots

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:41.732 align:middle line:84%
around the planet and
apply Google Earth to it.

00:38:41.732 --> 00:38:44.689 align:middle line:84%
A much more complex
portrait starts emerging.

00:38:44.689 --> 00:38:45.980 align:middle line:90%
So I mean, that's what I think.

00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:48.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's the
beauty of this time.

00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:51.270 align:middle line:84%
Pretty soon knowledge
can't be withheld.

00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:52.960 align:middle line:84%
It's all being made
available really.

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:53.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Right.

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:54.620 align:middle line:90%
And the internet's done that--

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:55.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To anyone
who cares to look.

00:38:55.450 --> 00:38:57.580 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: --to a large degree,
I would always compare it

00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:58.550 align:middle line:90%
to the printing press.

00:38:58.550 --> 00:39:01.870 align:middle line:84%
When the printing press
was invented, at that time,

00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:04.920 align:middle line:84%
that allowed even a
lot of gentry and kind

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:09.650 align:middle line:84%
of our upper crust of people
to read the Bible themselves

00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:12.030 align:middle line:84%
for the first time, or
interpret, whatever else.

00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:15.200 align:middle line:84%
Or even eventually start
writing their own books.

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:18.290 align:middle line:84%
So the internet is
just amazing that way.

00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:20.000 align:middle line:84%
You have to be
careful too and weed

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.814 align:middle line:90%
through what you see on there.

00:39:21.814 --> 00:39:22.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure you do.

00:39:22.730 --> 00:39:24.390 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: I couldn't have
done this without it.

00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:24.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:25.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Let's put it that way.

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:25.960 align:middle line:90%
I just couldn't.

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:28.085 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It doesn't change
the fact that you still

00:39:28.085 --> 00:39:32.530 align:middle line:84%
have a handful of individuals
that, you know, more or less

00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:35.220 align:middle line:90%
controlling every major system.

00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: Well, they
probably in my opinion

00:39:37.350 --> 00:39:41.420 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't have let the internet
happen if they didn't already

00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:43.850 align:middle line:90%
have something else figured out.

00:39:43.850 --> 00:39:45.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm hm.

00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:46.200 align:middle line:90%
But if seems that.

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:48.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: So you see them time
after time through history

00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:49.480 align:middle line:90%
doing that.

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:50.940 align:middle line:90%
Dominating technology.

00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:51.740 align:middle line:90%
Gunpowder.

00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:53.345 align:middle line:90%
Let's take some basic ones.

00:39:53.345 --> 00:39:57.330 align:middle line:84%
Nuclear energy, things like
that, where they probably

00:39:57.330 --> 00:40:00.610 align:middle line:84%
knew about it for a long time
before they actually used it.

00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:03.290 align:middle line:84%
Either that, or they
monopolize it entirely

00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:04.689 align:middle line:90%
so they can control it.

00:40:04.689 --> 00:40:06.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet
now knowledge can't

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:08.030 align:middle line:90%
be monopolized any longer.

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
are coming back around.

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:12.950 align:middle line:84%
I could just call these their
own ancient memories are being

00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:15.610 align:middle line:84%
reminded of what was
once known, and then

00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:18.200 align:middle line:84%
starting, like you,
to pull the threads.

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:20.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: And that even with
the internet takes time.

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:21.418 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it does.

00:40:21.418 --> 00:40:22.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: In some cases.

00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:23.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:24.300 align:middle line:90%
Constantine.

00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:25.400 align:middle line:90%
Let's get to Constantino.

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:27.660 align:middle line:84%
The Tower of the
Winds in Athens.

00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:30.120 align:middle line:84%
What is the cultural
root of what Constantine

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:33.030 align:middle line:90%
did with his octagons, as well?

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And let's just focus on
him for a little bit.

00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:37.510 align:middle line:84%
The key player that
he was in the day.

00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:38.310 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Sure.

00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:40.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How he
contributed to this story.

00:40:40.090 --> 00:40:40.890 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Certainly.

00:40:40.890 --> 00:40:43.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, we all know
that he is credited

00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:46.950 align:middle line:84%
with the creation of the
modern form of Christianity.

00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:48.380 align:middle line:90%
From the Council of Nicaea.

00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:49.325 align:middle line:90%
But if you examine--

00:40:49.325 --> 00:40:50.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But he
wasn't Christian.

00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:51.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Right.

00:40:51.330 --> 00:40:54.200 align:middle line:84%
If you examine the
structures-- that's argued.

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:55.670 align:middle line:84%
You know, a lot of
people say that.

00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:57.240 align:middle line:84%
But I think what
I'm trying to do

00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:59.699 align:middle line:84%
is give you some evidence here
that shows you you're right.

00:40:59.699 --> 00:41:00.498 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:00.498 --> 00:41:03.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: That it seems like he
was either a mithras follower.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.890 align:middle line:84%
Or even if he had
some Christian values,

00:41:04.890 --> 00:41:08.470 align:middle line:84%
they were more oriented
toward the gnostic gospels

00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:11.090 align:middle line:84%
and the Coptic kind
of view of things.

00:41:11.090 --> 00:41:12.910 align:middle line:84%
And I think these
octagonal structures

00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:15.320 align:middle line:90%
that he built were part of that.

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:18.810 align:middle line:84%
And I really do
believe if you examine

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:21.100 align:middle line:84%
the details of how
the Dome of the Rock

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:23.260 align:middle line:90%
was built, for instance.

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:25.870 align:middle line:90%
And this was built later.

00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:28.050 align:middle line:84%
But I found some
18th century sources

00:41:28.050 --> 00:41:31.500 align:middle line:84%
that say Constantine the Great
built the Dome of the Rock.

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:33.310 align:middle line:84%
Or he built an
octagonal structure

00:41:33.310 --> 00:41:36.310 align:middle line:84%
there first that may
have been demolished.

00:41:36.310 --> 00:41:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And then even when you look
into the dynamics of how

00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:43.620 align:middle line:84%
the official story tells
it, Justinian the II,

00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:47.310 align:middle line:84%
the Byzantine ruler, sent
artists and engineers

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:49.350 align:middle line:84%
to assist the
khalif of Jerusalem

00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:51.200 align:middle line:84%
in the building of
the Dome of the Rock.

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:52.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: So to me
this is suggestive of

00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:56.600 align:middle line:84%
he was manipulating,
because the khalif actually

00:41:56.600 --> 00:42:01.500 align:middle line:84%
paid tribute to Justinian
at that time to not invade.

00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:04.510 align:middle line:84%
So he's sending the people
to design the building

00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:05.310 align:middle line:90%
and build it.

00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:09.840 align:middle line:84%
I think they just rebuilt
Constantine's octagon.

00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:13.160 align:middle line:84%
And it may even be possible that
it was never even demolished,

00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:17.100 align:middle line:84%
that they just put tile
work and made it look--

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:18.700 align:middle line:90%
and a dome on top of it.

00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:20.610 align:middle line:84%
It used to be open
in the center,

00:42:20.610 --> 00:42:24.615 align:middle line:84%
or have a canted roof like
this, like the Powder Magazine

00:42:24.615 --> 00:42:27.120 align:middle line:90%
in Colonial Williamsburg.

00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:32.060 align:middle line:84%
But it's interesting in that the
octagon of the Dome of the Rock

00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:36.320 align:middle line:84%
points to the obelisk at the
center of St. Peter's Square.

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:37.650 align:middle line:90%
And we also--

00:42:37.650 --> 00:42:38.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Go ahead.

00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:38.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:39.520 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Yeah.

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:41.870 align:middle line:90%
And we'll get to that.

00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:44.220 align:middle line:84%
This was before the
windrows markers were there.

00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:45.870 align:middle line:90%
But today the obelisk is there.

00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's surrounded
with markers that

00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:50.830 align:middle line:84%
actually have compass
directions inscribed on them.

00:42:50.830 --> 00:42:54.390 align:middle line:84%
And each of those places--
Fatima, Portugal-- one of them

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:57.030 align:middle line:84%
to the East points right
to Constantine's home

00:42:57.030 --> 00:43:00.800 align:middle line:84%
of the octagon of the
Daphne in Constantinople.

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:04.540 align:middle line:10%
And it points back to
the Dome of the Rock.

00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:08.070 align:middle line:10%
So both of these structures
infer the same direction

00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:11.560 align:middle line:10%
thousands of miles apart
that point each other.

00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And they're involved
in the same theme--

00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:16.660 align:middle line:84%
the development of
Christianity, the architecture

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:21.630 align:middle line:84%
of Constantine, and the story
of Justinian I, which is amazing

00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:23.750 align:middle line:90%
in and of itself.

00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:26.910 align:middle line:84%
He was the only Roman ruler
to ever have been deposed

00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:29.550 align:middle line:90%
and regain his throne.

00:43:29.550 --> 00:43:32.930 align:middle line:84%
When he was deposed,
they slit his tongue.

00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:36.930 align:middle line:84%
So he would wear a mask to
cover the deformity when

00:43:36.930 --> 00:43:41.400 align:middle line:84%
he came back and reconquered
and took the throne back.

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:46.030 align:middle line:84%
So later, obviously he went
through all of these things--

00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:48.150 align:middle line:84%
I believe building
the Dome of the Rock,

00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:52.650 align:middle line:84%
or rebuilding it because he
knew Constantine was there.

00:43:52.650 --> 00:43:55.802 align:middle line:84%
This all led me to believe that
Constantine could have even

00:43:55.802 --> 00:43:57.510 align:middle line:84%
been buried beneath
the Dome of the Rock.

00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:58.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I was going go ask you.

00:43:58.510 --> 00:43:59.310 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:43:59.310 --> 00:44:02.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: And then we see possibly
even the Knights Templar.

00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:04.670 align:middle line:84%
There are so many legends
of them finding something

00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:06.060 align:middle line:90%
beneath the Dome of the Rock.

00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:06.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:09.120 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: We know the
temple treasure was gone.

00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:12.530 align:middle line:10%
It was displayed in Rome at the
Peace Temple that I mentioned

00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:16.630 align:middle line:10%
before and the Lateran
Palace in Rome,

00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:22.060 align:middle line:10%
which Constantine
also rebuilt. So I

00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:23.241 align:middle line:10%
think that's off the table.

00:44:23.241 --> 00:44:24.490 align:middle line:90%
I think that's somewhere else.

00:44:24.490 --> 00:44:26.760 align:middle line:90%
The Visigoths ended up with it.

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:29.180 align:middle line:90%
Or the Romans hid it somewhere.

00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:31.100 align:middle line:84%
So I think the
Knights Templar found

00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:35.260 align:middle line:84%
the remains of Constantine the
Great and associated library

00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:38.050 align:middle line:84%
of information that was
left, because that's

00:44:38.050 --> 00:44:40.910 align:middle line:84%
another theme you
see re-emerging

00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:44.800 align:middle line:84%
during the time of Charlemagne
when Otto the II, Holy Roman

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:47.820 align:middle line:84%
Emperor, opened
Charlemagne's crypt

00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:49.335 align:middle line:90%
and found him wearing a mask.

00:44:49.335 --> 00:44:52.200 align:middle line:84%
You know, he left him wearing
a mask when he closed it,

00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:58.390 align:middle line:84%
just like Justinian's-- on his
face, on Charlemagne's corpse,

00:44:58.390 --> 00:45:01.060 align:middle line:84%
in the crypt with the
Coronation Gospels,

00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:02.736 align:middle line:84%
which is an
illuminated manuscript.

00:45:02.736 --> 00:45:04.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going
to ask you about those.

00:45:04.610 --> 00:45:04.930 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:45:04.930 --> 00:45:06.600 align:middle line:84%
Before we go to the
Coronation Gospels,

00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:09.270 align:middle line:84%
because I don't know
anything about them,

00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:14.300 align:middle line:84%
is there a significance that
Constantine had declared

00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:16.480 align:middle line:90%
Constantinople the new Rome?

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:17.280 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:19.950 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that was the original
name of the Nova Roma.

00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:23.160 align:middle line:84%
And it just gained the name
Constantinople before it.

00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:25.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think his beliefs are
part of why he did this.

00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:27.185 align:middle line:90%
We were discussing--

00:45:27.185 --> 00:45:29.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The mithras beliefs.

00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:32.520 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: How he had more Eastern
Christian, possibly, beliefs,

00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:37.050 align:middle line:84%
or mithraic beliefs with pagan
beliefs, obviously, as well.

00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's why he
wanted to move.

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:42.560 align:middle line:84%
None the least of it
which he was from there.

00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:43.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:46.330 align:middle line:10%
>>CORT: I mean, his birthplace
is given either in Macedonia,

00:45:46.330 --> 00:45:51.400 align:middle line:10%
which is right next-- just to
the west of Constantinople,

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:56.567 align:middle line:10%
or of Nicodemia, which is
just to the east in Turkey.

00:45:56.567 --> 00:45:57.650 align:middle line:90%
So he was even from there.

00:45:57.650 --> 00:46:00.230 align:middle line:84%
That's probably the
reason I would go toward.

00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:03.340 align:middle line:84%
But there is no doubt
that he realized

00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:05.400 align:middle line:84%
that the royal district
that he established

00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:09.280 align:middle line:84%
was due east of the obelisk
at St. Peter's Square.

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:10.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:11.038 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: I believe that.

00:46:11.038 --> 00:46:13.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
the Coronation Gospels.

00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:14.990 align:middle line:90%
I know nothing of these.

00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:15.790 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Right.

00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:16.660 align:middle line:90%
Back to Charlemagne.

00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:19.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, this ends
up being the book

00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:25.800 align:middle line:84%
that is used to coordinate
all of the German Holy Roman

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:27.150 align:middle line:90%
Emperors.

00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:29.290 align:middle line:90%
So it's important just in that.

00:46:29.290 --> 00:46:31.310 align:middle line:84%
As far as the
contents of it go, I'm

00:46:31.310 --> 00:46:34.650 align:middle line:84%
not clear on if
it's any different

00:46:34.650 --> 00:46:40.440 align:middle line:84%
than the normal gospels we
see in the Old Testament.

00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:41.410 align:middle line:90%
But that's interesting.

00:46:41.410 --> 00:46:44.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm gonna look into that now
that you just brought that up,

00:46:44.170 --> 00:46:48.940 align:middle line:84%
because that could easily
conform to the gnostic view.

00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:49.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:50.990 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: And it does seem that.

00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:52.580 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a
lot of evidence too.

00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:55.950 align:middle line:84%
I think Charlemagne believed
he was even descendant

00:46:55.950 --> 00:46:58.460 align:middle line:84%
of Byzantine
Royalty, because you

00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:01.560 align:middle line:84%
see this progression of-- we'll
go to Theodora in a while.

00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:02.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:05.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: But then the
Merovingiens come after her.

00:47:05.350 --> 00:47:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And all of their coinage
had the [? Cairo ?]

00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:10.290 align:middle line:90%
with the alpha and omega on it.

00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:14.690 align:middle line:84%
And the rulers are dressed in
Byzantine garbs and headdress.

00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:17.070 align:middle line:90%
So why are they doing that?

00:47:17.070 --> 00:47:20.990 align:middle line:84%
And then Charlemagne just
has this unprecedented mania

00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:23.830 align:middle line:90%
for Greek and Roman culture.

00:47:23.830 --> 00:47:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's well-documented
in history.

00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:28.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He-- Charlemagne
built the Aachen Cathedral,

00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:31.950 align:middle line:84%
which again, was based on
Constantine's Dome of the Rock.

00:47:31.950 --> 00:47:33.940 align:middle line:84%
There was something
being perpetuated

00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:37.180 align:middle line:84%
in this geometry and mythology
over and over by these players.

00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:37.980 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Certainly.

00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:41.175 align:middle line:84%
And he's telling you
he knew, in a way.

00:47:41.175 --> 00:47:42.710 align:middle line:90%
He had solved the mystery.

00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:47.040 align:middle line:84%
He had done that, and then
left one just like it himself

00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:49.240 align:middle line:84%
no less than four
Holy Roman emperors

00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:51.200 align:middle line:84%
open Charlemagne's
vault, because they

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:56.330 align:middle line:84%
had solved whatever he left
for them to lead them there.

00:47:56.330 --> 00:47:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And so this mystery is repeated
again in the Rosicrucian

00:47:59.890 --> 00:48:04.820 align:middle line:84%
thought with the vault with
Christian Rosenkreuz interred

00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:06.870 align:middle line:90%
with the book and everything.

00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:09.270 align:middle line:84%
So you see a funerary
overlay to this, even

00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:12.930 align:middle line:84%
in the Rennes-le-Chateau
mystery, where

00:48:12.930 --> 00:48:16.840 align:middle line:84%
some of the concepts
were that a body was

00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:20.230 align:middle line:84%
hidden that needed to be
found to prove your legitimacy

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:21.380 align:middle line:90%
to rule.

00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:24.840 align:middle line:84%
And this was happening in
like the Napoleonic era

00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:26.660 align:middle line:84%
and the post-Napoleonic
era when they

00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:28.480 align:middle line:90%
didn't have a king anymore.

00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:29.940 align:middle line:84%
But there were
still people there

00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:33.470 align:middle line:84%
who had the blood and
the right to do it.

00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:36.180 align:middle line:84%
So even Pierre Plantard,
who everybody points to

00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:40.270 align:middle line:84%
as being a faker, that's what
he was claiming he was doing.

00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:41.980 align:middle line:84%
He was claiming
to be royal blood,

00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:45.900 align:middle line:84%
that he had solved the mystery
and now had the right to rule.

00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:49.480 align:middle line:84%
So this is I believe part of
the reason Charlemagne's vault

00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:51.820 align:middle line:90%
was opened so many times.

00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And that they were
compelled to do this.

00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:58.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:59.521 align:middle line:90%
Let's go back a little further.

00:48:59.521 --> 00:49:02.170 align:middle line:84%
You also stated Byzantine
royalty rebuilt the Temple

00:49:02.170 --> 00:49:05.050 align:middle line:84%
Mount as a copy of an array of
monuments at Baalbek, Lebanon.

00:49:05.050 --> 00:49:05.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Yes.

00:49:05.850 --> 00:49:06.240 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:07.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:08.100 align:middle line:90%
Let's get to that area.

00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:08.630 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: OK.

00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:10.213 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you look
at the Temple Mount,

00:49:10.213 --> 00:49:13.070 align:middle line:84%
you'll see the Al-Aqsa Mosque,
which that's called today.

00:49:13.070 --> 00:49:13.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:17.170 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: That was originally
built as the Church of St.

00:49:17.170 --> 00:49:18.300 align:middle line:90%
Mary Justinian--

00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:18.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:49:18.570 --> 00:49:20.210 align:middle line:84%
And this is going to
take us into that.

00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:22.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: --by Justinian
I. And he also copied

00:49:22.690 --> 00:49:25.590 align:middle line:84%
Constantine by building
Basilica San Vitale, which

00:49:25.590 --> 00:49:27.970 align:middle line:90%
is also an octagon.

00:49:27.970 --> 00:49:32.980 align:middle line:84%
So you see later feeds into my
theory about how Constantine--

00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:35.580 align:middle line:84%
if Justinian had built
the church there,

00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:38.210 align:middle line:84%
that means the Dome of the
Rock was already there.

00:49:38.210 --> 00:49:39.010 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:40.890 align:middle line:84%
History does not
tell you that's true.

00:49:40.890 --> 00:49:44.470 align:middle line:84%
They say the Muslims built
it in the seventh century.

00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:46.820 align:middle line:84%
The church of St.
Mary Justinian was

00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:48.920 align:middle line:84%
built in the fifth century--
or the sixth century.

00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:50.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting it mixed up.

00:49:50.650 --> 00:49:52.300 align:middle line:84%
Dome of the Rock
was seventh century.

00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:54.950 align:middle line:84%
The church was built
in the sixth century.

00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:58.450 align:middle line:84%
So he was just complementing
what Constantine had already

00:49:58.450 --> 00:49:59.700 align:middle line:90%
done.

00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:04.300 align:middle line:84%
Now if you compare the plan
view of the Temple of Jupiter

00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:06.680 align:middle line:84%
in Baalbek with the
hexagonal structure,

00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:08.760 align:middle line:90%
it's the same layout.

00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:11.900 align:middle line:84%
Except now it's the
church in an octagon.

00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:14.440 align:middle line:84%
And this goes back to
what I was supposing

00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:17.180 align:middle line:84%
before about the hexagon
representing the more pagan

00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:17.980 align:middle line:90%
value.

00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:22.490 align:middle line:84%
I believe Baalbek was
the pagan Roman axis.

00:50:22.490 --> 00:50:24.880 align:middle line:90%
It points to the Great Pyramid.

00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:30.700 align:middle line:10%
It points to in Libya to
Tunisia, or Tunis, where

00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:32.820 align:middle line:10%
the war harbor of
Carthage was, which

00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:38.860 align:middle line:10%
is a regularly built
geometric structure

00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:40.690 align:middle line:10%
that has an octagon
in the middle of it.

00:50:40.690 --> 00:50:43.040 align:middle line:84%
Later, we see Thomas Jefferson
pointing one of his structures

00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:43.300 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:43.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:43.975 align:middle line:90%
We're going to go there.

00:50:43.975 --> 00:50:44.400 align:middle line:90%
Mm hm.

00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:46.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: He showed respect
later to many of the things I'm

00:50:46.830 --> 00:50:48.270 align:middle line:90%
telling you about now.

00:50:48.270 --> 00:50:49.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:50:49.070 --> 00:50:52.080 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: So this
tradition was just there.

00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:53.930 align:middle line:90%
Justinian I was aware of it.

00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:55.790 align:middle line:90%
Justinian II.

00:50:55.790 --> 00:50:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And Justinian II was
the last Byzantine ruler

00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:02.930 align:middle line:84%
to actually live in the
octagonal room in the Daphne

00:51:02.930 --> 00:51:05.800 align:middle line:84%
Palace that
Constantine had built.

00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:09.760 align:middle line:84%
So really he's the last
Byzantine true Roman

00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:11.740 align:middle line:90%
ruler, in my opinion.

00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:16.240 align:middle line:84%
After him, you see the mantle
of power going to Charlemagne.

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:17.380 align:middle line:90%
And via--

00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:19.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Who continues
the tradition.

00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:19.980 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Right.

00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:23.770 align:middle line:84%
And I think the Merovingiens
had a lot to do with that.

00:51:23.770 --> 00:51:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And Theodora,
Justinian I's wife.

00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:27.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:32.026 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go
there in just a sec.

00:51:32.026 --> 00:51:33.400 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
you said is you

00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:35.730 align:middle line:84%
think that the Temple
Mount in Jerusalem

00:51:35.730 --> 00:51:38.410 align:middle line:84%
may hold some of the most
controversial secrets

00:51:38.410 --> 00:51:39.610 align:middle line:90%
of all times.

00:51:39.610 --> 00:51:41.300 align:middle line:84%
Is this what we were
just referring to?

00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:42.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Yes.

00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:46.950 align:middle line:84%
I believe there's Constantine's
remains and lots of information

00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:49.410 align:middle line:84%
were recovered by
the Knights Templar.

00:51:49.410 --> 00:51:53.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is what they had
to threaten the Church.

00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:56.140 align:middle line:84%
Because here the Church
is always telling us

00:51:56.140 --> 00:51:59.070 align:middle line:90%
Constantine created our church.

00:51:59.070 --> 00:52:01.810 align:middle line:84%
They don't even like the
Eastern Orthodox Church that's

00:52:01.810 --> 00:52:03.060 align:middle line:90%
more aligned with Constantine.

00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:03.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:06.310 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: So that's a secret.

00:52:06.310 --> 00:52:10.730 align:middle line:84%
Maybe if he was a agnostic or a
pagan or a mithraic worshipper,

00:52:10.730 --> 00:52:13.550 align:middle line:84%
then they don't want
you to know that,

00:52:13.550 --> 00:52:16.120 align:middle line:84%
because he would have that
effect on other people.

00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:16.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:20.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: And I do think you
see this value through time.

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.550 align:middle line:84%
Even in more modern
times, I think

00:52:22.550 --> 00:52:25.420 align:middle line:84%
there's a class of people
that are privy to all of this.

00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:27.110 align:middle line:90%
And they do know these things.

00:52:27.110 --> 00:52:27.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:28.710 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:30.880 align:middle line:84%
So you had just
mentioned the church

00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:35.040 align:middle line:84%
that preceded the Al-Aqsa
Mosque, the Church of St. Mary

00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:36.827 align:middle line:90%
Justinian, right?

00:52:36.827 --> 00:52:38.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Mm hm.

00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:41.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's start going
into the story of Mary,

00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:44.660 align:middle line:90%
or the Magdala story, Theodora.

00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:49.150 align:middle line:84%
The story of the women
weavers, and how that weaves in

00:52:49.150 --> 00:52:51.910 align:middle line:90%
with the Merovingien line.

00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:52.960 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Right.

00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:55.990 align:middle line:84%
And this is interesting, because
we go back to Basilica San

00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:58.640 align:middle line:90%
Vitale in Ravenna, Italy.

00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:02.610 align:middle line:84%
There's also the Santa Paulo
[INAUDIBLE] Nuevo Basilica

00:53:02.610 --> 00:53:07.980 align:middle line:84%
there that the Al-Aqsa
Mosque is a copy of.

00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:11.659 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the interior,
it's almost identical.

00:53:11.659 --> 00:53:12.700 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's not as nice.

00:53:12.700 --> 00:53:15.840 align:middle line:84%
But the layout and the placement
of the beams and columns

00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:17.780 align:middle line:90%
and everything is in that style.

00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:20.270 align:middle line:90%
It's a Byzantine style building.

00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:22.470 align:middle line:84%
So but if we go to
Basilica San Vitale,

00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:25.250 align:middle line:90%
it has pointing qualities too.

00:53:25.250 --> 00:53:29.300 align:middle line:84%
It points to Avebury also, just
like the Tower of the Winds.

00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's one point
I'd like to make.

00:53:31.010 --> 00:53:35.020 align:middle line:84%
You see, both these men--
Justinian I and Constantine--

00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:38.180 align:middle line:84%
even though separated
by over 300 years,

00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:42.180 align:middle line:84%
were both Greek
culture in origin.

00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:43.240 align:middle line:90%
They spoke Greek.

00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:44.040 align:middle line:90%
Wrote in Greek.

00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:47.220 align:middle line:84%
The Byzantines were a
lot more eastern oriented

00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:49.540 align:middle line:84%
than the Latin
church, obviously.

00:53:49.540 --> 00:53:53.450 align:middle line:84%
But within Basilica San Vitale
are the most amazing mosaics

00:53:53.450 --> 00:53:55.800 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:57.950 align:middle line:84%
There's Christ
Pantocrator, shown

00:53:57.950 --> 00:54:02.430 align:middle line:84%
with short hair, no beard,
wearing Byzantine royal robes.

00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:06.220 align:middle line:84%
So that's a notion of what I'm
getting to with Charlemagne

00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:10.090 align:middle line:84%
thinking or believing that
he may have been related.

00:54:10.090 --> 00:54:13.830 align:middle line:84%
But even more interesting
is the mosaic of Theodora,

00:54:13.830 --> 00:54:16.257 align:middle line:90%
because it shows her--

00:54:16.257 --> 00:54:17.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us
something about her.

00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:18.640 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: OK.

00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:21.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The day, that period
of history, and so forth.

00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:26.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: This is in the sixth
century when Basilica San

00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:30.590 align:middle line:84%
Vitale was built. I
believe it was in 535 AD.

00:54:30.590 --> 00:54:31.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's location?

00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:36.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: It's in Ravenna, Italy,
which is northeast Italy, kind

00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:37.700 align:middle line:90%
of south of Venice.

00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:41.100 align:middle line:84%
And this was really the first
seat of the Christian faith

00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:43.630 align:middle line:90%
even before the Vatican was.

00:54:43.630 --> 00:54:45.660 align:middle line:90%
This was made that.

00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:51.580 align:middle line:84%
So him and Theodora, there's
a really interesting oddity

00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:53.860 align:middle line:84%
there, because
they were fighting

00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:59.340 align:middle line:84%
the Visigoths at that time,
the Romans and Byzantines were.

00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:02.690 align:middle line:90%
And Theodoric ruled Ravenna.

00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:04.950 align:middle line:84%
But he had an agreement
with Justinian

00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:06.600 align:middle line:90%
that he actually owned it.

00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And that that's
called an [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:08.510 --> 00:55:11.240 align:middle line:84%
It's a type of
political division.

00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:15.820 align:middle line:84%
So as soon as the Basilica
San Vitale was built,

00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:17.180 align:middle line:90%
Theodoric died.

00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:19.550 align:middle line:90%
And Justinian took over Ravenna.

00:55:19.550 --> 00:55:23.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the
mosaics were added.

00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:26.850 align:middle line:90%
Justinian I's wife was Theodora.

00:55:26.850 --> 00:55:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And she has a very
interesting life.

00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:32.960 align:middle line:84%
She was trained in
Coptic Christianity

00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:35.280 align:middle line:90%
in Alexandria, Egypt.

00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And this is the place where
we see the Gospels of Mary

00:55:38.110 --> 00:55:39.970 align:middle line:84%
and the Nag Hammadi
text, and all

00:55:39.970 --> 00:55:45.720 align:middle line:84%
of these older gnostic concepts
coming from Ptolemaic Egypt.

00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:49.150 align:middle line:84%
The Greeks had controlled
Egypt since Alexander the Great

00:55:49.150 --> 00:55:51.600 align:middle line:90%
in the third century BC.

00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:55.190 align:middle line:84%
So there's huge exchange
of ideas, I believe,

00:55:55.190 --> 00:55:58.320 align:middle line:84%
going on between
Greece and Egypt,

00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:01.500 align:middle line:84%
including the Tower of the Winds
I found an earlier one there

00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:03.110 align:middle line:84%
that I'm just now
starting to study--

00:56:03.110 --> 00:56:04.193 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:56:04.193 --> 00:56:06.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: --that's associated
with Cleopatra, even.

00:56:06.410 --> 00:56:09.770 align:middle line:84%
At Abu Simbel,
west of Alexandria.

00:56:09.770 --> 00:56:10.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:56:10.570 --> 00:56:12.111 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: I don't know
more about that.

00:56:12.111 --> 00:56:14.730 align:middle line:84%
But I think that's
even before the Tower

00:56:14.730 --> 00:56:17.510 align:middle line:90%
of the Winds in a Greek way.

00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:22.050 align:middle line:90%
So Theodora studied all of this.

00:56:22.050 --> 00:56:25.130 align:middle line:84%
It's noted her
faith was different.

00:56:25.130 --> 00:56:30.200 align:middle line:84%
She believed in the kind of
Coptic Eastern Christian unity

00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:33.650 align:middle line:84%
included Christ being a
man and not being divine

00:56:33.650 --> 00:56:36.460 align:middle line:90%
like the Latin church.

00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:38.440 align:middle line:84%
And this was accepted
and acknowledged,

00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:41.670 align:middle line:84%
even though Justinian
didn't believe that.

00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:44.420 align:middle line:90%
He was still Eastern Orthodox.

00:56:44.420 --> 00:56:47.240 align:middle line:84%
But they believe
Christ is divine, just

00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:48.240 align:middle line:90%
like the Western church.

00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:50.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did she have
her own followers, then?

00:56:50.170 --> 00:56:50.970 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Yes.

00:56:50.970 --> 00:56:52.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Were they
principally female?

00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:53.510 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Yes.

00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:54.810 align:middle line:90%
And that's what's interesting.

00:56:54.810 --> 00:56:59.000 align:middle line:84%
When you look on the mosaic,
her sister and her niece,

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:02.887 align:middle line:84%
Sophia, are wearing
Coptic tunic patches.

00:57:02.887 --> 00:57:03.720 align:middle line:90%
And this is easily--

00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:05.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Very open-minded
of Justinian I--

00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:06.880 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: To let her do that.

00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:09.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --to allow his wife
to carry on in her own tradition

00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:09.875 align:middle line:90%
and belief.

00:57:09.875 --> 00:57:11.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: By many
accounts, though,

00:57:11.250 --> 00:57:13.630 align:middle line:84%
she was the stronger
and real ruler.

00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:14.430 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:15.660 align:middle line:90%
If you read that.

00:57:15.660 --> 00:57:18.840 align:middle line:84%
During the Nika riots, for
instance, in Constantinople,

00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:20.230 align:middle line:90%
Justinian wanted to leave.

00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:21.030 align:middle line:90%
And she said, no.

00:57:21.030 --> 00:57:22.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm staying.

00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And they can kill me
wearing royal purple.

00:57:24.930 --> 00:57:29.200 align:middle line:84%
So she almost had more
chutzpah than the ruler.

00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:30.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now
how does this come

00:57:30.670 --> 00:57:34.240 align:middle line:90%
into the story of the weavers?

00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:36.619 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: Well, Theodora
was trained as a weaver.

00:57:36.619 --> 00:57:38.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Explain
what a weave means.

00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:38.960 align:middle line:90%


00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: Her story is
similar to Mary Magdalene.

00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:47.330 align:middle line:84%
You know, she was cast as
a prostitute dancing girl.

00:57:47.330 --> 00:57:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And supposedly she
learned the weaving craft

00:57:50.670 --> 00:57:54.680 align:middle line:84%
as part of her
training in Alexandria.

00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:56.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like most
prostitutes do, right?

00:57:56.550 --> 00:57:57.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Right.

00:57:57.350 --> 00:57:59.520 align:middle line:84%
Sit around knitting
and doing needlepoint.

00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:01.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That still galls me.

00:58:01.340 --> 00:58:02.420 align:middle line:90%
Eh.

00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:03.220 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:04.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: I mean,
she may have well

00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:06.137 align:middle line:84%
been an entertainer or
something like that.

00:58:06.137 --> 00:58:07.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or may not have.

00:58:07.220 --> 00:58:07.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Yeah.

00:58:07.810 --> 00:58:08.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Who knows.

00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:09.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: But stretched into that.

00:58:09.410 --> 00:58:09.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:10.040 align:middle line:90%
Prostitution.

00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:10.530 align:middle line:90%
Always.

00:58:10.530 --> 00:58:10.720 align:middle line:90%
Always.

00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:11.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: Just like
Mary Magdelene.

00:58:11.730 --> 00:58:12.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:58:12.530 --> 00:58:15.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: So cut back
to the sixth century.

00:58:15.970 --> 00:58:17.320 align:middle line:90%
And she's now the Empress.

00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And her sister and niece are
part of her court, let's say.

00:58:25.180 --> 00:58:27.980 align:middle line:84%
We see Theodora
creating a group of nuns

00:58:27.980 --> 00:58:30.690 align:middle line:90%
that are all taught to weave.

00:58:30.690 --> 00:58:33.920 align:middle line:84%
And Sophia is trained
in this, as well.

00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And they're wearing the Coptic
tunic patches, one of which

00:58:37.060 --> 00:58:38.020 align:middle line:90%
is the Cairo.

00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:40.080 align:middle line:90%
And another one's an octagon.

00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And you can plainly see
them in the mosaics.

00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And if you go look
up what they are,

00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:47.900 align:middle line:84%
it's not related to the normal
Christian religion that's

00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:49.350 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:58:49.350 --> 00:58:55.760 align:middle line:84%
We can easily imagine this
group of nuns, or sect of nuns,

00:58:55.760 --> 00:59:00.350 align:middle line:84%
kind of creating the culture
of Mary Magdalene that we see

00:59:00.350 --> 00:59:03.280 align:middle line:84%
later in Europe,
and as transmitted

00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:05.890 align:middle line:84%
by the Merovingiens,
possibly, or the Three

00:59:05.890 --> 00:59:09.320 align:middle line:90%
Marys, those kind of stories.

00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:13.120 align:middle line:84%
The Theban legion
of Zion, France

00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:16.150 align:middle line:84%
that came from
Thebes, Egypt and were

00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:20.780 align:middle line:90%
martyred there very early on.

00:59:20.780 --> 00:59:26.100 align:middle line:84%
We see that all of these values
come in later to Charlemagne.

00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:29.270 align:middle line:84%
And even the Cathars
were known as weavers.

00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:31.570 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the
tenets of their faith.

00:59:31.570 --> 00:59:36.320 align:middle line:84%
And even the Aryan faith--
not Aryan like Nazi Germany--

00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:38.650 align:middle line:84%
the more gnostic
oriented Christianity

00:59:38.650 --> 00:59:41.447 align:middle line:84%
was likely a result
of what she created.

00:59:41.447 --> 00:59:42.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The women's tradition.

00:59:42.780 --> 00:59:43.580 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Yes.

00:59:43.580 --> 00:59:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And I still believe
this likely exists now.

00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:48.590 align:middle line:90%
The weavers.

00:59:48.590 --> 00:59:50.360 align:middle line:90%
I think they're still with us.

00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And they're promoting kind
of maybe some of the things

00:59:53.350 --> 00:59:55.970 align:middle line:84%
we see in the Da Vinci
Code, the things that

00:59:55.970 --> 00:59:59.270 align:middle line:84%
are leading everybody to
maybe consider that as true

00:59:59.270 --> 01:00:00.470 align:middle line:90%
more than in the past.

01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:02.136 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know,
and it's interesting

01:00:02.136 --> 01:00:05.600 align:middle line:84%
as we were just kind of
joking about the notion

01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:07.600 align:middle line:84%
that all of the women
that are represented

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:10.670 align:middle line:84%
as powerful throughout history
were viewed as prostitutes.

01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:14.080 align:middle line:84%
What just occurred to me is
if they were women of strength

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:17.260 align:middle line:84%
and power, as in ancient
times and pagan times,

01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:19.010 align:middle line:90%
they could choose their partner.

01:00:19.010 --> 01:00:21.540 align:middle line:84%
Now to be viewed later
by the Church then,

01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:23.500 align:middle line:84%
they would call
them a prostitute,

01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:27.520 align:middle line:84%
because they might have
had an important liaison

01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:28.870 align:middle line:90%
outside of wedlock.

01:00:28.870 --> 01:00:29.670 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Sure.

01:00:29.670 --> 01:00:32.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I can see
where that term has

01:00:32.610 --> 01:00:34.310 align:middle line:84%
been misapplied
throughout history

01:00:34.310 --> 01:00:35.350 align:middle line:90%
to these powerful women.

01:00:35.350 --> 01:00:36.150 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Certainly.

01:00:36.150 --> 01:00:39.390 align:middle line:10%
And just to smear the
[INAUDIBLE] the antithesis

01:00:39.390 --> 01:00:41.180 align:middle line:10%
of what you're saying,
you know, if you

01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:44.890 align:middle line:10%
want to sling mud at the
most basic level you can

01:00:44.890 --> 01:00:45.690 align:middle line:10%
by doing that.

01:00:45.690 --> 01:00:47.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just denigrate
someone to that level.

01:00:47.650 --> 01:00:48.450 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Mm hm.

01:00:48.450 --> 01:00:49.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

01:00:49.250 --> 01:00:51.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have
gotten through most

01:00:51.370 --> 01:00:53.100 align:middle line:90%
of, but not all of, Part 1.

01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:55.620 align:middle line:84%
But it's kind of brought
us up to speed enough

01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:58.480 align:middle line:84%
that we can take a short
break and have a cup of tea

01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:02.980 align:middle line:84%
and come back and talk
about how these traditions

01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:05.360 align:middle line:84%
and artifacts started
showing up through bloodlines

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:06.588 align:middle line:90%
in the Americas.

01:01:06.588 --> 01:01:07.388 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT: Great.

01:01:07.388 --> 01:01:08.340 align:middle line:90%
Fantastic.

01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:09.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's fascinating.

01:01:09.730 --> 01:01:11.240 align:middle line:90%
It's a ride.

01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:12.624 align:middle line:90%
It's a wild ride.

01:01:12.624 --> 01:01:14.985 align:middle line:84%
>>CORT: Well, I hope everyone's
enjoying it and having

01:01:14.985 --> 01:01:15.786 align:middle line:90%
a good ride.

01:01:15.786 --> 01:01:16.585 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

01:01:16.585 --> 01:01:18.150 align:middle line:10%
So stay tuned for
Part 2, when we

01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:21.640 align:middle line:10%
speak of the mysterious treasure
of Oak Island, Nova Scotia,

01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:25.060 align:middle line:10%
and how this remote place ties
the great bloodlines of Europe

01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:26.460 align:middle line:10%
and America together.

01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:30.170 align:middle line:10%
Until then, thank you for
