Filmmaker Caroline Cory’s work focuses on transforming Self by using the full potential of the mind. As a young child, she encountered light beings who helped to develop her own potential as she began using precognitive abilities to see the future. \n\nHer recent docu-series explores, through a series of experiments, how superhuman abilities can be learned and developed by anyone. From moving physical objects in space by using thought-heart connection techniques to a group of children reading and playing while completely blindfolded, we witness the power of the mind and understand our own potential. Cory is the creator of the docu-series ‘Superhuman: the Invisible Made Visible’, now available on Gaia.","teaser":"Can your intentions have an impact on the physical world?

These are some of the many gems of wisdom the Z’s share to guide us through this planetary transition:\n\nEarth is coming online in ways we have never experienced.\nThis transmission is multidimensionality in action.\nThe bliss bunnies are bringing balance to emotional rage machines.\nIf we could show you how many things have been averted when it comes to destruction, you would feel horrified at first and then relieved.\nWe are witnessing the push and pull between the forces that want to divide us and the future of consciousness.\n\nWhile humanity is experiencing an unstable world, we are moving beyond our \"war imprint\" and discovering our heart- energy gifts for healing and spiritual connection.\n\nLee Harris is a channeler and empath who has been receiving communication from his guides, the Z’s, since 1999. He is an accomplished author of many books including Conversations with the Z’s, Book One: The Energetics of the New Human Soul.","teaser":"What is the current direction of humanity's evolution?\nLegendary channeler Lee Harris returns to Gaia to share profound and timely insights from his channeled guides, The Z’s.
