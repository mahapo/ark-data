00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.810 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Our
fascination with horror

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:30.627 align:middle line:10%
never ends.

00:00:30.627 --> 00:00:32.210 align:middle line:10%
And one of the most
terrifying stories

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.070 align:middle line:10%
humans have been
confronted with is

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.190 align:middle line:10%
the presence of reptilian
humanoids on Earth.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.690 align:middle line:10%
There are a myriad
of books speaking

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.320 align:middle line:10%
of their influence
over earthlings,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.290 align:middle line:10%
and today we'll be
looking at the history

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.460 align:middle line:10%
of these beings with Len Kasten,
author of "Alien World Order"

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.140 align:middle line:10%
and welcome, Len.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.490 align:middle line:84%
We saw each other last time
over project Serpo, right?

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:51.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LEN KASTEN: Yes.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this one is, wow,
it's intensely well researched.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.320 align:middle line:84%
But we also have
testimony in there

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.420 align:middle line:84%
from some very
common threads, you

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.100 align:middle line:84%
know Stewart
Swerdlow, for example,

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.720 align:middle line:90%
whom I've interviewed also.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.690 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of this
is coming from--

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.907 align:middle line:84%
the early part of the story is
coming from Robert Morning Sky.

00:01:08.907 --> 00:01:10.490 align:middle line:10%
And we're going to
get right into that

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.080 align:middle line:10%
and talk about who he is.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.060 align:middle line:10%
But may I say something
before we even begin?

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.860 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Sure.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As scary and
ubiquitous as this story

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.390 align:middle line:84%
seems to be, you and I
are of the same opinion,

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.520 align:middle line:84%
and that is that
human beings, rock

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.460 align:middle line:84%
solid DNA-driven
human beings actually

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.100 align:middle line:84%
have far more capability
and power than them

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.227 align:middle line:84%
once we start to wake
up and understand that.

00:01:33.227 --> 00:01:34.310 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yes, absolutely.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.110 align:middle line:90%
I agree with that.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.740 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they really
are afraid of us.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know, that's
why so much oppression.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.100 align:middle line:84%
The last thing they
want to see happen here

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.350 align:middle line:90%
is what's happening right now.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.610 align:middle line:90%
We're waking up.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:44.030 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Exactly, exactly.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.696 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so I
just have to say that

00:01:45.696 --> 00:01:48.050 align:middle line:84%
right up front before we go
and scare the bejesus out

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.400 align:middle line:90%
of people, OK?

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.910 align:middle line:10%
So first of all, let's talk
about Robert Morning Sky

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.260 align:middle line:10%
and how he came into this story
and the nature of the beings

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.150 align:middle line:10%
that he's speaking about.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.750 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Yes, his
grandfather was really

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.509 align:middle line:84%
the key person who was involved
in the rescue of an alien

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.947 align:middle line:84%
from a craft that crashed in
the desert on the reservation.

00:02:11.947 --> 00:02:13.030 align:middle line:90%
I think I believe it was--

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: New Mexico.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.040 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: New Mexico.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In '47 before Roswell.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.730 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Before Roswell, yes.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And his grandfather was one
of the six young men that

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.940 align:middle line:84%
discovered the site of the
crash and rescued the alien

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.270 align:middle line:84%
and nursed him back to
health because he was hurt.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And then he left and he
started living among us

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.550 align:middle line:90%
as a human being.

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:36.770 align:middle line:90%
He was able to do that.

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, quick question.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.440 align:middle line:84%
Was the government aware
that there was a survivor?

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm sure they must
have kept this secret.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.400 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Native
Americans, typically,

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.500 align:middle line:84%
will not report these
crashes because there's

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.741 align:middle line:90%
nothing in it for them.

00:02:47.741 --> 00:02:50.240 align:middle line:84%
They see that the military comes
and takes the wreckage away

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.117 align:middle line:84%
and takes the survivors
away and they don't

00:02:54.117 --> 00:02:55.200 align:middle line:90%
know what happens to them.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.766 align:middle line:90%
So they don't need to report it.

00:02:56.766 --> 00:02:57.640 align:middle line:90%
They don't choose to.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.100 align:middle line:90%
It's their property.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.260 align:middle line:90%
So you said that this being--

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.000 align:middle line:84%
how did they describe
the being first,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.360 align:middle line:84%
and how was he able
to pass among humans?

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.430 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: He was
human-like, apparently.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's why he was able to
continue telling them his story

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.570 align:middle line:84%
later after he had
already become absorbed

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:23.510 align:middle line:84%
into the human race because he
left the reservation after he

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.070 align:middle line:90%
came back to health.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.550 align:middle line:84%
And he continued the story--
and his name was [INAUDIBLE],,

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.680 align:middle line:90%
they discovered--

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.710 align:middle line:84%
and gave them the whole story of
human existence on this planet.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:38.574 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Where was he from?

00:03:38.574 --> 00:03:39.490 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: They never--

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:40.650 align:middle line:84%
Morning Sky never
discussed that.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:41.820 align:middle line:90%
He never disclosed that.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But he was more human,
not reptilian-human but human.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.840 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: No, not reptilian.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.640 align:middle line:90%
Human-like, yes.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.264 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did he have
any features that

00:03:48.264 --> 00:03:50.790 align:middle line:84%
would distinguish him as
separate from humans or was he

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.704 align:middle line:84%
human enough that
he just passed?

00:03:52.704 --> 00:03:54.870 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Not from what I
learned from Morning Sky's

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:55.950 align:middle line:90%
writings, no.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.030 align:middle line:84%
He was able to pass
as so many are.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And now, again, Robert
was getting this

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.940 align:middle line:84%
from his grandfather who
was present at the time,

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.040 align:middle line:84%
and he was present
to the stories

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.970 align:middle line:84%
as they were being
relayed in the day?

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:07.770 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yes.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:08.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.270 align:middle line:84%
So let's go ahead and talk
about some of the information

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.140 align:middle line:84%
starting with the place
he called the Green World.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.040 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: The Green World was
in this galaxy, apparently,

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.840 align:middle line:84%
and we don't know exactly
which planet it was.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.330 align:middle line:84%
Morning Sky refers to
it as the Green World.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.485 align:middle line:84%
And that was the nexus,
that was the original home

00:04:31.485 --> 00:04:34.710 align:middle line:84%
world of the reptilian
species, that we now

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:35.850 align:middle line:90%
call the Reptilians.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And according to Morning
Sky it really started

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.610 align:middle line:90%
with dragonflies.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.890 align:middle line:84%
And the dragonflies
over millions of years

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.740 align:middle line:84%
evolved into what
we now refer to as

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.700 align:middle line:84%
Reptilians, scaly-skinned
humanoid-looking beings.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.180 align:middle line:84%
And they retained some
of the characteristics

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.746 align:middle line:84%
of the dragonflies, however,
they did have wings,

00:05:03.746 --> 00:05:05.370 align:middle line:84%
and they were able
to fly and that this

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.360 align:middle line:84%
was a tremendous advantage in
their battles which were many.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.030 align:middle line:90%


00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.470 align:middle line:84%
Because they were able to attack
an enemy flying as a host.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And Morning Sky describes it as
an angry buzz coming from them

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.450 align:middle line:84%
until they were upon
their enemy and then

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.031 align:middle line:84%
they were very
difficult to defeat.

00:05:28.031 --> 00:05:30.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Fast and vicious and
had claws and all the above--

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:31.330 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yes.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.540 align:middle line:90%
They had claws.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.857 align:middle line:84%
So they became all powerful
on the Green World.

00:05:35.857 --> 00:05:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And they went through several
phases on the Green World.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:44.550 align:middle line:84%
Eventually they began
to evolve into more--

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.750 align:middle line:84%
not quite as
ferocious and warlike

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.690 align:middle line:90%
as they were business-like.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:06:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And what they originally relied
on to dominate in terms of

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:06.060 align:middle line:84%
ferocity now became
business acumen and they

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:13.310 align:middle line:84%
became money oriented
and became a commercial--

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.560 align:middle line:84%
their civilization became
more commercial rather

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.267 align:middle line:90%
than combative.

00:06:19.267 --> 00:06:21.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So in your book,
you talk about not only money

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:26.190 align:middle line:84%
systems but they have
colonial kind of practices

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.440 align:middle line:90%
throughout the solar system.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.360 align:middle line:84%
They also use war and
assassinations and sport games.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, pretty
much sounds like us.

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:35.070 align:middle line:90%
Is it that bad everywhere?

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.110 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: It does
sound like us and I

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.780 align:middle line:84%
think the reason it sounds like
us is because we have derived

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:44.040 align:middle line:84%
a lot of that from them
because of their influence

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.870 align:middle line:90%
here on this planet.

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.969 align:middle line:84%
So we've become mercenary
and combative in business

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:51.010 align:middle line:84%
just like they were, just
like they had developed

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:52.350 align:middle line:90%
those same capabilities.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:57.000 align:middle line:84%
We're now sort of bloodthirsty
when it comes to business

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.560 align:middle line:90%
the same way they were.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And my understanding
of the deep prehistory eras,

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.910 align:middle line:84%
very early times
which we'll get into

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:07.330 align:middle line:84%
is that is not what human
beings we're wired as.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.240 align:middle line:84%
That's not what
the being was like.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.890 align:middle line:84%
This is something
that has almost been

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:12.840 align:middle line:90%
an infection on this planet.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.150 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Right, we're talking
about millions of years

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:15.950 align:middle line:90%
ago, actually.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:17.783 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, many
millions of years ago--

00:07:17.783 --> 00:07:19.440 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's go back
for a moment now.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.570 align:middle line:84%
Stewart Swerdlow, now,
he says, that can't be.

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:24.900 align:middle line:90%
They could not have evolved.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.440 align:middle line:84%
They are fully embodied
as we know them today,

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.310 align:middle line:84%
as humanoid reptilians and
came from Draco and Orion.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:34.860 align:middle line:84%
Draco, Draco-- however
you say it-- and Orion.

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.230 align:middle line:90%
So what is your thought on that?

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:40.905 align:middle line:84%
Between those two stories, that
they were evolved in the Green

00:07:40.905 --> 00:07:46.050 align:middle line:84%
Land according to Morning Sky's
grandfather as dragonflies that

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:49.770 align:middle line:84%
developed into this humanoid
type of being versus Swerdlow's

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:52.157 align:middle line:84%
views which say, no,
they came from Draco

00:07:52.157 --> 00:07:53.490 align:middle line:90%
and that's how they always were.

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:55.281 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: And I questioned
that in my book.

00:07:55.281 --> 00:07:58.542 align:middle line:84%
I did say that Swerdlow
is not much of a--

00:07:58.542 --> 00:08:00.000 align:middle line:84%
how would he know
whether or not it

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.220 align:middle line:84%
was possible for a dragonfly to
evolve into a reptilian being?

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:09.162 align:middle line:90%
But Morning Sky did say that.

00:08:09.162 --> 00:08:11.560 align:middle line:84%
That that's why they were
able to fly because they

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.060 align:middle line:90%
have that capability.

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.460 align:middle line:84%
They still had the wings
in the early stages

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:16.990 align:middle line:90%
of their evolution.

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:19.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about what

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.400 align:middle line:90%
happened on the Green Land.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.170 align:middle line:84%
There's quite a bit
written in your book

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:26.230 align:middle line:84%
about what happened with the
reproduction capabilities

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:30.040 align:middle line:84%
of the species, with the
females who ultimately

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:33.520 align:middle line:84%
gained dominance,
with their inability

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.429 align:middle line:90%
to reproduce at one point.

00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:37.870 align:middle line:84%
Explain that whole
lineage to us.

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:40.210 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Well,
as the Reptilians

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:44.710 align:middle line:84%
became more aware of
technology and learned

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:49.420 align:middle line:84%
how to fly to their moons
and to inhabit their moons

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.190 align:middle line:84%
and to mine their
moons, they gradually

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:53.920 align:middle line:84%
started to go out
into the cosmos.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.380 align:middle line:84%
They developed
spacefaring technology.

00:08:56.380 --> 00:09:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And since they were
a very fierce race,

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:03.310 align:middle line:84%
they had no trouble conquering
the entities that they

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:05.050 align:middle line:90%
encountered wherever they went.

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:08.450 align:middle line:84%
And so they really
developed an empire.

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:09.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But why?

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.720 align:middle line:90%
What was the motivation?

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.136 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: That's
the way they are.

00:09:12.136 --> 00:09:14.170 align:middle line:84%
They have no other
modus operandi.

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:17.140 align:middle line:84%
All they know how to
do is to dominate.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.700 align:middle line:84%
They're not a
peace-loving people.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:20.500 align:middle line:90%
That's the key.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.583 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the key
attributes of the Reptilians

00:09:22.583 --> 00:09:26.260 align:middle line:84%
is they really have nothing that
we would recognize as a heart

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:30.110 align:middle line:90%
or love or affection.

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:32.440 align:middle line:84%
They don't have those
capabilities, they just don't.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.710 align:middle line:90%
That's the way they're made.

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:35.460 align:middle line:84%
So all they know about
when they encounter

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.660 align:middle line:84%
another civilization
on a distant star

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:41.685 align:middle line:84%
is how do we dominate them
and make them our slaves?

00:09:41.685 --> 00:09:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's been
what they've been

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.107 align:middle line:84%
doing for hundreds of
thousands of years,

00:09:45.107 --> 00:09:46.190 align:middle line:90%
perhaps millions of years.

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:47.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's
been speculated

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.330 align:middle line:84%
with people who write
about the Anunnaki and such

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:51.850 align:middle line:84%
that this was done for a
purpose where maybe they

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:53.740 align:middle line:84%
needed a resource or
something like that.

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:56.060 align:middle line:84%
You're saying, no,
it's just what they do?

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.750 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: That's
what they do, yes.

00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:58.210 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:58.210 --> 00:09:59.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we
know people like that.

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:00.724 align:middle line:84%
We know governments
and countries

00:10:00.724 --> 00:10:01.810 align:middle line:90%
like that, ours being one.

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:03.809 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Well, we have
certain characteristics,

00:10:03.809 --> 00:10:05.187 align:middle line:90%
certain characteristics similar.

00:10:05.187 --> 00:10:07.020 align:middle line:84%
But we're much more
than that, they are not.

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:08.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, we're
much more than that.

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get into
that part of the story.

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:12.040 align:middle line:84%
Because really to me, what
matters in all of this

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.720 align:middle line:84%
is the statement we
made at the very top

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.220 align:middle line:84%
and that's where
we're going to end.

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:17.140 align:middle line:84%
But we still need
to maybe understand

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:20.410 align:middle line:84%
some of the nature of the depth
of the interference that's

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:23.420 align:middle line:84%
been going on as a result of the
presence of this particular DNA

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:24.220 align:middle line:90%
probe.

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:24.760 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Right.

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:25.370 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:26.170 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And so their encounter
with human beings

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:32.930 align:middle line:84%
began in the
constellation of Lyra.

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:36.970 align:middle line:10%
That was the first time that
humans and Reptilians met.

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:39.280 align:middle line:10%
And Alex Collier
tells that whole story

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.990 align:middle line:10%
in his book "Defending
Sacred Ground."

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:42.850 align:middle line:10%
And that's a book I
would recommend highly.

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:43.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:43.540 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:44.290 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:45.310 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: And Alex
is tremendous.

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:46.726 align:middle line:84%
He's a good writer
and everything.

00:10:46.726 --> 00:10:48.700 align:middle line:84%
And he knows the whole
story because he's

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:52.330 align:middle line:84%
connected to the Andromedans,
and the Andromedans of course,

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.670 align:middle line:90%
know everything about this.

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:59.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so let's
talk about the beings,

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:02.050 align:middle line:90%
the Lyran beings, OK.

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:05.590 align:middle line:84%
We can go into the trajectory
of Mars and to Earth.

00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:10.720 align:middle line:84%
But let's look at where the
Reptilians finally made it here

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.200 align:middle line:84%
where the cross-breeding
started and so forth.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.700 align:middle line:84%
Just paint that picture because
it's two divergent pathways.

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:17.324 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: I think
before we do that, we

00:11:17.324 --> 00:11:21.070 align:middle line:84%
have to talk about the fact that
the male Reptilians dominated

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:24.010 align:middle line:84%
their society for hundreds
of thousands of years.

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:26.480 align:middle line:84%
When it came to
actually developing

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:30.430 align:middle line:84%
stable societies of
the entities that they

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:34.540 align:middle line:84%
had defeated in battle, they
left that to the females.

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:38.890 align:middle line:84%
The females were the ones that
actually devised the systems

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:43.680 align:middle line:84%
for controlling the
populations of these planets.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did it happen
through crossbreeding?

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:47.280 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: No, no.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.988 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They just
knew how to dominate.

00:11:48.988 --> 00:11:51.550 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: The females were just
adept at that and so they did

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:55.540 align:middle line:84%
all the work that
was necessary to--

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:56.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Subdue a species--

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:57.758 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: That's right.

00:11:57.758 --> 00:12:00.430 align:middle line:84%
Keep the conquered
peoples in line

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:05.650 align:middle line:84%
and fearful and controlled
and contributing their labor

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:07.630 align:middle line:90%
which that's what they did.

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:09.550 align:middle line:90%
They were enslaved.

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:14.150 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, it became rather
than just simple enslavement,

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:18.100 align:middle line:84%
they realized that enslaving
conquered populations was not

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:19.880 align:middle line:90%
the right way to go.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.510 align:middle line:84%
They would simply let them
develop their own society

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:26.430 align:middle line:90%
and contribute money.

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:28.022 align:middle line:90%
OK, just--

00:12:28.022 --> 00:12:29.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Introduce
the monetary system--

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:31.396 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Introduce
the monetary system,

00:12:31.396 --> 00:12:33.190 align:middle line:90%
and banking as they developed.

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:35.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's how they
controlled those societies.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.810 align:middle line:84%
And the females
were the ones who

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:40.630 align:middle line:84%
were drafted to do
that kind of work

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:43.000 align:middle line:84%
while the males went
back out into space

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.700 align:middle line:84%
and conquered a few
more star systems.

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, let's start
on the rest of that story.

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:51.160 align:middle line:84%
So the males are out conquering,
here you have planet Earth.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.589 align:middle line:84%
We have an earth with a
newly developing species.

00:12:53.589 --> 00:12:55.380 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Yeah, before
we get there though,

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:58.300 align:middle line:84%
we have to talk about the
fact that the females began

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:02.699 align:middle line:84%
to realize that they really
were the most important.

00:13:02.699 --> 00:13:04.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, this is
where they become dominant.

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:05.710 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: That's right.

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:06.751 align:middle line:90%
They were more important.

00:13:06.751 --> 00:13:09.240 align:middle line:84%
They were running
these star systems.

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:15.020 align:middle line:84%
They were supervising
and they finally

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:17.870 align:middle line:84%
realized, well, why shouldn't
we have the supreme power?

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:20.690 align:middle line:84%
Why should the
king be in charge?

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And they revolted,
and instead of a king

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:26.960 align:middle line:84%
they replaced the
king with a queen.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And then they started
to assassinate

00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:33.410 align:middle line:84%
the important males to
get them out of the way

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:35.120 align:middle line:90%
and the women took over.

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And as
I recall, it said

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:39.200 align:middle line:84%
that they were breeding
the males of the species

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.210 align:middle line:90%
for shorter lifespans.

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:40.580 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yes.

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:42.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they were
in service to the queen,

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.069 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, to make
sure there was always

00:13:44.069 --> 00:13:45.230 align:middle line:90%
the strongest offspring.

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:47.150 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Well, the queens
put more emphasis on drugs.

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And they had their
scientists developing

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:52.010 align:middle line:84%
these remarkable drugs that
could shorten or lengthen

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:53.240 align:middle line:90%
a lifespan.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:56.600 align:middle line:84%
And it was because the
females were in charge

00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:00.860 align:middle line:84%
that they took that
route of the development

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:03.470 align:middle line:84%
of the medical systems
and drug-related things.

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And eventually they could
extend the life of the queen

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:09.590 align:middle line:90%
beyond an incredible limit.

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:11.996 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you
said even beyond that,

00:14:11.996 --> 00:14:15.020 align:middle line:84%
that the queen had the ability
to transfer consciousness

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.940 align:middle line:84%
into a younger vehicle
and continue her reign.

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:19.530 align:middle line:90%
Like in the movie, "Self/less."

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:20.330 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Exactly.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And eventually the scientists
developed the ability

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:29.150 align:middle line:84%
to develop clones
because the queen wanted

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:31.190 align:middle line:84%
another entity with
spare parts in case

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:33.440 align:middle line:90%
her's wore out which they did.

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:38.570 align:middle line:84%
So they could take the
spare parts, the organs

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:43.520 align:middle line:84%
and the limbs, whatever she
needed and renew her vigor.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And so her lifespan
started to grow.

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:51.080 align:middle line:84%
The queen started to
live to advanced ages.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And then the
scientists developed

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:55.940 align:middle line:84%
even more of a drug
that could even

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:58.920 align:middle line:90%
extend her lifespan even more.

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:02.420 align:middle line:84%
So the people of the
planets that they conquered

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:05.690 align:middle line:84%
began to believe that
the queen was immortal

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:08.330 align:middle line:84%
because she lived beyond
the lifespan of most

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:11.840 align:middle line:84%
of the population and
began to worship her

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:14.510 align:middle line:90%
as divine, eventually.

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:19.350 align:middle line:84%
And so the queens
remained in control.

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:24.530 align:middle line:84%
The men continued to dominate
their conquests of the star

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:28.089 align:middle line:84%
systems, but now the female
warriors also joined in that.

00:15:28.089 --> 00:15:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for that was
that they reached the point

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:34.460 align:middle line:84%
where they started to encounter
civilizations that resisted

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:37.040 align:middle line:90%
and weren't as easy to defeat.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And they had to do something
to change the system.

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:43.670 align:middle line:84%
So they said, why don't we
recruit female warriors too.

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And they did and
that helped also

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:47.810 align:middle line:84%
in the transition from
the male to the female.

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:49.874 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They were vicious.

00:15:49.874 --> 00:15:51.540 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: The females
were more vicious.

00:15:51.540 --> 00:16:01.040 align:middle line:84%
They were less bothered by minor
problems than the males were.

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:04.970 align:middle line:84%
Not that they were more vicious,
they were more efficient.

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:06.220 align:middle line:90%
They were more cold.

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:09.610 align:middle line:84%
They were more cold-blooded
killers than the males were.

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:11.150 align:middle line:90%
Let's put it that way.

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:14.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now, when do we
start descending to earth here

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:15.500 align:middle line:90%
with them?

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.120 align:middle line:84%
And when do we start
getting into crossbreeding

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:18.920 align:middle line:90%
and all that?

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.310 align:middle line:84%
You pick up the story
and tell it in the order

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:22.130 align:middle line:90%
you would like to.

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:25.120 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Well, while they were
developing their civilizations

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:28.610 align:middle line:84%
in Draco, primarily in Draco
which is a star system about

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:31.030 align:middle line:90%
300 light years from us.

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:34.310 align:middle line:84%
The humans in this galaxy
were developing a civilization

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:37.030 align:middle line:90%
in the star system Lyra.

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:40.159 align:middle line:84%
Now, Swerdlow doesn't know
how the humans got here.

00:16:40.159 --> 00:16:41.950 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't know how
the Reptilians got here

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:43.660 align:middle line:90%
in this galaxy.

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:46.240 align:middle line:84%
He does talk about how
the Reptilians evolved

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.464 align:middle line:84%
from the dragonfly,
but he doesn't really

00:16:48.464 --> 00:16:50.380 align:middle line:84%
know how they got into
this particular galaxy.

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:53.680 align:middle line:84%
They just appeared
full grown so to speak.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.660 align:middle line:90%
And the humans were the same.

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:56.590 align:middle line:90%
They just appeared.

00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:58.630 align:middle line:84%
They could have come
from another dimension.

00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:00.590 align:middle line:84%
They could have come
from another star system.

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:02.947 align:middle line:84%
They could have come
from another time period.

00:17:02.947 --> 00:17:05.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Uh, huh, that's where
Adamski's work comes in that's

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:08.020 align:middle line:84%
very interesting because
he said with his contact

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:11.050 align:middle line:84%
with the Venusians and such,
the information he was given

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:14.710 align:middle line:84%
is that this humanoid
form, the human form,

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:19.140 align:middle line:84%
is the most useful
and popular in terms

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:22.760 align:middle line:84%
of the vehicles for incarnating
into throughout the universe.

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:24.699 align:middle line:84%
It's very common, we're
a very common form.

00:17:24.699 --> 00:17:25.740 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yes, it is now.

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:28.680 align:middle line:84%
But in those early
stages, the Lyra

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:30.960 align:middle line:84%
was the only place
the humans existed.

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.460 align:middle line:84%
The human race
existed on planets

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:35.040 align:middle line:90%
in the star system Lyra.

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:38.190 align:middle line:10%
And they had very
peaceful civilizations.

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:39.720 align:middle line:90%
They developed agriculture.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.200 align:middle line:90%
They traded with each other.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.080 align:middle line:84%
And eventually,
they also developed

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:45.060 align:middle line:90%
spacefaring technology.

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:46.854 align:middle line:84%
And they were living
very peacefully.

00:17:46.854 --> 00:17:48.270 align:middle line:84%
There were millions
of them, and I

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:50.103 align:middle line:84%
don't know how many
planets they had in Lyra

00:17:50.103 --> 00:17:52.440 align:middle line:90%
but there were several.

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:55.770 align:middle line:84%
And one day the Reptilians
appeared in the sky

00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:59.130 align:middle line:84%
and decided they
would like to find out

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:01.436 align:middle line:90%
more about these human beings.

00:18:01.436 --> 00:18:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And at first they were friendly,
but then they somehow felt

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:09.540 align:middle line:84%
insulted by the way the
Lyrans regarded them,

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:12.700 align:middle line:90%
and they started to kill them.

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And they destroyed
50 million Lyrans.

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And they destroyed
three of their planets.

00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:21.820 align:middle line:84%
They had the technology to
actually destroy planets.

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:25.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, this huge star
ship, the queen's starship,

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:27.600 align:middle line:84%
the way it's described it
looks like the death star.

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:31.100 align:middle line:84%
An all-seeing eye that vaporizes
whole cities and small planets

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:32.942 align:middle line:90%
that are in the way.

00:18:32.942 --> 00:18:36.540 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Yeah, the death star
that George Lucas talked about

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:40.290 align:middle line:84%
was developed by the
Reptilians as a weapon.

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And it made sense to have
a globular configuration

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:49.040 align:middle line:84%
and a planetary
configuration as a spaceship

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:52.382 align:middle line:84%
than some sleek
aerodynamic thing

00:18:52.382 --> 00:18:54.090 align:middle line:84%
because they could
live inside the planet

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:56.830 align:middle line:84%
while they're traveling through
space, and they did that.

00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:57.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:59.421 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: And they
could keep their animals

00:18:59.421 --> 00:19:02.220 align:middle line:84%
with them, their agriculture
with them, in the planet.

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:05.006 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now they're
attacking the peaceful Lyrans.

00:19:05.006 --> 00:19:05.880 align:middle line:90%
So what happens next?

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.980 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: They wiped
out 50 billion Lyrans.

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:12.850 align:middle line:84%
The Lyrans were unprepared
for such a catastrophe.

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:16.590 align:middle line:84%
It was truly a holocaust and
they created a human diaspora

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:18.380 align:middle line:90%
in the galaxy.

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:22.990 align:middle line:84%
The humans spread to 110
different star systems

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:24.190 align:middle line:90%
eventually.

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:27.160 align:middle line:84%
Many of whom developed
spacefaring technology

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.290 align:middle line:90%
and many of them who did not.

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:38.810 align:middle line:84%
They particularly inhabited
the Pleiades and Procyon

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:41.180 align:middle line:90%
and several other star systems.

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:47.781 align:middle line:84%
And eventually they continued
to connect with each other

00:19:47.781 --> 00:19:50.030 align:middle line:84%
and they developed something
that we now refer to as a

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:51.710 align:middle line:90%
the Federation.

00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:53.660 align:middle line:84%
Some call it the
Galactic Federation.

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:55.220 align:middle line:90%
Some call it the Collective.

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:57.030 align:middle line:84%
Some call it the
Confederation of Light.

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:59.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it's
uniquely human DNA?

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:00.900 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: It's a human thing.

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And they started to learn how
to repel the Reptilian attacks,

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:05.720 align:middle line:90%
and they became good at it.

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:07.430 align:middle line:84%
The Reptilians
left a lot of them

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:11.300 align:middle line:84%
alone as they developed these
other colonies and other star

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:13.970 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:18.050 align:middle line:84%
But the Reptilians, their
spacefaring technology

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:20.300 align:middle line:84%
was so advanced they
could go anywhere

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:24.980 align:middle line:84%
and they eventually discovered
a lot of the human habitats

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:28.870 align:middle line:84%
but they were repelled by
them because the humans did

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:32.050 align:middle line:84%
learn how to develop
the weaponry to do that.

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And some of the humans wound
up here in this solar system.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.000 align:middle line:84%
And at the time they
came here, which

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:47.550 align:middle line:84%
I think Swerdlow said was about
two or three million years ago,

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:50.550 align:middle line:90%
they inhabited two planets--

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:53.550 align:middle line:84%
Mars and a planet
that we now refer to

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:58.480 align:middle line:84%
as Maldek which was the
fourth planet from the sun.

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And they lived peacefully too
just like they had in Lyra.

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And developed trading
with each other,

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:06.940 align:middle line:84%
developed agricultural
societies.

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:09.780 align:middle line:90%
They were not warlike at all.

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:12.730 align:middle line:84%
And then one day,
guess who showed up?

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:13.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Our favorites.

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:14.290 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: The Reptilians.

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:15.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The Reptilians, yep.

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:19.730 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: And they
figured that by that time

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:23.840 align:middle line:84%
according to Alex Collier,
the Reptilians had discovered

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:27.960 align:middle line:84%
that they could use
humans as a food source,

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:30.330 align:middle line:90%
actually, eat human's flesh.

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:34.710 align:middle line:84%
They also had developed
the dinosaur--

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:37.851 align:middle line:90%
dinosaurs as a food source.

00:21:37.851 --> 00:21:39.350 align:middle line:84%
When they came to
this solar system,

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:41.960 align:middle line:84%
they brought their
dinosaurs with them.

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now,
that's interesting to me.

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:45.410 align:middle line:84%
Because I noted
that and I thought

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:48.200 align:middle line:84%
that according to
science dinosaurs

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.310 align:middle line:84%
disappeared 65 million
years ago, way before they

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:51.110 align:middle line:90%
would have come.

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:54.722 align:middle line:84%
So you are saying they
brought some more with them?

00:21:54.722 --> 00:21:56.930 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: What we call the
Jurassic period supposedly

00:21:56.930 --> 00:22:00.470 align:middle line:84%
started 265 million
years ago and terminated

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:03.650 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden 65
million years ago.

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:05.450 align:middle line:90%
That's based on carbon dating.

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:09.090 align:middle line:84%
Carbon dating is
notoriously unreliable.

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:12.120 align:middle line:84%
Swerdlow's time
frame is different.

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:19.250 align:middle line:84%
He claims that they came here
about a million years ago

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:20.190 align:middle line:90%
to this solar system.

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:21.648 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
Reptilians came here.

00:22:21.648 --> 00:22:22.500 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yes.

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:23.860 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty new to the game.

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:26.970 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: There were no humans
here when they got here.

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:29.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, see now, I think
that time frame is way off.

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:31.470 align:middle line:84%
Certainly by the
Vedas and others.

00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:34.170 align:middle line:84%
But let's ignore time frames
and just go with the story

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:37.440 align:middle line:84%
and forget the fact that all
the different researchers

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:43.650 align:middle line:84%
and viewers doing this stuff
are trying to peer into an era

00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:47.070 align:middle line:84%
where time wasn't the same, the
frequencies of the dimension

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:48.570 align:middle line:90%
itself wasn't the same.

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:50.880 align:middle line:84%
And I can see where
this gets very

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:52.860 align:middle line:84%
confusing in these
long time frames.

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:56.470 align:middle line:84%
The Vedas are far, far longer
than that, for example.

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:59.220 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I
almost think it's best

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:01.410 align:middle line:84%
to just leave time
frames out but maybe

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:04.380 align:middle line:84%
go with more concurrent events
so that people don't have

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:07.147 align:middle line:84%
resistance to, yeah, it couldn't
happen because they disappeared

00:23:07.147 --> 00:23:09.730 align:middle line:84%
then, how could these guys have
eaten them when they showed up

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:11.080 align:middle line:90%
64 million years later.

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:14.790 align:middle line:84%
So let's just forget all
that and go with the story.

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Well, in any case,
according to Swerdlow's time

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:22.280 align:middle line:84%
table, the humans did
inhabit Mars and Maldek

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:26.760 align:middle line:84%
before the Reptilians arrived
here and were living peacefully

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:30.270 align:middle line:84%
on those two planets, on the
surface of those two planets.

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And when the Reptilians
showed up here,

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.850 align:middle line:84%
they destroyed
Maldek immediately,

00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:40.060 align:middle line:84%
either with a weapon or just by
simply going by so close to it

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:47.200 align:middle line:84%
that it exploded and millions
of humans on Maldek died.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.720 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them were able
to get off and go to Mars.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.880 align:middle line:90%
But when the death star--

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:55.910 align:middle line:84%
which Swerdlow referred
to as a death star--

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:58.490 align:middle line:84%
went by Mars it stripped
the atmosphere of much

00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:00.500 align:middle line:84%
of its oxygen. So
the Martians were

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:03.080 align:middle line:90%
forced to retreat underground.

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:05.120 align:middle line:84%
So the Maldekians
that survived also

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:08.260 align:middle line:84%
joined the Martians
underground on Mars

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:11.140 align:middle line:90%
when Maldek was destroyed.

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the destruction
of Maldek supposedly

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:16.000 align:middle line:90%
created the asteroid belt--

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.820 align:middle line:84%
that we call now
the asteroid belt.

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:23.620 align:middle line:84%
The Reptilians went on
then and encountered

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:26.260 align:middle line:84%
earth which at that time
was a water planet according

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:29.170 align:middle line:84%
to Swerdlow's
technology time frame.

00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:31.486 align:middle line:84%
And they were able
to dry it out.

00:24:31.486 --> 00:24:33.870 align:middle line:84%
And they went into a mutual
orbit around the Earth

00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:38.230 align:middle line:84%
with their death star, dried
it out, and the water sort of

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:41.280 align:middle line:90%
congealed at the polar regions.

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:42.990 align:middle line:90%
And out of that water--

00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:47.220 align:middle line:84%
out of those oceans emerged two
continents which we refer to

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:50.360 align:middle line:90%
as Lemuria and Atlantis.

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And then they created supposedly
a moon which is artificial--

00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:56.660 align:middle line:90%
our moon is artificial--

00:24:56.660 --> 00:25:02.630 align:middle line:84%
because it was easier to
inhabit Earth from a moon

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:05.860 align:middle line:90%
that was closer than from Venus.

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:08.520 align:middle line:84%
They in turn became the
third planet from the sun.

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:11.370 align:middle line:84%
Their death star
became the planet Venus

00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:17.530 align:middle line:84%
and they inhabited the Earth
and they settled on Lemuria.

00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:21.760 align:middle line:84%
And they lived on
Lemuria by themselves

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:22.997 align:middle line:90%
for around 300,000 years.

00:25:22.997 --> 00:25:24.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and
that's again where

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:27.190 align:middle line:84%
the stories-- so many
different stories come

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:30.220 align:middle line:84%
into this because the
other body of stories

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:33.460 align:middle line:90%
say that they were peace-loving.

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:36.220 align:middle line:84%
As they were developing
this very early development,

00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:39.700 align:middle line:84%
peace-loving humans
there at that time,

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:42.070 align:middle line:84%
is it possible we're now
dropping into something

00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:45.889 align:middle line:84%
called maybe parallel
timelines, parallel realities?

00:25:45.889 --> 00:25:47.180 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: No, I don't think so.

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:47.980 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you why.

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:51.340 align:middle line:84%
Because by that time the
Federation was well-developed,

00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:53.650 align:middle line:84%
and many of the
Federation star systems

00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:56.260 align:middle line:84%
had spacefaring technology
and advanced technology

00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:57.550 align:middle line:90%
and advanced weaponry.

00:25:57.550 --> 00:26:00.190 align:middle line:84%
So they were quite able
to defend themselves

00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:02.320 align:middle line:90%
and to help each other.

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.420 align:middle line:84%
The 110 different
star systems now

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:09.360 align:middle line:84%
became a federation, a true
federation and they traded

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:14.290 align:middle line:84%
and they helped each other with
technology and with education.

00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:19.670 align:middle line:84%
So at that point, the
Federation decided they

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:21.440 align:middle line:84%
we're not going to let
the Reptilians have

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:26.090 align:middle line:90%
this particular solar system.

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And so they sent a fierce
group of humans that we call

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:35.960 align:middle line:84%
the Atlans, A-t-l-a-n-s, to
inhabit the other continent

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:39.650 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, and
that became Atlantis.

00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:40.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But they were human.

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:43.050 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: They were humans.

00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:46.450 align:middle line:90%
But they were the early humans.

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:49.550 align:middle line:84%
They originated in
the Lyran star system.

00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:52.870 align:middle line:84%
They were not created
on this planet.

00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:57.130 align:middle line:84%
They were basically
extraterrestrials.

00:26:57.130 --> 00:27:00.370 align:middle line:84%
Being prehuman, as
we refer to human,

00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:03.570 align:middle line:84%
they did not have
the Reptilian brain.

00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:06.150 align:middle line:84%
But we'll get to
that in a minute.

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:10.810 align:middle line:84%
In any case, the Atlans were
unhappy with the dinosaurs

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:13.080 align:middle line:84%
chomping over their
agricultural settlements

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:16.230 align:middle line:84%
and they went to war
with the Reptilians.

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:19.470 align:middle line:84%
And they had very
sophisticated weaponry.

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:23.460 align:middle line:84%
They had what I think Swerdlow
calls electromagnetic pulse

00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:29.040 align:middle line:84%
weapons which they used
to cause Lemuria to sink

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:32.160 align:middle line:90%
beneath the Pacific Ocean.

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.680 align:middle line:84%
And the Reptilians then
retreated underground

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:36.680 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:41.230 align:middle line:84%
And the humans had the
planet's surface to themselves.

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:44.950 align:middle line:84%
And they were able to
develop a golden civilization

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:47.290 align:middle line:90%
that we call Atlantis.

00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And they had
tremendous technology,

00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:51.910 align:middle line:90%
tremendous resources.

00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:54.820 align:middle line:84%
They were very spiritual
in the beginning.

00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And they were very
loving and helpful

00:27:56.770 --> 00:27:59.470 align:middle line:84%
and they were a
very powerful race.

00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:01.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And agrarian,
very beautiful--

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:02.852 align:middle line:90%
interesting.

00:28:02.852 --> 00:28:04.810 align:middle line:84%
You know, and I've talked
to a number of people

00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:08.430 align:middle line:84%
who have that deep vision and
have been able to look back,

00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:10.900 align:middle line:84%
all the way back to the
beginning into time.

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:18.700 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing that they
do concur with this story on,

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:20.800 align:middle line:84%
is that even during
those times they

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:24.390 align:middle line:90%
were being attacked from above.

00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:28.430 align:middle line:84%
I haven't heard anyone
yet that wasn't aware

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:30.470 align:middle line:84%
that they were under
threat from something

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:32.150 align:middle line:90%
outside of their own culture.

00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:34.760 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Was it above
or was it from below?

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:37.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Above-- they
talk about aircraft,

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:41.120 align:middle line:84%
you know, using
advanced technology.

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.210 align:middle line:84%
You know, particle beam
technology and so forth.

00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:45.751 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The Reptilians had
all that technology underground.

00:28:45.751 --> 00:28:48.360 align:middle line:84%
They had developed a global
train system, a high speed

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:49.160 align:middle line:90%
train system.

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:52.520 align:middle line:84%
They had developed
multi-level civilization

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:53.884 align:middle line:90%
under the planet's surface.

00:28:53.884 --> 00:28:56.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then maybe Atlantis
was under attack from beings

00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:58.290 align:middle line:90%
beyond, as well.

00:28:58.290 --> 00:28:59.290 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: It's possible.

00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:02.377 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know, but I mean,
that disruptive force was there

00:29:02.377 --> 00:29:03.460 align:middle line:90%
even in those golden days.

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:05.907 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Yeah but the
Atlanteans could handle it.

00:29:05.907 --> 00:29:07.240 align:middle line:90%
They had very advanced weaponry.

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:11.380 align:middle line:84%
They had the fire stone
that Cayce talks about.

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:16.520 align:middle line:84%
And they were able
to defend themselves.

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:19.300 align:middle line:84%
The Reptilians
decided that the best

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:23.145 align:middle line:84%
way to get the surface back
was through hybridization,

00:29:23.145 --> 00:29:24.787 align:middle line:90%
and they're very good at this.

00:29:24.787 --> 00:29:26.745 align:middle line:84%
They've used that system
throughout the galaxy.

00:29:26.745 --> 00:29:29.260 align:middle line:90%


00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:33.370 align:middle line:84%
To defeat 21 different star
systems, they've used it.

00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:37.530 align:middle line:84%
So they started abducting
humans from Atlantis

00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:41.050 align:middle line:84%
and mixing their DNA with the
human DNA and creating hybrids.

00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:44.920 align:middle line:84%
The hybrids were then planted
back into Atlantean society

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:46.470 align:middle line:90%
and they began to develop.

00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:48.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's the
Reptilian brain and such was--

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:49.510 align:middle line:90%
not yet?

00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:50.250 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: No, no.

00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:50.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:52.900 align:middle line:10%
>>KASTEN: But they took
over the key positions,

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:55.100 align:middle line:10%
the levers of power.

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:56.820 align:middle line:90%
What we now call--

00:29:56.820 --> 00:30:00.500 align:middle line:84%
during World War II we
called it the fifth column.

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:04.390 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the way that
phrase-- the fifth column--

00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:07.770 align:middle line:84%
where it comes from is
in the Spanish Civil War.

00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:10.900 align:middle line:84%
The Spanish generals had
four columns of troops

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:13.630 align:middle line:84%
and they refer to
the fifth column

00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:17.260 align:middle line:84%
as being already infiltrated
in the population

00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:19.120 align:middle line:84%
and they were weakening
it from within.

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:21.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's exactly the
way the Reptilians operate.

00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:25.270 align:middle line:84%
So the fifth column started to
infiltrate Atlantean society

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:28.660 align:middle line:84%
to the point where they
felt they could now

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:31.660 align:middle line:90%
come in and take over Atlantis.

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:34.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
were the traits

00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:39.150 align:middle line:84%
that started evolving from
the hybridization programs?

00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:42.870 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Well, being
Reptilian, partially Reptilian,

00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:45.370 align:middle line:90%
they were naturally--

00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:48.420 align:middle line:90%
more aggressive.

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:52.200 align:middle line:84%
All of the traits that we now
refer to as compassion, love,

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.540 align:middle line:84%
and affection,
they did not have.

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And they were able to slowly
take over the levers of power.

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:01.130 align:middle line:84%
But more than that
they developed

00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:04.060 align:middle line:90%
a black magic capability.

00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:06.720 align:middle line:90%
We refer to demonology now--

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:10.200 align:middle line:84%
well, Swerdlow claims that
what we refer to as demons

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:13.720 align:middle line:84%
were really Reptilians
living underground.

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:16.990 align:middle line:84%
And they did have
magical capabilities

00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:19.870 align:middle line:90%
because they had control.

00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:23.390 align:middle line:84%
They basically lived in
the fourth dimension,

00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:26.400 align:middle line:84%
the dreamscape, what
we call the dreamscape.

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And so they could control
the humans from that point.

00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:34.450 align:middle line:84%
But the Atlanteans were very
sophisticated spiritually,

00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:35.250 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:37.083 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They had
access to the same thing.

00:31:37.083 --> 00:31:38.700 align:middle line:84%
It might just be
called white magic.

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:39.210 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: White magic, exactly.

00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:40.918 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They had
the same capabilities.

00:31:40.918 --> 00:31:43.330 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yes.

00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:45.850 align:middle line:84%
But in any case,
the Atlanteans began

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:47.900 align:middle line:84%
to realize that the
threat was not from above,

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:50.140 align:middle line:90%
it was from below.

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And they started pointing
their weapons downwards

00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:54.830 align:middle line:90%
instead of upward--

00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:56.830 align:middle line:90%
the pulse weapons.

00:31:56.830 --> 00:32:00.560 align:middle line:84%
And that destabilized
Atlantis, the continent,

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:02.990 align:middle line:84%
and the whole continent
became unstable.

00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:07.390 align:middle line:84%
And the black magic sort of
contributed to that problem.

00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:10.790 align:middle line:84%
And allied with the
volcanic activity,

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:13.490 align:middle line:90%
Atlantis began to sink itself.

00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:16.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and there were
those above ground at that time

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:17.960 align:middle line:84%
that spent decades
of their lives

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:21.320 align:middle line:84%
while this was unfolding
over a long period of time

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:23.930 align:middle line:84%
trying to hold the
energies together

00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:25.830 align:middle line:90%
in trying to counter it.

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:28.220 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: We call them
white magicians verses

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:29.630 align:middle line:90%
the black magicians, yes.

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:32.046 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they worked very
hard to hold that whole gig

00:32:32.046 --> 00:32:34.310 align:middle line:84%
together, and they ended up
going down with the ship.

00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:36.170 align:middle line:84%
As a result, it
caused a lot of damage

00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:37.830 align:middle line:90%
to the people who were there.

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:40.430 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: But prior to
the sinking of Atlantis,

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:43.910 align:middle line:84%
the main portion of which sank
in one night as everyone knows

00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:47.570 align:middle line:90%
now, they were warned by their--

00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:48.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They knew.

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:54.067 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Yes, by their psychics
and by their advanced beings.

00:32:54.067 --> 00:32:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it
was the third time.

00:32:55.650 --> 00:32:57.830 align:middle line:90%
This has been done in stages.

00:32:57.830 --> 00:33:00.325 align:middle line:84%
It started going down from
the north to the midsection

00:33:00.325 --> 00:33:02.450 align:middle line:84%
and finally the south which
was by then a much more

00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:04.180 align:middle line:90%
of a warring condition.

00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:07.420 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Right, and
the Island of Poseidon

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:09.890 align:middle line:84%
was a main [? thing. ?]
By the way,

00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:15.470 align:middle line:84%
prior to that sinking colonies
left Atlantis and started

00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:18.310 align:middle line:90%
colonies like in Greece.

00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:21.380 align:middle line:84%
The early Grecians were
a colony of Atlantis.

00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:24.020 align:middle line:84%
That's why they were really
very similar to the Atlanteans

00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:24.860 align:middle line:90%
in many ways.

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:26.443 align:middle line:84%
But they were a
breakaway civilization

00:33:26.443 --> 00:33:30.180 align:middle line:84%
and the Atlanteans went to
war with them to recover them.

00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:32.860 align:middle line:84%
They didn't like the fact
that they had gone away.

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:35.325 align:middle line:84%
So that also started the
Mediterranean civilizations.

00:33:35.325 --> 00:33:37.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, then you have
the whole Egyptian culture.

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:39.616 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then you
got the whole Egyptian.

00:33:39.616 --> 00:33:41.630 align:middle line:84%
And so there was also a
mass migration to Egypt,

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:43.670 align:middle line:84%
that was the main
one and that was led

00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:45.600 align:middle line:90%
by a high priest called Thoth.

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:48.192 align:middle line:90%
T-h-o-t-h.

00:33:48.192 --> 00:33:50.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The basis of
the hermetic tradition--

00:33:50.150 --> 00:33:52.370 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Right, and I
made the point in my book

00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:56.510 align:middle line:84%
that Egypt seemed to have
sprung out of nothing.

00:33:56.510 --> 00:34:00.755 align:middle line:84%
There was no previous barbarian
civilization in Egypt.

00:34:00.755 --> 00:34:01.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, then again.

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:04.790 align:middle line:84%
When you get back to
alternate timelines,

00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:07.940 align:middle line:84%
the hermetics will say that
Egypt existed concurrently

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:11.840 align:middle line:84%
with Atlantis over a period of a
couple 100,000 years up to date

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:12.770 align:middle line:90%
currently.

00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:15.080 align:middle line:84%
So there was always an
exchange back and forth

00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:17.480 align:middle line:90%
of these cultures, right?

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:21.050 align:middle line:84%
And that changes the way
we view the whole thing.

00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:23.690 align:middle line:84%
If we understand that, and if
they had advanced knowledge,

00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:27.889 align:middle line:84%
each time that Atlantis was
to be destroyed in stages,

00:34:27.889 --> 00:34:31.569 align:middle line:84%
they had these immigrations,
mass immigrations, all along

00:34:31.569 --> 00:34:35.197 align:middle line:84%
to South America, the Yucatan
even Europe and Egypt.

00:34:35.197 --> 00:34:37.530 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: To the Yucatan,
that's right, Central America,

00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:40.560 align:middle line:84%
South America, and
Egypt and Greece--

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:44.500 align:middle line:84%
the civilization
that started Greece,

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:47.179 align:middle line:84%
the Atlanteans went to
war with the Grecians

00:34:47.179 --> 00:34:49.730 align:middle line:84%
and that's covered
in Plato's book--

00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:54.260 align:middle line:84%
Plato's writings-- about that
war, how valiantly the Grecians

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:56.449 align:middle line:90%
were able to defend themselves.

00:34:56.449 --> 00:34:58.054 align:middle line:90%
But in any case--

00:34:58.054 --> 00:34:59.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because these
were basically humans.

00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:01.095 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: They were humans.

00:35:01.095 --> 00:35:06.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They were humans as
in the upper-Egyptian times.

00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:10.230 align:middle line:84%
They valued love and family
and loyalty and beauty

00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:11.105 align:middle line:90%
of all kinds.

00:35:11.105 --> 00:35:13.500 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yes, they were human.

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:16.410 align:middle line:84%
They were descended from
the original Lyrans,

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:17.815 align:middle line:90%
as were the Atlanteans.

00:35:17.815 --> 00:35:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And they were
taller than we are.

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:21.750 align:middle line:84%
They were godlike
beings in many ways.

00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:24.175 align:middle line:84%
They were not like the human
race as we know it today.

00:35:24.175 --> 00:35:25.550 align:middle line:84%
They were far in
advance of that.

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:27.008 align:middle line:84%
That's why they
were able to create

00:35:27.008 --> 00:35:31.790 align:middle line:84%
such a huge incredible
civilization in Egypt--

00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:36.920 align:middle line:84%
the pyramids, the incredible
obelisks, the statuary.

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:40.860 align:middle line:84%
There was no barbarian
stage in Egypt.

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And I made the point in my book
that it came without mother,

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:44.390 align:middle line:90%
without father.

00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:45.530 align:middle line:90%
It just appeared.

00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:46.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It appeared.

00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:48.576 align:middle line:84%
And again, that's
where you have to look

00:35:48.576 --> 00:35:51.260 align:middle line:84%
at these alternate timelines
now and say, oh, well, of course

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:55.520 align:middle line:84%
it was because it had already
existed for tens of thousands

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:57.031 align:middle line:84%
of years if not
more prior to that

00:35:57.031 --> 00:35:59.030 align:middle line:84%
that's not acknowledged
because it's buried deep

00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:00.320 align:middle line:90%
under the sands.

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:02.900 align:middle line:84%
We can't see the physical
evidence of early Egypt.

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:04.740 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Right,
there is some evidence

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:09.110 align:middle line:84%
that there were pyramids
and very sophisticated

00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:12.255 align:middle line:84%
temples as early as
10,000 years ago.

00:36:12.255 --> 00:36:13.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:16.220 align:middle line:84%
And some of the work Carmen
Boulter is doing right now

00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:17.480 align:middle line:90%
is fascinating.

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:22.640 align:middle line:84%
Those treasures that showed up
not far from Gobeckli Tepi that

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:26.630 align:middle line:84%
have the sarcophagus that looks
virtually identical to Tut's.

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:32.630 align:middle line:84%
It has those statuary of the
various Egyptian gods, right?

00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:38.650 align:middle line:84%
Including Amenhotep IV, or
Akhenaten, in this cache

00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:42.530 align:middle line:84%
and also his father
Amenhotep III, right?

00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And those have been dated,
those are little statues,

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:48.740 align:middle line:84%
very fine little statues
and they're carved of wood

00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:51.080 align:middle line:84%
and dipped in gold,
covered in gold.

00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:55.480 align:middle line:84%
And they did some scratch tests
of carbon dating on the wood.

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:57.670 align:middle line:90%
Those are 11,000 years old.

00:36:57.670 --> 00:37:01.030 align:middle line:84%
Those were Atlantean
artifacts that past on

00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:02.120 align:middle line:90%
through the family.

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:03.550 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: The Atlanteans
had so much gold they

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:04.940 align:middle line:90%
didn't know what to do with it.

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:09.280 align:middle line:84%
They plated their
buildings with it.

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:13.390 align:middle line:84%
They wove their
garments with gold.

00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:17.230 align:middle line:84%
And so the Egyptians naturally
brought that capability over

00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:18.160 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:19.743 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They did
and so some of what

00:37:19.743 --> 00:37:22.000 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing in the great
exhibits around the world--

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.650 align:middle line:84%
the Louvre, British
Museum, and those.

00:37:23.650 --> 00:37:26.080 align:middle line:84%
I've been there, I haven't
been to the one in Cairo.

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:28.560 align:middle line:84%
Those may be Atlantean
artifacts we're looking at.

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:30.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, maybe heirlooms
that have been passed down.

00:37:30.850 --> 00:37:34.000 align:middle line:84%
They may not even be from
that dynasty, for example.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.120 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: That's right, and
the Egyptians did work in gold.

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:39.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A very
sophisticated culture

00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:42.201 align:middle line:84%
with board games and beautiful
jewelry and instruments.

00:37:42.201 --> 00:37:45.310 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: And technology, yes,
and the medical capabilities.

00:37:45.310 --> 00:37:48.300 align:middle line:84%
They were actually able to
remove cataracts from the eyes.

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:49.579 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, brain surgery.

00:37:49.579 --> 00:37:50.620 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Brain surgery--

00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:56.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's because
they were prehuman.

00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:58.690 align:middle line:84%
What we call human
beings now are different.

00:37:58.690 --> 00:38:00.940 align:middle line:84%
It's different, and we'll
talk about that in a minute.

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:02.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now,
let's get to that part

00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:03.610 align:middle line:84%
when you're done with
this part because we

00:38:03.610 --> 00:38:05.920 align:middle line:84%
want to see where we ended
up with this Reptilian brain

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:06.400 align:middle line:90%
for one.

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:07.540 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: But I just
want us to point out

00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:09.834 align:middle line:84%
that it was Thoth, who
was an Atlantean that

00:38:09.834 --> 00:38:10.750 align:middle line:90%
designed and built the

00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:13.240 align:middle line:90%
Great Pyramid of Giza.

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:15.160 align:middle line:84%
And there was far
more to those pyramids

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:17.050 align:middle line:84%
technologically speaking
than we understand.

00:38:17.050 --> 00:38:18.925 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely,
and again the hermetics

00:38:18.925 --> 00:38:21.130 align:middle line:84%
date the Great Pyramid
at 85,000 years.

00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:24.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, OK, well, I
think Robert Anthony West--

00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:28.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He told me he
thought maybe 35,000 years.

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:30.770 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: John Anthony
West said 35,000?

00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:31.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He did.

00:38:31.570 --> 00:38:32.980 align:middle line:84%
In one interview
with me a long time

00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:35.480 align:middle line:84%
ago, I didn't really hear him
talk about it much after that.

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:39.062 align:middle line:84%
But I do know this, recently
at a conference in Sedona,

00:38:39.062 --> 00:38:40.770 align:middle line:84%
I attended the second
day, not the first.

00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:42.370 align:middle line:84%
And on the first
night, Robert Schalk

00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:44.990 align:middle line:84%
was chatting casually
with someone.

00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:49.132 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you can't talk
about it publicly, so to speak,

00:38:49.132 --> 00:38:50.590 align:middle line:84%
because there's no
place to put it.

00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:53.260 align:middle line:84%
But when he first
saw the Great Pyramid

00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:55.180 align:middle line:84%
he thought it was around
100,000 years old.

00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:58.090 align:middle line:84%
So that overlays also
with the hermetic text

00:38:58.090 --> 00:38:59.860 align:middle line:90%
that it's 85,000 years old.

00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:00.735 align:middle line:90%
This changes history.

00:39:00.735 --> 00:39:03.026 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Well, it was
Atlantean technology, certainly.

00:39:03.026 --> 00:39:04.901 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Exactly,
concurrent with Atlantis--

00:39:04.901 --> 00:39:06.609 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Yes, concurrent
with Atlantis--

00:39:06.609 --> 00:39:09.100 align:middle line:84%
as some of the Greek temples
were really remarkable too.

00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:09.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:10.000 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Because
they were concurrent.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very Atlantean--

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:14.830 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Yeah, so yes,
the technology was amazing.

00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:18.340 align:middle line:84%
And there was a temple,
the temple of Osiris

00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:23.350 align:middle line:84%
is it that's also built
on a prior temple that

00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:25.782 align:middle line:84%
was supposed to be about at
least 10,000 years old, if I'm

00:39:25.782 --> 00:39:26.582 align:middle line:90%
correct.

00:39:26.582 --> 00:39:29.015 align:middle line:90%


00:39:29.015 --> 00:39:30.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The history
is under the sand.

00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:33.140 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: It's
under the sand, yes.

00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And by the time Atlantis
actually sank so many of them

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:42.000 align:middle line:84%
had left and migrated
to other places

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:47.130 align:middle line:84%
that human civilization
sprung up in those places.

00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:52.390 align:middle line:84%
But the war continued between
the Reptilians and the humans.

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:54.260 align:middle line:90%
It did not go away.

00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:58.980 align:middle line:84%
And the struggle got
pretty fierce again

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:02.100 align:middle line:84%
because the Reptilians
were actually

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:05.610 align:middle line:84%
coming out through the
openings and having

00:40:05.610 --> 00:40:10.650 align:middle line:84%
their battles between the humans
continuing with the Reptilians.

00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:15.830 align:middle line:84%
And the humans had developed
spacefaring technology

00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:17.740 align:middle line:90%
on Atlantis, as you know.

00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And they were already attacking
the Reptilian colonies

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:24.750 align:middle line:90%
on the moon, as well.

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:27.890 align:middle line:84%
And the Maldekians were
a part of that also.

00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:34.740 align:middle line:84%
There was a council called
in the galaxy of Andromeda

00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:37.610 align:middle line:84%
to decide on how to
reconcile the two

00:40:37.610 --> 00:40:40.370 align:middle line:90%
civilizations on this planet.

00:40:40.370 --> 00:40:45.550 align:middle line:84%
How to cease the warfare and
evolve a peaceful civilization

00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:46.860 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:49.450 align:middle line:84%
And at that council,
they decided

00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:52.210 align:middle line:84%
that they were going
to create a new race

00:40:52.210 --> 00:40:56.580 align:middle line:84%
and it would be part
human and part Reptilian.

00:40:56.580 --> 00:41:00.570 align:middle line:84%
Humans of course, did not want
any part of the Reptilian DNA.

00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:04.620 align:middle line:84%
But 12 human civilizations were
combined with some Reptilian

00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:09.550 align:middle line:90%
DNA as part of the deal.

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:12.310 align:middle line:84%
The most active human
race involved in that

00:41:12.310 --> 00:41:15.760 align:middle line:84%
were the Elohim, they were
humans from a very distant star

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:22.510 align:middle line:84%
system but they were humans
who had originated on Lyra.

00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:24.910 align:middle line:84%
So that's how the human
race was created according

00:41:24.910 --> 00:41:30.980 align:middle line:84%
to Swerdlow's timeline, around
40,000 or 50,000 years ago,

00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:37.560 align:middle line:84%
and what became the Garden
of Eden in northern Iraq.

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:39.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [INAUDIBLE] work, yep.

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:42.300 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: And that human
race of which we now

00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:48.040 align:middle line:84%
are the descendants and that we
now call homo sapiens sapien,

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:50.400 align:middle line:90%
does have the Reptilian brain.

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:52.830 align:middle line:84%
So they're much different
than the Atlanteans.

00:41:52.830 --> 00:41:55.320 align:middle line:84%
We are much different
than the Atlanteans.

00:41:55.320 --> 00:42:00.276 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But there are still
pure humans that exist here.

00:42:00.276 --> 00:42:01.400 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: They still exist.

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:04.520 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: They do
and they come back.

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:06.630 align:middle line:84%
I think they incarnate at
various periods of time,

00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:10.220 align:middle line:84%
particularly as in
the past when darkness

00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:14.000 align:middle line:84%
seems to be taking over,
these cast of characters

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.180 align:middle line:84%
do come back and try to
inculcate some knowledge

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:18.950 align:middle line:84%
and light and
higher understanding

00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:20.690 align:middle line:90%
into humanity at those times.

00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:24.206 align:middle line:84%
And often times it doesn't
last or it doesn't take seed

00:42:24.206 --> 00:42:25.580 align:middle line:84%
because there are
a lot of forces

00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:27.164 align:middle line:90%
that do work against that.

00:42:27.164 --> 00:42:29.330 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Right, and I
understand that some of those

00:42:29.330 --> 00:42:34.509 align:middle line:84%
became what we call the masters
in Tibet, or some of those.

00:42:34.509 --> 00:42:36.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They think
they're all over the planet.

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:37.120 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: They're
all over the planet.

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:38.000 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.070 align:middle line:90%
And they have mystery schools.

00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:40.190 align:middle line:90%
They founded mystery schools.

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:41.820 align:middle line:84%
And I think they're
hermetic mystery schools.

00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:43.278 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That is
one of them, yes.

00:42:43.278 --> 00:42:45.720 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: And so
a lot of human--

00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:47.640 align:middle line:90%
our type of human--

00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:49.670 align:middle line:84%
had gone to these
mystery schools

00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:52.580 align:middle line:84%
and were able to develop a
higher spirituality thanks

00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:55.020 align:middle line:90%
to the Atlanteans.

00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:58.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you take this
notion that the human being has

00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:00.920 align:middle line:84%
now been bred with
the Reptilian brain,

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:02.489 align:middle line:84%
which is oriented
towards survival,

00:43:02.489 --> 00:43:03.530 align:middle line:90%
but also with the Lyran--

00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:04.100 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: And fear.

00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:04.900 align:middle line:90%
And fear.

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:06.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and
fear, absolutely,

00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:08.390 align:middle line:90%
and the Lyran upper traits--

00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:10.430 align:middle line:90%
higher traits of humanity--

00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:12.740 align:middle line:84%
you start looking at
the complex species that

00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:14.450 align:middle line:90%
is known as the human being.

00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:16.730 align:middle line:84%
And in your book, you
spend a good amount

00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:22.370 align:middle line:84%
of time on World War II and
not just the personality

00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:25.820 align:middle line:84%
traits but the training
that their soldiers

00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:29.910 align:middle line:84%
were subjected to from
Hirohito and from Hitler.

00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:32.360 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Right, and the
reason I was doing that was I

00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:34.550 align:middle line:84%
wanted to point out how
vicious the Reptilians were

00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:38.630 align:middle line:84%
because the Reptilians
basically were behind the Nazis

00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:42.620 align:middle line:84%
and also the Kaiser
in World War II.

00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And they were vicious,
they were vicious killers.

00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:50.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, not only that,
the thing that struck me is

00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:53.990 align:middle line:84%
that the systems in which they
brought the boys up under,

00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:56.390 align:middle line:84%
those military systems,
and the military training

00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:57.620 align:middle line:90%
of the youth--

00:43:57.620 --> 00:44:01.520 align:middle line:84%
whether it was Hitler's youth
or whether it was Hirohito's, I

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:04.460 align:middle line:84%
don't know what the
equivalent name of his youth--

00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:08.870 align:middle line:84%
and this goes right into British
boarding school and boarding

00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:09.970 align:middle line:90%
schools around the world.

00:44:09.970 --> 00:44:10.540 align:middle line:90%
It's all the same.

00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:12.123 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: And Japan
had the equivalent

00:44:12.123 --> 00:44:15.080 align:middle line:84%
of that, that same type
of educational system.

00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:17.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These systems-- and
I know some of these people

00:44:17.570 --> 00:44:18.530 align:middle line:90%
well--

00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:20.230 align:middle line:84%
breed a different
kind of human being.

00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:22.105 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Yeah, They're
vicious and they have

00:44:22.105 --> 00:44:23.300 align:middle line:90%
no they have no conscience.

00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:24.440 align:middle line:90%
They have no heart.

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:27.650 align:middle line:84%
They kill just
like the Nazis did.

00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:30.170 align:middle line:84%
One of them reported just
shooting women and children

00:44:30.170 --> 00:44:31.550 align:middle line:90%
for sport.

00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:34.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and also,
the Nanking massacre

00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:37.330 align:middle line:84%
or the rape of Nanking is one
of the most disgusting events

00:44:37.330 --> 00:44:39.720 align:middle line:84%
that's ever happened in
quote, "human history."

00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:41.470 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: That's why
I wanted to cover it.

00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:43.550 align:middle line:84%
Because what I wanted
to do was make sure

00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:48.520 align:middle line:84%
people understand just how
conscienceless and vicious

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:49.510 align:middle line:90%
the Reptilians are.

00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:53.830 align:middle line:84%
They have no affection as we
understand affection and love.

00:44:53.830 --> 00:44:55.820 align:middle line:90%
They have no heart chakra.

00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:58.470 align:middle line:84%
So for them it's just a matter
of domination and conquest.

00:44:58.470 --> 00:44:59.830 align:middle line:90%
That's all they think about.

00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:03.000 align:middle line:84%
When they encounter
a new star system,

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.605 align:middle line:84%
it's conquest that they have
in mind, not friendship.

00:45:07.605 --> 00:45:09.730 align:middle line:84%
All they're concerned about
is taking all the time.

00:45:09.730 --> 00:45:11.105 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But how
does this work?

00:45:11.105 --> 00:45:14.500 align:middle line:84%
So you have a system that
brings out the Reptilian

00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:17.770 align:middle line:84%
characteristics in people,
these military schools,

00:45:17.770 --> 00:45:22.870 align:middle line:84%
these elite boarding schools
that do horrid types of hazing,

00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:25.240 align:middle line:84%
that create an
absolute dominance

00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:29.140 align:middle line:84%
over another submission,
absolute acquiescence--

00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:31.505 align:middle line:84%
robots to follow orders no
matter how cruel they are.

00:45:31.505 --> 00:45:33.879 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: And what happened
in Auschwitz and all of that?

00:45:33.879 --> 00:45:35.814 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, but
these are human beings.

00:45:35.814 --> 00:45:37.230 align:middle line:84%
These are human
beings doing this.

00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:37.950 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Well, yes,
these are human beings,

00:45:37.950 --> 00:45:39.550 align:middle line:90%
but look at it this way.

00:45:39.550 --> 00:45:43.420 align:middle line:84%
We do know that the
Reptilians do live underground

00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:45.070 align:middle line:84%
in the third dimension,
some of them.

00:45:45.070 --> 00:45:47.770 align:middle line:84%
But mostly, they live
in the fourth dimension

00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:50.550 align:middle line:90%
which is not physical.

00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:52.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it's just
the next phase off the real.

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:53.380 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: It's
the next phase up,

00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:55.540 align:middle line:84%
but it also inhabits
the dreamscape.

00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And many of these men that
became vicious killers

00:45:58.990 --> 00:46:02.920 align:middle line:84%
were programmed through
the fourth dimension

00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:05.080 align:middle line:84%
in their dreamscape--
through the dreamscape.

00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And James Bartley
talks about that

00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:09.312 align:middle line:84%
in great detail in his
books, how that happens,

00:46:09.312 --> 00:46:10.520 align:middle line:90%
how they are able to do that.

00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:12.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's how they
prepare a nation for war.

00:46:12.670 --> 00:46:17.800 align:middle line:84%
They prepare these
killers internally

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:23.200 align:middle line:84%
through the dreamscape to
become totally unconscious

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:24.580 align:middle line:90%
of human suffering.

00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:26.560 align:middle line:84%
They have no regard
for human suffering.

00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:28.330 align:middle line:90%
To them it's just a game.

00:46:28.330 --> 00:46:29.380 align:middle line:90%
They kill just like that.

00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:31.254 align:middle line:84%
And that's what happened
with the First World

00:46:31.254 --> 00:46:35.640 align:middle line:84%
War with the Kaiser when
the German army went

00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:37.170 align:middle line:90%
through Belgium.

00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:39.406 align:middle line:84%
And I made a whole point
of that in the book.

00:46:39.406 --> 00:46:40.780 align:middle line:84%
You've read that
part, I believe?

00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:41.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I did.

00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:44.460 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: How vicious.

00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:47.680 align:middle line:84%
Belgium was just a
corridor to France.

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:51.580 align:middle line:84%
The Germans had declared war
on France not on Belgium.

00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:53.644 align:middle line:84%
And they violated the
neutrality treaty.

00:46:53.644 --> 00:46:55.060 align:middle line:84%
So when they went
through Belgium,

00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:58.360 align:middle line:84%
they started killing
civilians randomly.

00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:02.770 align:middle line:84%
They massacred 100,000
people 6,000 of which

00:47:02.770 --> 00:47:04.270 align:middle line:90%
were by execution.

00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:07.210 align:middle line:84%
And they had no
reason to do that.

00:47:07.210 --> 00:47:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And they bayoneted
little babies.

00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:16.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, I made that point simply to
show what kind of human society

00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:19.630 align:middle line:84%
can be created by
Reptilian influence.

00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:21.730 align:middle line:90%
That's why I made the point.

00:47:21.730 --> 00:47:23.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I
understand that.

00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:27.430 align:middle line:84%
And when we look at
ourselves and we see that,

00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:30.880 align:middle line:84%
in our own histories, the
type of cruelty any one of us

00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:33.070 align:middle line:84%
may have been capable
of at one time

00:47:33.070 --> 00:47:35.560 align:middle line:84%
that we couldn't even
begin to understand today

00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:37.030 align:middle line:90%
in modern times, for example.

00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:38.170 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Right, but
I think the human race

00:47:38.170 --> 00:47:39.610 align:middle line:90%
itself is essentially decent.

00:47:39.610 --> 00:47:42.340 align:middle line:84%
The human race is
essentially decent.

00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And the brutality comes
from that mixture of the DNA

00:47:47.410 --> 00:47:48.942 align:middle line:90%
from the Reptilians.

00:47:48.942 --> 00:47:52.480 align:middle line:84%
And since they are in positions
of power throughout the globe

00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:58.990 align:middle line:84%
through the Illuminati, they
can transfer that brutality

00:47:58.990 --> 00:48:01.720 align:middle line:84%
to their minions, to
their people under them.

00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:04.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So really, it shows
me that one thing that must

00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:06.520 align:middle line:90%
become obsolete are militaries.

00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:09.100 align:middle line:84%
All kinds of military
training ultimately,

00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:13.120 align:middle line:84%
this has to become obsolete
on this planet in order for it

00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:15.262 align:middle line:90%
to recover itself, right?

00:48:15.262 --> 00:48:16.720 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Yes, and
that will happen

00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:18.470 align:middle line:90%
as human consciousness expands.

00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:19.270 align:middle line:90%
That's the game.

00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:21.310 align:middle line:84%
The game is expanding
human conscious.

00:48:21.310 --> 00:48:23.280 align:middle line:84%
Once we reach a
certain level, we'll

00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:26.320 align:middle line:84%
be free of all Reptilian
influence completely.

00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:30.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we still
have a big roadblock here

00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:33.490 align:middle line:90%
and that is monetary systems.

00:48:33.490 --> 00:48:36.040 align:middle line:84%
So one of the greatest fears
in the life of human beings

00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:38.650 align:middle line:84%
is that they don't have
the means to survive.

00:48:38.650 --> 00:48:41.590 align:middle line:84%
Or if they don't go along with
the program, even doing things

00:48:41.590 --> 00:48:43.480 align:middle line:84%
they don't like doing,
that they're not

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:45.940 align:middle line:84%
going to be able to survive
or feed their family.

00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:50.170 align:middle line:84%
This is more insidious,
less obvious,

00:48:50.170 --> 00:48:52.090 align:middle line:84%
but more insidious
on a lot of levels

00:48:52.090 --> 00:48:55.090 align:middle line:84%
than even the overt
means of taking over.

00:48:55.090 --> 00:48:58.150 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Right, and that's
why half of the human race

00:48:58.150 --> 00:48:59.890 align:middle line:90%
lives in poverty half of it.

00:48:59.890 --> 00:49:03.830 align:middle line:84%
Fully, half of the human race
lives on less than $2.50 a day,

00:49:03.830 --> 00:49:04.630 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:11.970 align:middle line:84%
One third live on
less than $1.25 a day.

00:49:11.970 --> 00:49:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's because
the Reptilians

00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:16.549 align:middle line:90%
control the banking--

00:49:16.549 --> 00:49:17.840 align:middle line:90%
I shouldn't say the Reptilians.

00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:19.220 align:middle line:84%
We have to talk
about the Illuminati.

00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:19.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
that's what I was

00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:22.040 align:middle line:84%
going to get to that what we
call the Power Elite-- now,

00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:23.498 align:middle line:84%
in your book, you
say they are kind

00:49:23.498 --> 00:49:29.510 align:middle line:84%
of 50/50 admixture of human, the
modern human and Reptilian DNA.

00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:34.010 align:middle line:84%
So is this more going into
David Icke's territory.

00:49:34.010 --> 00:49:35.150 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Sort of, sort of.

00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:38.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So explain this to us
and explain your understanding.

00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:40.620 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: When the Reptilian
DNA reaches a certain point,

00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:44.900 align:middle line:84%
they are able to shape shift and
look human when they need to.

00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:46.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I will
tell you something.

00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:50.090 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I'm supposed
to tell this or not.

00:49:50.090 --> 00:49:51.770 align:middle line:90%
In fact, David told me this.

00:49:51.770 --> 00:49:52.770 align:middle line:90%
David Icke told me this.

00:49:52.770 --> 00:49:54.110 align:middle line:90%
We're friends.

00:49:54.110 --> 00:49:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And he said that he
spoke with someone

00:49:57.140 --> 00:50:02.150 align:middle line:84%
in the military who he knew
very well who was attending

00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:06.200 align:middle line:90%
a speech by George Bush Sr.

00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:08.990 align:middle line:84%
And the man said, he
was totally freaked out

00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:10.999 align:middle line:84%
because he didn't know
about any of this stuff.

00:50:10.999 --> 00:50:13.040 align:middle line:84%
But that's what he saw
happening with George Bush

00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:14.765 align:middle line:90%
Sr. He was shape shifting.

00:50:14.765 --> 00:50:16.890 align:middle line:84%
And he saw it with his own
eyes and he was shocked.

00:50:16.890 --> 00:50:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's the only reason he
even spoke to David about it

00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:20.660 align:middle line:84%
because he was
straight military.

00:50:20.660 --> 00:50:23.240 align:middle line:84%
This world does
not exist for him.

00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:24.950 align:middle line:84%
So that just was a
little fantastic.

00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:26.450 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: There's
a video on YouTube

00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:29.360 align:middle line:84%
that shows George Bush
Sr.'s eyes becoming slits.

00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:30.885 align:middle line:84%
Have you seen that
video on YouTube?

00:50:30.885 --> 00:50:32.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But I always
wonder-- if it's

00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:33.500 align:middle line:90%
YouTube you have to wonder.

00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:34.916 align:middle line:84%
But I thought that
was interesting

00:50:34.916 --> 00:50:37.550 align:middle line:84%
that this dyed in the
wool military man said,

00:50:37.550 --> 00:50:38.930 align:middle line:90%
I saw it with my own eyes.

00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:40.400 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yeah, that's amazing.

00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:41.200 align:middle line:90%
Truly.

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:43.464 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about this 50/50 hybrid

00:50:43.464 --> 00:50:44.630 align:middle line:90%
and what they're doing here.

00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:45.620 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: They
became the royalty

00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:46.994 align:middle line:84%
that we know as
European royalty,

00:50:46.994 --> 00:50:52.580 align:middle line:84%
because they had a larger
admixture of Reptilian DNA.

00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:54.740 align:middle line:84%
And the reason they
call them bluebloods

00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:57.170 align:middle line:84%
was because they
have more copper

00:50:57.170 --> 00:50:59.300 align:middle line:84%
in their system and
the copper turns

00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:01.370 align:middle line:90%
the blood somewhat bluish.

00:51:01.370 --> 00:51:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And so they became
known as bluebloods.

00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And they were in charge of
all of the basic civilizations

00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:09.290 align:middle line:84%
in Europe and all
over the planet.

00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:14.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, and Hitler
was in league with them.

00:51:14.090 --> 00:51:16.760 align:middle line:84%
But Hitler, himself,
wasn't Reptilian.

00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:18.930 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Well, his father
was really a Rothschild.

00:51:18.930 --> 00:51:21.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I was going
to say, and not only that,

00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:22.850 align:middle line:84%
there is a little
book that I read

00:51:22.850 --> 00:51:25.370 align:middle line:84%
years ago called "Hitler's
Secret Backers" written

00:51:25.370 --> 00:51:27.620 align:middle line:90%
by one of the Warburgs.

00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And he was talking about
how those families--

00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:31.700 align:middle line:84%
the big banking
families in America--

00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:34.250 align:middle line:84%
were the ones who
gave the lion's

00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:36.895 align:middle line:84%
share of the original funding
to Hitler to get started, get

00:51:36.895 --> 00:51:39.230 align:middle line:84%
his uniforms, and make
a presence in the world.

00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:40.900 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Allen Dulles
was part of that.

00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:42.483 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
Dulles was part of it.

00:51:42.483 --> 00:51:49.780 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: And also Allen Dulles
and his brother John Foster

00:51:49.780 --> 00:51:51.080 align:middle line:90%
Dulles--

00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:56.120 align:middle line:84%
the bluebloods basically have
controlled our civilization

00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:58.280 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of years now.

00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And the Reptilians
keep us, the population

00:52:01.730 --> 00:52:04.130 align:middle line:84%
in a dumbed down
state, because they

00:52:04.130 --> 00:52:06.770 align:middle line:84%
know that we have the capability
of expanding our consciousness

00:52:06.770 --> 00:52:09.750 align:middle line:84%
and eventually reaching into
the higher dimensions, which

00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:10.550 align:middle line:90%
they can't do.

00:52:10.550 --> 00:52:11.540 align:middle line:90%
They can't do that.

00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:11.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm, mm.

00:52:11.590 --> 00:52:12.420 align:middle line:90%
They don't have the refinement.

00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:13.870 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: So we
have the capability,

00:52:13.870 --> 00:52:15.170 align:middle line:84%
and that's why they
are afraid of us.

00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:16.010 align:middle line:90%
They know that.

00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:16.810 align:middle line:90%
They know that.

00:52:16.810 --> 00:52:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And they keep us subdued through
propaganda and mind control.

00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:25.620 align:middle line:84%
Mind control is their main
technique, and hybridisation.

00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And all the abductions the
whole abduction scenario

00:52:29.330 --> 00:52:32.930 align:middle line:84%
is for the purposes
of hybridisation.

00:52:32.930 --> 00:52:35.780 align:middle line:84%
They are creating
hybrids in large numbers

00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:38.250 align:middle line:90%
all over the planet.

00:52:38.250 --> 00:52:42.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, the hybrid body is not able
to accommodate a human soul.

00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:45.300 align:middle line:84%
A human soul cannot
enter a hybrid body.

00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:48.030 align:middle line:90%
There's something about the DNA.

00:52:48.030 --> 00:52:53.230 align:middle line:84%
So when we deal with hybrids,
we're dealing with aliens.

00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:57.480 align:middle line:84%
And as the hybrid population
grows and the more human

00:52:57.480 --> 00:53:00.480 align:middle line:84%
looking hybrids start to
take over all the positions

00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:04.770 align:middle line:84%
of power, eventually the human--
the spiritually-based humans--

00:53:04.770 --> 00:53:05.820 align:middle line:90%
will be dispossessed.

00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:08.420 align:middle line:90%


00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:10.672 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you
see this as a given?

00:53:10.672 --> 00:53:11.880 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: I see it happening.

00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:12.840 align:middle line:90%
That's their plan.

00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:13.640 align:middle line:90%
That's the plan.

00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:14.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know
that's their plan,

00:53:14.810 --> 00:53:16.311 align:middle line:84%
but we're also
starting to remember.

00:53:16.311 --> 00:53:18.101 align:middle line:84%
We're starting to wake
up at the same time.

00:53:18.101 --> 00:53:20.360 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Yes, OK, that's
true, and the Federation

00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:23.817 align:middle line:84%
is helping us to grow up,
to expand our consciousness.

00:53:23.817 --> 00:53:25.150 align:middle line:90%
So that's the game we're in now.

00:53:25.150 --> 00:53:27.080 align:middle line:90%
It's a stalemate really.

00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:31.530 align:middle line:84%
If the human consciousness
can expand enough

00:53:31.530 --> 00:53:37.370 align:middle line:84%
before the hybrid population
reaches the point of takeover.

00:53:37.370 --> 00:53:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And we also have to talk about
the robotics part of this.

00:53:40.130 --> 00:53:42.088 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah, and
the transhumanist part.

00:53:42.088 --> 00:53:44.750 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Transhumanism
and the singularity.

00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:46.657 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That is a
pretty evil agenda.

00:53:46.657 --> 00:53:48.240 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: That's
also Reptilian based.

00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:48.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:53:48.830 --> 00:53:50.660 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Because they
control technology.

00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:51.650 align:middle line:90%
They control the media.

00:53:51.650 --> 00:53:52.924 align:middle line:90%
They control Hollywood.

00:53:52.924 --> 00:53:54.340 align:middle line:84%
All of that is
under the control--

00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:56.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And if you control
all of that and you create--

00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:59.090 align:middle line:84%
in a kind of a mass
understanding--

00:53:59.090 --> 00:54:02.340 align:middle line:84%
that you're just flesh
and it's dust to dust

00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:05.700 align:middle line:84%
and all this spiritual
nonsense is fairy tales,

00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:07.730 align:middle line:84%
then you create a need
for their product.

00:54:07.730 --> 00:54:11.360 align:middle line:84%
Because these people are
terrified of dying because they

00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:14.000 align:middle line:90%
think they cease to exist.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.610 align:middle line:84%
So you got to find something
else to be able transfer that--

00:54:16.610 --> 00:54:20.447 align:middle line:90%
not soul-- but mind into, right?

00:54:20.447 --> 00:54:22.280 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: And once
you're dead, you're dead?

00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:24.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But if the rest of
the planet says, no, not really,

00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:25.580 align:middle line:90%
you just reincarnate.

00:54:25.580 --> 00:54:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, you learned a thing
or two and do better next time.

00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:28.970 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Exactly, exactly.

00:54:28.970 --> 00:54:30.736 align:middle line:84%
And so the Reptilians
have to keep us

00:54:30.736 --> 00:54:32.360 align:middle line:84%
in a state of ignorance,
which they do.

00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:33.440 align:middle line:84%
It's very effective,
because they

00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:34.800 align:middle line:90%
control the educational system.

00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Scientific
materialism does it.

00:54:36.530 --> 00:54:36.890 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Right.

00:54:36.890 --> 00:54:38.510 align:middle line:90%
They control the universities.

00:54:38.510 --> 00:54:41.210 align:middle line:84%
They control the
medical profession.

00:54:41.210 --> 00:54:44.145 align:middle line:84%
The Illuminati are
running the planet now.

00:54:44.145 --> 00:54:45.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:54:45.140 --> 00:54:49.970 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: But as our
consciousness expands--

00:54:49.970 --> 00:54:53.810 align:middle line:84%
and the Federation is helping
us but they cannot interfere

00:54:53.810 --> 00:54:57.320 align:middle line:84%
because of the noninterference
clause in the galactic law,

00:54:57.320 --> 00:54:59.480 align:middle line:90%
whatever you want to call it--

00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:00.870 align:middle line:90%
they can't directly interfere.

00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:03.240 align:middle line:90%
But they can help to educate us.

00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:09.652 align:middle line:84%
And one of the appendices in my
book is the "Path to Victory."

00:55:09.652 --> 00:55:11.110 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
you read that part.

00:55:11.110 --> 00:55:12.401 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I didn't get to that.

00:55:12.401 --> 00:55:14.390 align:middle line:84%
I thought I read
the whole thing, OK.

00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:17.170 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: It's a technique
for raising our consciousness

00:55:17.170 --> 00:55:18.917 align:middle line:84%
to the point where
we're no longer--

00:55:18.917 --> 00:55:21.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, just share
that right now, a little bit.

00:55:21.250 --> 00:55:23.210 align:middle line:84%
Give us a taste and
people can buy the book,

00:55:23.210 --> 00:55:25.750 align:middle line:84%
then I'll go back
and read that part.

00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:28.480 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: That particular
appendix was dictated

00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:32.650 align:middle line:84%
by an extraterrestrial by
the name of Khyla, K-h-y-l-a,

00:55:32.650 --> 00:55:36.060 align:middle line:84%
who is from the
star system Procyon,

00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:39.840 align:middle line:84%
which was a human star system
until the Greys took it over.

00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And they took it over through
subterfuge and infiltration

00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:47.250 align:middle line:84%
until finally the human
population was totally

00:55:47.250 --> 00:55:49.080 align:middle line:90%
dominated and had to leave.

00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:51.820 align:middle line:84%
So he's a refugee
from that system.

00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And so he dictated this
particular appendix in my book.

00:55:56.820 --> 00:55:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And what he said was,
once we've learned

00:55:58.710 --> 00:56:02.850 align:middle line:84%
to focus on our highest
spiritual nature

00:56:02.850 --> 00:56:07.410 align:middle line:84%
and keep it in focus,
we'll reach the point where

00:56:07.410 --> 00:56:08.850 align:middle line:90%
they can't touch us anymore.

00:56:08.850 --> 00:56:11.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I absolutely
agree with that.

00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And as you say, it's a little
bit of a race against time.

00:56:14.070 --> 00:56:18.660 align:middle line:84%
And is that your purpose
for writing the book?

00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:20.530 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Yeah, my
purpose was to--

00:56:20.530 --> 00:56:21.330 align:middle line:90%
here we are--

00:56:21.330 --> 00:56:23.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So here's the
threat and this is how long

00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:24.243 align:middle line:90%
it's been going on, right?

00:56:24.243 --> 00:56:26.550 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Yeah, and this
is what we have to do.

00:56:26.550 --> 00:56:28.800 align:middle line:84%
This is what we have
to do now or we're

00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:30.510 align:middle line:84%
going to lose the
planet, essentially,

00:56:30.510 --> 00:56:34.364 align:middle line:84%
and it'll become another slave
planet of the Reptilian Empire.

00:56:34.364 --> 00:56:36.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I
guess we could boil it

00:56:36.030 --> 00:56:39.630 align:middle line:84%
down to a country western song,
Mama, "Don't Let Your Babies

00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:41.760 align:middle line:90%
Grow Up to be Soldiers," right?

00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:45.040 align:middle line:84%
Just take ourselves out of the
war machine, the war mentality,

00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:46.145 align:middle line:90%
the competition.

00:56:46.145 --> 00:56:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's one thing that's
really disturbing to me

00:56:48.270 --> 00:56:50.850 align:middle line:84%
as a Hollywood trend is
the trend toward using

00:56:50.850 --> 00:56:54.545 align:middle line:84%
the feminine as the real
kind of kick ass heroines.

00:56:54.545 --> 00:56:57.170 align:middle line:84%
You know, violent and oftentimes
it's on the side of the right.

00:56:57.170 --> 00:56:58.711 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Well see,
but a lot of that

00:56:58.711 --> 00:57:01.120 align:middle line:84%
is the reaction to the male
dominated Reptilian society.

00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:02.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I understand.

00:57:02.490 --> 00:57:04.620 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: The Reptilians
are patriarchal

00:57:04.620 --> 00:57:06.870 align:middle line:90%
and they've subdued the women.

00:57:06.870 --> 00:57:09.870 align:middle line:84%
Unlike the queens of Orion
who have taken over there.

00:57:09.870 --> 00:57:12.915 align:middle line:84%
here the Reptilian males
have rebelled against that.

00:57:12.915 --> 00:57:13.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:57:13.790 --> 00:57:15.720 align:middle line:90%
And the feminine is rising up.

00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:19.320 align:middle line:84%
But to have kind of a boot-camp
version of the feminine

00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:20.230 align:middle line:90%
is not helpful.

00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:22.350 align:middle line:84%
It's the actual
feminine principles

00:57:22.350 --> 00:57:25.240 align:middle line:84%
that have to be
reinculcated into society.

00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: The gentler,
loving, nature, that's right--

00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:30.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not just
compassionate but also working

00:57:30.210 --> 00:57:31.890 align:middle line:84%
as a collective
and collaboratively

00:57:31.890 --> 00:57:33.986 align:middle line:90%
instead of competitively.

00:57:33.986 --> 00:57:34.860 align:middle line:90%
It's feminine traits.

00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:37.110 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: The feminine traits
are the glue of our society,

00:57:37.110 --> 00:57:37.890 align:middle line:90%
really.

00:57:37.890 --> 00:57:38.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They are.

00:57:38.690 --> 00:57:42.490 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Love and affection--
and since we have a heart, OK?

00:57:42.490 --> 00:57:43.650 align:middle line:90%
They do not.

00:57:43.650 --> 00:57:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And love is the key to
the whole thing, really.

00:57:46.260 --> 00:57:48.870 align:middle line:84%
Because as we expand
our consciousness,

00:57:48.870 --> 00:57:50.550 align:middle line:90%
our loving nature will prevail.

00:57:50.550 --> 00:57:52.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, I
totally agree with you.

00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:53.790 align:middle line:90%
We're on the same page there.

00:57:53.790 --> 00:57:56.070 align:middle line:84%
Tough story to get through
to show the cruelty

00:57:56.070 --> 00:58:00.330 align:middle line:84%
that we've been subjected
to and that we have actually

00:58:00.330 --> 00:58:03.210 align:middle line:84%
perpetuated ourselves as a
result of that influence.

00:58:03.210 --> 00:58:04.680 align:middle line:90%
But the message is good.

00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:06.096 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: And if
we could get away

00:58:06.096 --> 00:58:08.730 align:middle line:84%
from the money dominated society
that they have inculcated

00:58:08.730 --> 00:58:12.210 align:middle line:90%
in us, then things will change.

00:58:12.210 --> 00:58:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, kind of
Michael Tellinger's Ubuntu idea

00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:17.906 align:middle line:84%
and the notion of people coming
together, creating together.

00:58:17.906 --> 00:58:19.530 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's growing
food, whether it's

00:58:19.530 --> 00:58:21.770 align:middle line:84%
going back to kind of a more
primitive communal life,

00:58:21.770 --> 00:58:22.570 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't matter.

00:58:22.570 --> 00:58:25.320 align:middle line:84%
Anything that puts the
power back in your own hands

00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:29.280 align:middle line:84%
so that it releases us from the
fear of survival and the money

00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:30.080 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:31.455 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: The
Federation is there

00:58:31.455 --> 00:58:32.890 align:middle line:90%
to help us in any way they can.

00:58:32.890 --> 00:58:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And they have been through
books, through infiltration,

00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:37.440 align:middle line:90%
in many ways.

00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:39.210 align:middle line:90%
But they can't interfere really.

00:58:39.210 --> 00:58:39.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:58:39.390 --> 00:58:41.306 align:middle line:84%
The good guys, they know
they can't interfere.

00:58:41.306 --> 00:58:42.885 align:middle line:10%
The bad guys do it anyway.

00:58:42.885 --> 00:58:43.685 align:middle line:10%
>>KASTEN: Right.

00:58:43.685 --> 00:58:45.250 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So Len,
thank you so much

00:58:45.250 --> 00:58:46.230 align:middle line:10%
and good luck with your book.

00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:46.560 align:middle line:10%
>>KASTEN: My pleasure.

00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:47.360 align:middle line:10%
Thank you.

00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:48.943 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Again, the
title of the book

00:58:48.943 --> 00:58:51.000 align:middle line:10%
is "Alien World Order"
which is available

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:52.230 align:middle line:10%
through major booksellers.

00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:56.020 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Open Minds.
