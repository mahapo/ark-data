>>REGINA MEREDITH: The
much revered Barbara Hand

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.820 align:middle line:10%
Clow is here with us today
for a big conversation.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.720 align:middle line:10%
We have our task cut out for
us to create a cohesive look

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.590 align:middle line:10%
at our times in
roughly 45 minutes.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:30.810 align:middle line:90%
But I think we can do it.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.840 align:middle line:10%
First, it's hard to believe
that Barbara's "Alchemy of Nine

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.350 align:middle line:10%
Dimensions" has just turned
20 years of age and has stood

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.570 align:middle line:10%
the test of time, being more and
more validated by so many others

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:42.370 align:middle line:10%
at this time.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.040 align:middle line:84%
So let's dig right
in with Barbara.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.763 align:middle line:84%
Barbara, wonderful to
see you back again.

00:00:45.763 --> 00:00:47.680 align:middle line:84%
>>BARBARA HAND CLOW:
Great to see you, Regina.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.805 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I love the
addition of purple streaks

00:00:49.805 --> 00:00:50.620 align:middle line:90%
to your hair.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.270 align:middle line:84%
They're more
pronounced this time.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:53.070 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.120 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Lots of fun.

>>REGINA: Speaks--

00:00:54.375 --> 00:00:55.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: I do
it for the kids.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --of who you are.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:56.190 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.360 align:middle line:84%

up to me and say, hey, granny.

>>REGINA: I love it.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.850 align:middle line:84%
So for people who
don't already know,

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.290 align:middle line:84%
you have a little--
most people, I

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.040 align:middle line:84%
think, do, but we
always have new viewers.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.850 align:middle line:84%
So you're part Native American,
had an interesting childhood,

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.410 align:middle line:90%
very intuitive.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.910 align:middle line:84%
You were in connection
with the Pleiadians decades

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.430 align:middle line:84%
ago, bringing
through information.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.380 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: That's right.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
Pleiadian agenda.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.075 align:middle line:84%
And your career has gone on
from there for four decades.

00:01:22.075 --> 00:01:22.875 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:01:22.875 --> 00:01:24.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Four decades
now of writing.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.240 align:middle line:84%
So this now-- other
people are starting

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.810 align:middle line:84%
to bring in Pleiadian
information.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.510 align:middle line:84%
Even some younger people
are bringing it in.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And you're finding it's starting
to cross-reference and validate

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.220 align:middle line:84%
a lot of what you
were shown back when.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:37.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: That's true.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:38.300 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.100 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.730 align:middle line:10%
And the reason I started being
in contact with the Pleiadian so

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.950 align:middle line:10%
young is that my grandfather
was half Cherokee.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.880 align:middle line:10%
He was Cherokee Celtic,
and he taught me

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.200 align:middle line:10%
that our people came
from the Pleiades.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.890 align:middle line:10%
And so I grew up with that
understanding of reality.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.930 align:middle line:10%
So when I started
having visitations,

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.600 align:middle line:10%
which really started when I was
about five and a half years old.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.380 align:middle line:84%
I had a near-death
experience that really

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.130 align:middle line:90%
brought in the higher planes.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.980 align:middle line:84%
So that when the
Pleiadian started

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.590 align:middle line:84%
getting in contact with me,
I was comfortable with it

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.530 align:middle line:84%
because it was culturally
comfortable as well

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.130 align:middle line:90%
as personally comfortable.

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk about
the genesis for the "Alchemy

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.230 align:middle line:90%
of Nine Dimensions."

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.563 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of what we're
going to be focusing on today.

00:02:20.563 --> 00:02:22.690 align:middle line:84%
We won't necessarily
hopscotch literally

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.510 align:middle line:84%
through every single dimension
like we did years ago,

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.390 align:middle line:84%
but we're going to
pick up on certain ones

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.123 align:middle line:84%
because a lot is happening
within those dimensions.

00:02:31.123 --> 00:02:33.790 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to bring in the
stories of some of the newcomers

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:34.410 align:middle line:90%
since then.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.000 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: That's right.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.325 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what you
found really fascinating.

00:02:36.325 --> 00:02:37.800 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: That's what
I'm the most excited about.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.990 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yes.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So why don't
we first start out

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.070 align:middle line:90%
with a basis of understanding?

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.870 align:middle line:84%
We live in a
multi-dimensional, you

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.360 align:middle line:84%
can say multi-roamed
experience on earth.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.220 align:middle line:84%
And so let's look at what
the first two dimensions are

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.360 align:middle line:90%
as the basis of this reality.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.160 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.310 align:middle line:84%
So this information came
through from the Pleiadians

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.550 align:middle line:84%
as a channeling that went over
three or four months where

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.150 align:middle line:90%
everything was recorded.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And according to the
Pleiadians, the first dimension

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.900 align:middle line:84%
is the iron-core crystal
in the center of the earth.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And at that point that
wasn't known in science.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.470 align:middle line:90%
It came in soon thereafter.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:19.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: But the interesting
thing about what's going on now

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.520 align:middle line:84%
is that a lot of
people are starting

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.140 align:middle line:84%
to see a black hole in
the center of the earth.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
what to make of that.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.250 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sticking by the
Pleiadian information.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.580 align:middle line:84%
But the important thing
about the first dimension

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.040 align:middle line:84%
is the first dimension
is in contact

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.440 align:middle line:84%
with all of the
other centers, of all

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.600 align:middle line:84%
of the other cosmic
bodies in the universe.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.900 align:middle line:84%
So there everything is
connected up kind of

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.800 align:middle line:90%
like-- you remember tinkertoys?

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.480 align:middle line:90%
It's all linked up.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And when something is going on
in the center of our planet,

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.610 align:middle line:84%
it's also communicating
information to other stars

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:55.825 align:middle line:90%
and galaxies and--

00:03:55.825 --> 00:03:57.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To its own
crystal iron-core?

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:58.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.940 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.250 align:middle line:90%
It's communicating, yeah.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And this is actually the source
of the Akashic Records, which

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.470 align:middle line:84%
is the information in
the etheric level, which

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.120 align:middle line:90%
we'll talk about in a minute.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.640 align:middle line:84%
That is a recording of all
the events through time.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And so then the
second dimension is

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.700 align:middle line:84%
the space between
the iron-core crystal

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.450 align:middle line:90%
and the crust of our planet.

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we
live on the crust

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.060 align:middle line:84%
of the earth in the third
dimension linear space and time.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.590 align:middle line:84%
But the second dimension is
an extremely interesting realm

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.990 align:middle line:84%
that I continue to probably
study more than any other realm,

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.460 align:middle line:84%
because the only way you can get
in touch with it is psychically.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And the second dimension
is the telluric realm,

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.360 align:middle line:84%
where we have crustal shifting
and earthquakes and magma.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And then as we get
closer to the surface

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.610 align:middle line:84%
of the earth, microbial
realms and mineral beings,

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.230 align:middle line:84%
and it's just filled with all
of these amazing beings who,

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.620 align:middle line:84%
as far as I can tell
so far, are actually

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.330 align:middle line:90%
more knowledgeable than we are.

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that gets us
to Radu Cinamar's work right

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:01.670 align:middle line:90%
off the bat.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.965 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: That's right.

00:05:01.965 --> 00:05:04.465 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so you and I have
both read a series of books.

00:05:04.465 --> 00:05:05.548 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: That's right.

00:05:05.548 --> 00:05:07.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Starting out with
the "Transylvania Sunrise."

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.910 align:middle line:84%
and Radu Cinamar, which is
a pseudonym for the author,

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.690 align:middle line:90%
explains--

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.370 align:middle line:84%
he starts going on
his own journey, which

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.790 align:middle line:84%
he is brought into by some
military and secret base

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:27.690 align:middle line:84%
operations in Romania,
to start journeying down

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.910 align:middle line:84%
these vast tunnels to these
holographic projections

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.500 align:middle line:90%
in the earth and beyond.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.300 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.717 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
really fascinating.

00:05:36.717 --> 00:05:38.840 align:middle line:84%
There are six or seven
books, as I recall.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:39.640 align:middle line:90%
Is it six or seven?

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:40.765 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: There's seven.

00:05:40.765 --> 00:05:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And then regarding these
tunnels, one of them

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.020 align:middle line:90%
goes to Tibet.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.670 align:middle line:90%
That's Tibetan plateau.

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:48.520 align:middle line:84%
Another one goes to the
Giza plateau in Egypt.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And then the third one
goes into the inner earth.

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:51.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And this is what's
so fascinating because I think

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.030 align:middle line:84%
this is probably
some of the best data

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.710 align:middle line:84%
that I've ever read
on the inner earth.

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.600 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of distortion
in what's actually going on

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.200 align:middle line:84%
down there, and there's a
lot of military deception

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.440 align:middle line:90%
all around it.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And I find Radu
Cinamar's understanding

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.140 align:middle line:84%
of the second dimension to
be fascinating because what

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:21.840 align:middle line:84%
he is saying in his work is
that these beings are much more

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.570 align:middle line:84%
peaceful, much more intelligent,
much more balanced, and much

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.500 align:middle line:90%
more harmonic than we are.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.500 align:middle line:84%
And so from my
perspective and what

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.790 align:middle line:84%
I receive from the Pleiadians is
this realm, the second dimension

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:37.550 align:middle line:84%
in my system, the inner
earth and Radu's system,

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.910 align:middle line:84%
this realm is the source
of mineral intelligence,

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:42.560 align:middle line:90%
microbial intelligence.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And then the last 20 years since
I received this information,

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:47.980 align:middle line:84%
I've actually reached
the point where

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:52.760 align:middle line:84%
I can go to a supermarket
or a health store,

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:57.520 align:middle line:84%
and I could just pass my hand
in front of certain substances

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.710 align:middle line:84%
or mineral essences
or whatever, and I

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:02.650 align:middle line:84%
could tell exactly what's
the right thing to use.

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And so the second dimension
is the source of homeopathy.

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.570 align:middle line:90%
It's the source of homeostasis.

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very, very
intelligent and highly developed

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:12.590 align:middle line:90%
realm.

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:16.870 align:middle line:84%
And so I was so
pleased to see Radu.

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:19.408 align:middle line:84%
Reading what he has to say
about those experiences

00:07:19.408 --> 00:07:21.075 align:middle line:84%
in the inner earth
are just fascinating.

00:07:21.075 --> 00:07:23.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, he just
wanted to keep going back.

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
because many people that

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.030 align:middle line:84%
write about the
inner earth make it

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:31.480 align:middle line:84%
seem a bit frightening
that it's all mantis people

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.790 align:middle line:84%
and people that are
unrecognizable to us,

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:37.130 align:middle line:84%
a different totally
different species.

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:38.800 align:middle line:84%
But if you wouldn't
mind sharing some

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.685 align:middle line:84%
of how Radu describes
the people, the people

00:07:41.685 --> 00:07:42.810 align:middle line:90%
at the center of the earth.

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:45.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah, he sees
them as being very intelligent,

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.800 align:middle line:84%
first of all, and very loving,
brilliant, as a matter of fact,

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.170 align:middle line:84%
just in terms of our
earth intelligence.

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:53.335 align:middle line:84%
And that he sees them
as being very beautiful.

00:07:53.335 --> 00:07:54.135 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Human.

00:07:54.135 --> 00:07:55.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Radiant.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And in my case, I did
take a journey down

00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.300 align:middle line:90%
into the inner earth.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:04.330 align:middle line:84%
I went to Shambhala 40 years ago
now in a past life regression

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:05.150 align:middle line:90%
session.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:05.350 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:07.367 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did it line
up with his version

00:08:07.367 --> 00:08:08.325 align:middle line:90%
of what he experienced?

00:08:08.325 --> 00:08:10.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah, what
was interesting to me

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:14.150 align:middle line:84%
is, OK, I actually visited
Shambhala, and with Greg Paxton,

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:16.730 align:middle line:84%
a therapist who's now
not with us anymore.

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And I saw this just incredible,
radiant, beautiful city.

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And the description in Radu's
books is exactly the same.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.450 align:middle line:90%
And so that really struck me.

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And apparently a
lot of other people

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.790 align:middle line:90%
have seen the same vision.

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:33.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so have these
people been in the inner earth

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.000 align:middle line:90%
the entire time?

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.020 align:middle line:84%
Or did they go from the
surface of the earth

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:41.610 align:middle line:84%
and were essentially
forced at some point

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:43.630 align:middle line:90%
to go inside the earth?

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:46.650 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: I think from my
studies of ancient catastrophes.

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:47.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:49.410 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: I think
the whole inner earth

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:53.970 align:middle line:84%
system is a system that people
have gone into during times when

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:57.360 align:middle line:84%
our planet was being bombarded
by meteors or asteroids

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.240 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.870 align:middle line:84%
But I also think there's
some kind of thing going on

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:04.230 align:middle line:84%
with extraterrestrials
landing on the earth

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:05.680 align:middle line:90%
and going into the inner earth.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.550 align:middle line:84%
I think-- I think
extraterrestrials are also

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:09.975 align:middle line:90%
accessing the inner earth.

00:09:09.975 --> 00:09:11.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
in Roger's books,

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:13.017 align:middle line:84%
when they write about
these tunnels that

00:09:13.017 --> 00:09:17.190 align:middle line:84%
go to these various places,
these are very sophisticated,

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:19.680 align:middle line:84%
just the materials, the
methods for drilling

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.130 align:middle line:90%
these tunnels and such.

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:25.070 align:middle line:84%
And just to put a little
background around it,

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:29.650 align:middle line:84%
this has turned into a joint
Romanian-American military

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:30.710 align:middle line:90%
operation.

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:33.760 align:middle line:84%
The Romanians had wanted
all of this knowledge

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.520 align:middle line:84%
about these tunnels and what
they discovered, including

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.310 align:middle line:84%
in the holographic
projection room,

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:41.480 align:middle line:90%
about our deep past and future.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.630 align:middle line:84%
They wanted all that released
and known some factions,

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:48.145 align:middle line:84%
but the Americans wanted to
keep it secret, if I recall.

00:09:48.145 --> 00:09:49.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And
what I would say

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.120 align:middle line:84%
is so valuable
about Radu's book is

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:55.330 align:middle line:84%
this whole analysis of
the Romanian government

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:57.650 align:middle line:90%
and the Romanian Secret Service.

00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of Americans
don't know very much

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.160 align:middle line:84%
about Romanian history,
but the Romanians

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.370 align:middle line:84%
went through a terrible
bout with communism,

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:08.860 align:middle line:84%
and they've gone through
a very difficult things

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:09.950 align:middle line:90%
in their culture.

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And then Meanwhile,
these amazing discoveries

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.960 align:middle line:84%
were made of these tunnels
and a projection room

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.960 align:middle line:84%
and all that deep in the
mountains in Romania.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And so the reason the
books are actually

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:30.130 align:middle line:84%
so valuable is because Radu
was selected by a guy named

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:33.770 align:middle line:84%
Cezar Brad to be one
of the people who would

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:35.910 align:middle line:90%
work for the military in--

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:37.852 align:middle line:90%
in the investigation of--

00:10:37.852 --> 00:10:38.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And document.

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:40.470 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah, and document.

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:41.270 align:middle line:90%
Well, Yeah.

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:44.390 align:middle line:84%
First of all, they were involved
in the actual exploration

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:45.830 align:middle line:90%
of these discoveries.

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:49.970 align:middle line:84%
And then Cezar
chose Radu Cinamar

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:53.370 align:middle line:84%
because he felt that he
could-- he had the ability,

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:54.600 align:middle line:90%
if you can imagine it.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.270 align:middle line:84%
Because, see, by then the
Americans had gotten into it.

00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:00.500 align:middle line:84%
As soon as the Americans
realized that the Romanians had

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.660 align:middle line:84%
made this great
discovery, they got

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:04.910 align:middle line:84%
involved immediately
because they had discovered

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:09.740 align:middle line:84%
similar things under Iraq, which
I actually think are probably--

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:11.570 align:middle line:84%
that's what George
Bush was talking

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:13.570 align:middle line:84%
about regarding the weapons
of mass destruction.

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:14.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:16.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: I actually think
during the invasion of Iraq,

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:19.190 align:middle line:84%
Radu doesn't say
this, but I think

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:23.060 align:middle line:84%
that they were going in order
to get a hold of the access

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:26.490 align:middle line:84%
to the projection rooms
under a rock and the tunnels.

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:30.050 align:middle line:84%
So this technology appears to
be probably in many more places

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:32.130 align:middle line:84%
than just leaving
and in Romania.

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:32.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:36.170 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: But Radu's
description of the way

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:39.590 align:middle line:84%
that military control
worked between the Americans

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:41.220 align:middle line:90%
and the Romanians.

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:43.460 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually
what comes out

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:46.860 align:middle line:84%
is the Masons are really
involved in the whole thing.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And I learned more about the
way the Secret Services operate

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:54.290 align:middle line:84%
and the way the military
operates from reading his book--

00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:57.330 align:middle line:84%
and Mason's also, than
anything I've ever read.

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And this has been very important
to me because I had my uncle,

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:07.010 align:middle line:84%
my father's sister's
brother was assassinated

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:09.330 align:middle line:84%
right at the end
of World War II,

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.550 align:middle line:90%
and he was a member of the CIA.

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:13.595 align:middle line:84%
And so I was always trying
to figure out, well,

00:12:13.595 --> 00:12:14.395 align:middle line:90%
but what happened?

00:12:14.395 --> 00:12:16.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Who's the
shadow behind it all?

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:17.210 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah, yeah.

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:18.000 align:middle line:90%
What happened to my uncle?

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.583 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A lot of people are
asking that right now because it

00:12:20.583 --> 00:12:22.850 align:middle line:84%
appears that whatever
the shadow behind it all,

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:26.660 align:middle line:84%
appears to, in America, trying
to be taking down both sides

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:27.990 align:middle line:90%
in a presidential campaign--

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:28.640 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Who knows what--

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:29.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right now.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:30.390 align:middle line:90%
It's like, for what?

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:32.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, who's supposed
to come forward

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:33.450 align:middle line:90%
if you take them both down?

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:35.160 align:middle line:90%
And we don't know.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.670 align:middle line:84%
We don't know these hands,
and everything around It

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:38.680 align:middle line:90%
just doesn't make sense.

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:39.480 align:middle line:90%
It's upside down.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.305 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: So this is an
early childhood imprint.

00:12:41.305 --> 00:12:42.105 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:42.105 --> 00:12:45.740 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Where I heard when
my father and my uncle arguing

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:47.720 align:middle line:84%
after World War II,
because my father

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:51.410 align:middle line:84%
wanted him to leave
the CIA because he

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:53.370 align:middle line:90%
was married to his sister.

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's very early
childhood imprint.

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And so the books really
satisfy so much information

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.475 align:middle line:84%
about how this
whole thing works.

00:13:00.475 --> 00:13:01.275 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:01.275 --> 00:13:03.685 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And reading
seven books and, as you know--

00:13:03.685 --> 00:13:04.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's a lot.

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:04.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:05.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: You read
a couple of them.

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:08.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're very-- I
read most of them actually.

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's very--
written very elegantly.

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:12.130 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yes.

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:15.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there's something
in the language itself

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:17.400 align:middle line:84%
that translates deeper
information I found.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.200 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even though you
can say, is this a fantasy?

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:21.205 align:middle line:90%
Is this someone's imagination?

00:13:21.205 --> 00:13:22.005 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:13:22.005 --> 00:13:24.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it's kind of
like the Anastasia series.

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.840 align:middle line:84%
There's still
embedded information

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.680 align:middle line:90%
that rings so true to you.

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.800 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the things just,
you know, on an external level,

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.490 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was around
the time that the US came

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:36.300 align:middle line:84%
in contact with
this information,

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:39.380 align:middle line:84%
the military became involved
that Romania was suddenly

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:41.325 align:middle line:84%
invited into, I believe,
the United Nations.

00:13:41.325 --> 00:13:42.125 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:13:42.125 --> 00:13:42.440 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Mm-hmm.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:43.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I think it was--

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:43.650 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:45.170 align:middle line:84%
That's when they--
that's what got--

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:47.337 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And I think
it's valuable to understand

00:13:47.337 --> 00:13:49.830 align:middle line:84%
how deep these levels
of secrecy are,

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:54.110 align:middle line:84%
because as the control
over all of this

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:57.570 align:middle line:84%
starts to dissipate,
because it is dissipating,

00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:00.260 align:middle line:84%
because stuff is just
coming out every day now,

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.660 align:middle line:84%
it's very, very
intense and traumatic

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:05.340 align:middle line:84%
for people because people
are just going like,

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:06.670 align:middle line:90%
what on earth is going on?

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:07.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:07.780 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: You know.

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:09.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And everybody's
scratching their head.

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:10.950 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: --a little
bit of a grasp of it.

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:12.367 align:middle line:84%
But I don't feel
like I understand

00:14:12.367 --> 00:14:13.409 align:middle line:90%
hardly anything about it.

00:14:13.409 --> 00:14:15.534 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we will both
say that these books can

00:14:15.534 --> 00:14:16.800 align:middle line:90%
be laborious to get through.

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.500 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of repetitive, too
much detail in certain areas.

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.160 align:middle line:84%
But when you get to the
juice of these conversations,

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.550 align:middle line:90%
it is quite fascinating.

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:28.860 align:middle line:84%
So now let's move on to what's
being projected at us now

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:30.430 align:middle line:84%
from the fourth
dimensional field,

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:32.370 align:middle line:84%
because as I recall
in our interview

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:36.300 align:middle line:84%
all those years ago,
that was the realm that

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:39.510 align:middle line:90%
was overseen by the Anunnaki.

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:41.170 align:middle line:90%
So let's-- what's going on?

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:45.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: The Pleiadians
said that realm is overseen

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.183 align:middle line:90%
by the, well, the keeper.

00:14:46.183 --> 00:14:47.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The keepers.

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: --of that
dimension are the Anunnaki,

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:56.820 align:middle line:84%
which is a whole Syrian
spiritual and academic issue,

00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:00.640 align:middle line:84%
especially connected to some of
the works of Zecharia Sitchin.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.240 align:middle line:90%
But-- one author.

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:08.160 align:middle line:84%
But I had a lot of issues with
that concept until I finally

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:11.550 align:middle line:84%
understood by the time I had
to revise "Alchemy of Nine

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:13.540 align:middle line:90%
Dimensions" in 2011.

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:19.680 align:middle line:84%
It initially came out in
2004, and I revised it in 2011

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:23.020 align:middle line:84%
because I realized I hadn't
gotten the fourth dimension

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:24.220 align:middle line:90%
quite right.

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:26.740 align:middle line:84%
And all that means
is that this is

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:31.870 align:middle line:84%
the whole Judeo-Christian,
Sumerian, even Egyptian

00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:35.690 align:middle line:84%
historical context behind
the collective mind,

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:37.015 align:middle line:90%
behind the world religions.

00:15:37.015 --> 00:15:38.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That which
we've been stuck

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:40.120 align:middle line:90%
in now for thousands of years.

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: We've been stuck
in them for thousands of years.

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:43.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Religious
wars, cultural wars.

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:44.770 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Right.

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really been the last
5,000 years where we've been

00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:50.990 align:middle line:90%
really stuck in those holograms.

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:54.350 align:middle line:84%
And what's going on
right now, big time,

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:56.300 align:middle line:90%
is that is really breaking down.

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:57.850 align:middle line:90%
That is not going to hold.

00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:00.598 align:middle line:84%
The world religious concepts
are not going to hold.

00:16:00.598 --> 00:16:02.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's like
the destruction--

00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:03.723 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: --isn't
going to go away.

00:16:03.723 --> 00:16:07.430 align:middle line:84%
It's just that it's going to
transmute to another dimension.

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:10.510 align:middle line:84%
It's going to transmute
away from being patriarchal

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:13.240 align:middle line:84%
and controlling of women and
destructive of children and all

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:14.040 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
go to another level.

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.260 align:middle line:84%
And anything that
doesn't is going

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.250 align:middle line:90%
to end up just dissipating.

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:20.230 align:middle line:90%
So it's a big--

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:22.215 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's the end of
the Piscean age of religious.

00:16:22.215 --> 00:16:23.015 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yes.

00:16:23.015 --> 00:16:24.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Religions
and the wars,

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:27.040 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, and moving into
the Aquarian age of what

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.910 align:middle line:90%
will be spirituality/religion.

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:29.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:30.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which will
look very different.

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:33.040 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: So that's
why this Pluto transit

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:36.310 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the age of
Pisces and moving into Aquarius

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:39.970 align:middle line:84%
is so critical, because the
only way to break this up

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:42.020 align:middle line:90%
is just to break it up big time.

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:44.560 align:middle line:84%
So for example, it was
so interesting to me

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:47.200 align:middle line:84%
when we saw the
intellectual argument

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:51.280 align:middle line:84%
over Zionism versus
anti-Semitism come up

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:55.570 align:middle line:84%
as a result of the
Israelis going into Gaza

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:57.560 align:middle line:90%
and trying to attack Hamas.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And what that represents
is a very, very

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:04.930 align:middle line:84%
big deal because Zionism is
a very major global belief

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:08.109 align:middle line:84%
system in the end times,
and the apocalypse

00:17:08.109 --> 00:17:12.730 align:middle line:84%
and how we're going to
have Jerusalem as in Jesus

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:16.520 align:middle line:84%
is going to come flying through
the clouds and all these ideas.

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:21.980 align:middle line:84%
And I love this earth, I love
my life, I love this dimension.

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:24.080 align:middle line:90%
I don't go along with that.

00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:24.880 align:middle line:90%
I don't go along--

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:25.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you're not
waiting for the rapture.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:26.800 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: No, I'm not.

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:27.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Nor am I.

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:29.172 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: --for the
rapture or the apocalypse.

00:17:29.172 --> 00:17:29.972 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:17:29.972 --> 00:17:30.847 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not at all.

00:17:30.847 --> 00:17:33.220 align:middle line:84%
But that's kind of playing
out before it-- well, it's

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:35.980 align:middle line:84%
playing out big time before
us and opening up debate that

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:37.570 align:middle line:90%
has never been opened before.

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And this, again, is part of
this breaking away from what

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:42.970 align:middle line:90%
we're considered absolutes.

00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:43.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yes.

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is very, very
important because what

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:51.100 align:middle line:84%
happened is the
Israeli attack on Gaza

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:54.130 align:middle line:84%
has caused everybody
in the world

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:55.430 align:middle line:90%
to start talking about this.

00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:58.250 align:middle line:84%
People are demonstrating in
favor of the Palestinians.

00:17:58.250 --> 00:17:59.230 align:middle line:90%
And so this--

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:00.647 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a
much larger thing

00:18:00.647 --> 00:18:01.990 align:middle line:90%
than just a geopolitical event.

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:05.050 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: --sign of the
way this change and crack up

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:06.400 align:middle line:90%
is occurring.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.780 align:middle line:84%
And you ask about
the fourth dimension.

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:10.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, the fourth
dimension is the realm

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:12.050 align:middle line:90%
of the collective mind.

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:15.160 align:middle line:84%
And the collective mind
emanates from each one of us

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.520 align:middle line:90%
as individuals.

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And then what each one of us
as individuals thinks and feels

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:24.160 align:middle line:84%
then goes into the collective,
and then the collective starts

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.570 align:middle line:90%
manipulating individuals.

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:28.640 align:middle line:90%
It comes back the other way.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the
most important things

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:33.970 align:middle line:84%
for people to understand
at this point that

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:36.130 align:middle line:84%
is to understand
that everybody has

00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:40.840 align:middle line:84%
one vote from this dimension,
and that no individual person

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:44.170 align:middle line:84%
like Bill Gates or
Joseph Biden or anybody

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:47.950 align:middle line:84%
is any more important than the
individual, and what they're

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:49.040 align:middle line:90%
thinking about.

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:52.070 align:middle line:84%
And so the important
thing to do at this point,

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:55.310 align:middle line:84%
according to my own work in
"Alchemy of Nine Dimensions,"

00:18:55.310 --> 00:19:00.400 align:middle line:84%
is to learn how to influence
realities in higher dimensions

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.180 align:middle line:90%
that are affecting us here.

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:04.990 align:middle line:84%
So this fourth
dimensional conflict

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:09.790 align:middle line:84%
has so much to do with resolving
our shadows, our dark side,

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:12.640 align:middle line:84%
dualities that we have
difficulty with it.

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:15.170 align:middle line:84%
That's really what's
happening right now.

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:17.210 align:middle line:84%
It's like cracking
the cosmic egg.

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:18.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:21.160 align:middle line:84%
And when you say one vote,
it's every single mind

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.700 align:middle line:90%
is co-creating together.

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:26.180 align:middle line:84%
Biden's mind, Trump's
mind, whomever's,

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:29.220 align:middle line:84%
you know, Netanyahu's
mind, they're one mind,

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:33.120 align:middle line:84%
but we also have the same
wattage and power per mind.

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.150 align:middle line:84%
So that's our vote
you're speaking of.

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:37.820 align:middle line:84%
Every thought,
every person's mind

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:40.433 align:middle line:84%
matters equally in
this co-creation,

00:19:40.433 --> 00:19:41.725 align:middle line:90%
and it's important to remember.

00:19:41.725 --> 00:19:42.200 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And so the point
is, how do you--

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:47.550 align:middle line:84%
the real teaching of "Alchemy
of Nine Dimensions," That's OK.

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:48.990 align:middle line:90%
How do you use that one vote?

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:50.460 align:middle line:90%
How do you use that power?

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.500 align:middle line:84%
How do you use
that consciousness?

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's just so critically
important right now.

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:56.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:19:56.310 --> 00:20:02.090 align:middle line:84%
So let's move ahead to some of
the astrological, cosmological

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:04.140 align:middle line:84%
influences that
will be happening.

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:09.000 align:middle line:84%
So February of
2026, you have said

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.660 align:middle line:84%
is going to be a very
powerful time for humanity.

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And everything now is
really just ratcheting up

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.720 align:middle line:84%
to that point, getting
us-- getting our feet

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.410 align:middle line:90%
wet with all the chaos.

00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:21.050 align:middle line:90%
So explain that a little more.

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:24.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Well, actually,
the really big moment

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:26.490 align:middle line:84%
of a kind of convergence
of consciousness

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:29.380 align:middle line:90%
is actually June of 2027.

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And what I see
going on during 2026

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:36.690 align:middle line:84%
is that the planets
that converge in 2027

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:39.460 align:middle line:84%
into a whole bunch of
trines and sextiles.

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:43.600 align:middle line:84%
They start to go into harmonic
relationship one after another.

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:47.424 align:middle line:90%
It's like almost like a--

00:20:47.424 --> 00:20:49.185 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Kind of
falling into harmony?

00:20:49.185 --> 00:20:49.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so this would
be-- this is the February 26th

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:52.970 align:middle line:90%
period.

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:55.740 align:middle line:84%
They're starting to go
into some kind of harmonic?

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:58.800 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Actually the
going into the harmonic

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.210 align:middle line:90%
is actually started this fall.

00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:01.293 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:21:01.293 --> 00:21:04.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah, but then
with Neptune and Saturn

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:09.180 align:middle line:84%
in Pisces for part
of 2025, stuff

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:11.910 align:middle line:84%
is going to happen with, Regina,
that's going to blow our minds,

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:16.530 align:middle line:84%
in terms of awareness
and awakening and seeing

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:17.375 align:middle line:90%
the real truth.

00:21:17.375 --> 00:21:19.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it may
be quite shocking?

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:22.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Yes, I expect
it to be very shocking.

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:24.300 align:middle line:90%
And then I expect--

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:27.640 align:middle line:84%
basically I think of 2025
is a great big shock wave.

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And look what's
going on right now.

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:33.050 align:middle line:84%
Just week by week, day
by day at this point.

00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:33.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:34.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Right.

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:38.880 align:middle line:84%
And then in 2026, we're
going to come into that point

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:41.190 align:middle line:84%
where we've been
experiencing it.

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And OK, what's it
doing to us right now?

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:45.580 align:middle line:90%
Because that's a precursor.

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:48.820 align:middle line:84%
What it's doing to a lot of
people, because I ask everybody,

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:50.920 align:middle line:84%
and I know what I
experienced myself,

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.860 align:middle line:90%
we're learning how to go inward.

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:56.220 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
really have a lot

00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:58.470 align:middle line:84%
of difficulty going
into deep meditation

00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:00.550 align:middle line:90%
and going totally inward.

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And when you go
inward is when you're

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:05.290 align:middle line:90%
in touch with the whole cosmos.

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that the
intensity of 2026 it's just

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.900 align:middle line:84%
going to be so intense that
people just aren't going to have

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:17.400 align:middle line:84%
any choice, just to have to
go inside because you won't--

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:19.080 align:middle line:84%
you look at how
things, look at how

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.390 align:middle line:84%
people's houses are
burning and people

00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:22.780 align:middle line:90%
are flooding and everything.

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:25.920 align:middle line:84%
There's all the things that
have kept us comfortable

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:28.590 align:middle line:84%
and enabled us to go, oh,
I'll just relax and deal

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:29.670 align:middle line:90%
with it next year.

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:30.850 align:middle line:90%
It's all going to be gone.

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:32.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Cosmos isn't
going to allow that.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.500 align:middle line:10%
>>HAND CLOW: Well, and
at the same time, though,

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:38.440 align:middle line:10%
if you in your consciousness
are in a deep place,

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:41.170 align:middle line:10%
and if you're deeply
inner centered,

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:43.800 align:middle line:10%
you don't have to fear anything.

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:46.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't know whether I'll
have the kind of house I have

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:49.000 align:middle line:84%
or anything that I
have at this point.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.480 align:middle line:84%
But what I do know is
I'll be deeply centered

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:54.370 align:middle line:84%
and I know that I'll be
close to the people I love,

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:56.470 align:middle line:84%
and I know that I'll
be using my vote--

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:58.205 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: --in the
higher dimensions.

00:22:58.205 --> 00:23:00.205 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, one of
the things nudging people

00:23:00.205 --> 00:23:02.850 align:middle line:84%
is more often than
ever, people are saying,

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:05.190 align:middle line:84%
ordinary people who
don't really think

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:06.970 align:middle line:84%
in any kind of
conspiratorial ways,

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:10.080 align:middle line:84%
for example, that I don't
know what's true anymore.

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.250 align:middle line:84%
I just, I can't
tell what's true.

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:15.540 align:middle line:84%
So where do you go when
literally the outside world

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:18.330 align:middle line:84%
looks like everything's just
being fabricated and turned

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:19.360 align:middle line:90%
upside down?

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:20.680 align:middle line:90%
There is nowhere to go.

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:20.880 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's where it's so
fascinating because of course,

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:26.410 align:middle line:84%
Eastern religions in particular,
to just say point blank,

00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:28.290 align:middle line:84%
everything that we
experience and everything

00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:30.910 align:middle line:84%
that happens to us
is actually not real.

00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:33.420 align:middle line:84%
It's like we're really
living in a dream,

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:37.440 align:middle line:84%
and the awakening comes
when you learn to go inside.

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.340 align:middle line:84%
Because you may be
living in a dream,

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:41.470 align:middle line:84%
you might be on a
shamanic journey,

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:43.330 align:middle line:84%
you might be whatever
you're doing,

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:46.210 align:middle line:84%
but if you go deep
inside and center,

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:48.820 align:middle line:84%
then you're in touch
with the cosmos,

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:50.710 align:middle line:90%
you're in touch with the divine.

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And for some people, this
is being in touch with God.

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:53.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's real you
anyway, that you're

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:57.005 align:middle line:90%
in touch with you, the real you.

00:23:57.005 --> 00:23:57.360 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:58.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So just
to finish this up,

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:01.545 align:middle line:84%
what's the peace look like
in June of 2027 again?

00:24:01.545 --> 00:24:02.345 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yes.

00:24:02.345 --> 00:24:04.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A lot of people
talk about this 2027 window.

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:05.870 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah, yeah.

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:10.638 align:middle line:84%
So in June 27 of 2027,
there's a great big eclipse

00:24:10.638 --> 00:24:12.930 align:middle line:84%
I think it's at the end of
the month, and it's going to

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:16.030 align:middle line:84%
and people are going to be
hearing about this like crazy.

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:18.390 align:middle line:84%
But what's going
to be happening is

00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:20.370 align:middle line:84%
all of the outer
planets are going

00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:23.530 align:middle line:90%
to be in sextile and trines.

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be like
the music of the spheres.

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:27.515 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be like the--

00:24:27.515 --> 00:24:28.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Is it positive?

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:29.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:30.020 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:32.170 align:middle line:84%
Oh, It's going to be--
it's going to be like--

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:34.047 align:middle line:84%
you know, I don't know
if you like Beethoven,

00:24:34.047 --> 00:24:36.630 align:middle line:84%
but it's going to be like that
point at the end of Beethoven's

00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:38.520 align:middle line:84%
Ninth Symphony when
everything just

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:42.250 align:middle line:84%
breaks into this glorious,
beautiful awakening.

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And so that is going
to be happening.

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And then at the same
time, what fascinates me,

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:51.000 align:middle line:84%
because I've written a book
about "Chiron", is that Chiron,

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:51.800 align:middle line:90%
at that point--

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:53.008 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The wounded healer.

00:24:53.008 --> 00:24:54.210 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah, returned.

00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:56.710 align:middle line:84%
Chiron is the planet
of the wounded healer,

00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:58.980 align:middle line:84%
and it's the planet
that takes us deepest

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:02.550 align:middle line:84%
into our karmic woundings
and our consciousness,

00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:04.360 align:middle line:90%
of our experience on earth.

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:07.290 align:middle line:84%
And Chiron is going
to be returned

00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:09.270 align:middle line:84%
to the place where
it was discovered

00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:12.280 align:middle line:90%
in 1977 for the first time.

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:14.560 align:middle line:84%
So this is called
the Chiron Return.

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And I'll probably
write a book about this

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.730 align:middle line:84%
just because I've
written about Chiron.

00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:20.620 align:middle line:90%
But what's that tells us.

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:21.720 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very important.

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:27.610 align:middle line:84%
What it tells us, it tells us
that this harmonic beautiful

00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:30.085 align:middle line:84%
awakening point is
going to be a healing.

00:25:30.085 --> 00:25:31.245 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's wonderful.

00:25:31.245 --> 00:25:32.300 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: A deep healing.

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:33.100 align:middle line:90%
And that's--

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:35.626 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Mark our
calendars, June 27.

00:25:35.626 --> 00:25:36.470 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:38.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everything starts
going into a harmonic,

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:41.415 align:middle line:84%
but we have to be in
alignment with that ourselves.

00:25:41.415 --> 00:25:43.082 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: We have
so much work to do.

00:25:43.082 --> 00:25:43.882 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:25:43.882 --> 00:25:45.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: I've
never felt like I

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:48.590 align:middle line:84%
have to work as hard as I-- and
I don't mean it as even work,

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:52.130 align:middle line:84%
I just simply intend
to be there and do it.

00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:53.870 align:middle line:90%
And what do I mean by that?

00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:55.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm just there for
everybody who needs me.

00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:56.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:58.593 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: That's where
the real learning comes,

00:25:58.593 --> 00:26:01.990 align:middle line:84%
is in our third dimensional
reality with our partners

00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:04.450 align:middle line:84%
and our children and
our grandchildren

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:06.320 align:middle line:84%
and our neighbors
and our friends.

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:08.450 align:middle line:84%
That's where the real
healing comes from.

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:11.630 align:middle line:84%
What we're doing right there
is what counts the most now.

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And so when things get
wacko and needless to say,

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:18.100 align:middle line:90%
even I'm amazed, like, oh, wow.

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:20.360 align:middle line:84%
I actually just turned
right around and say,

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:22.130 align:middle line:84%
who was it I was
going to help today?

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:23.030 align:middle line:90%
And I just do it.

00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:23.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:23.635 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:26:23.635 --> 00:26:25.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we
have to take this on.

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: We all
have to do that.

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:29.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we go to
the sixth dimension,

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:33.520 align:middle line:84%
but it's about holding these 3D
thought forms intact and we have

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:37.570 align:middle line:84%
to have these higher, better
developed understandings

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:42.085 align:middle line:84%
of our co-creative capacities
so that we can hold a coherent--

00:26:42.085 --> 00:26:42.885 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Right.

00:26:42.885 --> 00:26:44.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --mental
form together.

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:45.430 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And so when we get into
the sixth dimension,

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:51.260 align:middle line:84%
this is the critical teaching
in "Alchemy of Nine Dimensions."

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:54.010 align:middle line:84%
When we get to that
dimension, that's

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:56.180 align:middle line:90%
where we really have one vote.

00:26:56.180 --> 00:27:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And we can literally just
fire our own thoughts,

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:03.110 align:middle line:84%
choose which kind
of reality we want.

00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:05.560 align:middle line:84%
Do we want a bloodbath
in the Middle East,

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:07.410 align:middle line:84%
or do we want peace
in the Middle East?

00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:11.110 align:middle line:84%
You know, do we want harmonic
politics in the United States

00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:13.610 align:middle line:84%
or do we want this
ridiculous chaos?

00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:19.102 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to learn how to
with each concept you work with.

00:27:19.102 --> 00:27:20.620 align:middle line:90%
All of us have many.

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:24.460 align:middle line:84%
To hold your mind
totally in the frequency

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:26.150 align:middle line:90%
that you want it to be in.

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And it actually changes
realities right down here.

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:32.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this we
get back to Radu's book.

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:35.290 align:middle line:84%
One thing they talked about
in the very first book says

00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:38.530 align:middle line:84%
"our Brad--" his name
has been changed,

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:41.380 align:middle line:84%
because of the sensitivity
of his situation.

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:45.340 align:middle line:84%
But Cezar Brad was talking to
him about what has to happen,

00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:48.980 align:middle line:84%
and he's talking about
we need to have "clear,

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:51.760 align:middle line:90%
focused thoughts and will."

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:53.260 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yes, yes.

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:56.110 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so once you
get that clear focus

00:27:56.110 --> 00:28:00.700 align:middle line:84%
and you really are visualizing
and thinking and intending

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:04.240 align:middle line:84%
a certain thing, then you
just activate your will

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:07.470 align:middle line:84%
because you will find yourself
doing something about it

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:08.270 align:middle line:90%
yourself.

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:10.885 align:middle line:84%
It's not just about dreaming
up something in the ethers,

00:28:10.885 --> 00:28:13.850 align:middle line:84%
you know, it's about
actually changing reality.

00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:17.810 align:middle line:84%
Like in "Alchemy of
Nine Dimensions,"

00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:21.430 align:middle line:84%
the image the Pleiadians use for
the sixth dimension affecting

00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:25.400 align:middle line:84%
the third dimension is yoga,
where we learn how to do yoga,

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:28.900 align:middle line:84%
and I do yoga regularly,
and we learn how to go

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:32.740 align:middle line:84%
into an alignment in our bodies
that then changes our alignment

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:34.090 align:middle line:90%
in 3D.

00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:34.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:36.285 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: It's
a good example.

00:28:36.285 --> 00:28:37.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is a good example.

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And so when we're talking about
this kind of clear and focused

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:45.480 align:middle line:84%
thought and an intention
and this co-creation one

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:48.630 align:middle line:84%
mind, individual mind,
every mind matters going

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:52.150 align:middle line:84%
into one mind,
creating an outcome,

00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:55.020 align:middle line:84%
we're looking far beyond
like bumper stickers, law

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:57.210 align:middle line:90%
of attraction kind of thinking.

00:28:57.210 --> 00:28:59.160 align:middle line:90%
The game is real now.

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:01.650 align:middle line:84%
And now what we
think and what we

00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:05.100 align:middle line:84%
choose to hold on to and
drag forward with us,

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:06.962 align:middle line:84%
it just isn't
appropriate any longer.

00:29:06.962 --> 00:29:08.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everyone has
their own time frame

00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:12.240 align:middle line:84%
to let it go and start
moving into this new way,

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:13.890 align:middle line:84%
and just speak about
that for a moment

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:15.110 align:middle line:90%
because we drag consciously--

00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:15.780 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:17.822 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --so much of
our past and pain with us.

00:29:17.822 --> 00:29:21.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: If we're not
intending in the sixth dimension

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:25.650 align:middle line:84%
to have the things manifest
here that we really want

00:29:25.650 --> 00:29:27.370 align:middle line:90%
and we really believe in.

00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:30.130 align:middle line:84%
Then we're more in
the fourth dimension.

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And you're stuck with
the Republican National

00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:36.290 align:middle line:84%
Convention and the Democrats
and whatever you're stuck with.

00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And so what's
happening is people

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:41.750 align:middle line:84%
are getting shredded and
pulling over here or over there,

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:43.100 align:middle line:90%
over here and over there.

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:46.510 align:middle line:84%
What's happening is people are
just more and more realizing

00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:49.503 align:middle line:84%
that they have to-- this is
an ascension issue, really,

00:29:49.503 --> 00:29:51.670 align:middle line:84%
where they have to ascend
with their consciousness--

00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:52.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: --to
this higher dimension.

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting thing about
that is you got to go through 5D

00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:58.670 align:middle line:90%
to get there.

00:29:58.670 --> 00:30:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And the fifth dimension
is the dimension

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:03.710 align:middle line:84%
of the heart and the
open heart chakra.

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:07.150 align:middle line:84%
And in order to go
into that dimension,

00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:09.050 align:middle line:90%
we have to open our hearts.

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's where this
life in 3D is so powerful.

00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:16.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, souls have been
fighting at this point from all

00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:17.450 align:middle line:90%
over the universe to come here.

00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:18.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:20.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Because they know
what's going to happen here.

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And they also know that
when that note is sounded

00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:26.950 align:middle line:84%
from the earth, it affects
the universe itself,

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:29.688 align:middle line:84%
and particularly the
Milky Way galaxy,

00:30:29.688 --> 00:30:30.730 align:middle line:90%
because we're part of it.

00:30:30.730 --> 00:30:32.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, beautiful.

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile, at
this very time,

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:38.140 align:middle line:84%
the one thing being fostered
and foisted upon humanity

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:41.500 align:middle line:84%
more by the minute is
artificial intelligence.

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:43.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, granted,
artificial intelligence

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:46.270 align:middle line:84%
is probably at the base of
every technologically advanced

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:48.610 align:middle line:84%
civilization in the
universe, as you know,

00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:50.630 align:middle line:84%
so artificial
intelligence is a thing.

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:53.090 align:middle line:84%
It's going to stay
here and be a thing.

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:56.830 align:middle line:84%
But as many have pointed
out, who programs

00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:58.250 align:middle line:90%
that ultimate thing--

00:30:58.250 --> 00:30:58.750 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: That's the point.

00:30:58.750 --> 00:30:59.540 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:00.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --is everything.

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:01.537 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And
think about that.

00:31:01.537 --> 00:31:03.890 align:middle line:84%
It's exactly like these
issues in the sixth dimension,

00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:04.690 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:08.320 align:middle line:84%
It's an issue of whether
artificial intelligence is going

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:12.970 align:middle line:84%
to be a whole bunch of data from
the fourth dimensional duality

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:15.280 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's going to
be a whole bunch of data

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:20.000 align:middle line:84%
with pure and clear
goals and objectives.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And if we can achieve that
with artificial intelligence,

00:31:24.050 --> 00:31:26.200 align:middle line:84%
we can have financial
integrity, we

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:28.220 align:middle line:90%
can have governmental integrity.

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:31.070 align:middle line:84%
There's no reason we
can't go to that level.

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:33.070 align:middle line:84%
But at this point,
as you know, there's

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:34.660 align:middle line:90%
a real struggle going on.

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:35.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Big time.

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:36.260 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:38.467 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and so
in another Radu's books,

00:31:38.467 --> 00:31:40.300 align:middle line:84%
one of the last ones,
"The Etheric Crystal,"

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:42.050 align:middle line:90%
they talk about I quite a bit.

00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:44.290 align:middle line:84%
But what I found
interesting there

00:31:44.290 --> 00:31:47.830 align:middle line:84%
is they said once AI
reaches a critical mass

00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:50.290 align:middle line:84%
within the consciousness
of humanity,

00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:54.520 align:middle line:84%
it actually attracts
a sentient being to it

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:58.375 align:middle line:90%
and becomes its own being.

00:31:58.375 --> 00:31:59.175 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:31:59.175 --> 00:32:01.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, we want to
be really careful what kind

00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:03.820 align:middle line:90%
of being we're attracting here.

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:04.820 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah, yeah.

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And so it could be that we're
in that phase of starting to,

00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:09.850 align:middle line:84%
because the people who
are working in this

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:10.770 align:middle line:90%
aren't all monsters.

00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:11.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, of course not.

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:13.180 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: There's only
a few monsters in there,

00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:16.120 align:middle line:84%
and there's a few monsters
everywhere as far as I can see.

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a lot of good
intent, people intentionally.

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:20.475 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's going to be
very helpful in our future

00:32:20.475 --> 00:32:21.270 align:middle line:90%
than it already is.

00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:21.730 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:22.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:25.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: But what you
say about it coming more

00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:31.570 align:middle line:84%
from a kind of mental
integration, a mental place.

00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:35.860 align:middle line:84%
I am very psychic and I
often experience that level

00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:37.850 align:middle line:90%
of mental integration.

00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:41.170 align:middle line:84%
And so I think this
machine phase is just

00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:43.130 align:middle line:90%
a step in the whole thing.

00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:44.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's going
to have to be dealt

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:47.900 align:middle line:84%
with because of the amount
of power that it consumes.

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:50.980 align:middle line:84%
And is anybody noticing
that after being pressured

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:54.890 align:middle line:84%
to buy electric vehicles and
turn your thermostat down,

00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:58.060 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, is anybody noticing
that these data centers are

00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:01.360 align:middle line:84%
going to run artificial
intelligence are taking away

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:05.803 align:middle line:84%
all of the progress that's
been made to try to have--

00:33:05.803 --> 00:33:07.095 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They are these farms.

00:33:07.095 --> 00:33:07.660 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yes.

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:09.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, a lot
of it, unless you're

00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:11.975 align:middle line:84%
going with solar or some
other thing that's fueling it.

00:33:11.975 --> 00:33:12.775 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:33:12.775 --> 00:33:13.600 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:17.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
there's already been,

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:20.440 align:middle line:84%
it's been known by the
Pentagon and others

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:23.770 align:middle line:84%
that they've been playing
with what's called apparently

00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:29.220 align:middle line:84%
integrated circuitry, meaning
mass physical, physical mass

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:32.260 align:middle line:84%
and biology flesh and
artificial intelligence

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:36.850 align:middle line:84%
together, to be able to garner
the native intelligence of say,

00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:39.360 align:middle line:84%
the human organs of
the body to create

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:45.420 align:middle line:84%
another level of intelligence
that has its own embodiment.

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:47.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, does anything
in your experience

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:48.720 align:middle line:90%
and what you've seen--

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:52.300 align:middle line:84%
what is your instinct
tell you about that?

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:54.695 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure it's been done
in other places already.

00:33:54.695 --> 00:33:56.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Well,
it's interesting

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.890 align:middle line:84%
because we brought up the
issue of using too much energy.

00:33:58.890 --> 00:33:59.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:02.867 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And energy is
coming from electromagnetism.

00:34:02.867 --> 00:34:04.450 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we're
trying to run it.

00:34:04.450 --> 00:34:05.867 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
get it all going

00:34:05.867 --> 00:34:08.560 align:middle line:84%
and set it up based
on electricity.

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:10.679 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, it'll
be interesting to see

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:12.420 align:middle line:90%
whether that works or not.

00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:14.010 align:middle line:84%
It could be that
the only way they're

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:16.409 align:middle line:84%
going to be able to
even create these things

00:34:16.409 --> 00:34:21.940 align:middle line:84%
is by technologies that are
in a more compatible form,

00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:23.838 align:middle line:84%
say, with the objective
that we have--

00:34:23.838 --> 00:34:26.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Zero point energy
and so forth in the future.

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:27.320 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: I know, I know.

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:29.620 align:middle line:84%
So there's certainly
works with that

00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:33.880 align:middle line:84%
very nicely by designing
some technological things

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:35.679 align:middle line:90%
based on Tesla coils.

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:37.270 align:middle line:90%
So I think we're going to see--

00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:39.270 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how much
we're going to really hear

00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:41.170 align:middle line:84%
of the real truth
about this, but there

00:34:41.170 --> 00:34:44.201 align:middle line:84%
must be a battle going on within
scientists wanting to push--

00:34:44.201 --> 00:34:45.159 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It has to be.

00:34:45.159 --> 00:34:46.040 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Oh, God.

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:48.219 align:middle line:84%
Push the energy in
the right direction,

00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:50.150 align:middle line:84%
if you want to call
it that or not.

00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:50.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:51.159 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:51.159 --> 00:34:54.699 align:middle line:84%
So then we both came across
also a fellow young man

00:34:54.699 --> 00:34:57.370 align:middle line:84%
named Darius J. Wright,
who's interesting

00:34:57.370 --> 00:35:00.010 align:middle line:84%
because he does a lot of
out-of-body exploration

00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:01.660 align:middle line:84%
and he's all over
the internet now.

00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:04.070 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed him
here and on my site.

00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:08.200 align:middle line:84%
And what he brings
to the table is

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:12.580 align:middle line:84%
kind of a visceral view of what
it looks like when you get out

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:17.500 align:middle line:84%
of the construct and look back
at these realms and dimensions,

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:20.330 align:middle line:84%
and the thought
forms that create it.

00:35:20.330 --> 00:35:23.080 align:middle line:84%
Going back to the need to
have our thoughts so clear,

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:25.910 align:middle line:84%
he's saying you can
literally once he gets out,

00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:29.490 align:middle line:84%
he can walk into walk through
the thought form of someone

00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:30.290 align:middle line:90%
he knows.

00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:32.332 align:middle line:84%
He knows kind of where
things are-- where they're

00:35:32.332 --> 00:35:34.960 align:middle line:84%
headed for that person
because of the density

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:37.673 align:middle line:84%
and repetition of the thought
form that they're creating,

00:35:37.673 --> 00:35:38.840 align:middle line:90%
which he's interfacing with.

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:39.610 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah, yeah.

00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:40.410 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:43.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've watched one
interview you had with him,

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.490 align:middle line:84%
and I'm very, very
impressed with him

00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:47.740 align:middle line:84%
because what he
reminds me of is he

00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:50.710 align:middle line:90%
reminds me of a medieval seer.

00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:54.520 align:middle line:84%
Like, back in the 10th, 11th and
12th centuries with people like

00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:56.840 align:middle line:84%
Meister Eckhart and
Hildegard Von Bingen,

00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:59.300 align:middle line:84%
because I used to, when I
worked for Barron company,

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:01.340 align:middle line:84%
I used to publish a
lot of medieval books.

00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:02.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:05.180 align:middle line:90%
- And they're very visual.

00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And you can see all
these angelic realms,

00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:12.560 align:middle line:84%
you can see all these circles
of vibration, of dimensions.

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:15.760 align:middle line:84%
And actually Darius
sees it differently

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:17.950 align:middle line:84%
than I do because
I see it more, I

00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:20.950 align:middle line:84%
see more of the simple
structure of the whole thing

00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:22.580 align:middle line:90%
and the way the dimensions work.

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And he's seeing more
of this visual panoply

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:29.700 align:middle line:84%
of just this gigantic,
expansive site within--

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:32.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like our universe
is just a construct

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:35.023 align:middle line:90%
among countless universes.

00:36:35.023 --> 00:36:35.830 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:36:35.830 --> 00:36:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And so the reason I'm really
excited right now, Regina,

00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:43.920 align:middle line:84%
is that once it was time to
bring the 20th anniversary

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:48.270 align:middle line:84%
edition out, this gave me
another chance to look deeply

00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:53.820 align:middle line:84%
into what have I been seeing
from 2011 to 2024 regarding

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:57.910 align:middle line:84%
people who are verifying
"Alchemy of Nine Dimensions."

00:36:57.910 --> 00:37:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And I see Darius as a
person who is seeing

00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:06.690 align:middle line:90%
what I kind of schematize.

00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:08.573 align:middle line:84%
My goal or the
Pleiadians', I should

00:37:08.573 --> 00:37:10.990 align:middle line:84%
say, because they're the ones
who created the whole thing.

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:13.410 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to come up
with the simplest idea

00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:16.480 align:middle line:84%
that people would get of
how this all fits together.

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:17.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:21.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And then Darius
is like seeing the same thing.

00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And then Radu Cinamar in his
seven books when he starts

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:30.670 align:middle line:84%
developing the technology
found under Romania,

00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:33.600 align:middle line:90%
which is 50,000 years old.

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:37.380 align:middle line:84%
The reason this is so
significant is this technology

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:41.800 align:middle line:84%
is 50,000 years old
and it still works.

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:46.140 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened is
Radu Cinamar and Cezar Brad

00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:52.440 align:middle line:84%
have opened up this whole field
of showing how ancient this

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:54.940 align:middle line:90%
is, how deep it is within us.

00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:58.320 align:middle line:84%
And then what
happened for me was I

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:01.210 align:middle line:84%
started realizing, as
I really studied Radu,

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:05.280 align:middle line:84%
is the whole thing that he
was doing with Cezar Brad,

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:08.160 align:middle line:84%
to activate the
technology is exactly

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:11.710 align:middle line:84%
the same thing as the system
that alchemy of nine dimensions.

00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:12.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And that
just blew me away,

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:17.680 align:middle line:90%
including he even used--

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:19.800 align:middle line:84%
what happens with
this technology

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:23.220 align:middle line:84%
is that they were able to
activate a time traveling

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:27.070 align:middle line:84%
machine that takes
you back over--

00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:30.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually takes you back
over 300 or 400 million years.

00:38:30.730 --> 00:38:33.320 align:middle line:84%
But then once Radu
gets it working,

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:35.040 align:middle line:84%
then he spends all
his time, of course.

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:35.840 align:middle line:90%
Who wouldn't?

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:38.920 align:middle line:84%
What would you what if you
could get a time machine going

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:41.050 align:middle line:84%
and if you could just
travel all over the place.

00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And what absolutely knocked
me over is being a Romanian,

00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:48.020 align:middle line:84%
he got real curious
about-- well,

00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:50.750 align:middle line:84%
I wonder what was
going on in Romania,

00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:52.940 align:middle line:90%
like in the last 10,000 years.

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:57.820 align:middle line:84%
So he used the time machine to
travel back to Romania 10,000

00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:02.680 align:middle line:84%
years ago, and he came to this
group of people who were doing

00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:06.850 align:middle line:84%
an energy activation on a
mountain in Bucegi Mountains

00:39:06.850 --> 00:39:09.910 align:middle line:90%
in Romania.

00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And so what he did, said,
well, what are they doing?

00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:13.013 align:middle line:90%
And I'll watch them.

00:39:13.013 --> 00:39:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And so he describes the whole
ceremony that they were doing,

00:39:16.610 --> 00:39:19.630 align:middle line:84%
and it's exactly the
same as the ceremonies I

00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:23.810 align:middle line:84%
taught for 15 years, the
Pleiadian agent activations.

00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:26.760 align:middle line:84%
Because as soon as the
Pleiadian agenda came in--

00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:30.420 align:middle line:84%
first of all, when it came
in 1995 and I channeled it,

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:32.130 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
90% of it meant.

00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:32.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:34.310 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And so the
only way I can figure out--

00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:35.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You were recording--

00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:36.890 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: --what it
meant was I went out

00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:39.980 align:middle line:84%
and I went, OK, I'll create
workshops based on these ideas,

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:42.000 align:middle line:84%
and we'll see what
happens with people.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.410 align:middle line:84%
And so Jerry and I went out
and we taught people Pleiadian

00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:51.380 align:middle line:84%
agenda activations for 15 years,
and now I find in a book a guy

00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:54.980 align:middle line:84%
who got on a time machine
and went back and watched one

00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:57.475 align:middle line:90%
in Romania 10,000 years ago.

00:39:57.475 --> 00:39:58.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And there's someone else
you're reading right now.

00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:02.415 align:middle line:90%
I've forgotten his name.

00:40:02.415 --> 00:40:03.665 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Joshua Reichmann.

00:40:03.665 --> 00:40:05.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Spell his name again.

00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:05.630 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:06.430 align:middle line:90%
Reichman.

00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:08.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Reichmann.

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:09.437 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: M-A-N-N.

00:40:09.437 --> 00:40:11.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what is the
name of that book again?

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:14.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And that's called
"The Realized Light of Twelve

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:14.970 align:middle line:90%
Dimensions."

00:40:14.970 --> 00:40:15.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:16.510 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:19.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because that, you
said, is truly profound.

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:20.780 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:23.600 align:middle line:84%
So let me just say where
this fits together, OK?

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:27.410 align:middle line:84%
Radu and Cezar are kind
of the technicians who

00:40:27.410 --> 00:40:30.350 align:middle line:84%
are working on how to deal with
the military and the Secret

00:40:30.350 --> 00:40:32.930 align:middle line:84%
Services, which is no
mean feat, in order

00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:35.750 align:middle line:84%
to activate this
technology that they know

00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:37.520 align:middle line:90%
is important for all of us.

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:41.355 align:middle line:84%
And the reason it's valuable to
read these people is this is--

00:40:41.355 --> 00:40:42.980 align:middle line:84%
you'll find out if
you read these books

00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:44.750 align:middle line:90%
that this is actually real.

00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:46.740 align:middle line:84%
And the Americans are
trying to cover it up,

00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:49.080 align:middle line:84%
but they're not going to
be able to do that forever.

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:52.130 align:middle line:84%
So then we have somebody
like Darius Wright, who's

00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:56.070 align:middle line:84%
actually like a seer, a real
seer, like Hildegard Von Bingen.

00:40:56.070 --> 00:40:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And actually have
somebody who could see it.

00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:01.070 align:middle line:84%
Then we've got Barbara
putting it all together

00:41:01.070 --> 00:41:03.810 align:middle line:90%
into a system, a simple system.

00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:06.600 align:middle line:84%
By the way, "Alchemy" is
actually a very simple book,

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:08.580 align:middle line:84%
considering the nature
of the material--

00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:09.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Considering, yeah.

00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:09.930 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Very simple.

00:41:09.930 --> 00:41:11.005 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
you have Joshua.

00:41:11.005 --> 00:41:12.295 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: We have
Joshua Reichmann.

00:41:12.295 --> 00:41:12.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's he do?

00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:15.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Here's the
deal with Joshua Reichmann.

00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:20.780 align:middle line:84%
Joshua Reichmann writes so
deliciously about all the ideas

00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:21.960 align:middle line:90%
that you're discussing.

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:24.612 align:middle line:84%
The man's language
is unbelievable.

00:41:24.612 --> 00:41:26.195 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I love it
when it's refined.

00:41:26.195 --> 00:41:29.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: So we have
somebody who is actually

00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:33.230 align:middle line:84%
describing all of this
accurately and eloquently

00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:34.560 align:middle line:90%
and beautifully.

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:37.340 align:middle line:84%
And we need this at
this point because this

00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:38.730 align:middle line:90%
is what wakes us up.

00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:40.665 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, speaking
of waking us up,

00:41:40.665 --> 00:41:42.290 align:middle line:84%
you have to ask,
well, what was Barbara

00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:45.430 align:middle line:90%
doing from 2011 through 2024?

00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:47.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know
what you were doing.

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:47.875 align:middle line:90%
You're writing the trilogy.

00:41:47.875 --> 00:41:48.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: 'Cause I came here.

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:50.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Basically
fiction to try

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.750 align:middle line:84%
to pull all these concepts
together in a juicy story.

00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:53.550 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:55.350 align:middle line:84%
Because I decided,
what can I do?

00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:57.510 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't-- I kept
teaching activations,

00:41:57.510 --> 00:42:00.140 align:middle line:84%
but I finally just couldn't
stand going all over the world

00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:01.380 align:middle line:90%
and being on the road.

00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And so then I
realized like, hey,

00:42:03.690 --> 00:42:06.770 align:middle line:84%
I can write fiction
with characters who

00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:08.280 align:middle line:90%
are becoming multi-dimensional.

00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:09.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:10.955 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: So we have
a group of characters

00:42:10.955 --> 00:42:15.680 align:middle line:84%
in Rome and Tuscany and
America who are actually

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:18.720 align:middle line:84%
becoming multidimensional
consciousness,

00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:20.390 align:middle line:84%
and they go through
all the struggle

00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:22.490 align:middle line:84%
that anybody goes through,
because if you do it,

00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:23.290 align:middle line:90%
it's a challenge.

00:42:23.290 --> 00:42:23.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:25.618 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: But we've
got them doing it.

00:42:25.618 --> 00:42:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And there's parents, there's
generations involved in this.

00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:32.390 align:middle line:84%
And so fiction allows
you to experience things

00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:34.140 align:middle line:90%
in a way that's a lot of fun.

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:34.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:35.480 align:middle line:90%
And I loved it.

00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:36.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: That's the
thing about fiction.

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:36.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:37.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:39.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so we only have
a couple of minutes left.

00:42:39.330 --> 00:42:40.890 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you
leave us with this?

00:42:40.890 --> 00:42:43.380 align:middle line:90%
OK, The Blue Brain Project.

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: OK.

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:46.320 align:middle line:84%
Great to bring that
one in right now,

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:48.740 align:middle line:84%
because then the other
thing that I discovered

00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:50.220 align:middle line:90%
was the Blue Brain Project.

00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And the first information that
we were able to get on this

00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:54.630 align:middle line:90%
was 2015.

00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:57.060 align:middle line:84%
So this is in the middle
of this whole thing.

00:42:57.060 --> 00:43:00.870 align:middle line:10%
And the Blue Brain Project
is a group of scientists,

00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:04.040 align:middle line:10%
working mathematicians,
topologists actually,

00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:07.280 align:middle line:10%
working in Switzerland,
and they have actually

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:10.670 align:middle line:10%
created a huge
computer that actually

00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:16.400 align:middle line:10%
shows the geometrical
forms of each

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:20.550 align:middle line:10%
of the nine to 11 dimensions,
the size nine to 11.

00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:24.770 align:middle line:10%
And they've actually been able
to show the geometry that's

00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:26.400 align:middle line:10%
operating in the brain.

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:29.400 align:middle line:10%
And they actually can show
which parts of the brains

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:31.950 align:middle line:10%
are responding in
which dimensions.

00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:34.540 align:middle line:10%
And so this is
actually, I'm sure,

00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:37.770 align:middle line:10%
very involved with
artificial intelligence,

00:43:37.770 --> 00:43:40.800 align:middle line:10%
because artificial
intelligence ultimately

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:45.300 align:middle line:10%
is working to find ways
to access intelligence

00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:47.550 align:middle line:10%
through our brains,
and then to convert

00:43:47.550 --> 00:43:49.310 align:middle line:10%
that intelligence to computers.

00:43:49.310 --> 00:43:50.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:50.110 --> 00:43:50.910 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:51.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:52.180 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:52.980 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:54.480 align:middle line:90%
Well, final thoughts.

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:56.170 align:middle line:90%
We don't have any time left.

00:43:56.170 --> 00:43:59.670 align:middle line:84%
So any final thoughts in
this period of time and what

00:43:59.670 --> 00:44:03.780 align:middle line:84%
we're here to do and talking
about these and the book itself,

00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:06.658 align:middle line:84%
the updated version of
"Alchemy of Nine Dimensions"?

00:44:06.658 --> 00:44:07.700 align:middle line:90%
A little wrap up thought.

00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:09.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah, just one
thing I just want to say.

00:44:09.930 --> 00:44:13.500 align:middle line:84%
This fourth dimensional
zone that a lot of us

00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:17.350 align:middle line:84%
were caught in, just continue
as you feel that stress,

00:44:17.350 --> 00:44:19.650 align:middle line:90%
that duality struggle.

00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:22.740 align:middle line:84%
Just continually, intentionally
move your consciousness

00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:23.830 align:middle line:90%
into your heart.

00:44:23.830 --> 00:44:27.070 align:middle line:84%
Because what that'll do is once
you're in the fourth dimension,

00:44:27.070 --> 00:44:31.180 align:middle line:84%
after all, is a higher dimension
than 3D linear space and time.

00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:33.700 align:middle line:84%
So once you move
into the fourth,

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:36.070 align:middle line:84%
then you can move
into the fifth.

00:44:36.070 --> 00:44:37.955 align:middle line:84%
And then once you're in
the fifth dimension--

00:44:37.955 --> 00:44:38.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Into the heart.

00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:40.647 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: --you
can access to all the

00:44:40.647 --> 00:44:42.780 align:middle line:84%
higher dimensions, including
going all the way up,

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:45.200 align:middle line:84%
with Joshua Reichmann
going up to 12 dimensions.

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:47.140 align:middle line:90%
So I only go up to nine.

00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:48.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and
that makes sense

00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:52.920 align:middle line:84%
because that thing we call
love, that nebulous word

00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:56.363 align:middle line:84%
that we call love, is
such a fine frequency that

00:44:56.363 --> 00:44:58.155 align:middle line:84%
is the pathway to all
the other dimensions.

00:44:58.155 --> 00:44:58.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Mm-hmm.

00:44:58.560 --> 00:44:59.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:44:59.370 --> 00:45:00.365 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yes, yes.

00:45:00.365 --> 00:45:02.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, Barbara,
thank you so much.

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:03.742 align:middle line:90%
This is exciting.

00:45:03.742 --> 00:45:05.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad you and I have
been on a similar track

00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:08.460 align:middle line:84%
and chatting behind the
scenes about these adventures

00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:10.410 align:middle line:84%
as we've been reading
these books and such,

00:45:10.410 --> 00:45:13.630 align:middle line:84%
and hope other people choose
to join in with this as well.

00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:15.095 align:middle line:90%
This is really an amazing time.

00:45:15.095 --> 00:45:17.595 align:middle line:84%

you for having me on the show.
