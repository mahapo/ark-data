[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:10.353 --> 00:00:27.714 align:middle line:90%


00:00:27.714 --> 00:00:29.630 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: The
science of hand reading

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.800 align:middle line:10%
has progressed far
beyond the days of Madame

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.660 align:middle line:10%
Zelda, the fortune teller.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.950 align:middle line:84%
In fact, according to today's
guest, Ellen Goldberg,

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.220 align:middle line:84%
you can glean nearly
everything about a person

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.570 align:middle line:84%
from their hands-- body,
mind, emotions, and soul.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.780 align:middle line:84%
From shape, color,
nails, hair, mounds,

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.440 align:middle line:84%
each part tells a
part of our story.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.630 align:middle line:84%
So, I'm so excited
to talk you, Ellen.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.730 align:middle line:90%
Your book is like the tome.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.530 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of the end all of
books on the subject, right?

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.660 align:middle line:10%
>>ELLEN GOLDBERG: I wanted it
to be as thorough as possible.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.905 align:middle line:10%
I'd have to be too bold and
brash to say it was the book,

00:01:04.905 --> 00:01:08.930 align:middle line:10%
but I wanted it to be
in print for 100 years,

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.220 align:middle line:10%
to be a reference book.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.803 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it
couldn't be taught.

00:01:11.803 --> 00:01:13.020 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it is so thorough.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.980 align:middle line:90%
It's so well illustrated.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.900 align:middle line:84%
Everything is laid out
in such plain English,

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.740 align:middle line:84%
but it actually is
almost a course of study.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.240 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: It is
a course of study.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.520 align:middle line:10%
It's a textbook.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.790 align:middle line:10%
And anybody, really, can
learn how to read hands.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.210 align:middle line:84%
And if you start at the
beginning of the book,

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.520 align:middle line:84%
really I've written it
in order that someone

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.520 align:middle line:90%
would start at page one.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.353 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and I
think it's appropriate.

00:01:35.353 --> 00:01:37.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Just read it
through in digestible amounts.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.890 align:middle line:84%
You know, read a
few pages a day.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.630 align:middle line:84%
And then it's written especially
to be friendly, absorbable,

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.090 align:middle line:84%
understandable, and one thing,
one point, builds on the other.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And if someone
went through it slowly,

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.410 align:middle line:84%
they could become
a real palmist.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:57.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.280 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Because
you don't have

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.380 align:middle line:90%
to be psychic to read palms.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.660 align:middle line:84%
You just have to love people,
and have a real interest

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:03.460 align:middle line:90%
in human nature.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.660 align:middle line:84%
Your book is the
first time I really

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.759 align:middle line:84%
understood how deep that
art and science, as you say,

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.250 align:middle line:90%
of hand reading goes.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.360 align:middle line:84%
How did you end up
doing this initially?

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.950 align:middle line:90%
What drew you to hand reading?

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: In some
ways, it was fate.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.010 align:middle line:84%
When I was introduced to
the I Ching, when I was 27,

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.780 align:middle line:84%
and in just maybe
15 minutes, I saw

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.800 align:middle line:84%
that there was a
higher intelligence

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.040 align:middle line:84%
that it would
communicate, and that it

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.680 align:middle line:90%
could see me so clearly.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.200 align:middle line:90%


00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.870 align:middle line:84%
I just could not wait to
see what else existed,

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.890 align:middle line:84%
and so I started to
study everything.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold,
I was good at it.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And at a little school that
I found-- no longer exists,

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.380 align:middle line:84%
but it was called the
School of Inner Vision--

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.360 align:middle line:84%
I was asked to be the assistant
to the palmistry teacher.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.080 align:middle line:84%
I resisted at first,
because I wanted so much

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.410 align:middle line:84%
to go to the tarot teacher,
who had requested me also.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.800 align:middle line:84%
But the head of the school
said, palmistry is your weakest

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.520 align:middle line:84%
subject, and if we don't
put you with this teacher,

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.790 align:middle line:90%
you may drop it.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.810 align:middle line:90%
So, it's this or nothing.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.500 align:middle line:84%
And so I became the
assistant, and this

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.260 align:middle line:90%
is where fate took a hand.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Three months
into the assistantship,

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.960 align:middle line:84%
the teacher inherited a
house 100 miles from where

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.870 align:middle line:84%
we lived, from New
York City, and said,

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.030 align:middle line:90%
Ellen, the class is yours.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And so I left
my job as a social worker.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.410 align:middle line:90%
I was 29.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.370 align:middle line:84%
Those of you who
know astrology-- you

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.420 align:middle line:84%
know astrology-- it
was the Saturn return,

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.240 align:middle line:84%
so I was taking up my
real place in this world.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And I stayed one
jump ahead of the students,

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.860 align:middle line:84%
and I taught there
for three years.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.650 align:middle line:90%
And that was my initiation.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.980 align:middle line:84%
By the time that I had
taught that for three years,

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.370 align:middle line:90%
I was a palmist.

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But, you know,
it's not happenstance

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:56.700 align:middle line:84%
that you happen to
be chosen for that,

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.260 align:middle line:84%
but also that you were selected
to assist the tarot teacher.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And that also you're
expert in astrology,

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.930 align:middle line:84%
and that you can overlay all
of these themes together.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.610 align:middle line:84%
This had to have been showing
itself even in your childhood.

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.829 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: In some ways, I was
always imaginative, always more

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.240 align:middle line:90%
drawn inwards and artistic.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.110 align:middle line:90%
I painted.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:23.250 align:middle line:90%
I acted.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.320 align:middle line:90%
I danced.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.850 align:middle line:84%
But in all truth, Regina,
I didn't discover myself

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.020 align:middle line:90%
until my late 20s.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.220 align:middle line:84%
When that awakening
came and I saw

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.990 align:middle line:84%
the truth of the
communication ability

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.020 align:middle line:84%
and the friendliness
of the higher forces,

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.450 align:middle line:90%
everything changed forever.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.420 align:middle line:84%
I could never go back to my
old ways, to my old boyfriend,

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.710 align:middle line:90%
to my old job.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:49.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.650 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: It was a new life.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.580 align:middle line:84%
So, I totally believe
in being a late bloomer.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.660 align:middle line:84%
What showed early was my
sensitivity and my curiosity,

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.880 align:middle line:84%
but I had not been
exposed to these things.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's interesting
because before we

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.290 align:middle line:84%
went on camera, everybody in the
studio-- there are quite a few

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.690 align:middle line:84%
moving parts here-- came over
and showed you their hand.

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And you generously read each
person, and blew their mind.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.197 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Which
I adore to read

00:05:15.197 --> 00:05:17.840 align:middle line:90%
people's palms, wherever I go.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk a little
bit about the history of hand

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.660 align:middle line:84%
reading to begin with,
because most people do think

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.100 align:middle line:84%
of it as kind of an
extension of fortune telling,

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.160 align:middle line:84%
and maybe they can get
a thing or two right,

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.150 align:middle line:84%
but let's go into
its deeper roots.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: I think the roots
go back to the dawn of time,

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:40.850 align:middle line:84%
when we see the hands
on cave paintings,

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.910 align:middle line:84%
you know, everywhere
from some of them

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:49.940 align:middle line:84%
from 25,000 years before the
Christian era, many from 8000,

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.130 align:middle line:90%
9000 years BCE.

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.171 align:middle line:84%
We see that people knew
that the hands were unique.

00:05:56.171 --> 00:05:59.260 align:middle line:90%


00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.820 align:middle line:90%
We did not have social media.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.440 align:middle line:84%
There were no books,
but there were tribes,

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.960 align:middle line:90%
there were stories.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And as people gathered
together, they

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.970 align:middle line:84%
started to discuss things that
they saw both in the heavens

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.020 align:middle line:90%
and in the hands.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And so these were some of the
earliest mystical sciences that

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.340 align:middle line:84%
were developed, and really
laid the groundwork for so many

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.530 align:middle line:90%
other things that came later.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:31.930 align:middle line:84%
When we look at, say,
palmistry as we know it,

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.660 align:middle line:84%
we know that the Chinese
used fingerprinting

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.580 align:middle line:84%
for identification 1,000 years
before we did in the west.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:41.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: They used
different diagnosis, certainly,

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.300 align:middle line:90%
way before that as well.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.350 align:middle line:84%
Do we know really whether it
came-- its first roots were

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.650 align:middle line:90%
from India or from China?

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:57.000 align:middle line:84%
I myself can't make
a good call on that,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.960 align:middle line:84%
but I know that we brought
back so much from the Persians.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:05.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: They also had
exquisite astrology, right?

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:11.100 align:middle line:84%
All of these great nations,
all of these great areas

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:17.150 align:middle line:84%
of the world, had both astrology
and palmistry traditions

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:19.540 align:middle line:84%
reaching back
thousands of years.

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.380 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
I get a big kick out of

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:27.880 align:middle line:84%
is that in the Vedas, these
ancient scriptures from India,

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:33.150 align:middle line:84%
about 2000 BC there is actually
an admonition to the monks

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:35.350 align:middle line:84%
saying, you know,
it's really not

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:38.140 align:middle line:90%
right to read palms for money?

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And so, therefore, we know it
was already a profession 2000

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.250 align:middle line:90%
BC.

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:48.900 align:middle line:84%
You could do it, but not for
money if you were a monk.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's interesting.

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And so when you
started on this path

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:57.210 align:middle line:84%
and you were assigned to
this particular teacher,

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:00.720 align:middle line:84%
were there some events
that were pivotal for you

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.730 align:middle line:90%
in the very beginning?

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:04.260 align:middle line:84%
Were there some
readings that happened

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.320 align:middle line:84%
that were just so
extraordinary and mind

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.860 align:middle line:84%
blowing that it really
started taking you

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.630 align:middle line:90%
in it, heart and soul?

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:15.460 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: I can say that
every reading is mind blowing.

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:17.110 align:middle line:90%
Every hand is unique.

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:20.380 align:middle line:84%
Look how we identify
people by fingerprints.

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:21.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:25.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And that in all
the world, your fingerprints

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:28.770 align:middle line:90%
only belong to you.

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:33.169 align:middle line:84%
Just add on to that the
shape of the fingertips,

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:35.630 align:middle line:84%
the length of them, the
texture of the skin,

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:38.490 align:middle line:84%
the development in
combination of the paddings

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:41.240 align:middle line:90%
or mounts within the hand.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.090 align:middle line:84%
You know, the line
structure, and all the things

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:48.230 align:middle line:84%
that can be there every
age along the line.

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:51.950 align:middle line:84%
Every hand is unique,
but I must say

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:55.910 align:middle line:84%
that getting to read the
hand of Muhammad Ali when

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.550 align:middle line:90%
I was probably about 30, 31.

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:00.660 align:middle line:90%
I was still a new palmist.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:04.740 align:middle line:84%
I had a job reading
palms and cards

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.770 align:middle line:84%
at a very fine restaurant
at the World Trade Center,

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:10.220 align:middle line:84%
called the Market
Bar and Dining Room.

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:14.170 align:middle line:84%
And I was engaged
because of that.

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:19.150 align:middle line:84%
Muhammad Ali gave a big benefit
for a children's center,

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:22.690 align:middle line:84%
and they said, we'd like
to hire you to read palms.

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:29.006 align:middle line:84%
And there I was getting to read
the hand of Muhammad Ali, and--

00:09:29.006 --> 00:09:30.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about that for a moment.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:31.110 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: OK.

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:33.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us all
about the experience, what

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:34.900 align:middle line:90%
you saw in him.

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:38.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: First of all,
just the size of the hands.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.950 align:middle line:90%
They were huge.

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:44.370 align:middle line:84%
And, Regina, you have
a stone table here,

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:47.320 align:middle line:84%
and when I pressed his
hands, they had no more

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.540 align:middle line:90%
give in them than this stone.

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:55.690 align:middle line:84%
Hard as a rock, and that
means incredible, vital force.

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, they
had a silkiness to them

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:03.890 align:middle line:84%
that you only find in the most
refined, sensitive people.

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:07.580 align:middle line:84%
So he was a very
unusual combination.

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And I'll never forget the
size of the mount of Venus.

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:13.680 align:middle line:84%
There was so much love of
life, and passion, and love

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:18.910 align:middle line:84%
of love in him, and
appreciation of the beautiful,

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:22.600 align:middle line:84%
that he was such
a gracious person.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.680 align:middle line:84%
And he was so intent
on the reading.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.630 align:middle line:84%
The only little
glitch was he kept

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:30.680 align:middle line:84%
wanting to take the magnifying
glass out of my hand.

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.127 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:32.127 --> 00:10:33.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, now
what about, I mean, he's

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:37.780 align:middle line:84%
a warrior, obviously to have
done the job he did, but did

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:39.040 align:middle line:90%
that show up in his hands?

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.380 align:middle line:84%
The whole courageous
warrior aspect?

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:42.180 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Yes.

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:47.280 align:middle line:84%
He had a mount-- in the hand
there are seven paddings, well

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.290 align:middle line:84%
really eight, but two
belong to the same mount.

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:50.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, we're going
to go in to all of them.

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:52.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And each
of us have archetypes.

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:52.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And there is one
archetype that is the warrior.

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:56.840 align:middle line:90%
That's Mars.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.550 align:middle line:90%
And he had a huge mount of Mars.

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:02.860 align:middle line:84%
Between someone who has
mount of Mars, but-- and that

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:05.260 align:middle line:90%
I expected to see, really.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.219 align:middle line:90%
What I was blown away by--

00:11:07.219 --> 00:11:08.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Was that Venus.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:09.426 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: --was the Venus.

00:11:09.426 --> 00:11:10.600 align:middle line:90%
So much love.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:15.480 align:middle line:84%
So much juicy, good
feeling to him.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.920 align:middle line:84%
So he really was
a loving warrior.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:18.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.070 align:middle line:90%
Well, how beautiful.

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:22.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think so many people
have such a deep admiration

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:24.910 align:middle line:84%
for him and don't even
know why, but it all

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:26.800 align:middle line:90%
showed very obviously to you.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.110 align:middle line:84%
I love this comment
in your book.

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:32.240 align:middle line:84%
It was a quote by Goethe,
that said, "The hand is

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.680 align:middle line:90%
the outside part of the brain."

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.577 align:middle line:90%
Now, how did you interpret that?

00:11:36.577 --> 00:11:40.300 align:middle line:90%


00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: The
hand and the brain

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:46.220 align:middle line:84%
are made from the
same stem cells,

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:50.020 align:middle line:84%
so there is a connection
from the get go.

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And when you develop,
there are more nerves

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:57.420 align:middle line:84%
between the hand and the
brain than in any other part

00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:00.470 align:middle line:90%
of the nervous system by far.

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And you know how every
thought has a chemistry?

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:10.930 align:middle line:84%
This is the terminus for
all of those feelings, all

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:13.150 align:middle line:90%
those chemical reactions.

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And so, the mind
writes the lines.

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:25.680 align:middle line:84%
Of course-- the hand,
you hardly have to think,

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:31.090 align:middle line:84%
I want to raise this cup
and bring it to my mouth.

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:32.720 align:middle line:90%
Good moment for a sip.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And I don't even have
to think of about it.

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:38.920 align:middle line:84%
In that sense, it's
the outside brain.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:43.170 align:middle line:84%
But in the other sense, in
that it is a map of the brain.

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:45.610 align:middle line:84%
Because of all those
nerves, because

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:49.200 align:middle line:84%
of the connection between the
hand and the mind, every time

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.220 align:middle line:84%
the mind changes in
a significant way,

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:54.700 align:middle line:90%
the hand changes too.

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:56.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I find
that interesting,

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:59.220 align:middle line:84%
even in some startling
ways, in the sense

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:02.590 align:middle line:84%
that the length of a
digit can even grow.

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:06.190 align:middle line:84%
So you're saying that-- if
I understand it correctly--

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:08.890 align:middle line:84%
that what is
reflected in our hand,

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:10.830 align:middle line:84%
is the result of
our subconscious

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:12.180 align:middle line:90%
mind in particular.

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:13.590 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Yes.

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:19.290 align:middle line:84%
You know, anyone who has
studied creative visualization

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:24.370 align:middle line:84%
or worked with affirmations,
you know that the conscious mind

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:28.710 align:middle line:84%
does not necessarily
influence us directly,

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:32.430 align:middle line:84%
or we would just think, well,
I'd like to be different,

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:35.870 align:middle line:84%
or I'd like to have
better concentration

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:37.720 align:middle line:90%
or develop this skill.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:38.530 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:42.300 align:middle line:84%
The conscious must go
first to the subconscious.

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.710 align:middle line:84%
It's like Jung said,
"We must always

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:48.410 align:middle line:84%
go the way of the waters,
which tends downward."

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:51.260 align:middle line:84%
Or even the word
success, which comes

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:55.260 align:middle line:84%
from the Latin [? sukceso, ?]
which means to go down, so as

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:56.660 align:middle line:90%
to come up.

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:59.820 align:middle line:84%
You want to influence the
head and influence your fate,

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:01.440 align:middle line:90%
and you can.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:06.200 align:middle line:84%
Each one of us can be really
co-creators of our destiny.

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:10.640 align:middle line:84%
Work with the conscious in order
to influence the subconscious,

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.420 align:middle line:84%
and the subconscious--
which we might

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:17.200 align:middle line:84%
call the great magical
agent-- it effects things.

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:19.590 align:middle line:84%
Now the wonderful
thing is, you can never

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:20.800 align:middle line:90%
fool the subconscious.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:24.460 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Whether the
suggestions you give it

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:28.710 align:middle line:84%
are positive or negative,
it will produce wherever

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:31.500 align:middle line:90%
that dominant thought is.

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:36.200 align:middle line:84%
Probably, our job is
to allow ourselves

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:41.170 align:middle line:84%
to repeat certain thoughts over
and over so that we plant them.

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:43.980 align:middle line:84%
We're planting the seeds
in the subconscious.

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:50.400 align:middle line:84%
When it takes root,
the hand changes.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.870 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: The change
is so authentic.

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:55.200 align:middle line:84%
It is amazing how
rapidly the hand changes.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.040 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: You
can compare them.

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you have noticed
in the book that I say,

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.410 align:middle line:84%
you read the dominant
for right handed people,

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:04.960 align:middle line:90%
that would be the right hand.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.660 align:middle line:84%
But the left hand--
and of course

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:10.370 align:middle line:84%
this would be vice versa
for a left handed person--

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:14.750 align:middle line:84%
but the left hand shows the
qualities given at birth,

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:17.500 align:middle line:84%
and the right hand is
what's become of them.

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And so it shows how
you are now, and what

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:25.680 align:middle line:84%
we seem to have written for
ourselves for the future.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:29.050 align:middle line:84%
There's always a fate
at any given moment,

00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:31.520 align:middle line:90%
but that fate is fluid.

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:35.810 align:middle line:84%
We are invited-- who
was it who said that?

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:40.670 align:middle line:84%
Who said you can never step
in the same river twice?

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:43.630 align:middle line:84%
I've forgotten the Greek
philosopher, but he also said,

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:45.590 align:middle line:90%
character is destiny.

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:47.830 align:middle line:84%
They knew it from
the ancient times.

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:49.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.820 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Oh, Heraclitus.

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:51.860 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:15:51.860 --> 00:16:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And who we are and our dominant
thought patterns-- or as

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.980 align:middle line:84%
the Buddha would say
it, "With our thoughts,

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:04.160 align:middle line:90%
we make our world."

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.070 align:middle line:84%
But it's really with
our repetitive thoughts.

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:08.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:09.870 align:middle line:84%
With our repetitive
thoughts, so they

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:12.589 align:middle line:84%
become part of the repository
of the subconscious.

00:16:12.589 --> 00:16:13.630 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: That's right.

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:14.500 align:middle line:90%
If we want--

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:15.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: New neural wiring.

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:16.520 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Yes.

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:18.830 align:middle line:90%
We rewire them, right?

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:19.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:26.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Just saying I'm
going to have strong willpower,

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:32.185 align:middle line:84%
or sugar and candy have
no appeal to me at all.

00:16:32.185 --> 00:16:33.310 align:middle line:90%
You can't just say it once.

00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:35.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know the
subconscious said, liar.

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:36.280 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: That's right.

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.670 align:middle line:84%
You have to show the
subconscious that you are

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:40.454 align:middle line:90%
authentic and mean business.

00:16:40.454 --> 00:16:42.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so you're
talking about the ways

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:45.070 align:middle line:84%
in which these things
can influence the hands.

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:47.420 align:middle line:84%
So, I have a question
for you that I've

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:51.840 align:middle line:84%
been kind of really
giggling to ask you this.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:54.650 align:middle line:84%
Three-- on my dominant
hand-- three fingers

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:56.302 align:middle line:90%
have been cut off.

00:16:56.302 --> 00:16:57.260 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Is that so?

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:58.242 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:58.242 --> 00:17:00.450 align:middle line:84%
What I'm saying-- you don't
have to look at them now.

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:03.730 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: I should
adore to look at them.

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:07.109 align:middle line:84%
Let me see the two, just
for a moment, to compare.

00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:10.079 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's bizarre to have
that many fingers impacted.

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:11.510 align:middle line:90%
This one, the pad is cut off.

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:14.092 align:middle line:84%
This one, the whole finger
was cut off and sewed back on.

00:17:14.092 --> 00:17:16.300 align:middle line:84%
This one was cut off, but
they didn't sew it back on.

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:17.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: You
mean this took place

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:19.303 align:middle line:90%
on three different occasions?

00:17:19.303 --> 00:17:20.185 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:20.185 --> 00:17:21.069 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Whoa.

00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:23.569 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What does that say
when you have three fingers cut

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:24.810 align:middle line:90%
off on your dominant hand?

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:29.922 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: I want to tell you,
this is a first for me, Regina.

00:17:29.922 --> 00:17:31.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I thought it might be.

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:33.580 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: So I do not
have an easy answer--

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:34.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Scar tissue.

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:35.738 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: --but I can say--

00:17:35.738 --> 00:17:37.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All this weird stuff.

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:40.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: How wonderful
that you would never notice.

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:42.810 align:middle line:84%
Because I asked you to
hold up your hand for me

00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:47.310 align:middle line:84%
when we were in the green room,
and I would not have noticed.

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:48.685 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Isn't
that interesting.

00:17:48.685 --> 00:17:50.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: They
really came out.

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:53.820 align:middle line:84%
There's not one
bit of deformity.

00:17:53.820 --> 00:18:00.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, I
would then immediately

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:02.860 align:middle line:84%
look at the
recessive hand to see

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:05.260 align:middle line:84%
what the-- I would
use the recessive hand

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:08.319 align:middle line:84%
for the relative lengths of the
finger, and not the dominant.

00:18:08.319 --> 00:18:10.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, because
that's not a real length.

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:11.401 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: That's right.

00:18:11.401 --> 00:18:18.140 align:middle line:84%
And I would also want
to see if by chance you

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:20.900 align:middle line:84%
had an influence from
the planet Saturn.

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:24.360 align:middle line:84%
Because when I see that
things happen to people,

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:29.060 align:middle line:84%
I look to see what archetype
would really be prone to that.

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:34.660 align:middle line:84%
And the most accident
prone archetype is Saturn.

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:37.260 align:middle line:84%
And there's something
that confirms that for me,

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:40.700 align:middle line:84%
because you have a mark
that Saturnians have

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:43.270 align:middle line:84%
which is this strong
line right here

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:47.200 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the
bottom third of the-- which

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.944 align:middle line:84%
is trouble with the bones and
joints, and that's Saturnian.

00:18:50.944 --> 00:18:51.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:53.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: If you
need-- and of course

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:55.840 align:middle line:84%
this would have been plenty of
trouble with bones and joints,

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:56.715 align:middle line:90%
but there are others.

00:18:56.715 --> 00:19:00.310 align:middle line:84%
You may have some tendency
towards arthritis or some knee

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:05.180 align:middle line:84%
issues, but it would
also make you deep.

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:10.420 align:middle line:84%
One reason Saturnine as
subjects are accident prone,

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:14.190 align:middle line:84%
is that the mind is always
thinking about something.

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:16.990 align:middle line:84%
They're interested in
knowledge, and research,

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:18.280 align:middle line:90%
and the world around them.

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.210 align:middle line:84%
There are serious
philosophical thinkers.

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:22.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I was
distracted every time

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:23.090 align:middle line:90%
my finger was cut off.

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:25.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: They are the
most likely to be distracted.

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:28.560 align:middle line:84%
We know each archetype
has lessons to learn,

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:31.620 align:middle line:90%
and Saturn's is, be present.

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:32.920 align:middle line:90%
Pay attention right now.

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I didn't
mean to throw a curve,

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:37.012 align:middle line:84%
it's just that it's
such a weird situation.

00:19:37.012 --> 00:19:38.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Regina,
as me anything.

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:40.719 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You'd be the perfect
person to ask about it.

00:19:40.719 --> 00:19:42.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: It's fascinating.

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And when I have a chance,
maybe after the show,

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:48.890 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to look more carefully
at the relative length

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:51.910 align:middle line:84%
of the two hands,
of the finger--

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:53.610 align:middle line:84%
well, show me just
for a minute, now.

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:54.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:54.830 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: OK.

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:56.900 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:59.940 align:middle line:84%
Yes, what I do see
is that the one

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:03.010 align:middle line:84%
that seems to have suffered
the most is the pinky.

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:06.484 align:middle line:84%
Because in the recessive hand
I see a beautiful, long pinky.

00:20:06.484 --> 00:20:08.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, that pinky
was cut off when I was six,

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:09.160 align:middle line:90%
and it's deformed.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:09.950 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: That one?

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:10.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This one.

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:11.405 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: That one.

00:20:11.405 --> 00:20:14.120 align:middle line:84%
That's the one that
is the-- the others

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:17.550 align:middle line:84%
have a relative length
that would hold their own,

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:20.160 align:middle line:90%
even against the birth hand.

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:25.450 align:middle line:84%
It's always interesting to see
where we choose to put rings.

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:28.060 align:middle line:84%
This is the finger
of God, this finger,

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:30.650 align:middle line:84%
and that shows your
spiritual nature.

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And actually, there's
more to be developed.

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:36.182 align:middle line:84%
I know you've had spiritual
experiences, Regina.

00:20:36.182 --> 00:20:37.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But
there's more to come.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.015 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: There's
more to come.

00:20:39.015 --> 00:20:41.720 align:middle line:84%
Because if you hold those
two hands in front of you

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:44.000 align:middle line:84%
and take a peek
yourself, you'll notice

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.140 align:middle line:84%
that the padding
under the index finger

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:48.980 align:middle line:90%
is fuller in the recessive hand.

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:49.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:53.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: That means you
have something to draw on.

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:58.090 align:middle line:84%
That is your, kind of,
bank account of qualities

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:02.220 align:middle line:84%
that are already there,
lying in the subconscious.

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:05.100 align:middle line:84%
It's why whenever I
have the opportunity,

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:07.110 align:middle line:90%
I look at both hands in people.

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:07.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:08.550 align:middle line:90%
And I think--

00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:08.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Because you
can see where they're weak,

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:10.820 align:middle line:84%
what they haven't
developed, but where

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:13.540 align:middle line:84%
are gifts that are
still going to give you

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:15.290 align:middle line:90%
treasures yet to be mined.

00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:16.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Still yet-- yes.

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:20.860 align:middle line:84%
That's a wonderful
treasure chest to have,

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:23.798 align:middle line:90%
constant spiritual growth.

00:21:23.798 --> 00:21:25.881 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Yes, with a
hand that looks like that,

00:21:25.881 --> 00:21:27.950 align:middle line:84%
you know you feel
supported by spirit.

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:28.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:30.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And you
know that you're

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:34.104 align:middle line:84%
driven by it to be the best form
of Regina that you could be.

00:21:34.104 --> 00:21:35.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
that would be true.

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.697 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: It's
naturally in you.

00:21:37.697 --> 00:21:38.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very true.

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:41.075 align:middle line:84%
OK, now let's start breaking
down-- because in your book,

00:21:41.075 --> 00:21:41.950 align:middle line:90%
you have all of this.

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:45.360 align:middle line:84%
So, let's talk
about-- let's see.

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:47.080 align:middle line:84%
Let's go first to
the mounds and lines.

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:47.540 align:middle line:90%
How's that?

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:48.330 align:middle line:90%
Basic concepts.

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:49.120 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Sure.

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:51.286 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So people can
start looking at their hands

00:21:51.286 --> 00:21:53.080 align:middle line:90%
as we're talking, OK?

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:54.700 align:middle line:84%
So people can
begin understanding

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:56.080 align:middle line:90%
the parts of the hand.

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:57.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: When I
teach palmistry--

00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:59.880 align:middle line:84%
and I have a little
school in Manhattan where

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:04.695 align:middle line:84%
I train people--
we start with what

00:22:04.695 --> 00:22:07.490 align:middle line:84%
I call the basic
modifiers, and that's

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:12.240 align:middle line:84%
going to be the things that
make each of those archetypes

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:13.070 align:middle line:90%
unique.

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:17.080 align:middle line:84%
Because not all Saturnine
people or Apollonian

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:19.340 align:middle line:90%
types are going to be alike.

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:21.620 align:middle line:84%
So first thing is you--
the very first thing

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:24.110 align:middle line:84%
that I want to feel--
spread that right

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:27.130 align:middle line:84%
across the table-- oh,
it's just like silk--

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:30.720 align:middle line:84%
is to feel the
texture of the skin.

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:34.460 align:middle line:84%
The silkier, the more refined
the texture of the skin,

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:36.470 align:middle line:84%
the more refined
the nature, and you

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:38.680 align:middle line:84%
know it's going to
go towards a higher

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:41.040 align:middle line:90%
polarity of the archetype.

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.870 align:middle line:84%
If it feels like
sandpaper, it's going

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:47.700 align:middle line:84%
to go towards a lower
polarity of the archetype.

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:51.740 align:middle line:84%
If it's in the middle, it's
a good, solid representation

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:52.540 align:middle line:90%
of the archetype.

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:55.150 align:middle line:90%


00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:58.180 align:middle line:84%
Just as nature would have
like the middle ground,

00:22:58.180 --> 00:22:59.680 align:middle line:90%
so can the archetypes.

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.977 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so the archetypes
are determined by the mounds?

00:23:02.977 --> 00:23:04.060 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: By the shapes.

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:04.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The shapes.

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:05.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: The
padding-- well, you know,

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.850 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to know
exactly what terms

00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:10.400 align:middle line:84%
to use when we're not
using the superficial term

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:12.300 align:middle line:90%
as the mounds of the hand.

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:14.550 align:middle line:84%
But considering that
we call the hand

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:17.710 align:middle line:84%
God's road map, we
think of this as a map,

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:22.790 align:middle line:84%
the lines as rivers of energy,
and the paddings are mountains.

00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And they take different
shapes, height, forms.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.460 align:middle line:84%
When I look at a hand,
I look to see what shape

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.610 align:middle line:90%
is going to jump out at me.

00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:35.660 align:middle line:90%
Are any very large?

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:38.910 align:middle line:84%
Like one of the people
here in the studio,

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:41.600 align:middle line:84%
I took a peek at their
hand as I was coming in

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:45.110 align:middle line:84%
and I saw a huge formation
down at the bottom.

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:47.850 align:middle line:84%
I knew this person
loved the ocean.

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:49.840 align:middle line:84%
I knew this person
could hear music

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:52.660 align:middle line:84%
with the cells of their
body, because I know what

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:55.340 align:middle line:90%
the archetype is capable of.

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:58.510 align:middle line:84%
We look-- and to
see, are there ones

00:23:58.510 --> 00:24:03.480 align:middle line:84%
that look fuller,
rounder, and also higher.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:06.460 align:middle line:84%
It's nice to look at the
hand right at eye level

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:12.050 align:middle line:84%
and to see, how high
do those mounts reach.

00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:14.380 align:middle line:90%
We're not only one archetype.

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:17.640 align:middle line:84%
We're usually a combination
of two or three.

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:20.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you explain the
mounds and the archetypes?

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:20.980 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Surely.

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:22.146 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, let's do that.

00:24:22.146 --> 00:24:24.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: There
are seven basics,

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:27.900 align:middle line:84%
and they are the same as the
seven planets of the ancients,

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:32.370 align:middle line:84%
or the seven planetary ruled
spheres on the Kabbalistic

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:33.590 align:middle line:90%
Tree of Life.

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:39.670 align:middle line:84%
These archetypes have been
used since very early times.

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And there was so much
cross cultural pollination,

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:47.620 align:middle line:84%
and different cultures
have recognized

00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:52.660 align:middle line:84%
the same archetypes, the
same gods and goddesses,

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:56.430 align:middle line:90%
in other cultures as their own.

00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:59.580 align:middle line:84%
That's why the Greek and
Roman gods are so similar,

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:02.430 align:middle line:90%
and some have similar names.

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:05.370 align:middle line:84%
The names are changed, but
we know the attributes.

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:08.700 align:middle line:84%
That whether it's Ares
or Mars, it's god of war.

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:09.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:11.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Whether
it's Venus or Aphrodite,

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:14.070 align:middle line:90%
it's the love goddess.

00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:16.830 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's Mercury
or Hermes, it's

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:21.250 align:middle line:84%
the wise, intelligent
trickster, god of medicine,

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:26.530 align:middle line:84%
god of business,
bringer of information

00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:28.950 align:middle line:90%
and knowledge to humankind.

00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:32.670 align:middle line:84%
So there are-- the
seven archetypes

00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:37.120 align:middle line:84%
in the hand are named after
the ancient gods of Greece

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.010 align:middle line:90%
and Rome.

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:42.110 align:middle line:84%
The index finger is--
they are the pads that

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:45.820 align:middle line:84%
are along the top ridge
under the fingers.

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:50.680 align:middle line:84%
There's a special location
all across the middle band

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:51.840 align:middle line:90%
for another.

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And then there are
two along the bottom,

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:56.450 align:middle line:90%
two bottom corners of the hand.

00:25:56.450 --> 00:26:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And their names are-- what
we know as the index finger,

00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:03.720 align:middle line:84%
that padding is the
Mount of Jupiter.

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:07.094 align:middle line:84%
Saturn is the scholar,
the wise philosopher.

00:26:07.094 --> 00:26:08.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The middle finger.

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:09.510 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: The middle finger.

00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:12.180 align:middle line:84%
Jupiter is the leader,
just like Jupiter

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:17.005 align:middle line:84%
was the leader of the gods on
Mount Olympus, Zeus, Jupiter.

00:26:17.005 --> 00:26:19.700 align:middle line:90%


00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:23.940 align:middle line:84%
This is a leadership,
spiritual finger.

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:28.380 align:middle line:84%
Saturn is called-- they
all have nicknames--

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:30.550 align:middle line:90%
the balance wheel of the hand.

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:36.000 align:middle line:84%
It is more conservative,
thoughtful, introverted,

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.910 align:middle line:84%
because they all can be
introvert or extrovert.

00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:44.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's often-- can't be judged
in the same with the others.

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:47.310 align:middle line:84%
All the others can be judged
by fullness and height,

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:50.220 align:middle line:84%
but Saturn's nickname
is the flat mound.

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:52.930 align:middle line:84%
And one way you can tell
when Saturn-- it's not

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:56.460 align:middle line:84%
the only way-- but one way you
can tell that Saturn is very

00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:58.720 align:middle line:84%
strong in a person,
is the whole hand

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:01.710 align:middle line:84%
will have a certain
flatness or evenness.

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:04.720 align:middle line:84%
It's not the case in your hand,
even though Saturn is strong,

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:08.620 align:middle line:84%
and I saw it by other
things and also by the fact

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:10.460 align:middle line:84%
you told me you've
had those accidents.

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:14.460 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, just knowing
some facts of a person's life

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:18.130 align:middle line:84%
says, oh, look for
this or look for that.

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And so Saturn is solitary,
thoughtful, introvert,

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:29.470 align:middle line:90%
and deep-- tends to melancholy.

00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:32.880 align:middle line:84%
But its neighbor, what we
know as the ring finger,

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:35.940 align:middle line:84%
is the finger and
the Mount of Apollo,

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:38.180 align:middle line:90%
and that is extroverted.

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And some people can be
both Saturn and Apollonian.

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:46.820 align:middle line:84%
They could share center
a prominence in the hand,

00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:49.370 align:middle line:84%
and therefore the person
could be introvert, extrovert,

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:51.980 align:middle line:84%
go back and forth like
inhalation and exhalation.

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:54.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Depending on the
situation and environment.

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:58.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Apollo-- Saturn,
for instance, its neighbor,

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:01.480 align:middle line:84%
is the hardest worker,
can lose itself in work.

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:04.710 align:middle line:90%
Apollo can lose itself in play.

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:08.190 align:middle line:84%
It shows us how to have fun, and
it's the creative, artistic--

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:12.170 align:middle line:84%
just like Apollo was
the head of the Muses.

00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:15.410 align:middle line:84%
Apollo was associated
with all the arts,

00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:18.760 align:middle line:84%
and is always shown with
his instrument the lyre.

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:23.275 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, Apollonians
have creative ways.

00:28:23.275 --> 00:28:28.270 align:middle line:84%
It could be painting, writing,
dancing, acting, film.

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:29.140 align:middle line:90%
So many.

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:30.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very artistic.

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:32.310 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Very
artistic, and we

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:35.750 align:middle line:84%
would tell which one of
them by the combination

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:37.500 align:middle line:90%
it had with other mounts.

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:40.130 align:middle line:84%
Because we usually are
a combination of two,

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:44.660 align:middle line:90%
often three mounts.

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:47.920 align:middle line:90%
The little finger is Mercury.

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:53.430 align:middle line:84%
And you would be amazed,
for the littlest finger,

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:56.050 align:middle line:84%
how huge that mount
can be sometimes.

00:28:56.050 --> 00:28:58.330 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes when I hold
the hand like this--

00:28:58.330 --> 00:29:00.920 align:middle line:84%
and it would not be
this way in my hand--

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:04.675 align:middle line:84%
you would see a rising
under the pinky that

00:29:04.675 --> 00:29:07.760 align:middle line:84%
would make you think that really
is like the Rocky Mountains,

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.950 align:middle line:90%
majestic and tall.

00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And Mercury goes with the god
Mercury, god of communication,

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:16.960 align:middle line:90%
business, medicine.

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:21.050 align:middle line:84%
And some of the best doctors,
lawyers, business people,

00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:25.510 align:middle line:84%
communicators, teachers,
have this archetype.

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And each of the archetypes even
has certain characteristic look

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:34.670 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:37.170 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you can
recognize people just

00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:39.720 align:middle line:90%
walking down the street.

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:44.930 align:middle line:84%
Whoa, look at that soft,
corpulent, pale, lunar look.

00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:48.220 align:middle line:84%
You could say, oh, is that
a psychic coming towards me.

00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:52.640 align:middle line:84%
Or you see that shapely,
long legged look

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:55.640 align:middle line:84%
of the Apollonian, who
are tall, and thin,

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:57.710 align:middle line:84%
and bony, and you
say, oh there's

00:29:57.710 --> 00:29:59.780 align:middle line:90%
a Saturnian coming towards me.

00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:02.100 align:middle line:90%
So we can memorize those.

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:04.260 align:middle line:90%
It's so easy.

00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:06.790 align:middle line:84%
The whole middle
portion of the hand

00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:11.880 align:middle line:84%
belongs to the planet
Mars, and we judge it

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:15.100 align:middle line:84%
by its curve outward
on the percussion.

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And just under the lifeline we
divide it into the lower Mars--

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:23.680 align:middle line:84%
just under, below the
lifeline-- and upper Mars--

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:26.750 align:middle line:84%
just slightly
above the headline.

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:30.370 align:middle line:84%
They cover different traits
of the Mars archetype.

00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:33.260 align:middle line:84%
The true Mars archetype
comes from upper Mars.

00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:37.300 align:middle line:84%
Lower Mars provides two
very important things--

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:42.910 align:middle line:84%
sexual consciousness and
sex drive, and assertion.

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:48.120 align:middle line:84%
Of course, since it rules
the sex chakra anyway, right,

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:52.970 align:middle line:84%
and is associated the Kundalini
force in Western mysticism,

00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:54.400 align:middle line:90%
is called The Mars force.

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.990 align:middle line:90%
So it's that.

00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:59.200 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's the force coiled
at the bottom of the spine that

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:02.660 align:middle line:84%
rises in meditation,
to be able to use

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:05.850 align:middle line:84%
for all manner of things--
healing, enlightenment,

00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:07.590 align:middle line:90%
transformation.

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:12.260 align:middle line:10%
The Mars energy is very
much associated, of course,

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:16.870 align:middle line:10%
with love, sex,
bravery, warrior-ship,

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:21.200 align:middle line:10%
and so it's the
development of upper Mars

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:26.180 align:middle line:10%
that we would use to identify
a true Mars archetype.

00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:29.240 align:middle line:84%
Many who have a
strong mount of Mars

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:34.210 align:middle line:84%
are going to have both upper
and lower Mars developed.

00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:35.350 align:middle line:90%
Perfectly great.

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:38.170 align:middle line:84%
They're really
firing on all fronts.

00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:41.560 align:middle line:84%
They are assertive, and they
have that tremendous bravery

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:43.430 align:middle line:90%
and resistance.

00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And you see that some
people have bulges.

00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:50.500 align:middle line:84%
But some people, the
hand is flat here.

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And so they're really
not the bravest,

00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:54.626 align:middle line:84%
but they could have
lower Mars and they

00:31:54.626 --> 00:31:56.420 align:middle line:90%
could have a lot of bravado.

00:31:56.420 --> 00:32:00.000 align:middle line:84%
Everyone would think they were
really stronger than they were

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.990 align:middle line:84%
because they would have
the assertion, the ability

00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:07.260 align:middle line:84%
to put things forth, and no one
would know how much it actually

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:08.385 align:middle line:90%
cost them to do that.

00:32:08.385 --> 00:32:09.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To do that.

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:10.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:13.870 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: But if they have
a full lower Mars, they can.

00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:17.080 align:middle line:84%
But when we identify
someone as a Mars type,

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:19.950 align:middle line:84%
it would never be just
from lower Mars alone.

00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:21.180 align:middle line:90%
It would be from upper Mars.

00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:24.260 align:middle line:90%


00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:29.010 align:middle line:84%
Mars is indispensable,
because it never gives up.

00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And if you have
it flat here, you

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:34.570 align:middle line:84%
have to have something
else in the hand that

00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:36.000 align:middle line:90%
will keep you going.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.310 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people
with large thumbs--

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:44.010 align:middle line:84%
which is willpower-- probably
the single most important thing

00:32:44.010 --> 00:32:44.850 align:middle line:90%
in the hand.

00:32:44.850 --> 00:32:50.160 align:middle line:84%
A large thumb will make people
without much Mars complete

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:51.120 align:middle line:90%
and do things anyway.

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:52.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it will
balance that out.

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:54.053 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's get to
Venus, and then we'll

00:32:54.053 --> 00:32:55.580 align:middle line:84%
go to fingers
including the thumb.

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:56.380 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: OK.

00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:57.900 align:middle line:84%
A little Venus
and a little Luna.

00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:02.010 align:middle line:84%
The ball of the thumb
is the mount of Venus,

00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:04.110 align:middle line:84%
and this is the
single largest area

00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:06.290 align:middle line:90%
in the hand given to any mount.

00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:09.180 align:middle line:84%
Probably because love does
make the world go round,

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:11.900 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of opportunity
for development

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:14.620 align:middle line:90%
is given for it in the hand.

00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:19.040 align:middle line:84%
People who have good, round,
mounts of Venus are loving.

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:20.270 align:middle line:90%
They live for love.

00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:22.180 align:middle line:90%
They love to make people happy.

00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:24.400 align:middle line:84%
They're not the most
ambitious people.

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:28.050 align:middle line:84%
What they want is to
enjoy life, and to help

00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:30.440 align:middle line:90%
other people enjoy life also.

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:31.730 align:middle line:90%
They're giving.

00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:34.100 align:middle line:90%
They like to dance.

00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:35.670 align:middle line:90%
We have a nickname for Venus.

00:33:35.670 --> 00:33:39.450 align:middle line:84%
It's called the Mount of
Melody, and people who have

00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:41.910 align:middle line:90%
a strong mount, have grace.

00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:43.030 align:middle line:90%
They love music.

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:44.760 align:middle line:90%
They need it in their life.

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:47.920 align:middle line:84%
Many a fine musician-- I
read the head of Pavarotti

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:50.340 align:middle line:84%
and also of Leonard
Bernstein when I was young.

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:51.555 align:middle line:90%
That was a pivotal reading.

00:33:51.555 --> 00:33:52.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Large Venus mounds?

00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:53.590 align:middle line:90%
Massive.

00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:56.210 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: They looked like
they were stung by bees.

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:58.920 align:middle line:84%
They were full to
bursting, Regina.

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:00.950 align:middle line:90%
It was marvelous to see.

00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:03.510 align:middle line:84%
People who are extreme
in traits often

00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:09.550 align:middle line:84%
have extreme
indications on the hand.

00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:12.739 align:middle line:84%
In the lower corner-- now mine
is not the most well developed,

00:34:12.739 --> 00:34:15.650 align:middle line:84%
and it's the most rare
to have well-developed,

00:34:15.650 --> 00:34:19.590 align:middle line:84%
but Einstein did, and many
an imaginative thinker

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:24.530 align:middle line:84%
does-- is the mount of the moon
for imagination and intuition.

00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:27.040 align:middle line:84%
Which is why, for
me, I can understand

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:30.940 align:middle line:84%
how Einstein said that
imagination was more important

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:34.620 align:middle line:90%
than reason or than knowledge.

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:36.550 align:middle line:90%
Because he imagined.

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:39.750 align:middle line:84%
He saw, like in a
vision, and intuited

00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:42.389 align:middle line:84%
many of his finest
discoveries, and then

00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:44.659 align:middle line:90%
spent a long time proving them.

00:34:44.659 --> 00:34:47.449 align:middle line:84%
But they come in
a flash, and this

00:34:47.449 --> 00:34:49.254 align:middle line:90%
is where intuition comes from.

00:34:49.254 --> 00:34:51.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about him
for a moment, because we're

00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:52.860 align:middle line:90%
going to go there anyway.

00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:54.670 align:middle line:84%
And we have a picture
from your book.

00:34:54.670 --> 00:34:58.306 align:middle line:84%
He also, as I recall, had
very, very low slung thumbs.

00:34:58.306 --> 00:35:00.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Could you see
that clearly in the book?

00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:01.799 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, I did.

00:35:01.799 --> 00:35:03.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: The
thumb-- like my thumb

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:05.590 align:middle line:90%
is attached right in the middle.

00:35:05.590 --> 00:35:06.930 align:middle line:90%
Turn your towards me.

00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:10.050 align:middle line:84%
Yours is attached right
in the middle also,

00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:13.300 align:middle line:84%
medium low, just a little
bit lower set than mine,

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:17.030 align:middle line:84%
but Einstein's came out right
near the bottom of the hand.

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:20.050 align:middle line:84%
The lower set the
thumb, the greater

00:35:20.050 --> 00:35:22.432 align:middle line:90%
the intellectual capacity.

00:35:22.432 --> 00:35:24.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what about thumbs--
we've talked about the low

00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:26.430 align:middle line:90%
slung thumb and intellect--

00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:28.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Oh, look
how low set that is

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:29.760 align:middle line:90%
on your left hand, Regina.

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is lower.

00:35:31.290 --> 00:35:34.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Oh, now that I see
it open to its full extent,

00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:37.104 align:middle line:84%
you have a beautiful
low set thumb.

00:35:37.104 --> 00:35:38.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, why thank you.

00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:40.730 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Now
I'm so impressed.

00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:43.470 align:middle line:84%
When people hold their
thumbs out like that,

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:45.840 align:middle line:84%
it means they're
claiming total freedom.

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:48.140 align:middle line:84%
Not only do we look at
the setting of the thumb,

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:51.360 align:middle line:84%
high being more [INAUDIBLE],
central-- doesn't mean

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:55.960 align:middle line:84%
you're unintelligent, because I
have centrally located thumbs,

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:58.450 align:middle line:84%
it's just that that is
not the mark that's going

00:35:58.450 --> 00:36:00.296 align:middle line:90%
to identify the intelligence.

00:36:00.296 --> 00:36:04.410 align:middle line:84%
But low set thumbs
want freedom, and they

00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:07.360 align:middle line:84%
have a good intellectual
capacity and also

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:09.180 align:middle line:90%
manual dexterity.

00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:11.120 align:middle line:84%
You could be good
with your hands.

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:13.078 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If I didn't
keep cutting fingers off.

00:36:13.078 --> 00:36:14.482 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: If you didn't take
off the ends of the fingers.

00:36:14.482 --> 00:36:15.610 align:middle line:90%
It does have an influence.

00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:17.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does.

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:19.940 align:middle line:84%
OK, so what about
when we have, say,

00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:23.040 align:middle line:84%
a tight or high thumb
that can't move outward.

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:24.191 align:middle line:90%
What's that mean?

00:36:24.191 --> 00:36:25.440 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: They're less free.

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:29.230 align:middle line:84%
They would rather play things
more safe or know the rules,

00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:32.660 align:middle line:84%
or you should go more
slowly and carefully.

00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:36.220 align:middle line:84%
But whether your thumb is
high, medium, or low set,

00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:39.480 align:middle line:84%
every day you can look at
the position of your thumb,

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:41.440 align:middle line:84%
and it's like a
weather barometer.

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:44.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it'll tighten up
or loosen up on a given day?

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:46.460 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And in a
twinkling of an eye.

00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:47.376 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:36:47.376 --> 00:36:48.990 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Because
it's showing you,

00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:51.720 align:middle line:84%
how do you feel about
your relationship to life?

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:54.310 align:middle line:84%
Like when it's out in
the way you showed me,

00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:56.190 align:middle line:90%
that's tremendous freedom.

00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:58.850 align:middle line:84%
That is as open to
life as you could get.

00:36:58.850 --> 00:37:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And not only do you want
the freedom for yourself,

00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:03.230 align:middle line:84%
you want it for
other human beings.

00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:06.760 align:middle line:84%
When it's at a 45
degree angle like this,

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:10.670 align:middle line:84%
then you're facing life
in a very open, spunky,

00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:13.960 align:middle line:84%
friendly way, and
also open to life.

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:17.890 align:middle line:84%
The wide opening is
extreme claiming a freedom,

00:37:17.890 --> 00:37:21.380 align:middle line:84%
but the 45 degree
opening is very healthy.

00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:25.190 align:middle line:84%
But as it gets closer to
the hand-- and some days

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:28.060 align:middle line:84%
you'll wake up and
you'll see the thumb is

00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:33.030 align:middle line:84%
hugging the hand like a magnet,
and you want to play it safe.

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:36.400 align:middle line:84%
You want to be
closer, more private.

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:39.990 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to make any
big decisions at that time.

00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:44.000 align:middle line:84%
And for people who hold their
thumbs like that chronically,

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.185 align:middle line:84%
you want to go very
slowly and carefully

00:37:46.185 --> 00:37:48.830 align:middle line:84%
and formally in
getting to know them.

00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:51.680 align:middle line:84%
Whereas open thumbs like
that, just like you and I,

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:55.040 align:middle line:84%
we had a big hug
the moment we met,

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:58.084 align:middle line:84%
because people with thumbs
like that are open to life--

00:37:58.084 --> 00:37:59.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Pretty much.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.302 align:middle line:90%
Not a lot of boundaries there.

00:38:00.302 --> 00:38:01.760 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: One
last thing about it

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:06.120 align:middle line:84%
is sometimes the thumb wants
to actually be pointed inwards,

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:08.945 align:middle line:90%
and that's depression.

00:38:08.945 --> 00:38:11.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if people are
holding their hands like that.

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:13.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: When the thumb
points in-- sometimes

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:15.630 align:middle line:84%
even it's out, but it
points towards it--

00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:17.580 align:middle line:84%
you know they're not
feeling so great.

00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And I often suggest they
take a little retreat.

00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:24.830 align:middle line:84%
But if it's like this,
they're not their best.

00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And people who are
really depressed,

00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:30.220 align:middle line:84%
and you'll see this sometimes
in the dying as well,

00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:33.370 align:middle line:84%
they'll enclose the
thumb in the hand.

00:38:33.370 --> 00:38:36.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's like-- because
it's the seat of willpower,

00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:38.500 align:middle line:84%
and it means the will
is being withdrawn.

00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:42.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if there were
one little key to read people

00:38:42.810 --> 00:38:47.245 align:middle line:84%
and where they are,
their openness or fears,

00:38:47.245 --> 00:38:48.380 align:middle line:90%
it's the thumb?

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: You could see
really where they are, and also

00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:53.710 align:middle line:84%
if the fingers are held
tight or held open.

00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:54.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:56.676 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Like every time
I've looked at your hand

00:38:56.676 --> 00:38:58.930 align:middle line:84%
this morning-- this few
times here, and just

00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:02.220 align:middle line:84%
slightly for a moment
before hand-- your fingers

00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:05.790 align:middle line:84%
always have spaces, and
that means easy to approach,

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:09.070 align:middle line:84%
open to life, easy
to get to know.

00:39:09.070 --> 00:39:13.020 align:middle line:84%
As soon as the fingers
are held tight together--

00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:17.650 align:middle line:84%
take your time, want things
proved, more conservative, not

00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:19.860 align:middle line:90%
that easy to approach.

00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:23.850 align:middle line:84%
Be gentle, and don't
expect things right away.

00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:25.450 align:middle line:90%
Much more private.

00:39:25.450 --> 00:39:28.080 align:middle line:90%
Much more open.

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:31.470 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine how many
times a reading will start--

00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:34.980 align:middle line:84%
because I always ask people to
hold their hands straight up--

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:38.840 align:middle line:84%
with their hands held like this,
and as I start to tell them

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:40.790 align:middle line:84%
things that are true
about themselvess--

00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:43.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They start opening
into their normal position.

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:46.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: But some people, if
it's not their normal position

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:48.070 align:middle line:84%
to be like this and
it's just that they're

00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:50.310 align:middle line:84%
conservative at the
beginning of the reading,

00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:53.720 align:middle line:84%
they will chronically
be held close together.

00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:54.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:39:54.830 --> 00:39:59.580 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's this-- that
being held close together

00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:02.320 align:middle line:84%
and flexibility thing we
were just talking about.

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:05.030 align:middle line:84%
There is someone I saw
the hands of recently,

00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:06.529 align:middle line:90%
and I knew this person.

00:40:06.529 --> 00:40:08.570 align:middle line:84%
It's just someone from
the past that I had known,

00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:10.490 align:middle line:84%
and knew some of
their proclivities.

00:40:10.490 --> 00:40:13.830 align:middle line:84%
And this person had some
disturbed, dark things

00:40:13.830 --> 00:40:19.080 align:middle line:84%
going on in their being,
extreme fear of rejection,

00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:22.970 align:middle line:84%
judgment, and all of this
that created behavior that

00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:23.776 align:middle line:90%
didn't serve them.

00:40:23.776 --> 00:40:25.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And did you
see things in the hand that

00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:26.860 align:middle line:90%
looked unusual?

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:27.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, Yeah.

00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:32.380 align:middle line:84%
I've got to tell you what
I saw 20 years later.

00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:38.220 align:middle line:84%
The person had skin that was so
thick and overgrown and rough,

00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:41.360 align:middle line:84%
they looked like 100-year-old,
150-year-old hands,

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:45.500 align:middle line:84%
and had to have regular
operations to cut the tendons

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:47.980 align:middle line:90%
just to have any movement.

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:50.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Isn't it amazing,
Regina, that the hand--

00:40:50.290 --> 00:40:51.115 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I had
just read your book.

00:40:51.115 --> 00:40:52.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: --is
such a metaphor.

00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:53.654 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh my, god.

00:40:53.654 --> 00:40:55.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Even for
people who have not

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:58.540 align:middle line:84%
read my book, to
think of the hand

00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:00.500 align:middle line:90%
as a metaphor for the person.

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:03.870 align:middle line:84%
Do you know if the hand cannot
open to its full extent--

00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:06.680 align:middle line:84%
we hope that a person
can open a hand fully,

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:08.990 align:middle line:84%
and we press down
on it a little bit.

00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:13.390 align:middle line:84%
This is considered normal,
healthy, adjustable.

00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:17.250 align:middle line:84%
People who are not adjustable,
who hold things in and who

00:41:17.250 --> 00:41:20.990 align:middle line:84%
are very tight in their
manner, the fingers won't open.

00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:22.204 align:middle line:90%
Then there are some maybe--

00:41:22.204 --> 00:41:23.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That are
super flexible.

00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:26.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And mine don't go
back as much as some people.

00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:32.130 align:middle line:84%
Some people really-- those are
versatile, adaptable people.

00:41:32.130 --> 00:41:35.740 align:middle line:84%
The more flexible the hand,
the more flexible the mind.

00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And you could just imagine that
that person with the calloused

00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:40.500 align:middle line:90%
over--

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:42.041 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was
almost like lobster.

00:41:42.041 --> 00:41:45.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was just
thick, thick, rough skin.

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:47.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: When you
say the word lobster,

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:51.040 align:middle line:84%
that brings up for me the
image of it also being

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:52.695 align:middle line:90%
a little bit scaly and rough.

00:41:52.695 --> 00:41:53.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It was like that.

00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:58.194 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And that is
associated with fear.

00:41:58.194 --> 00:41:59.485 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Now that makes sense.

00:41:59.485 --> 00:42:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: There
are many people

00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:05.070 align:middle line:84%
who have a good deal of
fear, and those hands

00:42:05.070 --> 00:42:12.030 align:middle line:84%
can be either cracked, dry
to the point of splitting,

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:14.352 align:middle line:90%
covered over in scales.

00:42:14.352 --> 00:42:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And when you put that
together with a hand that

00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:20.420 align:middle line:84%
can't open-- like say we
have a myriad of traits,

00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:23.760 align:middle line:84%
but many of them have
things in common.

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:26.740 align:middle line:84%
You give somebody's
hand like four or five

00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:31.590 align:middle line:84%
things that all border
on similar stories,

00:42:31.590 --> 00:42:35.040 align:middle line:84%
then you know you have
a very strong specimen

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:39.860 align:middle line:84%
of a particular type of
being in front of you.

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:44.070 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we have people
like Muhammad Ali.

00:42:44.070 --> 00:42:47.240 align:middle line:84%
You would never have expected--
I would never have expected

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:48.797 align:middle line:90%
that silky skin on a warrior.

00:42:48.797 --> 00:42:49.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That refinement.

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:53.370 align:middle line:84%
But he had a refined
mind and way of being.

00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:55.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: So
therefore, it's also

00:42:55.680 --> 00:43:02.170 align:middle line:84%
the juxtaposition of qualities,
the opposite qualities

00:43:02.170 --> 00:43:06.830 align:middle line:84%
in the same nature, that
also define a human being.

00:43:06.830 --> 00:43:12.320 align:middle line:84%
The hand, in many ways, is
a very simple symbol system.

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:15.730 align:middle line:84%
It does not actually
tell everything,

00:43:15.730 --> 00:43:18.690 align:middle line:84%
but what it does
tell, it never lies.

00:43:18.690 --> 00:43:21.620 align:middle line:84%
Because it will change as
you change, and it does

00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:22.920 align:middle line:90%
tell plenty.

00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:24.240 align:middle line:90%
Of course--

00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:25.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So, go ahead.

00:43:25.350 --> 00:43:26.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: I was
going to say, we

00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:27.760 align:middle line:90%
have not even discussed lines.

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:31.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, we're going to
get to fingers and lines now.

00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:34.470 align:middle line:84%
Just briefly on the
fingers, which each one is,

00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:36.780 align:middle line:84%
and when you have a
dominant length or whatever.

00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:39.915 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and you can hold
yours up when we're talking.

00:43:39.915 --> 00:43:41.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: When
I look at hands,

00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:48.320 align:middle line:84%
I can almost say that almost
every part is my favorite,

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:49.770 align:middle line:90%
because every part is exciting.

00:43:49.770 --> 00:43:52.550 align:middle line:90%


00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:54.750 align:middle line:84%
The fingers are named
for the mounts that

00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:58.380 align:middle line:84%
lie underneath them, so we have
the finger of Jupiter, Saturn,

00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:01.410 align:middle line:90%
Apollo, and Mercury.

00:44:01.410 --> 00:44:05.020 align:middle line:84%
They all have
standard proportions,

00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:09.630 align:middle line:84%
and Saturn always considered to
be the longest as the balance

00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:10.430 align:middle line:90%
wheel.

00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:14.085 align:middle line:84%
Since it's conservative, it
holds the other qualities

00:44:14.085 --> 00:44:16.930 align:middle line:84%
in the hand from
running away with them.

00:44:16.930 --> 00:44:19.640 align:middle line:84%
If it is ever shorter
than its two neighbors,

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:24.600 align:middle line:84%
you have someone in front
of you who is darn foolish,

00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:27.137 align:middle line:84%
and is not going to be able
to make wise decisions.

00:44:27.137 --> 00:44:27.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Watch out.

00:44:27.970 --> 00:44:29.511 align:middle line:84%
You don't want a
short middle finger.

00:44:29.511 --> 00:44:31.000 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Never.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.280 align:middle line:84%
But its two neighbors, to be
considered average-- and mine

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:38.890 align:middle line:84%
are close to that-- are
normally about the same size.

00:44:38.890 --> 00:44:41.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm adjusting mine
to look like that.

00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And would come to the very
center of the top section,

00:44:46.330 --> 00:44:51.040 align:middle line:84%
called a phalange, of the Saturn
finger, our central finger.

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:54.550 align:middle line:84%
Or that the pinky also
has a line of demarcation

00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:56.900 align:middle line:84%
when gently held against
the side of the hand,

00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:59.830 align:middle line:84%
it should come to
the line that divides

00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:02.900 align:middle line:84%
the top and middle
phalanges of its neighbor.

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:06.500 align:middle line:84%
When a finger is way longer
or shorter-- like the Jupiter

00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:11.130 align:middle line:84%
finger could be almost
as long as Saturn,

00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:13.340 align:middle line:84%
and you will see
this fairly common--

00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:16.040 align:middle line:84%
then the person is a
natural born leader,

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:19.000 align:middle line:84%
and in fact, has
to be in charge.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.680 align:middle line:84%
You'll know it in
their relationship.

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:23.660 align:middle line:84%
You'll know it in
their business.

00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:26.410 align:middle line:84%
And these are the
people who are meant

00:45:26.410 --> 00:45:30.280 align:middle line:84%
to be good administrators,
fair and just,

00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:35.510 align:middle line:84%
and might often be
highly spiritual.

00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:38.690 align:middle line:84%
Many a politician,
a fine leader,

00:45:38.690 --> 00:45:44.120 align:middle line:84%
the president of a corporation,
the head of an office,

00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:46.300 align:middle line:90%
has a strong finger of Jupiter.

00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:51.090 align:middle line:84%
But say they did not
have a very good hand,

00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:54.270 align:middle line:84%
and the skin was rough
instead of silky.

00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:56.470 align:middle line:84%
If it was silky, they
could be the president

00:45:56.470 --> 00:46:01.620 align:middle line:84%
of the board of directors of
a corporation, of a church.

00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:04.060 align:middle line:84%
You know, something
very refined.

00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:08.420 align:middle line:84%
But if it was rough, they might
be the leader of the gang.

00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:09.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:11.470 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: But lead they will.

00:46:11.470 --> 00:46:13.180 align:middle line:84%
Many people with
strong Jupiter's

00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:15.100 align:middle line:84%
just go off and start
their own companies,

00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:17.210 align:middle line:84%
do their own business,
because they weren't made

00:46:17.210 --> 00:46:19.530 align:middle line:90%
to take orders from anyone.

00:46:19.530 --> 00:46:24.310 align:middle line:84%
If it is short, say it not only
doesn't come to the middle,

00:46:24.310 --> 00:46:27.390 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't hardly
makes coming to the line

00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:32.250 align:middle line:84%
that divides the two phalanges
on its neighbors finger,

00:46:32.250 --> 00:46:35.020 align:middle line:84%
these people don't
want responsibility.

00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:38.390 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to
be in the limelight.

00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:40.350 align:middle line:84%
They could work
as part of a team.

00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:43.590 align:middle line:84%
I've known marvelous people
to have short Jupiter fingers,

00:46:43.590 --> 00:46:45.600 align:middle line:84%
but it isn't because
they're in charge.

00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:47.690 align:middle line:90%
They don't want to be in charge.

00:46:47.690 --> 00:46:49.970 align:middle line:84%
Can they still be
ambitious, because we call

00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:51.270 align:middle line:90%
this the finger of ambition.

00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:51.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:53.596 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: You can
imagine how a long Jupiter

00:46:53.596 --> 00:46:56.310 align:middle line:90%
finger is ambitious.

00:46:56.310 --> 00:46:59.330 align:middle line:84%
They could still succeed
very well in this world,

00:46:59.330 --> 00:47:04.130 align:middle line:84%
because many times-- and I've
seen some here this morning--

00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:06.920 align:middle line:84%
the shorter Jupiter
finger will be accompanied

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:09.440 align:middle line:90%
by an extra long pinky.

00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And the pinky succeeds, not
because it likes the limelight,

00:47:13.970 --> 00:47:15.976 align:middle line:84%
but because it has
such good sense.

00:47:15.976 --> 00:47:17.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it's smart.

00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:18.475 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And
it loves process,

00:47:18.475 --> 00:47:19.950 align:middle line:90%
and it's smart as can be.

00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:24.110 align:middle line:84%
And so then, in a quiet way--
because Jupiter is out front,

00:47:24.110 --> 00:47:27.540 align:middle line:84%
but Mercury would rather do
things in a more subtle way,

00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:29.780 align:middle line:84%
let other people be
in the limelight,

00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:32.470 align:middle line:84%
and be the power
behind the throne.

00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:35.882 align:middle line:84%
They will have their success,
but in a different manner.

00:47:35.882 --> 00:47:38.540 align:middle line:90%


00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:40.760 align:middle line:84%
Let's switch over and talk
about the ring finger.

00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:44.230 align:middle line:84%
When the ring finger
is as long as Saturn,

00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:48.600 align:middle line:84%
now you have people who
are creative, artistic,

00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:52.260 align:middle line:84%
who long to have fun
and who will take risks.

00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:57.780 align:middle line:84%
Because just as Saturn is our
most conservative archetype,

00:47:57.780 --> 00:48:01.090 align:middle line:84%
Apollo is the most
risk taking archetype.

00:48:01.090 --> 00:48:03.100 align:middle line:90%
They will go skydiving.

00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:06.640 align:middle line:90%
They will do the stock market.

00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:11.320 align:middle line:84%
They love to go to casinos
to have a good time.

00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:12.270 align:middle line:90%
Whatever it is.

00:48:12.270 --> 00:48:15.290 align:middle line:84%
They'll take risks in
their lives, in their work.

00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:18.340 align:middle line:84%
And you know that
they must play,

00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:20.510 align:middle line:90%
and they are free with the body.

00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:22.060 align:middle line:84%
Do you know, every
one of these has

00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:25.980 align:middle line:84%
their own kind of
relationship to love and sex?

00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:26.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:28.420 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Apollo--
Appolonians--

00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:32.150 align:middle line:84%
are the most naturally
free with the body,

00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:35.670 align:middle line:84%
and that's why in the lower
aspect of the archetype

00:48:35.670 --> 00:48:39.860 align:middle line:84%
is where we find sex workers who
can use the body as a business

00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:41.140 align:middle line:90%
tool.

00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:46.890 align:middle line:84%
In the higher form, we might
find showgirls and beautiful

00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:49.550 align:middle line:84%
women, artists
models, who felt fine

00:48:49.550 --> 00:48:53.060 align:middle line:84%
about taking their clothes
off, because the body-- it

00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:54.840 align:middle line:90%
was impersonal.

00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:59.020 align:middle line:90%
Where the Saturnian, oh no.

00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:00.660 align:middle line:90%
So conservative.

00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:03.250 align:middle line:90%
You'd have to coax them.

00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:04.363 align:middle line:90%
Not in public, thank you.

00:49:04.363 --> 00:49:05.163 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:49:05.163 --> 00:49:08.780 align:middle line:90%


00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:14.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: The pinky, when it
is long-- we have two forms.

00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:17.770 align:middle line:84%
It can be long and
straight, which is probably

00:49:17.770 --> 00:49:22.320 align:middle line:84%
the safest because if it comes
above this line-- first of all,

00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:25.770 align:middle line:84%
just to come to the
line is completely good.

00:49:25.770 --> 00:49:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And I must say that during
the writing of my book,

00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:31.100 align:middle line:84%
with my book partner-- I have
to mention my partner, Dorian

00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:34.070 align:middle line:84%
Bergen, with whom
this book would never

00:49:34.070 --> 00:49:38.020 align:middle line:84%
have seen the light of
day without Dorian's help,

00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:40.970 align:middle line:84%
because she was the
producer of the book.

00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:46.030 align:middle line:84%
I may be the writer, but
writer cannot do it alone.

00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:49.630 align:middle line:84%
You need constancy in a project
that takes as many years

00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:50.490 align:middle line:90%
as this.

00:49:50.490 --> 00:49:55.950 align:middle line:84%
And to have a friend who
would co-edit, sit by my side,

00:49:55.950 --> 00:50:00.480 align:middle line:84%
put the words into the computer,
do all the public relations

00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:03.290 align:middle line:90%
and-- indispensable.

00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:04.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Does she
have a long pinky?

00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:06.433 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: She absolutely does.

00:50:06.433 --> 00:50:09.820 align:middle line:84%
Her two archetypes
are Mercury and Mars.

00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:12.060 align:middle line:90%
She is go, go, go.

00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:14.900 align:middle line:84%
Whereas I am sort of
Jupiter and Saturn.

00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:16.060 align:middle line:90%
I have ambition.

00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:18.930 align:middle line:84%
I have spirituality, but
I've got a little thumb

00:50:18.930 --> 00:50:20.320 align:middle line:90%
for weak willpower.

00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:22.180 align:middle line:90%
Dorian has a big thumb.

00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:24.750 align:middle line:84%
But during the
writing of this book,

00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:28.610 align:middle line:84%
my pinky grew from
being just barely

00:50:28.610 --> 00:50:30.950 align:middle line:90%
at the line of demarcation.

00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:34.260 align:middle line:84%
It got above it in
these last few years.

00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:36.920 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
I'm 71 years old.

00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:40.410 align:middle line:84%
Your hand can change
until the day you die.

00:50:40.410 --> 00:50:43.590 align:middle line:84%
We are constantly in
process every day.

00:50:43.590 --> 00:50:45.220 align:middle line:84%
But if you have a
long pinky, you're

00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:46.940 align:middle line:84%
going to be a
communicator, and it's

00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:50.390 align:middle line:84%
going to say you are
probably good with money.

00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:52.750 align:middle line:90%
Unless it's very low set.

00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:55.470 align:middle line:84%
You see, mine is not set
even with the others,

00:50:55.470 --> 00:50:57.200 align:middle line:90%
so mine is a pinch low set.

00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:58.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Lower.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.870 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: But
some of them are set

00:50:59.870 --> 00:51:02.250 align:middle line:84%
so low that they
seem that they're

00:51:02.250 --> 00:51:05.040 align:middle line:90%
on a whole different level.

00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:07.900 align:middle line:84%
Pinkys that don't
come to the line,

00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:10.330 align:middle line:84%
they don't like to deal
with money very much.

00:51:10.330 --> 00:51:12.090 align:middle line:90%
They're not very good at it.

00:51:12.090 --> 00:51:14.520 align:middle line:84%
And the pinky, or
the Mercury finger,

00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:17.750 align:middle line:84%
is also where we get
talents for being

00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:20.260 align:middle line:90%
able to judge human nature.

00:51:20.260 --> 00:51:24.960 align:middle line:84%
So that when I have someone
come to me for a reading

00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:28.290 align:middle line:84%
and they have a little
pinky, doesn't reach anywhere

00:51:28.290 --> 00:51:30.790 align:middle line:84%
near the line of
demarcation, then I

00:51:30.790 --> 00:51:32.790 align:middle line:84%
encourage them to
learn something

00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:35.880 align:middle line:84%
like palmistry or
astrology so that they

00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:38.762 align:middle line:84%
can look into the nature of
people and have some way--

00:51:38.762 --> 00:51:39.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What an excellent--

00:51:39.970 --> 00:51:42.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: --to
objectively judge it.

00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:44.690 align:middle line:84%
People who have a
long pinky, or maybe

00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:49.200 align:middle line:84%
with an ever so slight curve
in it, oh, they meet you,

00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:50.290 align:middle line:90%
they know you.

00:51:50.290 --> 00:51:52.470 align:middle line:90%
They are never wrong.

00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:54.740 align:middle line:90%
They are exquisite judges.

00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:59.290 align:middle line:84%
If the finger is too bent--
there can be a little curve,

00:51:59.290 --> 00:52:01.530 align:middle line:84%
and then there's
very deep curves,

00:52:01.530 --> 00:52:03.970 align:middle line:84%
and you'll see examples
of that in my book-- then

00:52:03.970 --> 00:52:08.020 align:middle line:84%
they run the risk of being
too clever for their own good.

00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:12.050 align:middle line:84%
And they need many
moral qualities

00:52:12.050 --> 00:52:16.410 align:middle line:84%
to rope in the ability, because
it comes so easy to them

00:52:16.410 --> 00:52:17.285 align:middle line:90%
to see possibilities.

00:52:17.285 --> 00:52:19.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's like they're
their own to trickster.

00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:20.953 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Their own trickster.

00:52:20.953 --> 00:52:24.340 align:middle line:84%
Because remember, Mercury
is the trickster as well.

00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:27.540 align:middle line:90%
So it's a complex archetype.

00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:31.280 align:middle line:84%
So we're always looking to see
the relative length, now that

00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:32.170 align:middle line:90%
is one factor.

00:52:32.170 --> 00:52:34.590 align:middle line:84%
The other is, are
they medium length--

00:52:34.590 --> 00:52:38.330 align:middle line:84%
which is mine-- sort of
with a decent relationship

00:52:38.330 --> 00:52:41.660 align:middle line:90%
to the size of the palm itself.

00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:48.500 align:middle line:84%
Or do they seem to be short, or
do they seem to be very long?

00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:50.800 align:middle line:84%
The medium length
on almost anything

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:56.890 align:middle line:84%
just gives good support to the
major archetypal influence.

00:52:56.890 --> 00:53:01.320 align:middle line:84%
But when you have extremes, like
extreme flexibility or extreme

00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:06.480 align:middle line:84%
stiffness or say very
short fingers-- the shorter

00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:09.290 align:middle line:84%
the fingers, the
quicker the mind.

00:53:09.290 --> 00:53:13.380 align:middle line:84%
Short fingers, they don't
want-- you can't hold them back,

00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:15.510 align:middle line:84%
and they get the big
picture right away.

00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:17.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I saw someone
like that yesterday, who

00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:19.610 align:middle line:90%
does have a very quick mind.

00:53:19.610 --> 00:53:22.310 align:middle line:84%
Very flexible, she's--
boom-- she's on it.

00:53:22.310 --> 00:53:23.750 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Yes.

00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And we add that together with,
are those fingers flexible?

00:53:29.570 --> 00:53:31.720 align:middle line:84%
What kind of
fingertips are they?

00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:34.120 align:middle line:84%
Are they tapered to
act like antennas,

00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:38.490 align:middle line:84%
or are they broad to say,
nope, my way only-- refusing

00:53:38.490 --> 00:53:41.310 align:middle line:84%
outside influences
from the cosmos.

00:53:41.310 --> 00:53:42.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or conical.

00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:43.695 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Or
conical, which are

00:53:43.695 --> 00:53:46.740 align:middle line:84%
artistic and creative
and receptive.

00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:49.760 align:middle line:84%
But the little
pointy ones, rare.

00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:52.610 align:middle line:84%
They're like antennas
to the cosmos.

00:53:52.610 --> 00:53:55.880 align:middle line:84%
If you wanted to see
a really psychic hand,

00:53:55.880 --> 00:54:01.070 align:middle line:84%
because long fingers are
careful, slow, thoughtful,

00:54:01.070 --> 00:54:02.150 align:middle line:90%
sensitive.

00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:07.550 align:middle line:84%
You might see a sort of longish
fingers, pointy tips, big mount

00:54:07.550 --> 00:54:10.110 align:middle line:90%
of the Moon, soft, gentle--

00:54:10.110 --> 00:54:12.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So those
are the psychics?

00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:15.980 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: That is a very
archetypal form of psychic.

00:54:15.980 --> 00:54:17.720 align:middle line:84%
And you'll probably
recognize them,

00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:20.910 align:middle line:84%
as they are often kind
of fleshy and soft.

00:54:20.910 --> 00:54:24.050 align:middle line:84%
This chin recedes
just a little bit.

00:54:24.050 --> 00:54:27.580 align:middle line:90%
The eyes bulge a little.

00:54:27.580 --> 00:54:32.240 align:middle line:84%
Every archetype
has its highest--

00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:35.580 align:middle line:84%
not only do they have higher and
lower examples of themselves,

00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:40.460 align:middle line:84%
and then good medium examples--
but even the highest examples,

00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:42.480 align:middle line:90%
everyone has liabilities.

00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:45.480 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has some
excess that they

00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:48.510 align:middle line:90%
could too easily fall into.

00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:51.670 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you recognize
people, as I mentioned before,

00:54:51.670 --> 00:54:54.470 align:middle line:90%
just by the look of them.

00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And only recently I was looking
at an old Judy Garland movie.

00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:01.340 align:middle line:90%
I think it was, A Star is Born.

00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And I recognized that she had
a beautiful, but Lunarian face.

00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:10.140 align:middle line:84%
I saw the eyes, the
little upturned nose,

00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:12.840 align:middle line:84%
but the bulginess, the
browness in the eyes,

00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:15.990 align:middle line:84%
the way the nose turned
up, the small chin.

00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:18.940 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, she's Luna.

00:55:18.940 --> 00:55:22.140 align:middle line:84%
And I wait and watch the movies
till they raise their hand,

00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:24.860 align:middle line:84%
and then try to pause
it with the clicker,

00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:27.140 align:middle line:84%
because I've gotten
to read-- I've read

00:55:27.140 --> 00:55:29.200 align:middle line:90%
Greta Garbo's hand that way.

00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:30.160 align:middle line:90%
Jack Nicholson's.

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:35.290 align:middle line:84%
Anybody who's in the movie and
I can stop it, it's fascinating.

00:55:35.290 --> 00:55:38.540 align:middle line:84%
But I saw, then I
understood the propensity

00:55:38.540 --> 00:55:42.020 align:middle line:84%
towards alcohol and
drugs, because Luna

00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:44.960 align:middle line:90%
likes altered states.

00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:49.170 align:middle line:84%
Everyone, like Jupiter--
mine-- over eating,

00:55:49.170 --> 00:55:51.100 align:middle line:90%
we love food too much.

00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:56.680 align:middle line:84%
Saturn overwork, and
maybe need for security--

00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:58.680 align:middle line:84%
hiding the money
under the mattress.

00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:01.990 align:middle line:90%
You know, just, I need.

00:56:01.990 --> 00:56:03.940 align:middle line:90%
Apollo, overspending.

00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:08.070 align:middle line:84%
Oh, don't give an
Appolonian a credit card.

00:56:08.070 --> 00:56:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And Mercury, it would
be too much love

00:56:10.540 --> 00:56:12.300 align:middle line:90%
of money and overwork.

00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:16.800 align:middle line:90%
These are very much workaholics.

00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:22.290 align:middle line:84%
Mars could be-- we
have an old joke.

00:56:22.290 --> 00:56:25.470 align:middle line:90%
We say Mars loved the three M's.

00:56:25.470 --> 00:56:28.690 align:middle line:84%
Probably the three M's
were more prevalent to be

00:56:28.690 --> 00:56:33.050 align:middle line:84%
used as terms-- meat, hearty
food, malt, they love to drink,

00:56:33.050 --> 00:56:34.560 align:middle line:90%
and mattress.

00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:36.690 align:middle line:90%
And so they will over do.

00:56:36.690 --> 00:56:40.490 align:middle line:84%
They like these things
very, very much.

00:56:40.490 --> 00:56:43.990 align:middle line:84%
Venus-- it's passivity,
and they could just

00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:47.510 align:middle line:84%
let people walk all over them,
over give, give themselves

00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:48.540 align:middle line:90%
away.

00:56:48.540 --> 00:56:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And the moon, it
could be lying, when

00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:57.900 align:middle line:90%
they go bad, or alcohol also.

00:56:57.900 --> 00:57:02.230 align:middle line:84%
When I went to some open
meetings of Alcoholics

00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:05.910 align:middle line:84%
Anonymous, I saw
so many Lunarians,

00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:08.960 align:middle line:90%
and many with psychic blushes.

00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:11.280 align:middle line:84%
Because Luna connects
us to the cosmos,

00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:15.930 align:middle line:84%
you can see why people who might
have a problem with alcohol

00:57:15.930 --> 00:57:19.940 align:middle line:84%
could also cure it with
spirit, because of relationship

00:57:19.940 --> 00:57:22.340 align:middle line:84%
to a higher power,
because it's all

00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:24.625 align:middle line:90%
embedded in the same archetype.

00:57:24.625 --> 00:57:26.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
this is so fun.

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm hoping that everybody
that's watching this

00:57:28.460 --> 00:57:31.680 align:middle line:84%
has their hands out, or they're
looking at each others hands.

00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:32.930 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Oh, I hope so too.

00:57:32.930 --> 00:57:35.609 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And also, I mean,
the book is just divine,

00:57:35.609 --> 00:57:36.650 align:middle line:90%
the way you've done this.

00:57:36.650 --> 00:57:38.760 align:middle line:84%
But we have just a
couple minutes left.

00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:41.110 align:middle line:84%
Let's just talk about a
couple other little things,

00:57:41.110 --> 00:57:43.556 align:middle line:84%
which is like the
springiness of the skin.

00:57:43.556 --> 00:57:44.680 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Oh, absolutely.

00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:47.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you press a
mound, if it just stays there--

00:57:47.210 --> 00:57:48.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Oh, Regina,
you have read the book.

00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:49.749 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I did read the book.

00:57:49.749 --> 00:57:51.920 align:middle line:90%
Do you want it to spring back?

00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:54.100 align:middle line:84%
You don't want it
depressed for too long.

00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:57.650 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Now when
you meet someone--

00:57:57.650 --> 00:58:01.140 align:middle line:84%
or you can test your own--
you press it, and you'll see.

00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And you can see whether
it has a bounce to it.

00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:06.150 align:middle line:90%
Let me feel yours.

00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:07.880 align:middle line:90%
Yes, look at that bounce.

00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:09.180 align:middle line:90%
You can see it bounce back.

00:58:09.180 --> 00:58:10.150 align:middle line:90%
Here, look.

00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:11.660 align:middle line:90%
It's softer.

00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:14.360 align:middle line:84%
The hand is not the
same in every place.

00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:16.980 align:middle line:84%
There is a general--
we call this

00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:19.330 align:middle line:84%
the resilience of the
hand, and that shows you

00:58:19.330 --> 00:58:21.000 align:middle line:90%
how much energy's available.

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:22.495 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:58:22.495 --> 00:58:23.870 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: When
it has a bounce,

00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:28.200 align:middle line:84%
we call it intelligent energy
or intelligent elasticity,

00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:31.840 align:middle line:84%
because without good
energy, you don't develop

00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:33.580 align:middle line:90%
all those archetypal talents.

00:58:33.580 --> 00:58:40.040 align:middle line:84%
Because every archetype not only
has liabilities and talents,

00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:42.450 align:middle line:84%
there are so many
interests, talents,

00:58:42.450 --> 00:58:44.910 align:middle line:84%
possibilities that
each one contains,

00:58:44.910 --> 00:58:46.780 align:middle line:84%
but are they going
to be developed.

00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:49.210 align:middle line:84%
The springiness of the
hand will tell you.

00:58:49.210 --> 00:58:53.010 align:middle line:84%
If it is soft, means the
person is more emotional.

00:58:53.010 --> 00:58:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And so their energy
will come and go,

00:58:55.450 --> 00:58:59.310 align:middle line:84%
depending on the emotions,
but they can still accomplish.

00:58:59.310 --> 00:59:04.430 align:middle line:84%
When it's hard as a rock, like
say Muhammad Ali's, normally

00:59:04.430 --> 00:59:06.820 align:middle line:84%
that would lower the
intelligence some,

00:59:06.820 --> 00:59:12.200 align:middle line:84%
but it would give such
enormous physical vitality

00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:17.830 align:middle line:84%
that they would accomplish and
do, but normally in one area.

00:59:17.830 --> 00:59:21.430 align:middle line:84%
Ali was different because
of that silky skin,

00:59:21.430 --> 00:59:24.050 align:middle line:90%
so it raised him up to be--

00:59:24.050 --> 00:59:25.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So fascinating.

00:59:25.220 --> 00:59:27.050 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: It gave
him more brainpower,

00:59:27.050 --> 00:59:29.460 align:middle line:90%
more refined thinking ability.

00:59:29.460 --> 00:59:34.150 align:middle line:84%
But some hands collapse under
you, almost like a jelly fish,

00:59:34.150 --> 00:59:37.350 align:middle line:90%
and those people have no energy.

00:59:37.350 --> 00:59:40.190 align:middle line:84%
It depends for them where
they're placed in life,

00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:41.940 align:middle line:84%
because they're never
going to do anything

00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:44.050 align:middle line:90%
to change it on their own.

00:59:44.050 --> 00:59:45.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:47.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are so
many more factors--

00:59:47.630 --> 00:59:50.020 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:59:50.020 --> 00:59:51.830 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Oh, the lines.

00:59:51.830 --> 00:59:53.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we don't
even have time for lines.

00:59:53.970 --> 00:59:54.770 align:middle line:90%
Oh my gosh.

00:59:54.770 --> 00:59:56.686 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well then
I'll just say the theory

00:59:56.686 --> 00:59:57.810 align:middle line:90%
of lines in one sentence.

00:59:57.810 --> 00:59:58.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:00.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: The deeper
and the more clear

01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:03.650 align:middle line:84%
that a line is, than
whatever it represents

01:00:03.650 --> 01:00:04.840 align:middle line:90%
is going to function better.

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:05.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:07.765 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And if there
is one line that is deeper

01:00:07.765 --> 01:00:10.440 align:middle line:84%
than all the others,
that area of life

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:13.020 align:middle line:84%
is where the person
really functions from.

01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:14.340 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it's the heart.

01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:15.670 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it's the head.

01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:17.760 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it's the life.

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And also I should say, not
everyone has every line,

01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:25.330 align:middle line:84%
but normally we have the big
three-- headline, heartline,

01:00:25.330 --> 01:00:26.290 align:middle line:90%
and lifeline.

01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's important
to know the lifeline does not

01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:31.260 align:middle line:90%
show how long one lives.

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:33.920 align:middle line:84%
It shows how long
energy is a gift.

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And people live much
longer than their lifeline

01:00:36.410 --> 01:00:39.100 align:middle line:84%
if they take care of
themselves, because then they

01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:41.591 align:middle line:84%
have to be partners
with that energy.

01:00:41.591 --> 01:00:42.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's good to know.

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:43.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:46.210 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And sometimes it
appears that it's a short line,

01:00:46.210 --> 01:00:47.690 align:middle line:90%
but it's not really.

01:00:47.690 --> 01:00:49.920 align:middle line:84%
The line may have
ended at one place,

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:52.840 align:middle line:84%
but jumped outwards
to expand the life

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:56.070 align:middle line:84%
or jumped inwards
to pull the life in.

01:00:56.070 --> 01:00:59.390 align:middle line:84%
So don't just think, oh,
I have a short lifeline,

01:00:59.390 --> 01:01:00.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm in trouble.

01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:02.120 align:middle line:84%
Look and see if
there is one right

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:05.317 align:middle line:84%
next to it that has jumped
out or inwards right

01:01:05.317 --> 01:01:06.400 align:middle line:90%
where the others left off.

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:08.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's just
so fascinating.

01:01:08.030 --> 01:01:09.130 align:middle line:90%
I love what you do.

01:01:09.130 --> 01:01:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And as we talked about
in the beginning,

01:01:10.870 --> 01:01:13.890 align:middle line:84%
you also do tarot to
that depth, astrology,

01:01:13.890 --> 01:01:15.620 align:middle line:84%
and you lay these
over hand readings.

01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And you must do
couple's hand reading.

01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:19.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Oh, I
do couples readings

01:01:19.110 --> 01:01:22.410 align:middle line:84%
before marriage, or
sometimes just before divorce

01:01:22.410 --> 01:01:24.070 align:middle line:90%
or during couples therapy.

01:01:24.070 --> 01:01:26.670 align:middle line:84%
I have been a
psychotherapist for 30 years

01:01:26.670 --> 01:01:32.080 align:middle line:84%
as well in Manhattan, but I'm
going to be concentrating more

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:33.120 align:middle line:90%
on readings, now.

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:35.770 align:middle line:84%
I read for people all over the
world by Skype or by phone.

01:01:35.770 --> 01:01:36.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, good.

01:01:36.570 --> 01:01:37.790 align:middle line:90%
So they can contact you.

01:01:37.790 --> 01:01:39.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Oh,
they can contact me.

01:01:39.290 --> 01:01:41.780 align:middle line:84%
I send them directions
on how to take

01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:44.750 align:middle line:84%
really excellent
photographs of the hand,

01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:46.190 align:middle line:90%
so that I can read them.

01:01:46.190 --> 01:01:48.030 align:middle line:84%
I've read for people
all over the world.

01:01:48.030 --> 01:01:49.654 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What is
your website address?

01:01:49.654 --> 01:01:53.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: My website
is schooloforacles.com,

01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:55.200 align:middle line:84%
and there's a
contact Ellen page.

01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:56.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, good.

01:01:56.130 --> 01:01:56.790 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful.

01:01:56.790 --> 01:01:58.790 align:middle line:84%
And you also have-- we
were talking off camera--

01:01:58.790 --> 01:02:02.250 align:middle line:84%
lots of little videos, little
tutorial videos on hand

01:02:02.250 --> 01:02:04.340 align:middle line:90%
reading--

01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:06.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: For people
who are in to palmistry

01:02:06.270 --> 01:02:08.620 align:middle line:84%
and they can't come to
New York to study with me.

01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:10.610 align:middle line:10%
And one day I'll get
tech savvy enough

01:02:10.610 --> 01:02:14.050 align:middle line:10%
to give big classes
on the internet,

01:02:14.050 --> 01:02:20.000 align:middle line:10%
but for now I've put up 50
videos on palmistry for free.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.010 align:middle line:10%
They're on YouTube
and on [INAUDIBLE],

01:02:23.010 --> 01:02:25.110 align:middle line:10%
and they cover
almost-- a little bit,

01:02:25.110 --> 01:02:27.080 align:middle line:10%
they're just five to
eight minutes long--

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:28.730 align:middle line:10%
on every subject in the book.

01:02:28.730 --> 01:02:30.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's a nice gift.

01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:32.710 align:middle line:84%
I really appreciate that
you do that for all of us.

01:02:32.710 --> 01:02:34.420 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile,
we're out of time.

01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:38.420 align:middle line:84%
And I've loved my time with
you, and I'll treasure the book

01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:40.057 align:middle line:90%
and pass it around a lot.

01:02:40.057 --> 01:02:41.140 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Oh, thank you.

01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:43.181 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And perhaps
we'll come back and revisit

01:02:43.181 --> 01:02:45.790 align:middle line:84%
on the subject of
the tarot one day,

01:02:45.790 --> 01:02:49.240 align:middle line:84%
because that's a big
passion and I haven't really

01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:52.660 align:middle line:84%
gone into that one in the
antiquity of that science yet,

01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:53.690 align:middle line:90%
so that could be fun.

01:02:53.690 --> 01:02:55.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: It's not
as old as the others,

01:02:55.490 --> 01:02:57.700 align:middle line:84%
but it shows that magic
is alive and well,

01:02:57.700 --> 01:02:59.700 align:middle line:90%
because it's developing still.

01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:01.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:02.910 align:middle line:84%
Ellen, thank you so
much for your time,

01:03:02.910 --> 01:03:05.110 align:middle line:84%
and your generous spirit
in reading everybody here

01:03:05.110 --> 01:03:06.679 align:middle line:90%
in the studio today, as well.

01:03:06.679 --> 01:03:07.970 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: It was my pleasure.

01:03:07.970 --> 01:03:08.900 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:10.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The name of the
book is The Art and Science

01:03:10.850 --> 01:03:11.680 align:middle line:90%
of Hand Reading.

01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:15.130 align:middle line:10%
You can go as deep as you want
with this magnificent tutorial.

01:03:15.130 --> 01:03:18.830 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank you
for joining us here at Gaia.

01:03:18.830 --> 01:03:25.168 align:middle line:90%
