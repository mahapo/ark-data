00:00:22.757 --> 00:00:24.358 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: One
of the biggest challenges

00:00:24.358 --> 00:00:27.828 align:middle line:84%
to making cohesive and
functional societies is a lack

00:00:27.828 --> 00:00:31.532 align:middle line:84%
of genuine communication
and egoless participation.

00:00:31.532 --> 00:00:34.135 align:middle line:84%
Healing a Broken World
offers strategies

00:00:34.135 --> 00:00:35.536 align:middle line:90%
that are clearer than most.

00:00:35.536 --> 00:00:39.673 align:middle line:84%
Why? Because the consultants are
beings from off planet cultures

00:00:39.673 --> 00:00:41.876 align:middle line:90%
or interdimensional beings.

00:00:41.876 --> 00:00:45.112 align:middle line:84%
As they observe this fragile
period of history we're in,

00:00:45.112 --> 00:00:47.782 align:middle line:84%
they see from perhaps a
more detached perspective

00:00:47.782 --> 00:00:51.519 align:middle line:84%
that the fixes are doable if
we can use some compassion

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:54.522 align:middle line:84%
for one another and leave
our agendas out of it.

00:00:54.522 --> 00:00:57.691 align:middle line:84%
Byron Belitsos is the
co-author and publisher

00:00:57.691 --> 00:01:00.895 align:middle line:84%
of Healing a Broken World
which is based on a vast body

00:01:00.895 --> 00:01:04.498 align:middle line:84%
of work called the Urantia
Book, the advice that's given

00:01:04.498 --> 00:01:07.001 align:middle line:84%
in a sound and enlightening
manner I have to say.

00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:08.969 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of
people say what?

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:11.439 align:middle line:84%
We're having essentially
teams built

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:13.574 align:middle line:84%
with off planet cultures
involved?

00:01:13.574 --> 00:01:15.109 align:middle line:84%
Sounds kind of far out
to a lot of people.

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:16.177 align:middle line:90%
Not to me.

00:01:16.177 --> 00:01:17.578 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to
explain how it all came

00:01:17.578 --> 00:01:19.113 align:middle line:84%
about because it has
a lot of traction,

00:01:19.113 --> 00:01:20.915 align:middle line:84%
and there's some
pretty high up people

00:01:20.915 --> 00:01:23.517 align:middle line:84%
who have been using this
work for a very long time.

00:01:23.517 --> 00:01:26.520 align:middle line:84%
So first of all let's start
out with what is Urantia?

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.889 align:middle line:84%
What was the Urantia Book
and then how it came about.

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:29.722 align:middle line:90%
And you have time.

00:01:29.722 --> 00:01:31.125 align:middle line:90%
Just lay it out there for us.

00:01:31.125 --> 00:01:32.626 align:middle line:84%
>> Byron Belitsos: Alright,
I'm going to lay it out,

00:01:32.626 --> 00:01:34.228 align:middle line:84%
and I'm very delighted
to be on the program.

00:01:34.228 --> 00:01:35.996 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:01:35.996 --> 00:01:37.264 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I'm happy
you're here, too.

00:01:37.264 --> 00:01:39.133 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: Urantia is
actually purportedly the name

00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:42.502 align:middle line:84%
of our planet according
to the celestials.

00:01:42.502 --> 00:01:44.438 align:middle line:90%
So up there when they looked

00:01:44.438 --> 00:01:46.307 align:middle line:84%
down upon earth they
called it Urantia.

00:01:46.307 --> 00:01:47.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: What's it mean?

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.445 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: It is simply the
name designated for the planet.

00:01:51.445 --> 00:01:54.482 align:middle line:84%
You could derive it from
the Greek word uranos

00:01:54.482 --> 00:01:56.383 align:middle line:90%
which means the heavens.

00:01:56.383 --> 00:01:57.585 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay, okay.

00:01:57.585 --> 00:01:59.787 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: But they
never [inaudible] I happen

00:01:59.787 --> 00:02:01.922 align:middle line:90%
to know Greek.

00:02:01.922 --> 00:02:03.257 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay.

00:02:03.257 --> 00:02:04.959 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: So that's why
they call it the Urantia Book.

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:07.294 align:middle line:90%
It's a book for the planet.

00:02:07.294 --> 00:02:09.964 align:middle line:84%
And it has a planetary
perspective

00:02:09.964 --> 00:02:11.532 align:middle line:90%
that was premature you might say

00:02:11.532 --> 00:02:14.201 align:middle line:84%
because we didn't really
have planetary evolution

00:02:14.201 --> 00:02:18.706 align:middle line:84%
or perspectives in the 20s and
30s when this came through.

00:02:18.706 --> 00:02:20.207 align:middle line:90%
But that's when it came through.

00:02:20.207 --> 00:02:24.178 align:middle line:84%
So it's one of the
earliest statements

00:02:24.178 --> 00:02:28.149 align:middle line:84%
of a holistic planetary and
off planetary perspective

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:30.584 align:middle line:90%
on humanity in our history.

00:02:30.584 --> 00:02:31.418 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:02:31.418 --> 00:02:32.987 align:middle line:90%
And this was a channeled work

00:02:32.987 --> 00:02:36.457 align:middle line:84%
in a time long before
certainly the word channeling

00:02:36.457 --> 00:02:39.793 align:middle line:84%
or the concept of channeling
was known to society at large.

00:02:39.793 --> 00:02:45.332 align:middle line:84%
Although there have always been
people who were able to dial in

00:02:45.332 --> 00:02:47.902 align:middle line:84%
and receive information
from the other realms.

00:02:47.902 --> 00:02:51.872 align:middle line:84%
This is amazing because
of the sheer volume

00:02:51.872 --> 00:02:53.207 align:middle line:90%
of work that came through.

00:02:53.207 --> 00:02:54.441 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:02:54.441 --> 00:02:56.443 align:middle line:90%
Who did it come through?

00:02:56.443 --> 00:02:57.478 align:middle line:90%
How did it come through?

00:02:57.478 --> 00:03:00.047 align:middle line:84%
Over what period of
time and so forth?

00:03:00.047 --> 00:03:01.882 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: A lot
of it is a mystery

00:03:01.882 --> 00:03:03.217 align:middle line:90%
as to how it came through.

00:03:03.217 --> 00:03:06.020 align:middle line:84%
It technically shouldn't really
be called a channeled work

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:11.258 align:middle line:84%
because the lore about this is
that it did not get channeled

00:03:11.258 --> 00:03:14.595 align:middle line:84%
through a person
but it appeared.

00:03:14.595 --> 00:03:15.596 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay.

00:03:15.596 --> 00:03:17.264 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: Now,
that's not proven.

00:03:17.264 --> 00:03:20.034 align:middle line:84%
There's historians
working on this,

00:03:20.034 --> 00:03:21.735 align:middle line:84%
but there's not much
documentation.

00:03:21.735 --> 00:03:23.938 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: It appeared
how and where?

00:03:23.938 --> 00:03:25.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: To a
group in Chicago.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.374 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: But how
did it appear?

00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:28.642 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: Literally
the papers

00:03:28.642 --> 00:03:31.879 align:middle line:84%
or chapters would
appear, materialize.

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:34.748 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Without
human participation?

00:03:34.748 --> 00:03:36.116 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: Without
human intervention known.

00:03:36.116 --> 00:03:38.419 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: But wasn't there one
particular person that a lot

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:40.955 align:middle line:84%
of it they were in
communion with regularly?

00:03:40.955 --> 00:03:42.156 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: There
was one particular one

00:03:42.156 --> 00:03:43.757 align:middle line:84%
but actually a group of
six, and they're known

00:03:43.757 --> 00:03:45.125 align:middle line:90%
as the contact commission.

00:03:45.125 --> 00:03:48.161 align:middle line:84%
And that work was around
-- the core person,

00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:49.296 align:middle line:90%
the kind of chairman

00:03:49.296 --> 00:03:51.197 align:middle line:84%
of the group was a guy
named Sadler [phonetic],

00:03:51.197 --> 00:03:53.634 align:middle line:84%
a professor at University
of Chicago and a physician

00:03:53.634 --> 00:03:56.170 align:middle line:84%
who was a visionary but
also a real scientist.

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.472 align:middle line:84%
He actually studied
with Freud at one point.

00:03:58.472 --> 00:04:02.109 align:middle line:84%
So he was well known and
a very prolific author.

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:04.678 align:middle line:84%
So that's why some people think,
well, he wrote this thing.

00:04:04.678 --> 00:04:07.348 align:middle line:84%
But he was actually a skeptic
who was brought in to try

00:04:07.348 --> 00:04:08.882 align:middle line:90%
to debunk what was happening.

00:04:08.882 --> 00:04:11.819 align:middle line:84%
They were having contacts
through a contact person

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.788 align:middle line:84%
who you could imagine being
like Edgar Cayce who was asleep

00:04:14.788 --> 00:04:16.590 align:middle line:84%
and these voices
would come through.

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.592 align:middle line:84%
But that's not how the
Urantia Book came through.

00:04:18.592 --> 00:04:22.830 align:middle line:84%
That was how the celestials
oriented them to here we are,

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.099 align:middle line:84%
we want to get to know you,
we want you to get to know us,

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:28.035 align:middle line:84%
and then we're going to give you
a revelation a little bit later.

00:04:28.035 --> 00:04:33.007 align:middle line:84%
So on a particular day they
started, it was February 11,

00:04:33.007 --> 00:04:39.880 align:middle line:84%
1924, and from 24 until 1942
this material came through.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.316 align:middle line:84%
It would come through
one paper at a time.

00:04:42.316 --> 00:04:45.486 align:middle line:84%
There was 196 of them
so it's pretty big.

00:04:45.486 --> 00:04:47.855 align:middle line:84%
They would read it, they
being this core group,

00:04:47.855 --> 00:04:49.790 align:middle line:84%
and then expand it to
a much bigger group.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.292 align:middle line:84%
And then they would
feed questions back

00:04:51.292 --> 00:04:53.394 align:middle line:90%
through the contact personality.

00:04:53.394 --> 00:04:55.429 align:middle line:90%
We don't know who that is.

00:04:55.429 --> 00:04:57.631 align:middle line:84%
And they'd feed them
back to the celestials

00:04:57.631 --> 00:05:00.934 align:middle line:84%
and they would rewrite the
chapter based on the questions.

00:05:00.934 --> 00:05:02.636 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And then the
papers just would --

00:05:02.636 --> 00:05:04.938 align:middle line:84%
the lore is that the
papers would disappear?

00:05:04.938 --> 00:05:05.873 align:middle line:90%
>> Belitsos: Disappear.

00:05:05.873 --> 00:05:08.909 align:middle line:84%
Because it's kind
of inconceivable

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:13.547 align:middle line:84%
that anybody could write this or
even channel it through the mind

00:05:13.547 --> 00:05:17.818 align:middle line:84%
because it's so superb in
its language and coherence.

00:05:17.818 --> 00:05:19.019 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: But I
mean the essence

00:05:19.019 --> 00:05:22.089 align:middle line:84%
of a pure channel is there
is none of them in it.

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:24.058 align:middle line:84%
Their mind isn't
participating in it.

00:05:24.058 --> 00:05:25.926 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: I haven't
seen one yet.

00:05:25.926 --> 00:05:26.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: You haven't?

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.494 align:middle line:90%
>> Belitsos: No.

00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:29.096 align:middle line:84%
I've been to many,
many channels.

00:05:29.096 --> 00:05:30.197 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:05:30.197 --> 00:05:30.898 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: And there's
a little bit of them

00:05:30.898 --> 00:05:32.366 align:middle line:90%
and also their cultures,

00:05:32.366 --> 00:05:35.669 align:middle line:84%
skews of their linguistic
capabilities also.

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.738 align:middle line:84%
The Urantia Book is
just it's so vast

00:05:37.738 --> 00:05:39.740 align:middle line:84%
that it can't come
from a single mind.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:40.808 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: No, not from a mind.

00:05:40.808 --> 00:05:42.943 align:middle line:90%
I understand what you're saying.

00:05:42.943 --> 00:05:44.311 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:05:44.311 --> 00:05:47.348 align:middle line:84%
So what happened to this doctor
after he came to debunk it?

00:05:47.348 --> 00:05:51.585 align:middle line:84%
How long did it take before
he became a full blown member

00:05:51.585 --> 00:05:52.753 align:middle line:90%
of the six?

00:05:52.753 --> 00:05:53.987 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: A number
of years actually.

00:05:53.987 --> 00:05:55.689 align:middle line:84%
I mean he was participating,
and he was kind

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:58.092 align:middle line:84%
of the guy holding
the space for this.

00:05:58.092 --> 00:06:01.628 align:middle line:84%
But there was a certain point
where he just said I've got

00:06:01.628 --> 00:06:02.329 align:middle line:90%
to throw in the towel.

00:06:02.329 --> 00:06:03.530 align:middle line:90%
This is so brilliant,

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:04.732 align:middle line:84%
I just can't believe
anybody could make this up,

00:06:04.732 --> 00:06:06.800 align:middle line:90%
and it was in his field.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.903 align:middle line:84%
And his field was
mainly psychiatry.

00:06:09.903 --> 00:06:14.641 align:middle line:84%
And they depicted the
psychology of the 12 apostles.

00:06:14.641 --> 00:06:17.277 align:middle line:84%
He said it was such a brilliant
depiction of the 12 apostles

00:06:17.277 --> 00:06:19.246 align:middle line:84%
that just no human
could come up with that.

00:06:19.246 --> 00:06:21.181 align:middle line:84%
So that's when he
said I'm all in.

00:06:21.181 --> 00:06:22.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Okay, do you mind
just sharing a teensy bit

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:23.984 align:middle line:90%
about that.

00:06:23.984 --> 00:06:25.319 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: About
that particular --

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:26.386 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yeah, just about
that, that it impressed him

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:28.622 align:middle line:90%
so much about the apostles.

00:06:28.622 --> 00:06:31.625 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: They depict them
as very flawed individuals.

00:06:31.625 --> 00:06:33.894 align:middle line:84%
And they show all
these different sides.

00:06:33.894 --> 00:06:40.267 align:middle line:84%
I mean Peter had a really big
kind of flawed side of kind

00:06:40.267 --> 00:06:45.272 align:middle line:84%
of egocentrism and fear
that was very deep.

00:06:45.272 --> 00:06:48.108 align:middle line:84%
And he really didn't want to
get out there and do what he did

00:06:48.108 --> 00:06:50.144 align:middle line:84%
which he was the
key spokesperson.

00:06:50.144 --> 00:06:54.982 align:middle line:84%
And this other part of him was
a very talented public speaker.

00:06:54.982 --> 00:06:58.185 align:middle line:84%
So he had a very
conflicted inner life

00:06:58.185 --> 00:07:01.889 align:middle line:84%
until much later it says that he
finally synthesized these parts

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:04.191 align:middle line:84%
of himself and became
the great Apostle Peter.

00:07:04.191 --> 00:07:05.425 align:middle line:90%
So that's one example.

00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:06.560 align:middle line:90%
John is another one.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.661 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yeah, what
did they say about John?

00:07:07.661 --> 00:07:09.463 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are
fascinated with John.

00:07:09.463 --> 00:07:11.632 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: Oh, I just
love the depiction of John.

00:07:11.632 --> 00:07:13.600 align:middle line:90%
John was mild mannered.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.004 align:middle line:84%
He was pretty shy and
young, and he was kind

00:07:17.004 --> 00:07:20.274 align:middle line:90%
of pulled along by the others.

00:07:20.274 --> 00:07:24.511 align:middle line:84%
But he had a tremendous
kind of philosophic capacity

00:07:24.511 --> 00:07:25.913 align:middle line:90%
that developed and unfolded.

00:07:25.913 --> 00:07:28.582 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the Gospel
of John is different

00:07:28.582 --> 00:07:30.017 align:middle line:90%
because of who John was.

00:07:30.017 --> 00:07:30.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.152 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: But
it was very hidden

00:07:32.152 --> 00:07:34.454 align:middle line:84%
when he was a young
man with Jesus.

00:07:34.454 --> 00:07:36.490 align:middle line:84%
So they talk about
how this was buried

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:38.125 align:middle line:90%
and how it came forward later.

00:07:38.125 --> 00:07:39.893 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Okay, that's
just a little tease.

00:07:39.893 --> 00:07:41.829 align:middle line:84%
I know that this
is -- how fat is

00:07:41.829 --> 00:07:43.463 align:middle line:90%
that book, the Book of Urantia?

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:45.199 align:middle line:90%
>> Belitsos: 2,097 pages.

00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:46.633 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: 2,097 pages.

00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:49.269 align:middle line:84%
So if we want to get into it
then we can study the rest

00:07:49.269 --> 00:07:50.637 align:middle line:90%
on our own.

00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:52.773 align:middle line:84%
I'm not suggesting that you lay
out too much of it right now

00:07:52.773 --> 00:07:55.209 align:middle line:84%
because we want to lead
toward the subject at hand

00:07:55.209 --> 00:07:58.078 align:middle line:84%
because they had some pretty
profound advice about it.

00:07:58.078 --> 00:08:02.616 align:middle line:84%
So I would like to -- as we
start moving toward the how

00:08:02.616 --> 00:08:05.319 align:middle line:84%
to heal a broken
world let's just say

00:08:05.319 --> 00:08:09.489 align:middle line:84%
that the world became broken not
necessarily of its own accord.

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:12.759 align:middle line:84%
Because they do acknowledge that
there have been other species

00:08:12.759 --> 00:08:16.463 align:middle line:84%
that have been here and have
interfered as well as assisted.

00:08:16.463 --> 00:08:19.466 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you can talk a
little bit about that part.

00:08:19.466 --> 00:08:22.336 align:middle line:84%
Often it's called
the fall of humanity.

00:08:22.336 --> 00:08:23.837 align:middle line:90%
What actually happened?

00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:27.608 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: The Urantia Book
affirms that there was a fall.

00:08:27.608 --> 00:08:30.744 align:middle line:84%
But the fall is presented
in mythic terms

00:08:30.744 --> 00:08:33.146 align:middle line:90%
in the Bible and Genesis.

00:08:33.146 --> 00:08:37.918 align:middle line:84%
But much of Genesis does
point to the true history.

00:08:37.918 --> 00:08:42.189 align:middle line:84%
And what we, Urantia
believers think and believe is

00:08:42.189 --> 00:08:45.225 align:middle line:84%
that this is the true
history of what happened.

00:08:45.225 --> 00:08:46.994 align:middle line:90%
And there are two big phases.

00:08:46.994 --> 00:08:49.463 align:middle line:84%
There was a really,
really distant phase

00:08:49.463 --> 00:08:55.002 align:middle line:84%
when an off planet group,
kind of hybrid, angelic human,

00:08:55.002 --> 00:09:01.041 align:middle line:84%
come to present civilization
and the basic aspects of living

00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:03.010 align:middle line:90%
in civilization to humanity.

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:06.246 align:middle line:90%
It was 500,000 years ago.

00:09:06.246 --> 00:09:09.449 align:middle line:84%
That particular group
went astray.

00:09:09.449 --> 00:09:10.984 align:middle line:90%
It went to the dark side.

00:09:10.984 --> 00:09:13.153 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: You're talking
500,000 years ago it starts

00:09:13.153 --> 00:09:16.924 align:middle line:84%
lining up with what are
often called the Anunnaki,

00:09:16.924 --> 00:09:18.191 align:middle line:90%
[inaudible] and so forth.

00:09:18.191 --> 00:09:20.661 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: That's why
Urantians tend to be friendly

00:09:20.661 --> 00:09:22.396 align:middle line:90%
to the theory of the Anunnaki.

00:09:22.396 --> 00:09:23.597 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:09:23.597 --> 00:09:27.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: The Anunnaki
is mainly seen at ETs.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.305 align:middle line:84%
The Urantia version is much more
sophisticated, and it's located

00:09:31.305 --> 00:09:33.907 align:middle line:84%
in a cosmology that's also
far more sophisticated

00:09:33.907 --> 00:09:36.677 align:middle line:90%
and more scientific I believe.

00:09:36.677 --> 00:09:40.781 align:middle line:84%
But we can use the term Anunnaki
because that refers to a kind

00:09:40.781 --> 00:09:46.954 align:middle line:84%
of rogue group that then kind
of intersplice their genes

00:09:46.954 --> 00:09:48.255 align:middle line:90%
so to speak with humans.

00:09:48.255 --> 00:09:50.724 align:middle line:84%
And the Urantia Book
says that did happen.

00:09:50.724 --> 00:09:53.460 align:middle line:84%
This group that incarnated,
these are avatars actually,

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:57.698 align:middle line:84%
there were 100 of them,
began to interbreed

00:09:57.698 --> 00:10:00.367 align:middle line:90%
with the natives way back then,

00:10:00.367 --> 00:10:02.736 align:middle line:84%
and that's where
this legend begins.

00:10:02.736 --> 00:10:05.539 align:middle line:84%
But there's yet another
group that comes later

00:10:05.539 --> 00:10:09.309 align:middle line:84%
in another interbreeding
program that also went astray.

00:10:09.309 --> 00:10:11.645 align:middle line:84%
And that's the one
that's not easy to talk

00:10:11.645 --> 00:10:15.549 align:middle line:84%
about because it's Adam and
Eve which is considered mythic.

00:10:15.549 --> 00:10:16.817 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: No, please
go into detail.

00:10:16.817 --> 00:10:19.987 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: That's an
amazing section on Adam

00:10:19.987 --> 00:10:21.955 align:middle line:90%
and Eve that's very eye opening.

00:10:21.955 --> 00:10:25.459 align:middle line:84%
Because you take Adam and Eve it
sounds like it's a fairy story.

00:10:25.459 --> 00:10:29.763 align:middle line:84%
But this explains that every
planet has to have an Adam

00:10:29.763 --> 00:10:32.132 align:middle line:84%
and an Eve who are
beings who come

00:10:32.132 --> 00:10:35.669 align:middle line:84%
to bring a genetic
upliftment to the planet.

00:10:35.669 --> 00:10:37.604 align:middle line:84%
They're actually
going to interbreed.

00:10:37.604 --> 00:10:38.538 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:10:38.538 --> 00:10:39.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: And
so again that fits

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:41.975 align:middle line:90%
in with the Anunnaki legend.

00:10:41.975 --> 00:10:43.910 align:middle line:90%
But the thing to understand

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:45.379 align:middle line:84%
about the Urantia
Book is it says

00:10:45.379 --> 00:10:48.615 align:middle line:84%
that the celestial
hierarchy of our planet

00:10:48.615 --> 00:10:52.986 align:middle line:84%
who sponsored these
interventions and incarnations,

00:10:52.986 --> 00:10:55.756 align:middle line:84%
they were unseen, they
actually went to the dark side

00:10:55.756 --> 00:10:58.058 align:middle line:84%
which is a very, very
rare event on a planet

00:10:58.058 --> 00:10:59.993 align:middle line:84%
when the angels go
to the dark side.

00:10:59.993 --> 00:11:01.395 align:middle line:90%
But this is sort of overseen

00:11:01.395 --> 00:11:04.097 align:middle line:84%
by angelic beings
that are a hierarchy.

00:11:04.097 --> 00:11:08.235 align:middle line:84%
And fairly up in the
hierarchy someone named Lucifer

00:11:08.235 --> 00:11:10.370 align:middle line:90%
went astray.

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:14.207 align:middle line:84%
And his lieutenant Satan, a
real person, with him went

00:11:14.207 --> 00:11:17.778 align:middle line:84%
around to various planets
to try to corrupt them.

00:11:17.778 --> 00:11:21.381 align:middle line:84%
Actually their gospel was
God doesn't really exist.

00:11:21.381 --> 00:11:23.016 align:middle line:90%
That was at the core of this.

00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:25.452 align:middle line:84%
And we're free to
do what we want.

00:11:25.452 --> 00:11:29.222 align:middle line:84%
And so down from that
teaching comes the sort

00:11:29.222 --> 00:11:33.260 align:middle line:84%
of satanic tradition, the dark
traditions of this planet.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:37.230 align:middle line:84%
And that was then taught by
these groups on the ground

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:41.033 align:middle line:84%
who were interbreeding who were
supervised by these dark beings.

00:11:41.033 --> 00:11:44.938 align:middle line:84%
So that's where we get
the Illuminati bloodlines.

00:11:44.938 --> 00:11:46.139 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: What's interesting

00:11:46.139 --> 00:11:49.509 align:middle line:84%
about that is even though
this was all an aspect

00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:52.079 align:middle line:84%
of an angelic realm
as you're saying,

00:11:52.079 --> 00:11:56.383 align:middle line:84%
the freedom of choice
exists all through.

00:11:56.383 --> 00:11:59.719 align:middle line:84%
It's not as though their
efforts were thwarted.

00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:02.122 align:middle line:90%
There was no intervention.

00:12:02.122 --> 00:12:04.224 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: Regina,
I'm so glad you brought

00:12:04.224 --> 00:12:06.293 align:middle line:90%
up that issue of free will.

00:12:06.293 --> 00:12:08.995 align:middle line:84%
Angels have free will,
humans have free will.

00:12:08.995 --> 00:12:12.499 align:middle line:84%
That's the core of the
theology of the Urantia Book.

00:12:12.499 --> 00:12:15.302 align:middle line:84%
It also is Christian
theology and other theologies.

00:12:15.302 --> 00:12:20.974 align:middle line:84%
We are valued so much by the
divine that we're given freedom.

00:12:20.974 --> 00:12:23.877 align:middle line:84%
But there's always correcting
influences coming in.

00:12:23.877 --> 00:12:25.178 align:middle line:90%
So the Urantia Book states

00:12:25.178 --> 00:12:29.116 align:middle line:84%
that after the first
two major interventions

00:12:29.116 --> 00:12:33.753 align:middle line:84%
on the planet went astray, they
sent one after another prophet,

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:36.723 align:middle line:84%
teacher and mission
to correct us.

00:12:36.723 --> 00:12:39.392 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Do they give similar
names that we would be familiar

00:12:39.392 --> 00:12:41.128 align:middle line:84%
with or entities
we'd be familiar

00:12:41.128 --> 00:12:43.330 align:middle line:90%
with as those who were sent?

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:44.664 align:middle line:90%
>> Belitsos: Yeah, certain ones.

00:12:44.664 --> 00:12:47.801 align:middle line:84%
Certainly the Hebrew prophets
were part of this program.

00:12:47.801 --> 00:12:50.003 align:middle line:90%
And in particular Melchizedek.

00:12:50.003 --> 00:12:53.140 align:middle line:84%
Melchizedek is a name you hear
in the new age all the time.

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:55.842 align:middle line:84%
So if you are interested in
Melchizedek look at the chapters

00:12:55.842 --> 00:12:58.545 align:middle line:84%
about Makavec [phonetic]
and Melchizedek is the name

00:12:58.545 --> 00:13:00.680 align:middle line:84%
of this person who
actually incarnated

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:04.784 align:middle line:84%
on an emergency mission to
correct all these problems.

00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:09.122 align:middle line:84%
And he had a big problem because
when he incarnated there was

00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:12.192 align:middle line:90%
pandemonium on the planet.

00:13:12.192 --> 00:13:15.829 align:middle line:84%
This was the time of the rise
of the Egyptian priesthood

00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:19.166 align:middle line:84%
which was oppressive,
of the Brahman caste

00:13:19.166 --> 00:13:21.234 align:middle line:90%
in India which was oppressive.

00:13:21.234 --> 00:13:25.172 align:middle line:84%
And all around the planet there
were these oppressive religions.

00:13:25.172 --> 00:13:29.576 align:middle line:84%
And his mission was to teach
a liberating religion actually

00:13:29.576 --> 00:13:30.810 align:middle line:90%
to the world.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:33.346 align:middle line:84%
And so the Melchizedek
teachings which are unknown

00:13:33.346 --> 00:13:36.416 align:middle line:84%
to the world other than the
fact that Melchizedek appeared

00:13:36.416 --> 00:13:38.518 align:middle line:90%
to Abraham in Genesis.

00:13:38.518 --> 00:13:40.253 align:middle line:84%
It says this guy just
walks into his tent

00:13:40.253 --> 00:13:43.190 align:middle line:84%
and his name is Melchizedek,
and he's a priest

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:45.058 align:middle line:90%
after the order of Melchizedek.

00:13:45.058 --> 00:13:47.360 align:middle line:84%
So that's where this comes
from, it's a Hebrew term.

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:51.198 align:middle line:84%
So historically in the Bible it
refers to this mysterious guy

00:13:51.198 --> 00:13:54.234 align:middle line:84%
that shows up out of nowhere
and says to Abraham you're going

00:13:54.234 --> 00:13:58.838 align:middle line:84%
to start a new race that will
numbered as many as the stars.

00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:02.943 align:middle line:84%
So you can take that passage
and come to the Urantia Book

00:14:02.943 --> 00:14:06.012 align:middle line:84%
and then get a complete
background on who this guy was.

00:14:06.012 --> 00:14:07.847 align:middle line:90%
So this is around 2000 B.C.

00:14:07.847 --> 00:14:09.516 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: What about
prior to that?

00:14:09.516 --> 00:14:11.718 align:middle line:84%
Were interventions
sent prior to that,

00:14:11.718 --> 00:14:15.288 align:middle line:84%
some of the more ancient
historical figures even?

00:14:15.288 --> 00:14:18.625 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: There was
always the good angels.

00:14:18.625 --> 00:14:22.796 align:middle line:84%
So most of the Angelicos
went dark.

00:14:22.796 --> 00:14:24.698 align:middle line:90%
The other part was still active.

00:14:24.698 --> 00:14:25.532 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: I see.

00:14:25.532 --> 00:14:26.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Belitsos: They were split.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.301 align:middle line:84%
And so the good angels
were always trying

00:14:28.301 --> 00:14:29.903 align:middle line:90%
to stop what was happening.

00:14:29.903 --> 00:14:31.905 align:middle line:84%
The other thing very important
is, it's a little complicated,

00:14:31.905 --> 00:14:36.176 align:middle line:84%
but within the original group
I mentioned 500,000 years ago

00:14:36.176 --> 00:14:37.577 align:middle line:90%
that split.

00:14:37.577 --> 00:14:39.913 align:middle line:84%
So one part of that went dark,
the other part did not go dark.

00:14:39.913 --> 00:14:43.283 align:middle line:84%
And that part continued
a tradition of the light.

00:14:43.283 --> 00:14:44.384 align:middle line:90%
They were like light workers.

00:14:44.384 --> 00:14:46.186 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So now was
that a similar split

00:14:46.186 --> 00:14:47.654 align:middle line:84%
to what Sitchin would
have written

00:14:47.654 --> 00:14:49.789 align:middle line:84%
about between Incan
[phonetic] and Leo?

00:14:49.789 --> 00:14:50.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Belitsos: I think so.

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:52.459 align:middle line:90%
The Sitchin, yeah --

00:14:52.459 --> 00:14:54.361 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I know there
were misinterpretations.

00:14:54.361 --> 00:14:56.696 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people say the
work was highly flawed,

00:14:56.696 --> 00:14:58.632 align:middle line:84%
but there is also
some truth to it.

00:14:58.632 --> 00:15:01.468 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just saying in broad
strokes might it have been

00:15:01.468 --> 00:15:03.036 align:middle line:90%
that little [inaudible] split.

00:15:03.036 --> 00:15:04.504 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: Yeah, I would
agree with that in a broad way.

00:15:04.504 --> 00:15:06.873 align:middle line:90%
Also amazingly the time line

00:15:06.873 --> 00:15:08.908 align:middle line:84%
that Sitchin gives
is almost identical

00:15:08.908 --> 00:15:10.143 align:middle line:90%
to the Urantia time line.

00:15:10.143 --> 00:15:11.344 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes, it is.

00:15:11.344 --> 00:15:12.746 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: Urantia time
is 500,000 years ago.

00:15:12.746 --> 00:15:17.550 align:middle line:84%
The rebellion is 200,000 years
ago with the Nibiru Anunnaki.

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:19.686 align:middle line:84%
The Urantia Book says
the same time line

00:15:19.686 --> 00:15:21.254 align:middle line:90%
around 200,000 years ago.

00:15:21.254 --> 00:15:23.723 align:middle line:84%
So actually they have
300,000 good years.

00:15:23.723 --> 00:15:25.358 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And it's
interesting, too,

00:15:25.358 --> 00:15:27.327 align:middle line:84%
because Sitchin's work
didn't come out until

00:15:27.327 --> 00:15:29.496 align:middle line:90%
after all of this, right?

00:15:29.496 --> 00:15:31.431 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: Right, and I
don't think he was aware of --

00:15:31.431 --> 00:15:32.198 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And he
wasn't aware of it.

00:15:32.198 --> 00:15:32.966 align:middle line:90%
>> Belitsos: -- this.

00:15:32.966 --> 00:15:34.033 align:middle line:90%
And I've tried to find --

00:15:34.033 --> 00:15:35.368 align:middle line:84%
people can write a
bridge between the two

00:15:35.368 --> 00:15:37.671 align:middle line:84%
which nobody is doing it
yet, maybe I'll do it,

00:15:37.671 --> 00:15:39.439 align:middle line:90%
but there definitely is.

00:15:39.439 --> 00:15:42.908 align:middle line:84%
Except he says that the
Anunnaki are from planet X

00:15:42.908 --> 00:15:44.244 align:middle line:90%
and that's hard to prove.

00:15:44.244 --> 00:15:47.647 align:middle line:84%
And the Urantia says something
more interesting I think,

00:15:47.647 --> 00:15:48.982 align:middle line:90%
more explanatory.

00:15:48.982 --> 00:15:51.384 align:middle line:84%
But it's kind of the same
morphology so to speak.

00:15:51.384 --> 00:15:53.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Okay, so here we are
the second split you say is a

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.188 align:middle line:84%
couple hundred thousand
years ago.

00:15:55.188 --> 00:15:57.023 align:middle line:90%
What happened then?

00:15:57.023 --> 00:15:58.491 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: After
the rebellion --

00:15:58.491 --> 00:15:59.526 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yeah,
after the rebellion --

00:15:59.526 --> 00:16:00.794 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: [Inaudible]
rebellion,

00:16:00.794 --> 00:16:04.731 align:middle line:84%
so as I said the first
avatar group, I call it that,

00:16:04.731 --> 00:16:07.033 align:middle line:84%
the Urantia Book doesn't,
that first group split;

00:16:07.033 --> 00:16:12.005 align:middle line:84%
60 out of the 100 went to
the dark side procedure

00:16:12.005 --> 00:16:14.641 align:middle line:84%
which was do whatever
you want to do.

00:16:14.641 --> 00:16:20.313 align:middle line:84%
And 40 of them remained
loyal to the divine plan.

00:16:20.313 --> 00:16:24.084 align:middle line:84%
They set up a settlement
actually in an area north

00:16:24.084 --> 00:16:27.287 align:middle line:84%
of the Mesopotamia which is
where all this was happening.

00:16:27.287 --> 00:16:30.523 align:middle line:84%
And their leader was someone
named Van [assumed spelling].

00:16:30.523 --> 00:16:32.726 align:middle line:84%
And Van continues --
these were immortals.

00:16:32.726 --> 00:16:37.964 align:middle line:84%
So he continued all the way
down upholding these traditions

00:16:37.964 --> 00:16:39.332 align:middle line:90%
and sending out emissaries

00:16:39.332 --> 00:16:43.937 align:middle line:84%
for all those year while the
dark group was fighting them,

00:16:43.937 --> 00:16:44.971 align:middle line:90%
literally fighting them.

00:16:44.971 --> 00:16:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And there's now new
channeled material

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:50.777 align:middle line:84%
from Timothy Widley [phonetic]
a very important author

00:16:50.777 --> 00:16:54.814 align:middle line:84%
who is brought through eight
volume history of what happened

00:16:54.814 --> 00:16:57.516 align:middle line:84%
in this period that is
not in the Urantia Book.

00:16:57.516 --> 00:17:00.120 align:middle line:84%
It's controversial, but it's
very good and very coherent.

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.956 align:middle line:84%
And this tells the
story of the battle

00:17:02.956 --> 00:17:06.158 align:middle line:84%
between these two groups
that was planet wide.

00:17:06.158 --> 00:17:09.995 align:middle line:84%
And does uphold this theory
you hear in other places

00:17:09.995 --> 00:17:12.966 align:middle line:84%
that the developed
technology, advanced technology

00:17:12.966 --> 00:17:14.701 align:middle line:90%
and a weaponized technology,

00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:18.638 align:middle line:84%
they had to because the dark
side beings were weaponizing.

00:17:18.638 --> 00:17:21.207 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So would this be
reflecting then the period

00:17:21.207 --> 00:17:23.510 align:middle line:84%
of history we would know
as the Atlantean period?

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:25.745 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: The Atlantean
period and even previous

00:17:25.745 --> 00:17:27.947 align:middle line:90%
to the Atlantean period.

00:17:27.947 --> 00:17:29.482 align:middle line:90%
And these cultures spread out.

00:17:29.482 --> 00:17:34.020 align:middle line:84%
And the Van's culture, the
light worker culture, went east,

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:38.358 align:middle line:84%
went to India, China and
then set up the Lemuria

00:17:38.358 --> 00:17:40.460 align:middle line:84%
in the Pacific, and that's
not in the Urantia Book.

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:42.796 align:middle line:84%
So this is a new
revelation, it's not proved.

00:17:42.796 --> 00:17:46.232 align:middle line:84%
And then the Caligastia group,
it's known as Caligastia,

00:17:46.232 --> 00:17:47.367 align:middle line:90%
Caligastia was the head

00:17:47.367 --> 00:17:51.604 align:middle line:84%
of the planetary angels
who really went dark.

00:17:51.604 --> 00:17:54.841 align:middle line:84%
This group was more
around the Mediterranean.

00:17:54.841 --> 00:17:58.611 align:middle line:84%
And so these were warring
parties for thousands of years

00:17:58.611 --> 00:18:01.481 align:middle line:84%
until they had an
atomic war according

00:18:01.481 --> 00:18:04.117 align:middle line:84%
to Widley not according to
the Urantia Book, unproven.

00:18:04.117 --> 00:18:06.052 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: But in some other
texts they also speak of this.

00:18:06.052 --> 00:18:07.253 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: Other texts
speak of this, too.

00:18:07.253 --> 00:18:11.257 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Even in the
Puranas I believe there is

00:18:11.257 --> 00:18:12.358 align:middle line:90%
atomic activity.

00:18:12.358 --> 00:18:13.593 align:middle line:90%
>> Belitsos: Absolutely is.

00:18:13.593 --> 00:18:16.096 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So I have a
question here at this point.

00:18:16.096 --> 00:18:19.966 align:middle line:84%
What was it about -- was planet
Earth unique in some way?

00:18:19.966 --> 00:18:22.802 align:middle line:84%
What was it that
drove this huge split?

00:18:22.802 --> 00:18:25.839 align:middle line:84%
There had to be a
temptation of some kind.

00:18:25.839 --> 00:18:29.476 align:middle line:84%
What would have driven
these otherwise good natured

00:18:29.476 --> 00:18:34.347 align:middle line:84%
and intentioned beings into
this dark exploitive mode?

00:18:34.347 --> 00:18:35.782 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: That's
why we need to stick

00:18:35.782 --> 00:18:38.218 align:middle line:84%
that in the Urantia Book
to explain the background

00:18:38.218 --> 00:18:41.154 align:middle line:84%
and orientation because it talks
about life on other planets

00:18:41.154 --> 00:18:43.056 align:middle line:84%
and how a normal planet
is supposed to be.

00:18:43.056 --> 00:18:44.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:45.425 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: So this is
way, way, way abnormal.

00:18:45.425 --> 00:18:47.227 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: This isn't
a normalist planet.

00:18:47.227 --> 00:18:48.228 align:middle line:90%
I understand that.

00:18:48.228 --> 00:18:48.928 align:middle line:90%
>> Belitsos: One in a million.

00:18:48.928 --> 00:18:49.996 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:18:49.996 --> 00:18:51.064 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: Literally
one in a million.

00:18:51.064 --> 00:18:52.565 align:middle line:84%
And it says in the
local group of planets

00:18:52.565 --> 00:18:56.769 align:middle line:84%
which is several million,
there's been several of these,

00:18:56.769 --> 00:18:58.938 align:middle line:84%
I think three of these
kind of rebellions.

00:18:58.938 --> 00:19:02.141 align:middle line:84%
So really like one to a million
chance of this happening.

00:19:02.141 --> 00:19:03.309 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: So why us?

00:19:03.309 --> 00:19:04.611 align:middle line:90%
Why the human species?

00:19:04.611 --> 00:19:06.079 align:middle line:90%
>> Belitsos: Why us?

00:19:06.079 --> 00:19:09.315 align:middle line:84%
Chance. Because the rebellion
was in our local system

00:19:09.315 --> 00:19:12.185 align:middle line:84%
of inhabited planets which
is about a thousand planets.

00:19:12.185 --> 00:19:17.023 align:middle line:84%
So the angelic hierarchy in that
group was headed up by Lucifer.

00:19:17.023 --> 00:19:19.692 align:middle line:90%
Bad luck. He was our chief guy.

00:19:19.692 --> 00:19:22.662 align:middle line:84%
And his lieutenant was
Satan so we were doomed.

00:19:22.662 --> 00:19:25.598 align:middle line:84%
But they could not
convince all 1,000 planets.

00:19:25.598 --> 00:19:27.066 align:middle line:84%
They had the freedom
to go around

00:19:27.066 --> 00:19:29.235 align:middle line:90%
and say this is our gospel.

00:19:29.235 --> 00:19:30.904 align:middle line:90%
This God thing is a myth.

00:19:30.904 --> 00:19:35.742 align:middle line:84%
This afterlife is
a waste of time.

00:19:35.742 --> 00:19:39.112 align:middle line:84%
The whole scheme of
ascension is a fraud.

00:19:39.112 --> 00:19:42.015 align:middle line:90%
It really was sweeping charges.

00:19:42.015 --> 00:19:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And really what it's
all about is free will.

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:46.753 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So we weren't
discerning enough on that one.

00:19:46.753 --> 00:19:50.623 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: Even angels at this
kind of mid level were not --

00:19:50.623 --> 00:19:51.824 align:middle line:90%
these guys are so brilliant.

00:19:51.824 --> 00:19:55.495 align:middle line:84%
I mean brilliant beings,
and they can go astray.

00:19:55.495 --> 00:19:57.530 align:middle line:90%
The higher up angels just can't.

00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:00.633 align:middle line:84%
But at this middle level
there's a weak link.

00:20:00.633 --> 00:20:04.304 align:middle line:84%
So they had 37 planets that went
-- we were one of 37 planets.

00:20:04.304 --> 00:20:07.974 align:middle line:84%
So there are 37 known
as the rebellion planets

00:20:07.974 --> 00:20:11.277 align:middle line:84%
that are dark side planets out
of the 1,000 local planets.

00:20:11.277 --> 00:20:14.581 align:middle line:84%
And so it's believed at
least by me that some

00:20:14.581 --> 00:20:17.750 align:middle line:84%
of the ETs coming here are
coming from those planets.

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:20.653 align:middle line:84%
Because those predatory
ETs that we hear

00:20:20.653 --> 00:20:24.157 align:middle line:84%
about I think must be
coming from those places.

00:20:24.157 --> 00:20:26.092 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: That would
make sense, sure,

00:20:26.092 --> 00:20:29.529 align:middle line:84%
if they've been contaminated
so to speak.

00:20:29.529 --> 00:20:31.731 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: But their
technology was far enough along

00:20:31.731 --> 00:20:35.435 align:middle line:84%
that they have interplanetary
travel but they're kind of dark

00:20:35.435 --> 00:20:39.872 align:middle line:84%
and exploitative which we can
see with certain ET groups.

00:20:39.872 --> 00:20:42.342 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And this work has
been around for a while now.

00:20:42.342 --> 00:20:45.211 align:middle line:84%
And when I heard your
talk a couple months ago

00:20:45.211 --> 00:20:48.848 align:middle line:84%
at Joshua Tree you
mentioned some

00:20:48.848 --> 00:20:52.785 align:middle line:84%
of the players we know the
names of who have been devotees

00:20:52.785 --> 00:20:55.321 align:middle line:84%
of this work, and maybe you
can explain just so we kind

00:20:55.321 --> 00:20:59.225 align:middle line:84%
of get kind of a
back door picture

00:20:59.225 --> 00:21:01.828 align:middle line:84%
of who these people
might have been.

00:21:01.828 --> 00:21:03.029 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: The
ones we know about,

00:21:03.029 --> 00:21:05.098 align:middle line:84%
but there's many
I'm sure we don't,

00:21:05.098 --> 00:21:08.134 align:middle line:84%
Jimi Hendrix was
a fervent reader.

00:21:08.134 --> 00:21:10.570 align:middle line:84%
It said that he carried
the Urantia Book along

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:15.341 align:middle line:84%
with his handbook
of Bob Dylan songs.

00:21:15.341 --> 00:21:16.442 align:middle line:90%
He carried the two with him.

00:21:16.442 --> 00:21:17.644 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Interesting.

00:21:17.644 --> 00:21:20.246 align:middle line:84%
Too bad it didn't comfort
him enough to stop some

00:21:20.246 --> 00:21:23.549 align:middle line:84%
of the outrageous drug use
that kind of got him down.

00:21:23.549 --> 00:21:27.453 align:middle line:84%
But what a beautiful being, what
a beautiful musician, artist.

00:21:27.453 --> 00:21:28.521 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: He was
supernatural.

00:21:28.521 --> 00:21:29.722 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: He was
supernatural, yeah.

00:21:29.722 --> 00:21:30.757 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: No wonder
he was interested

00:21:30.757 --> 00:21:31.958 align:middle line:90%
in supernatural teachings.

00:21:31.958 --> 00:21:32.925 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah, yeah.

00:21:32.925 --> 00:21:34.827 align:middle line:90%
>> Belitsos: Jerry Garcia died

00:21:34.827 --> 00:21:36.229 align:middle line:84%
with the Urantia
Book next to his bed.

00:21:36.229 --> 00:21:39.265 align:middle line:84%
And I personally validated that
because I live in San Raphael

00:21:39.265 --> 00:21:41.634 align:middle line:90%
where he -- and it is the case.

00:21:41.634 --> 00:21:43.970 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to sources,
and he was a reader

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:46.039 align:middle line:84%
and was a committed
student of it.

00:21:46.039 --> 00:21:49.175 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people in the
music business including,

00:21:49.175 --> 00:21:50.977 align:middle line:90%
believe it or not, Nashville.

00:21:50.977 --> 00:21:51.611 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Really?

00:21:51.611 --> 00:21:52.311 align:middle line:90%
>> Belitsos: Yeah.

00:21:52.311 --> 00:21:53.379 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Interesting.

00:21:53.379 --> 00:21:54.847 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: So you
think of Nashville.

00:21:54.847 --> 00:21:58.051 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: That would seem more
Biblically oriented but cool.

00:21:58.051 --> 00:22:00.153 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: They're musicians
that [inaudible] people,

00:22:00.153 --> 00:22:02.121 align:middle line:84%
and really a lot
of those things.

00:22:02.121 --> 00:22:05.158 align:middle line:84%
Waylon Jennings, and who's
the one with the pigtails?

00:22:05.158 --> 00:22:05.958 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Willie Nelson.

00:22:05.958 --> 00:22:07.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Belitsos: Willie Nelson.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:08.728 align:middle line:84%
They're definitely
committed to the Urantia Book.

00:22:08.728 --> 00:22:09.796 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Oh, interesting.

00:22:09.796 --> 00:22:12.198 align:middle line:84%
How about politics,
people in politics?

00:22:12.198 --> 00:22:13.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Belitsos: Bill Clinton.

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:17.203 align:middle line:84%
I have a very direct
source on that

00:22:17.203 --> 00:22:20.239 align:middle line:84%
that Bill Clinton had a
book in the Oval Office open

00:22:20.239 --> 00:22:23.276 align:middle line:84%
on his desk according
to a special ops soldier

00:22:23.276 --> 00:22:25.378 align:middle line:84%
who was being decorated
in the Oval Office

00:22:25.378 --> 00:22:26.713 align:middle line:90%
who saw it there twice.

00:22:26.713 --> 00:22:28.781 align:middle line:84%
He was there twice and talked
to Bill Clinton about it.

00:22:28.781 --> 00:22:32.018 align:middle line:84%
And it's certainly no surprise
because Clinton has that expanse

00:22:32.018 --> 00:22:35.688 align:middle line:84%
of intellect I think that
matches the Urantia Book.

00:22:35.688 --> 00:22:36.723 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Interesting,
there are a lot

00:22:36.723 --> 00:22:37.990 align:middle line:90%
of nuances in that one.

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:39.659 align:middle line:90%
Okay, great.

00:22:39.659 --> 00:22:42.562 align:middle line:84%
So now we're getting to --
I mean that's getting closer

00:22:42.562 --> 00:22:47.567 align:middle line:84%
to the need for these
more well ordered

00:22:47.567 --> 00:22:51.037 align:middle line:84%
and better functioning
teams that you talk about.

00:22:51.037 --> 00:22:54.307 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's at Bill Clinton's
level and governmental level

00:22:54.307 --> 00:22:56.609 align:middle line:90%
or whether it's at a local level

00:22:56.609 --> 00:22:59.979 align:middle line:84%
or agency level we
don't do that very well.

00:22:59.979 --> 00:23:02.915 align:middle line:84%
There aren't very many
teams we see that don't seem

00:23:02.915 --> 00:23:04.350 align:middle line:90%
to blow apart at the seams

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:07.120 align:middle line:84%
because of some kind
of internal conflict.

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk about now the
book, Healing a Broken World.

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:12.725 align:middle line:84%
We can see how the
world became broken.

00:23:12.725 --> 00:23:15.261 align:middle line:84%
We're still suffering
from the vestiges

00:23:15.261 --> 00:23:17.296 align:middle line:90%
of that kind of oppression.

00:23:17.296 --> 00:23:19.665 align:middle line:84%
We're starting to find our way
out of it I think mentally,

00:23:19.665 --> 00:23:21.033 align:middle line:90%
emotionally and spiritually.

00:23:21.033 --> 00:23:24.403 align:middle line:84%
But still could use a little
helping hand, a little guidance.

00:23:24.403 --> 00:23:27.473 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about Healing a
Broken World and how that came

00:23:27.473 --> 00:23:31.043 align:middle line:84%
through Daniel Raphael
who is the primary author.

00:23:31.043 --> 00:23:32.745 align:middle line:84%
You're the co-author
of this book.

00:23:32.745 --> 00:23:34.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Belitsos: Correct.

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:37.016 align:middle line:84%
Daniel is part of something
called the Teaching Mission

00:23:37.016 --> 00:23:38.918 align:middle line:84%
which is part of something
called the Correcting Time.

00:23:38.918 --> 00:23:41.788 align:middle line:84%
And the Correcting Time was
launched after the Urantia Book.

00:23:41.788 --> 00:23:42.855 align:middle line:90%
I forgot to mention this to you.

00:23:42.855 --> 00:23:43.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Oh, yes, okay.

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:45.625 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: So it was
proclaimed by the beings

00:23:45.625 --> 00:23:46.659 align:middle line:90%
who wrote the Urantia Book

00:23:46.659 --> 00:23:49.028 align:middle line:84%
through various channels
that we're back.

00:23:49.028 --> 00:23:51.697 align:middle line:84%
They gave this book,
it was printed,

00:23:51.697 --> 00:23:54.667 align:middle line:84%
it's all over the world, it's
in 10 languages, 12 languages.

00:23:54.667 --> 00:23:56.002 align:middle line:90%
Now there's more to say.

00:23:56.002 --> 00:23:56.869 align:middle line:90%
They have a lot more to say.

00:23:56.869 --> 00:23:58.004 align:middle line:90%
Things have changed.

00:23:58.004 --> 00:23:59.305 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: There was a
gap in there I take it?

00:23:59.305 --> 00:24:00.873 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: There was a
generation of things developing.

00:24:00.873 --> 00:24:03.209 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: A generational
gap, okay.

00:24:03.209 --> 00:24:05.178 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: And in
particular they stated,

00:24:05.178 --> 00:24:07.680 align:middle line:84%
and this is controversial
in the Urantia community,

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:12.084 align:middle line:84%
they stated the Lucifer
rebellion has been ended.

00:24:12.084 --> 00:24:15.788 align:middle line:84%
That is there was a
court case in heaven

00:24:15.788 --> 00:24:19.192 align:middle line:90%
that was settled in 1985.

00:24:19.192 --> 00:24:21.561 align:middle line:90%
And so the end of this --

00:24:21.561 --> 00:24:24.363 align:middle line:84%
there was various
things they terminated,

00:24:24.363 --> 00:24:25.698 align:middle line:84%
certain activities
were terminated

00:24:25.698 --> 00:24:28.067 align:middle line:90%
when Jesus incarnated.

00:24:28.067 --> 00:24:33.206 align:middle line:84%
Many of the key activities were
ended, but there was still more

00:24:33.206 --> 00:24:35.241 align:middle line:84%
to do because they
have to have a case --

00:24:35.241 --> 00:24:38.711 align:middle line:84%
they had to have a judgment
from these higher beings.

00:24:38.711 --> 00:24:41.814 align:middle line:84%
And that was handed down in
85 kind of right in the midst

00:24:41.814 --> 00:24:45.051 align:middle line:84%
of the worst part
of the cold war.

00:24:45.051 --> 00:24:47.854 align:middle line:84%
And they had no way
to let us know other

00:24:47.854 --> 00:24:49.522 align:middle line:90%
than through channels.

00:24:49.522 --> 00:24:52.391 align:middle line:84%
So this came through all
these different groups all

00:24:52.391 --> 00:24:53.526 align:middle line:90%
over the place.

00:24:53.526 --> 00:24:55.461 align:middle line:84%
And so we just had to
like say if it's coming

00:24:55.461 --> 00:24:57.563 align:middle line:84%
through all these people
independently it must be true.

00:24:57.563 --> 00:25:00.366 align:middle line:84%
So it's known as
the adjudication

00:25:00.366 --> 00:25:01.801 align:middle line:90%
of the Lucifer rebellion.

00:25:01.801 --> 00:25:04.303 align:middle line:84%
And with that they
announced the Correcting Time

00:25:04.303 --> 00:25:05.438 align:middle line:90%
which has two parts.

00:25:05.438 --> 00:25:09.075 align:middle line:84%
One part is using the
Urantia lingo to teach.

00:25:09.075 --> 00:25:12.545 align:middle line:84%
And the other part is teaching
without the Urantia lingo

00:25:12.545 --> 00:25:16.249 align:middle line:84%
which is the main part where
the angelic host is now

00:25:16.249 --> 00:25:20.386 align:middle line:84%
rehabilitated, is
working to end communism.

00:25:20.386 --> 00:25:22.755 align:middle line:84%
And they actually say
it was part of our work

00:25:22.755 --> 00:25:24.557 align:middle line:84%
that brought an end
to the cold war

00:25:24.557 --> 00:25:27.460 align:middle line:84%
because there were angelic
appearances to Gorbachev.

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:28.661 align:middle line:90%
You may have heard this.

00:25:28.661 --> 00:25:30.096 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: No, I have
never heard that actually.

00:25:30.096 --> 00:25:34.367 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: Just a whole play,
it's documentation of the fact

00:25:34.367 --> 00:25:39.372 align:middle line:84%
that the had two angels that
came to him and worked with him.

00:25:39.372 --> 00:25:41.173 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you can look
that up and see that.

00:25:41.173 --> 00:25:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And it was just a lot of
influence by a certain type

00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:46.512 align:middle line:84%
of angel that can
work on social change,

00:25:46.512 --> 00:25:48.915 align:middle line:84%
they have like angels
of social change.

00:25:48.915 --> 00:25:51.350 align:middle line:84%
So they said a lot of
these things you're seeing

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:56.055 align:middle line:84%
around you are work
co-creative, not just us.

00:25:56.055 --> 00:25:57.189 align:middle line:90%
We're working through you.

00:25:57.189 --> 00:25:59.292 align:middle line:84%
When you're ready
then we work with you.

00:25:59.292 --> 00:26:01.394 align:middle line:84%
When you get the idea
we enhance the idea.

00:26:01.394 --> 00:26:03.963 align:middle line:84%
We don't necessarily
give you the idea

00:26:03.963 --> 00:26:05.298 align:middle line:84%
because we're not really
allowed to do that.

00:26:05.298 --> 00:26:06.699 align:middle line:90%
It has to be your idea.

00:26:06.699 --> 00:26:10.169 align:middle line:84%
But then we tweak it and improve
the idea and enhance the idea.

00:26:10.169 --> 00:26:14.106 align:middle line:84%
So the many movements
that we see now

00:26:14.106 --> 00:26:16.008 align:middle line:84%
like the environmental
movement, for example,

00:26:16.008 --> 00:26:17.910 align:middle line:84%
they say we're a
part of that, too.

00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:20.046 align:middle line:84%
Everything positive
we're a part of.

00:26:20.046 --> 00:26:24.317 align:middle line:84%
But we still have a battle
against the Luciferic party

00:26:24.317 --> 00:26:26.619 align:middle line:84%
which are the humans
that were part

00:26:26.619 --> 00:26:28.754 align:middle line:90%
of these Illuminati families.

00:26:28.754 --> 00:26:33.125 align:middle line:84%
And they're still wealthy,
active, but we're cleaning it

00:26:33.125 --> 00:26:34.727 align:middle line:90%
up but it's taking time.

00:26:34.727 --> 00:26:37.063 align:middle line:84%
So that's why you see
this back and forth.

00:26:37.063 --> 00:26:40.333 align:middle line:84%
Things are going well for
a while then 9/11 happens.

00:26:40.333 --> 00:26:45.237 align:middle line:84%
And that is in my humble opinion
not just a secular thing.

00:26:45.237 --> 00:26:46.339 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Exactly.

00:26:46.339 --> 00:26:48.507 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: That's
off planet involvement

00:26:48.507 --> 00:26:51.210 align:middle line:90%
to really move us backward.

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:53.379 align:middle line:84%
Progress went backward
at that point.

00:26:53.379 --> 00:26:55.848 align:middle line:84%
So they're stating
it's a pretty rough go

00:26:55.848 --> 00:26:58.884 align:middle line:84%
because you have very
strong Luciferic leadership

00:26:58.884 --> 00:27:00.119 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:27:00.119 --> 00:27:02.822 align:middle line:84%
It's mainly hidden away but
sometimes not so hidden.

00:27:02.822 --> 00:27:08.894 align:middle line:84%
So we launched yet
another program called the

00:27:08.894 --> 00:27:10.262 align:middle line:90%
Magisterial Mission.

00:27:10.262 --> 00:27:12.331 align:middle line:84%
So that's what this book
is really the first book

00:27:12.331 --> 00:27:13.532 align:middle line:90%
of this mission.

00:27:13.532 --> 00:27:16.002 align:middle line:84%
So there's really two
missions of these beings.

00:27:16.002 --> 00:27:18.537 align:middle line:84%
One is called the
Teaching Mission

00:27:18.537 --> 00:27:20.373 align:middle line:90%
which is spiritual teachings,

00:27:20.373 --> 00:27:23.409 align:middle line:84%
I've published many
books of that.

00:27:23.409 --> 00:27:27.980 align:middle line:84%
And then graduated to a
social transformation teaching

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:29.949 align:middle line:84%
which I'd never heard of
anything quite like it

00:27:29.949 --> 00:27:32.618 align:middle line:84%
where high beings are
teaching cultural and social

00:27:32.618 --> 00:27:34.954 align:middle line:84%
and political transformation
to individuals.

00:27:34.954 --> 00:27:36.655 align:middle line:90%
And that's what this is.

00:27:36.655 --> 00:27:37.723 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: It's very
nicely done.

00:27:37.723 --> 00:27:39.458 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's a small
book but it's packed

00:27:39.458 --> 00:27:42.228 align:middle line:84%
with pretty much everything
you need to know to create,

00:27:42.228 --> 00:27:44.797 align:middle line:84%
as you say, a socially
sustainable,

00:27:44.797 --> 00:27:48.000 align:middle line:90%
indefinitely sustainable future.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.736 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: They use the term
sustainability in a new way.

00:27:50.736 --> 00:27:54.306 align:middle line:84%
I have been researching
and finding that scholars

00:27:54.306 --> 00:27:57.109 align:middle line:84%
in the field do use this
term but not too much.

00:27:57.109 --> 00:27:59.512 align:middle line:84%
Mainly they mean
environmental sustainable.

00:27:59.512 --> 00:28:02.114 align:middle line:84%
But people who really know
the score know we need

00:28:02.114 --> 00:28:03.315 align:middle line:90%
social sustainability.

00:28:03.315 --> 00:28:04.417 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Exactly.

00:28:04.417 --> 00:28:05.051 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: I mean
it's kind of obvious.

00:28:05.051 --> 00:28:06.118 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:28:06.118 --> 00:28:08.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: But this
is fairly radical

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:11.390 align:middle line:84%
in that it says you might
as well not think too much

00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:13.225 align:middle line:84%
about environmental
sustainability unless you have

00:28:13.225 --> 00:28:19.165 align:middle line:84%
institutions that can implement
environmental regulation,

00:28:19.165 --> 00:28:20.433 align:middle line:90%
and you really don't.

00:28:20.433 --> 00:28:24.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean look at global warming,
look at climate change.

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:26.305 align:middle line:84%
You really don't have the
ability to regulate it

00:28:26.305 --> 00:28:28.941 align:middle line:84%
because you don't have
sustainable institutions

00:28:28.941 --> 00:28:31.777 align:middle line:84%
that can make decisions,
that can deliberate.

00:28:31.777 --> 00:28:34.547 align:middle line:84%
So you would have thought, I
would have thought at least,

00:28:34.547 --> 00:28:37.216 align:middle line:84%
that they'd work with the United
Nations, they being celestials

00:28:37.216 --> 00:28:38.951 align:middle line:84%
and they would work with the
United Nations and work with,

00:28:38.951 --> 00:28:41.387 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, World Bank
although that's probably a

00:28:41.387 --> 00:28:42.555 align:middle line:90%
dark entity.

00:28:42.555 --> 00:28:45.291 align:middle line:84%
But they'd work with
these institutions and try

00:28:45.291 --> 00:28:46.926 align:middle line:90%
to tweak them to do this.

00:28:46.926 --> 00:28:49.962 align:middle line:84%
But they said, and I got
this actually in dialogues

00:28:49.962 --> 00:28:52.231 align:middle line:90%
and others as well, not just me.

00:28:52.231 --> 00:28:55.768 align:middle line:84%
Actually one time I just said
why aren't you coming to us?

00:28:55.768 --> 00:28:57.269 align:middle line:90%
We're just regular citizens.

00:28:57.269 --> 00:28:58.471 align:middle line:90%
We're mystics.

00:28:58.471 --> 00:29:01.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean why don't you work
with these big parties

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:03.776 align:middle line:84%
that can really influence
the world.

00:29:03.776 --> 00:29:05.945 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, we just
don't think they're going

00:29:05.945 --> 00:29:07.279 align:middle line:90%
to do it.

00:29:07.279 --> 00:29:09.949 align:middle line:84%
And many of them are corrupt
and they're part of self --

00:29:09.949 --> 00:29:11.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: A lot of them
still have the dark agenda,

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:13.519 align:middle line:84%
satanic rituals and
all that going, too.

00:29:13.519 --> 00:29:14.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Belitsos: They do.

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:15.921 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Hard to
get through, yeah.

00:29:15.921 --> 00:29:17.389 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: Or if they're not
part of it they're influenced

00:29:17.389 --> 00:29:20.392 align:middle line:84%
by it they're influenced by it
and they're in that mind set.

00:29:20.392 --> 00:29:21.794 align:middle line:90%
And they further went on,

00:29:21.794 --> 00:29:27.399 align:middle line:84%
and for some years they've been
saying, their system is slowly

00:29:27.399 --> 00:29:30.669 align:middle line:84%
like an attrition, it's
just slowly collapsing.

00:29:30.669 --> 00:29:34.206 align:middle line:84%
But then it's going to be a very
sudden acceleration of collapse.

00:29:34.206 --> 00:29:36.609 align:middle line:84%
And you can't fix it
so don't even think

00:29:36.609 --> 00:29:38.611 align:middle line:90%
about fixing these institutions.

00:29:38.611 --> 00:29:41.046 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So we're talking
about all the known systems?

00:29:41.046 --> 00:29:42.114 align:middle line:90%
>> Belitsos: Yeah.

00:29:42.114 --> 00:29:43.482 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Economic,
etc., governmental.

00:29:43.482 --> 00:29:44.483 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: Governmental,
economic.

00:29:44.483 --> 00:29:45.584 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And so
what did they say

00:29:45.584 --> 00:29:47.052 align:middle line:84%
that collapse will look
like, and what kind

00:29:47.052 --> 00:29:50.189 align:middle line:84%
of time frames are they looking
at before the disintegration

00:29:50.189 --> 00:29:52.591 align:middle line:84%
and then new consciousness,
new systems rising?

00:29:52.591 --> 00:29:57.062 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: Within our lifetime
there will be systemic collapse.

00:29:57.062 --> 00:29:58.264 align:middle line:90%
We've seen pretty close to that.

00:29:58.264 --> 00:29:59.732 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: We're seeing it, yes.

00:29:59.732 --> 00:30:01.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: So it's not
hard to believe that.

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:04.470 align:middle line:84%
And they started saying that
before the collapse in 2008.

00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:06.305 align:middle line:90%
They were saying it in 2006.

00:30:06.305 --> 00:30:08.073 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, God, this
is it, it's happening,

00:30:08.073 --> 00:30:11.210 align:middle line:84%
2008 is what they're
saying, it's so soon.

00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:14.380 align:middle line:84%
But the system can
self-heal somewhat,

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:18.150 align:middle line:84%
but really bailing themselves
out isn't going to work forever.

00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:20.019 align:middle line:84%
So they said, well, just
look at the evidence.

00:30:20.019 --> 00:30:22.121 align:middle line:84%
Or look at other civilizations
that have collapsed

00:30:22.121 --> 00:30:23.489 align:middle line:90%
and almost every single one.

00:30:23.489 --> 00:30:24.857 align:middle line:90%
I mean name one that didn't.

00:30:24.857 --> 00:30:29.061 align:middle line:84%
Every single one,
China or Roman Empire,

00:30:29.061 --> 00:30:32.131 align:middle line:84%
whatever it is these
empires have gone away.

00:30:32.131 --> 00:30:35.734 align:middle line:84%
So you, too, will go away but
this time on a planetary scale.

00:30:35.734 --> 00:30:38.571 align:middle line:84%
But I mean there will
be surviving structures

00:30:38.571 --> 00:30:41.473 align:middle line:84%
and libraries and things
will still survive.

00:30:41.473 --> 00:30:44.577 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to give you
something that's grass roots.

00:30:44.577 --> 00:30:47.012 align:middle line:84%
So their approach
is grass roots.

00:30:47.012 --> 00:30:49.014 align:middle line:90%
Which to me sounds pretty tough.

00:30:49.014 --> 00:30:50.516 align:middle line:90%
So citizens have to do it.

00:30:50.516 --> 00:30:53.085 align:middle line:84%
And then in these dialogues
and this is just one,

00:30:53.085 --> 00:30:55.688 align:middle line:84%
there's like 2,000 pages of
stuff, we got it down to 100.

00:30:55.688 --> 00:30:58.724 align:middle line:84%
We said how are we going to
get these people to do this?

00:30:58.724 --> 00:31:03.195 align:middle line:84%
They said people will run to
do this at a certain point

00:31:03.195 --> 00:31:04.463 align:middle line:90%
because they will want --

00:31:04.463 --> 00:31:05.631 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: I would agree.

00:31:05.631 --> 00:31:06.699 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: -- to
rebuild their institutions.

00:31:06.699 --> 00:31:08.801 align:middle line:84%
And they'll need a
methodology to do this,

00:31:08.801 --> 00:31:10.002 align:middle line:84%
and they'll need
something simple.

00:31:10.002 --> 00:31:11.971 align:middle line:84%
And there's plenty of
great stuff out there.

00:31:11.971 --> 00:31:15.341 align:middle line:84%
But we simplify it down
to three basic things.

00:31:15.341 --> 00:31:17.543 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yes, and
then how to utilize that

00:31:17.543 --> 00:31:20.379 align:middle line:84%
and the participants and
the nature of their roles.

00:31:20.379 --> 00:31:23.682 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of this when you're
reading the book you have the

00:31:23.682 --> 00:31:26.852 align:middle line:84%
comments from the
entity that is involved,

00:31:26.852 --> 00:31:30.589 align:middle line:84%
the celestial being
named Monjoronson?

00:31:30.589 --> 00:31:33.025 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: Monjoronson
or Monjoronson.

00:31:33.025 --> 00:31:35.894 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Okay, and so tell us
a little bit about this being.

00:31:35.894 --> 00:31:40.099 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: Monjoronson is
a very high celestial being.

00:31:40.099 --> 00:31:47.439 align:middle line:84%
In the Urantia it's not really
a hierarchy, it's a holarchy.

00:31:47.439 --> 00:31:53.846 align:middle line:84%
He's a being of status
from the central universe.

00:31:53.846 --> 00:31:56.782 align:middle line:84%
The central universe is an
eternal universe according

00:31:56.782 --> 00:32:00.019 align:middle line:84%
to the Urantia Book so they
don't have a big bang cosmology.

00:32:00.019 --> 00:32:02.688 align:middle line:84%
So beings that come out
from the central universe

00:32:02.688 --> 00:32:03.889 align:middle line:90%
which is also known

00:32:03.889 --> 00:32:07.593 align:middle line:84%
as the mother universe are
very, very high beings.

00:32:07.593 --> 00:32:13.866 align:middle line:84%
And they come to planets on
very important dispensational

00:32:13.866 --> 00:32:17.970 align:middle line:84%
missions which is the
termination of an age

00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:21.674 align:middle line:84%
and ushering in a
new age, another age.

00:32:21.674 --> 00:32:26.412 align:middle line:84%
And this is a celestial thing
as well as an earth thing.

00:32:26.412 --> 00:32:30.616 align:middle line:84%
So they're actually working with
the angels around our planet

00:32:30.616 --> 00:32:32.818 align:middle line:84%
to move them forward, and
they're working with us.

00:32:32.818 --> 00:32:34.920 align:middle line:90%
So he is that type of being.

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:38.457 align:middle line:84%
He is known as a
magisterial son.

00:32:38.457 --> 00:32:41.927 align:middle line:90%
And they incarnate.

00:32:41.927 --> 00:32:45.164 align:middle line:90%
So this will be an avatar event.

00:32:45.164 --> 00:32:49.034 align:middle line:84%
And so every normal
planet has such a being.

00:32:49.034 --> 00:32:53.372 align:middle line:84%
But because we're not normal
he has a very special program

00:32:53.372 --> 00:32:55.607 align:middle line:90%
adapted for our big problems.

00:32:55.607 --> 00:32:59.545 align:middle line:84%
Normally if a magisterial son
comes things are pretty good,

00:32:59.545 --> 00:33:03.816 align:middle line:84%
and you don't have nuclear wars
and you don't have genocide.

00:33:03.816 --> 00:33:05.317 align:middle line:84%
But you have to really
move forward,

00:33:05.317 --> 00:33:06.819 align:middle line:90%
and you need a world teacher.

00:33:06.819 --> 00:33:10.656 align:middle line:84%
So he becomes the
maitreya, the world teacher.

00:33:10.656 --> 00:33:12.758 align:middle line:84%
And so he incarnates
for that purpose.

00:33:12.758 --> 00:33:16.028 align:middle line:84%
But in this case they have
all these programs most

00:33:16.028 --> 00:33:17.496 align:middle line:90%
of which we don't know about.

00:33:17.496 --> 00:33:21.467 align:middle line:84%
This is just one of them,
it's a big one, though,

00:33:21.467 --> 00:33:25.003 align:middle line:84%
to get grass roots
reconfiguration

00:33:25.003 --> 00:33:28.640 align:middle line:84%
of society creating
this database

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:32.778 align:middle line:84%
of socially sustainable
institutions

00:33:32.778 --> 00:33:36.515 align:middle line:84%
that are universally
valid cross-culturally.

00:33:36.515 --> 00:33:38.584 align:middle line:90%
So that as we're moving

00:33:38.584 --> 00:33:42.354 align:middle line:84%
into collapse you can just
pull this off the shelf.

00:33:42.354 --> 00:33:45.557 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to design a
healthcare system you've got

00:33:45.557 --> 00:33:47.559 align:middle line:90%
to design.

00:33:47.559 --> 00:33:49.294 align:middle line:84%
It's not coming from
the United Nations.

00:33:49.294 --> 00:33:50.396 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:33:50.396 --> 00:33:53.332 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: Or some
capitalist corporation.

00:33:53.332 --> 00:33:54.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: It's very
clear and practical.

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:57.569 align:middle line:84%
Everything I read in there
was very clear and practical

00:33:57.569 --> 00:34:00.372 align:middle line:90%
and beautifully articulated.

00:34:00.372 --> 00:34:01.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Belitsos: Thanks.

00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:04.076 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I mean these are
very articulate beings.

00:34:04.076 --> 00:34:05.076 align:middle line:90%
Their English is perfect.

00:34:05.076 --> 00:34:07.379 align:middle line:90%
It's just amazing.

00:34:07.379 --> 00:34:09.915 align:middle line:84%
So it makes it easy for us
because you just kind of put it

00:34:09.915 --> 00:34:11.016 align:middle line:90%
in a book and there it is.

00:34:11.016 --> 00:34:12.884 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Right, so
let's talk about that.

00:34:12.884 --> 00:34:15.654 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the
three core values they say is

00:34:15.654 --> 00:34:19.857 align:middle line:84%
absolutely necessary no matter
where you are in the cosmos

00:34:19.857 --> 00:34:24.129 align:middle line:84%
to have societies that function
well, bring the most out

00:34:24.129 --> 00:34:26.532 align:middle line:90%
and sustain themselves.

00:34:26.532 --> 00:34:29.735 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: So throughout
the cosmos there are billions

00:34:29.735 --> 00:34:32.504 align:middle line:84%
of inhabited planets
according the Urantia Book

00:34:32.504 --> 00:34:34.273 align:middle line:90%
and according to many others.

00:34:34.273 --> 00:34:38.310 align:middle line:84%
If you observe how they become
sustainable there's a certain

00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:39.844 align:middle line:84%
set of principles
that are always there,

00:34:39.844 --> 00:34:42.181 align:middle line:90%
and they're really common sense.

00:34:42.181 --> 00:34:44.683 align:middle line:84%
Sustainability socially
means, number one,

00:34:44.683 --> 00:34:47.085 align:middle line:90%
you can't have inequality.

00:34:47.085 --> 00:34:49.421 align:middle line:84%
Because eventually you're going
to have a revolution of the poor

00:34:49.421 --> 00:34:52.858 align:middle line:84%
versus -- so that's
not sustainable.

00:34:52.858 --> 00:34:56.829 align:middle line:84%
So you say, well, okay
now we have equality

00:34:56.829 --> 00:34:58.897 align:middle line:84%
but that's not going
to be sustainable

00:34:58.897 --> 00:35:00.599 align:middle line:90%
because pretty soon you're going

00:35:00.599 --> 00:35:02.634 align:middle line:84%
to realize we don't have
a quality of life here.

00:35:02.634 --> 00:35:03.902 align:middle line:90%
We're like in prison here.

00:35:03.902 --> 00:35:06.371 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is equal, and
that's what communism is like.

00:35:06.371 --> 00:35:08.540 align:middle line:84%
So we need to add
quality of life.

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:10.542 align:middle line:84%
I mean everybody is
surviving and not starving,

00:35:10.542 --> 00:35:12.711 align:middle line:90%
so let's add quality of life.

00:35:12.711 --> 00:35:14.847 align:middle line:90%
That's the second value.

00:35:14.847 --> 00:35:18.217 align:middle line:90%
The third value is growth.

00:35:18.217 --> 00:35:22.488 align:middle line:84%
So imagine a situation where
everyone in this situation,

00:35:22.488 --> 00:35:25.457 align:middle line:84%
let's say a country,
everybody is equal,

00:35:25.457 --> 00:35:28.694 align:middle line:84%
everybody has got quality of
life and everybody is growing,

00:35:28.694 --> 00:35:32.631 align:middle line:84%
personal growth, spiritually
growing, self-realization.

00:35:32.631 --> 00:35:34.399 align:middle line:84%
Where do you find
that happening?

00:35:34.399 --> 00:35:38.637 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe Shangri-La or
something but it's utopia.

00:35:38.637 --> 00:35:41.373 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Maybe kind of in a
few intentional communities,

00:35:41.373 --> 00:35:43.909 align:middle line:84%
but they're having issues
of their own as well, yeah.

00:35:43.909 --> 00:35:45.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: That's
really the idea

00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:46.678 align:middle line:84%
of an intentional
community, isn't it,

00:35:46.678 --> 00:35:48.580 align:middle line:90%
it's equal and they're growing.

00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:54.887 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so it's like a utopian
vision, but they use logic.

00:35:54.887 --> 00:35:57.523 align:middle line:84%
And they say, look, I
mean think about it,

00:35:57.523 --> 00:36:00.559 align:middle line:84%
where do you find
something stable

00:36:00.559 --> 00:36:01.994 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't have these three?

00:36:01.994 --> 00:36:03.829 align:middle line:90%
Like a family for example.

00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:07.065 align:middle line:84%
I mean the children ought
to have certain rights.

00:36:07.065 --> 00:36:10.903 align:middle line:84%
And it's not that the parents
are dictating to the children.

00:36:10.903 --> 00:36:12.738 align:middle line:84%
So you need some
kind of equality

00:36:12.738 --> 00:36:14.506 align:middle line:90%
of rights, equal rights.

00:36:14.506 --> 00:36:15.507 align:middle line:90%
A quality of life.

00:36:15.507 --> 00:36:16.775 align:middle line:84%
If the family doesn't
have quality

00:36:16.775 --> 00:36:19.545 align:middle line:84%
of life the kids act out,
they start getting crazy.

00:36:19.545 --> 00:36:25.284 align:middle line:84%
And if people aren't growing
then they aren't growing up.

00:36:25.284 --> 00:36:26.685 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:36:26.685 --> 00:36:30.088 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting because in
our cultures now growth always

00:36:30.088 --> 00:36:35.627 align:middle line:84%
seems to come at the expense
of the inequality issue.

00:36:35.627 --> 00:36:37.129 align:middle line:90%
Someone wins, someone loses,

00:36:37.129 --> 00:36:39.598 align:middle line:84%
someone exploits,
someone provides.

00:36:39.598 --> 00:36:44.436 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at just
our human personalities

00:36:44.436 --> 00:36:47.472 align:middle line:84%
and behavior you have
your A type personalities,

00:36:47.472 --> 00:36:49.441 align:middle line:84%
B type personalities
and so forth.

00:36:49.441 --> 00:36:53.412 align:middle line:84%
This is not eradicating
our native nature.

00:36:53.412 --> 00:36:57.015 align:middle line:84%
We can live within nature it
sounds like without having

00:36:57.015 --> 00:37:01.253 align:middle line:84%
to violate that inequality
issue for growth.

00:37:01.253 --> 00:37:03.255 align:middle line:90%
>> Belitsos: As a student

00:37:03.255 --> 00:37:07.125 align:middle line:84%
in college I was actually
studying aristocracies.

00:37:07.125 --> 00:37:09.461 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why I
was attracted to it.

00:37:09.461 --> 00:37:11.530 align:middle line:90%
I was a history student.

00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:15.334 align:middle line:84%
I was very attracted to
the French aristocracy.

00:37:15.334 --> 00:37:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And later when I was doing
this work I realized, oh,

00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:22.975 align:middle line:84%
this is the case of
the quality of life.

00:37:22.975 --> 00:37:25.243 align:middle line:84%
They have high quality
of life in aristocracies.

00:37:25.243 --> 00:37:27.279 align:middle line:90%
No wonder I like it.

00:37:27.279 --> 00:37:30.382 align:middle line:84%
Great music, great art, great
writing, poetry, all this stuff.

00:37:30.382 --> 00:37:31.783 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Food,
clothes, it's all there.

00:37:31.783 --> 00:37:33.652 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: All of it, and
they're growing as people.

00:37:33.652 --> 00:37:38.590 align:middle line:84%
But it's totally corrupt because
the peasants are repressed.

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if that exactly
responds to what you said.

00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:43.395 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:37:43.395 --> 00:37:44.796 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: But it's just
the experience of this in once

00:37:44.796 --> 00:37:48.433 align:middle line:84%
in a life where you recognize
here I am living in the suburbs

00:37:48.433 --> 00:37:51.470 align:middle line:84%
of San Francisco where
I live in Marin County

00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:53.605 align:middle line:84%
where it's a great quality of
life, and I go over the bridge

00:37:53.605 --> 00:37:57.175 align:middle line:84%
to Oakland and it's really
sometimes quite a mess.

00:37:57.175 --> 00:37:58.377 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
crime over there,

00:37:58.377 --> 00:38:00.545 align:middle line:84%
and that's just a
few miles away.

00:38:00.545 --> 00:38:03.148 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I mean the
difference between Marin County

00:38:03.148 --> 00:38:05.851 align:middle line:84%
and certain areas of Oakland,
I've spent a lot of time in each

00:38:05.851 --> 00:38:08.453 align:middle line:84%
and was raised partially
in Marin County,

00:38:08.453 --> 00:38:09.955 align:middle line:84%
I mean here you're
looking at sort

00:38:09.955 --> 00:38:11.957 align:middle line:90%
of the best of the best in life.

00:38:11.957 --> 00:38:15.427 align:middle line:84%
Even the weather is
pretty much perfect.

00:38:15.427 --> 00:38:20.966 align:middle line:84%
Camelot. And then you go over
into Oakland into certain areas

00:38:20.966 --> 00:38:24.936 align:middle line:90%
of Oakland and it's so desolate.

00:38:24.936 --> 00:38:28.707 align:middle line:84%
Not only are there
not jasmine and roses

00:38:28.707 --> 00:38:32.244 align:middle line:84%
and beautiful things growing,
you're talking about dirt,

00:38:32.244 --> 00:38:36.415 align:middle line:84%
not even grass growing and
dogs and chain link fences,

00:38:36.415 --> 00:38:41.053 align:middle line:84%
and people whose eyes
are so sad, so empty,

00:38:41.053 --> 00:38:43.155 align:middle line:90%
so angry and desperate.

00:38:43.155 --> 00:38:46.391 align:middle line:84%
So close together these two
realities including the Oakland

00:38:46.391 --> 00:38:47.859 align:middle line:90%
Hills, from the Oakland Hills.

00:38:47.859 --> 00:38:49.528 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: Yeah, just
come down the hill.

00:38:49.528 --> 00:38:51.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So that
isn't working.

00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:52.864 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: Yeah,
that's not working.

00:38:52.864 --> 00:38:57.269 align:middle line:84%
So think of social
sustainability as a culture

00:38:57.269 --> 00:39:00.238 align:middle line:84%
where it's like a stool
where there's three legs.

00:39:00.238 --> 00:39:02.774 align:middle line:84%
Equality has to be
there, that's one leg.

00:39:02.774 --> 00:39:05.677 align:middle line:84%
The other leg is
quality of life.

00:39:05.677 --> 00:39:08.880 align:middle line:90%
And the third leg is growth.

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:11.616 align:middle line:90%
The stool can be stable.

00:39:11.616 --> 00:39:15.253 align:middle line:84%
Oakland could be a stable place
and not have all this crime,

00:39:15.253 --> 00:39:18.256 align:middle line:84%
not have uprisings
like the occupation.

00:39:18.256 --> 00:39:21.259 align:middle line:84%
The occupied movement was an
uprise, it was a good uprising,

00:39:21.259 --> 00:39:25.330 align:middle line:84%
but it disrupts life to have
uprisings to try to fix things.

00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:27.699 align:middle line:84%
So you have to have that
stool that's stable.

00:39:27.699 --> 00:39:31.636 align:middle line:84%
And how you get that into these
institutions of government,

00:39:31.636 --> 00:39:34.973 align:middle line:84%
of business, industry
that's a big job.

00:39:34.973 --> 00:39:37.743 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So it sounds
like the beings involved

00:39:37.743 --> 00:39:40.479 align:middle line:84%
with this were very
intentional, as you say,

00:39:40.479 --> 00:39:42.314 align:middle line:84%
in starting on a
grass roots level.

00:39:42.314 --> 00:39:45.350 align:middle line:84%
You can take a PTA
group or whatever

00:39:45.350 --> 00:39:47.686 align:middle line:84%
and really apply these
principles for something

00:39:47.686 --> 00:39:50.589 align:middle line:84%
of high function, and that's
not to make light of the PTA.

00:39:50.589 --> 00:39:53.458 align:middle line:84%
A lot of things happen in
the schools or not happening

00:39:53.458 --> 00:39:54.659 align:middle line:90%
in the school actually,

00:39:54.659 --> 00:39:57.395 align:middle line:84%
they can't get things done
there anymore starting

00:39:57.395 --> 00:39:59.231 align:middle line:84%
with raising the children
in the way they need

00:39:59.231 --> 00:40:02.234 align:middle line:84%
to define their own talents,
their own desires and so forth.

00:40:02.234 --> 00:40:04.169 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
where it begins.

00:40:04.169 --> 00:40:05.403 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: Just
look at schools.

00:40:05.403 --> 00:40:08.073 align:middle line:84%
I mean schools there's
the sense of equality.

00:40:08.073 --> 00:40:11.910 align:middle line:84%
Everybody goes to school, either
public school or some kind

00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:15.147 align:middle line:84%
of education is required
as it should be.

00:40:15.147 --> 00:40:16.748 align:middle line:90%
So we're all equal.

00:40:16.748 --> 00:40:20.285 align:middle line:84%
We all go to junior,
elementary and high school.

00:40:20.285 --> 00:40:23.321 align:middle line:84%
But beyond that there's really
not much quality there unless

00:40:23.321 --> 00:40:27.459 align:middle line:84%
you go to a private school and
you get some quality there.

00:40:27.459 --> 00:40:29.494 align:middle line:90%
But are people really growing?

00:40:29.494 --> 00:40:32.164 align:middle line:84%
Well, we find a lot of
them are dropping out.

00:40:32.164 --> 00:40:35.233 align:middle line:84%
And so schools are
not sustainable.

00:40:35.233 --> 00:40:37.002 align:middle line:84%
I think that's obvious
to all of us.

00:40:37.002 --> 00:40:38.603 align:middle line:84%
So how would you get
that to be the case?

00:40:38.603 --> 00:40:40.906 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're going
to have a tax base

00:40:40.906 --> 00:40:44.276 align:middle line:84%
to fund high quality
education across the board.

00:40:44.276 --> 00:40:48.280 align:middle line:84%
No discrepancies by
race or class or region.

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:51.116 align:middle line:84%
And so I think it's
straightforward.

00:40:51.116 --> 00:40:52.684 align:middle line:90%
You've got to have music.

00:40:52.684 --> 00:40:53.819 align:middle line:90%
You've got to have art.

00:40:53.819 --> 00:40:56.721 align:middle line:84%
You've got to have kids
learning about civics.

00:40:56.721 --> 00:41:00.358 align:middle line:90%
You've got math and science.

00:41:00.358 --> 00:41:02.561 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: And use their bodies.

00:41:02.561 --> 00:41:03.395 align:middle line:90%
>> Belitsos: What's that?

00:41:03.395 --> 00:41:04.362 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Physical education.

00:41:04.362 --> 00:41:05.664 align:middle line:84%
Let people use their
bodies again.

00:41:05.664 --> 00:41:08.033 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: That's it so
they can grow and be strong

00:41:08.033 --> 00:41:09.301 align:middle line:90%
and so all these things.

00:41:09.301 --> 00:41:11.203 align:middle line:84%
And also fostering
personal growth

00:41:11.203 --> 00:41:14.339 align:middle line:90%
in classes on personal growth.

00:41:14.339 --> 00:41:16.441 align:middle line:90%
Sex education is important, too.

00:41:16.441 --> 00:41:19.911 align:middle line:84%
And all that gives you a
socially sustainable tool.

00:41:19.911 --> 00:41:22.881 align:middle line:84%
So if you wanted to do
a design you would start

00:41:22.881 --> 00:41:25.617 align:middle line:84%
as a social sustainability
design team.

00:41:25.617 --> 00:41:27.219 align:middle line:90%
You would instigate a team.

00:41:27.219 --> 00:41:30.455 align:middle line:84%
And you would invite people
who are interested in education

00:41:30.455 --> 00:41:33.825 align:middle line:84%
or in education or teachers,
and you have a citizens' group

00:41:33.825 --> 00:41:35.827 align:middle line:90%
that would have, if I may,

00:41:35.827 --> 00:41:37.028 align:middle line:84%
talk about the structure
of the group.

00:41:37.028 --> 00:41:38.096 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I would like to
talk about the structure

00:41:38.096 --> 00:41:40.665 align:middle line:84%
and the roles various
people play, yes.

00:41:40.665 --> 00:41:42.067 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: So you
have like the organizer.

00:41:42.067 --> 00:41:44.436 align:middle line:90%
The organizer has division.

00:41:44.436 --> 00:41:46.137 align:middle line:90%
We've got to fix schools.

00:41:46.137 --> 00:41:48.573 align:middle line:84%
So let's try to do
this in Oakland.

00:41:48.573 --> 00:41:51.743 align:middle line:84%
I will recruit some people, not
too many, six, seven, eight,

00:41:51.743 --> 00:41:56.515 align:middle line:84%
nine people to be in this
committee really, it's SSDT,

00:41:56.515 --> 00:41:58.617 align:middle line:84%
social sustainability
design team

00:41:58.617 --> 00:42:00.252 align:middle line:90%
or just team or design team.

00:42:00.252 --> 00:42:03.388 align:middle line:84%
And you follow the procedure
in the procedure in the book

00:42:03.388 --> 00:42:07.325 align:middle line:84%
which is you get a facilitator,
not necessarily the organizer,

00:42:07.325 --> 00:42:09.127 align:middle line:84%
someone who is good
at facilitation.

00:42:09.127 --> 00:42:11.897 align:middle line:84%
That person is going
to set up a procedure

00:42:11.897 --> 00:42:14.132 align:middle line:84%
so that the others
can do their job.

00:42:14.132 --> 00:42:18.703 align:middle line:84%
And the other jobs are
inquiring, questioning.

00:42:18.703 --> 00:42:21.072 align:middle line:84%
So you have several members
who are good at that,

00:42:21.072 --> 00:42:23.775 align:middle line:84%
good at questioning,
good at researching.

00:42:23.775 --> 00:42:27.979 align:middle line:84%
And you actually have meetings
where they're asking questions

00:42:27.979 --> 00:42:29.848 align:middle line:90%
and having deliberations.

00:42:29.848 --> 00:42:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And there's another role
called the recorder,

00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:36.388 align:middle line:84%
and the recorder is taking
it all down and providing --

00:42:36.388 --> 00:42:38.323 align:middle line:84%
it's more than just
being a secretary.

00:42:38.323 --> 00:42:39.991 align:middle line:90%
They're providing good summaries

00:42:39.991 --> 00:42:41.393 align:middle line:84%
for the next meeting,
for example.

00:42:41.393 --> 00:42:44.829 align:middle line:84%
And they're reading back, this
is what we're now talking about.

00:42:44.829 --> 00:42:48.900 align:middle line:84%
So you get into a process
for weeks or months even

00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:52.504 align:middle line:84%
until everybody agrees that
we've hit the bottom of this.

00:42:52.504 --> 00:42:55.373 align:middle line:84%
We've got to the
core assumptions.

00:42:55.373 --> 00:42:57.509 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And that's
a big thing.

00:42:57.509 --> 00:43:00.178 align:middle line:84%
Assumptions, every
assumption has to be evaluated,

00:43:00.178 --> 00:43:03.248 align:middle line:84%
but not only that and torn
apart and restructured

00:43:03.248 --> 00:43:06.017 align:middle line:84%
because assumptions are at
the base of all dysfunction.

00:43:06.017 --> 00:43:08.219 align:middle line:90%
You have incorrect assumptions.

00:43:08.219 --> 00:43:10.355 align:middle line:84%
And in addition to that
you have people coming

00:43:10.355 --> 00:43:13.491 align:middle line:84%
and maybe running their
own agenda for maybe sort

00:43:13.491 --> 00:43:15.327 align:middle line:90%
of egoic or personal gain.

00:43:15.327 --> 00:43:17.629 align:middle line:90%
That's not going to work there.

00:43:17.629 --> 00:43:22.133 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: If you get the
group aligned spiritually

00:43:22.133 --> 00:43:25.337 align:middle line:84%
with one another, and
there needs to be exercises

00:43:25.337 --> 00:43:29.074 align:middle line:84%
and we have them in the
book of prayer together,

00:43:29.074 --> 00:43:33.178 align:middle line:84%
of energetic alignment so that
you don't have people acting

00:43:33.178 --> 00:43:35.480 align:middle line:90%
out egoically more or less.

00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:37.916 align:middle line:84%
But if somebody does
you call them on it.

00:43:37.916 --> 00:43:39.985 align:middle line:84%
So there are methods
for sort of --

00:43:39.985 --> 00:43:46.958 align:middle line:84%
facilitation methods of
collaborative deliberation

00:43:46.958 --> 00:43:50.996 align:middle line:84%
where you are honest with one
another because you've bonded

00:43:50.996 --> 00:43:52.964 align:middle line:90%
and so you can be honest.

00:43:52.964 --> 00:43:56.234 align:middle line:84%
So it should be a lot of fun
to meet with colleagues and get

00:43:56.234 --> 00:43:58.303 align:middle line:84%
to the bottom of what is
the issue with education.

00:43:58.303 --> 00:44:01.206 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: It's really
a pure kind of analysis.

00:44:01.206 --> 00:44:02.841 align:middle line:90%
It's not agenda driven other

00:44:02.841 --> 00:44:06.344 align:middle line:84%
than the agreed upon sole
agenda of the group, right?

00:44:06.344 --> 00:44:09.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: It's like everybody
becoming a Socratic philosopher

00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:09.881 align:middle line:90%
in a way.

00:44:09.881 --> 00:44:11.616 align:middle line:90%
It's pure in that sense.

00:44:11.616 --> 00:44:12.884 align:middle line:90%
We just have questions.

00:44:12.884 --> 00:44:14.185 align:middle line:90%
We don't have answer.

00:44:14.185 --> 00:44:15.553 align:middle line:90%
I may think I have answers.

00:44:15.553 --> 00:44:18.490 align:middle line:84%
I'll put them on the table, but
we're going to tear that up.

00:44:18.490 --> 00:44:21.026 align:middle line:90%
We're going to get below that,

00:44:21.026 --> 00:44:22.594 align:middle line:84%
and that's really
what philosophers do.

00:44:22.594 --> 00:44:25.563 align:middle line:84%
They get to the assumptions
underneath these conclusions.

00:44:25.563 --> 00:44:28.533 align:middle line:84%
And that's what a real
mature society does.

00:44:28.533 --> 00:44:30.135 align:middle line:84%
That's what Congress
should be doing.

00:44:30.135 --> 00:44:33.004 align:middle line:84%
Congress should be having
deliberative discussions

00:44:33.004 --> 00:44:36.508 align:middle line:84%
about the assumptions behind
all of these programs.

00:44:36.508 --> 00:44:38.777 align:middle line:84%
Instead it's at this
other level of just --

00:44:38.777 --> 00:44:40.812 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Oh, it's so broken
it's not even worth addressing.

00:44:40.812 --> 00:44:43.848 align:middle line:84%
It really does have to be
refashioned from the ground up.

00:44:43.848 --> 00:44:45.784 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: They don't
have true debates.

00:44:45.784 --> 00:44:47.185 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: No.

00:44:47.185 --> 00:44:48.753 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: Those committees
are just dominated by parties.

00:44:48.753 --> 00:44:49.621 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Absolutely.

00:44:49.621 --> 00:44:50.855 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: You
abolish parties.

00:44:50.855 --> 00:44:54.692 align:middle line:84%
You would have each
individual in the light of God

00:44:54.692 --> 00:44:57.462 align:middle line:84%
and the truth is
getting to the --

00:44:57.462 --> 00:45:00.799 align:middle line:84%
really like Socrates
asking the hard questions.

00:45:00.799 --> 00:45:02.300 align:middle line:90%
So every citizen being

00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:05.036 align:middle line:84%
like Socrates that's
an ideal society.

00:45:05.036 --> 00:45:06.705 align:middle line:90%
That's real civic participation.

00:45:06.705 --> 00:45:09.941 align:middle line:84%
And it's also fun to do
because I've done some of this.

00:45:09.941 --> 00:45:11.776 align:middle line:84%
And if it's something
you care about --

00:45:11.776 --> 00:45:12.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:45:12.610 --> 00:45:13.678 align:middle line:90%
No, to me it sounds exciting.

00:45:13.678 --> 00:45:15.747 align:middle line:84%
The process itself
sounds exciting.

00:45:15.747 --> 00:45:19.517 align:middle line:84%
And so as you have people
that are participating

00:45:19.517 --> 00:45:22.954 align:middle line:84%
in these various roles, first
of all you just ask questions,

00:45:22.954 --> 00:45:27.058 align:middle line:84%
and you get down to stripping
bear some incorrect assumptions

00:45:27.058 --> 00:45:29.794 align:middle line:84%
that have been creating a
dysfunctional environment,

00:45:29.794 --> 00:45:30.829 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:45:30.829 --> 00:45:31.930 align:middle line:90%
Then what?

00:45:31.930 --> 00:45:33.731 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: Also you're
out doing research.

00:45:33.731 --> 00:45:35.033 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And you're
out doing research.

00:45:35.033 --> 00:45:36.367 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: You're actually
reading the literature --

00:45:36.367 --> 00:45:37.669 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Your inquiring
minds are doing the research.

00:45:37.669 --> 00:45:40.305 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: The inquiring
group is doing the research.

00:45:40.305 --> 00:45:42.207 align:middle line:84%
Anybody can do research,
bring it to the table

00:45:42.207 --> 00:45:43.508 align:middle line:90%
and say this is what we know.

00:45:43.508 --> 00:45:45.076 align:middle line:84%
This is the data we
have from the Department

00:45:45.076 --> 00:45:47.212 align:middle line:90%
of Education right now.

00:45:47.212 --> 00:45:49.514 align:middle line:84%
This is the data we have
from the Oakland Department

00:45:49.514 --> 00:45:51.883 align:middle line:84%
of Education and here's
what we're facing here.

00:45:51.883 --> 00:45:54.319 align:middle line:84%
So you'd have that
in, the data has to be

00:45:54.319 --> 00:45:55.620 align:middle line:90%
in front of you as well.

00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:59.124 align:middle line:84%
Here are some other designs
that we've heard about.

00:45:59.124 --> 00:46:02.594 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at their designs.

00:46:02.594 --> 00:46:05.196 align:middle line:84%
So whatever you could
bring into --

00:46:05.196 --> 00:46:06.731 align:middle line:84%
your own experience
as a teacher.

00:46:06.731 --> 00:46:09.067 align:middle line:84%
Here's what I found
out as a teacher.

00:46:09.067 --> 00:46:14.005 align:middle line:84%
My kids were a mess because
some of them came in hungry.

00:46:14.005 --> 00:46:15.240 align:middle line:90%
You've got to deal with that.

00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:18.309 align:middle line:84%
We've got to make sure
kids are getting breakfast.

00:46:18.309 --> 00:46:19.711 align:middle line:84%
Real basic things
are brought in.

00:46:19.711 --> 00:46:23.615 align:middle line:84%
You just write this stuff all
up and have a lot of notes

00:46:23.615 --> 00:46:26.951 align:middle line:84%
until you get to -- when you're
ready, you don't know quite

00:46:26.951 --> 00:46:29.954 align:middle line:84%
when you're ready until
you're ready, when you know

00:46:29.954 --> 00:46:35.226 align:middle line:84%
that we can give a summary that
includes all three core values

00:46:35.226 --> 00:46:38.096 align:middle line:90%
of social sustainability.

00:46:38.096 --> 00:46:40.431 align:middle line:84%
That's called a validation
statement.

00:46:40.431 --> 00:46:42.767 align:middle line:84%
So those three that
we mentioned.

00:46:42.767 --> 00:46:45.637 align:middle line:84%
You actually write a validation
statement saying this is how

00:46:45.637 --> 00:46:48.640 align:middle line:84%
we're going to implement
this in each of these areas

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:52.944 align:middle line:84%
of education, all three all
at the same time in each case.

00:46:52.944 --> 00:46:55.814 align:middle line:84%
Can't just have two,
have to have all three.

00:46:55.814 --> 00:46:58.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And the ultimate
goal in this which I love,

00:46:58.550 --> 00:47:00.585 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's one of
my favorite topics,

00:47:00.585 --> 00:47:05.823 align:middle line:84%
is about taking humanity
back into an encouraging

00:47:05.823 --> 00:47:09.794 align:middle line:84%
and safe space where every
person's innate talents

00:47:09.794 --> 00:47:13.164 align:middle line:84%
and innate abilities and
capabilities no matter

00:47:13.164 --> 00:47:14.499 align:middle line:90%
who you are and what you bring

00:47:14.499 --> 00:47:20.238 align:middle line:84%
to the table everyone
has the support and right

00:47:20.238 --> 00:47:22.774 align:middle line:84%
to offer their talents
to the world.

00:47:22.774 --> 00:47:26.244 align:middle line:84%
If you're only capable of
doing one thing in life to do

00:47:26.244 --> 00:47:29.047 align:middle line:84%
that one thing well, and
that's what you want to do

00:47:29.047 --> 00:47:31.382 align:middle line:84%
as a human being, that's what
you should be able to bring

00:47:31.382 --> 00:47:33.585 align:middle line:90%
to your life and to the table.

00:47:33.585 --> 00:47:34.919 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: That's
a mature society.

00:47:34.919 --> 00:47:36.754 align:middle line:84%
That's where everybody
participates.

00:47:36.754 --> 00:47:40.091 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has access to
education and healthcare

00:47:40.091 --> 00:47:41.659 align:middle line:90%
and resources they need.

00:47:41.659 --> 00:47:44.128 align:middle line:84%
They can go to the bank and
get a loan and start a company.

00:47:44.128 --> 00:47:45.930 align:middle line:90%
Everybody can do that.

00:47:45.930 --> 00:47:51.002 align:middle line:84%
And so everyone, even if
they don't have a high IQ,

00:47:51.002 --> 00:47:54.739 align:middle line:84%
can fully get into
self-realization

00:47:54.739 --> 00:47:58.076 align:middle line:84%
and even spiritual
self- realization.

00:47:58.076 --> 00:48:00.311 align:middle line:84%
That's called a sustainable
society.

00:48:00.311 --> 00:48:04.649 align:middle line:84%
And the Urantia Book actually
shows you cases of other planets

00:48:04.649 --> 00:48:07.018 align:middle line:90%
that are socially sustainable.

00:48:07.018 --> 00:48:07.852 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Oh, interesting.

00:48:07.852 --> 00:48:08.519 align:middle line:90%
>> Belitsos: It describes them.

00:48:08.519 --> 00:48:09.153 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:48:09.153 --> 00:48:10.388 align:middle line:90%
>> Belitsos: Yeah.

00:48:10.388 --> 00:48:11.322 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Okay, now in this
process the one you left

00:48:11.322 --> 00:48:12.390 align:middle line:90%
out when you were talking

00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:15.827 align:middle line:84%
about the group members
is the consultant.

00:48:15.827 --> 00:48:19.797 align:middle line:84%
That's where it's different
than terrestrial groups,

00:48:19.797 --> 00:48:21.933 align:middle line:90%
just purely terrestrial groups.

00:48:21.933 --> 00:48:23.835 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: Thanks, Regina,
I'm glad you brought that up.

00:48:23.835 --> 00:48:25.737 align:middle line:84%
I have a little mental
block about that

00:48:25.737 --> 00:48:29.641 align:middle line:84%
because it's a little
controversial now even among our

00:48:29.641 --> 00:48:31.609 align:middle line:84%
own group that you
would bring in someone

00:48:31.609 --> 00:48:34.178 align:middle line:84%
that would transmit
these beings.

00:48:34.178 --> 00:48:38.416 align:middle line:84%
But that is what is requested
is that there be one more role

00:48:38.416 --> 00:48:42.186 align:middle line:84%
which we call the consultant
or the spiritual consultant.

00:48:42.186 --> 00:48:43.588 align:middle line:90%
It's very important actually.

00:48:43.588 --> 00:48:47.325 align:middle line:84%
So when the group gets stuck on
something or when we really have

00:48:47.325 --> 00:48:52.964 align:middle line:84%
to call somebody on their egoic
trip and you're really stuck,

00:48:52.964 --> 00:48:55.266 align:middle line:84%
you say, well, we've got
to turn to our consultant,

00:48:55.266 --> 00:48:59.704 align:middle line:84%
and that's somebody sitting
around the table with you.

00:48:59.704 --> 00:49:04.976 align:middle line:84%
Would you ask the celestial
who is working with us,

00:49:04.976 --> 00:49:07.578 align:middle line:84%
so you've implemented a
relationship with a celestial

00:49:07.578 --> 00:49:09.881 align:middle line:84%
for your team, and
they've got plenty of them,

00:49:09.881 --> 00:49:11.716 align:middle line:90%
they're not too busy for us.

00:49:11.716 --> 00:49:16.854 align:middle line:84%
So you request a celestial
angelic being to be able

00:49:16.854 --> 00:49:21.959 align:middle line:84%
to transmit through this
consultant, advice and wisdom

00:49:21.959 --> 00:49:25.196 align:middle line:90%
to get through these issues.

00:49:25.196 --> 00:49:26.297 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Stumbling
blocks, yeah.

00:49:26.297 --> 00:49:27.966 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: Stumbling
blocks of the group.

00:49:27.966 --> 00:49:30.134 align:middle line:90%
But if you're not comfortable

00:49:30.134 --> 00:49:32.470 align:middle line:84%
or if you can't find someone
that's clairvoyant enough

00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:36.741 align:middle line:84%
to do this then find somebody
that's wise that's respected

00:49:36.741 --> 00:49:41.045 align:middle line:84%
and has great intuition,
and let them be that role.

00:49:41.045 --> 00:49:44.449 align:middle line:84%
So they'll just tune into their
intuition, and they can be

00:49:44.449 --> 00:49:48.152 align:middle line:84%
that consultant to the
group to break through,

00:49:48.152 --> 00:49:50.355 align:middle line:84%
to make breakthroughs
where you can't get it

00:49:50.355 --> 00:49:52.690 align:middle line:84%
through rational
thought so to speak.

00:49:52.690 --> 00:49:54.092 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: And I like that idea.

00:49:54.092 --> 00:49:56.461 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed a man years ago,
Rob Williams [assumed spelling]

00:49:56.461 --> 00:50:01.933 align:middle line:84%
and again recently on Gaiam TV,
and he talks about corporations

00:50:01.933 --> 00:50:06.003 align:middle line:84%
because of the broken nature of
corporate America, each needing

00:50:06.003 --> 00:50:10.675 align:middle line:84%
to employ what he calls a
corporate Shamanic officer.

00:50:10.675 --> 00:50:14.579 align:middle line:84%
Someone who comes in that
always holds the largest view,

00:50:14.579 --> 00:50:18.316 align:middle line:84%
the most holistic view, and
that every decision that's made

00:50:18.316 --> 00:50:21.452 align:middle line:84%
in that corporation has to
be run through the wisdom

00:50:21.452 --> 00:50:24.856 align:middle line:84%
of that individual before
it can be implemented

00:50:24.856 --> 00:50:26.424 align:middle line:90%
which makes perfect sense.

00:50:26.424 --> 00:50:27.792 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: That's
the same idea.

00:50:27.792 --> 00:50:30.194 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And in a way it's
like in Israel in the Parliament

00:50:30.194 --> 00:50:33.931 align:middle line:84%
where they have the
seven generation factor

00:50:33.931 --> 00:50:36.667 align:middle line:84%
which when you're examining your
legislation you have to know

00:50:36.667 --> 00:50:40.405 align:middle line:84%
that it's sustainable for
seven generations out ideally,

00:50:40.405 --> 00:50:43.674 align:middle line:84%
I mean in an ideal
piece of legislation.

00:50:43.674 --> 00:50:46.644 align:middle line:84%
So this is, again, what
you're talking about in terms

00:50:46.644 --> 00:50:49.647 align:middle line:84%
of this long-term
social sustainability.

00:50:49.647 --> 00:50:52.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean what excites me about it
is you're talking about a planet

00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:55.319 align:middle line:84%
where people are alive and
doing what they want to do,

00:50:55.319 --> 00:50:57.722 align:middle line:90%
what they're talented at rather

00:50:57.722 --> 00:51:00.792 align:middle line:84%
than this ridiculous worker
bee species we've gotten

00:51:00.792 --> 00:51:02.126 align:middle line:90%
ourselves into.

00:51:02.126 --> 00:51:05.229 align:middle line:84%
Did the beings comment on that
at all, what we've become?

00:51:05.229 --> 00:51:06.564 align:middle line:90%
>> Belitsos: Oh, all the time.

00:51:06.564 --> 00:51:09.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Tell us what their
view of us is if they were

00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:13.004 align:middle line:84%
to look at us and, you
know, what we've become

00:51:13.004 --> 00:51:15.706 align:middle line:84%
when we are innately
so talented.

00:51:15.706 --> 00:51:18.142 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: Number
one unsustainable.

00:51:18.142 --> 00:51:21.012 align:middle line:84%
Number two heading
toward systemic collapse.

00:51:21.012 --> 00:51:25.349 align:middle line:84%
And the citizens are
oppressed in every direction,

00:51:25.349 --> 00:51:27.318 align:middle line:90%
financially but spiritually.

00:51:27.318 --> 00:51:28.886 align:middle line:90%
And they do comment a lot

00:51:28.886 --> 00:51:34.525 align:middle line:84%
about how spiritual practices
are undertaken on our planet

00:51:34.525 --> 00:51:37.628 align:middle line:84%
which they're stereotypical,
they're rigid.

00:51:37.628 --> 00:51:41.032 align:middle line:84%
People are not taught
free inquiry

00:51:41.032 --> 00:51:43.668 align:middle line:90%
into spirit, real meditation.

00:51:43.668 --> 00:51:49.207 align:middle line:84%
They actually teach
practices they call stillness.

00:51:49.207 --> 00:51:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And they'd like the whole
planet to sit still.

00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:53.644 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: I bet they would.

00:51:53.644 --> 00:51:55.213 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: And
listen to spirit.

00:51:55.213 --> 00:51:57.682 align:middle line:84%
And they continually
talk about that.

00:51:57.682 --> 00:52:00.051 align:middle line:84%
And they say if you don't do
that you really don't break

00:52:00.051 --> 00:52:04.055 align:middle line:84%
through the discursive
mind to the deeper places.

00:52:04.055 --> 00:52:05.389 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:52:05.389 --> 00:52:07.725 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: And it's very
important teaching in general,

00:52:07.725 --> 00:52:10.328 align:middle line:90%
not just in this connection.

00:52:10.328 --> 00:52:13.064 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's a deplorable
situation.

00:52:13.064 --> 00:52:17.768 align:middle line:84%
And other planets, with
the technology we have,

00:52:17.768 --> 00:52:21.339 align:middle line:84%
never have a technology
of this sophistication

00:52:21.339 --> 00:52:25.710 align:middle line:84%
and have whole continents
of people who are dying

00:52:25.710 --> 00:52:28.346 align:middle line:90%
and starving at the same time

00:52:28.346 --> 00:52:31.349 align:middle line:84%
and civil wars going
on all the time.

00:52:31.349 --> 00:52:32.984 align:middle line:90%
I mean they have a whole section

00:52:32.984 --> 00:52:35.319 align:middle line:84%
on abolition of war,
for example.

00:52:35.319 --> 00:52:40.725 align:middle line:84%
And I actually did a book on
that called One World Democracy

00:52:40.725 --> 00:52:44.595 align:middle line:84%
which talks about their system
of how do you abolish war.

00:52:44.595 --> 00:52:46.697 align:middle line:84%
And they all the time
point to the fact

00:52:46.697 --> 00:52:48.165 align:middle line:90%
of how can this continue.

00:52:48.165 --> 00:52:51.169 align:middle line:84%
I mean there will be a
nuclear conflagration.

00:52:51.169 --> 00:52:52.303 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:52:52.303 --> 00:52:54.639 align:middle line:84%
And it seems like
there's always an elegance

00:52:54.639 --> 00:52:57.608 align:middle line:84%
and really sublime
intelligence the way they seem

00:52:57.608 --> 00:53:00.478 align:middle line:84%
to position this
information to humanity.

00:53:00.478 --> 00:53:02.113 align:middle line:90%
It starts with the family, too.

00:53:02.113 --> 00:53:03.147 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk a little bit --

00:53:03.147 --> 00:53:05.149 align:middle line:84%
we have maybe ten
minutes or so left.

00:53:05.149 --> 00:53:08.085 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about when
you start with the family

00:53:08.085 --> 00:53:11.222 align:middle line:84%
and even pre-conception
what their view

00:53:11.222 --> 00:53:14.258 align:middle line:84%
of sustainability
really looks like.

00:53:14.258 --> 00:53:15.693 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: Yeah, they talk
a lot, there's a chapter

00:53:15.693 --> 00:53:19.163 align:middle line:84%
about the family and
how as a child comes

00:53:19.163 --> 00:53:21.866 align:middle line:84%
in there's consciousness
in each step.

00:53:21.866 --> 00:53:24.769 align:middle line:90%
So the couple really needs

00:53:24.769 --> 00:53:29.173 align:middle line:84%
to have training before
they're married in marriage.

00:53:29.173 --> 00:53:30.675 align:middle line:90%
And really they advocate

00:53:30.675 --> 00:53:33.077 align:middle line:84%
in Urantia Book also there
should be marriage certificates

00:53:33.077 --> 00:53:35.446 align:middle line:90%
which say I have been trained.

00:53:35.446 --> 00:53:39.850 align:middle line:84%
You're taught in schools that
are public schools in how

00:53:39.850 --> 00:53:43.154 align:middle line:84%
to be a couple and
how to be harmonious.

00:53:43.154 --> 00:53:47.458 align:middle line:84%
Also that the couple begin
to think even before marriage

00:53:47.458 --> 00:53:49.560 align:middle line:84%
and certainly after
marriage how they'd

00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:51.162 align:middle line:84%
like to really plan
their family.

00:53:51.162 --> 00:53:55.933 align:middle line:84%
It's family planning but with a
spiritual aspect to it as well.

00:53:55.933 --> 00:54:00.304 align:middle line:84%
We're bringing into the world
a cosmic citizen who is endowed

00:54:00.304 --> 00:54:03.274 align:middle line:90%
with divine attributes.

00:54:03.274 --> 00:54:05.343 align:middle line:90%
This is very precious.

00:54:05.343 --> 00:54:09.480 align:middle line:84%
How do we take this being and
bring them up year by year?

00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:12.883 align:middle line:84%
And actually in the text it
has how do we make sustainable

00:54:12.883 --> 00:54:15.186 align:middle line:90%
individuals, not just groups.

00:54:15.186 --> 00:54:16.988 align:middle line:84%
So a sustainable
child is this child

00:54:16.988 --> 00:54:20.091 align:middle line:84%
that has a well balanced
personality.

00:54:20.091 --> 00:54:24.328 align:middle line:84%
They're getting everything
they need when they need it.

00:54:24.328 --> 00:54:25.630 align:middle line:90%
The timing is critical

00:54:25.630 --> 00:54:27.732 align:middle line:84%
that they're giving
it at the right time.

00:54:27.732 --> 00:54:30.901 align:middle line:84%
So that's real true education
understands the timing

00:54:30.901 --> 00:54:35.373 align:middle line:84%
of how the psyche evolves,
how cognition evolves,

00:54:35.373 --> 00:54:36.707 align:middle line:90%
how the emotions evolve.

00:54:36.707 --> 00:54:37.808 align:middle line:84%
All these things
have to be done.

00:54:37.808 --> 00:54:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And the parents are
going to have

00:54:39.010 --> 00:54:41.212 align:middle line:84%
to be the implementors
for the most part.

00:54:41.212 --> 00:54:43.347 align:middle line:84%
So they have to have
some serious training

00:54:43.347 --> 00:54:45.082 align:middle line:84%
to create sustainable
individuals.

00:54:45.082 --> 00:54:49.220 align:middle line:84%
On advanced planets the parents
are doing the moral education.

00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:53.057 align:middle line:84%
You're not taking them outside
to Sunday school so much

00:54:53.057 --> 00:54:56.527 align:middle line:84%
which is under the sort of
oppressive church hierarchy

00:54:56.527 --> 00:55:00.531 align:middle line:84%
with rigid -- it's really
done freely by the parents.

00:55:00.531 --> 00:55:06.637 align:middle line:84%
And many families we know
from even in the Bible

00:55:06.637 --> 00:55:09.206 align:middle line:84%
that were high functioning
families,

00:55:09.206 --> 00:55:11.375 align:middle line:84%
but mainly we don't have
this and we don't understand.

00:55:11.375 --> 00:55:13.644 align:middle line:84%
And we're not conscious
about family life.

00:55:13.644 --> 00:55:16.414 align:middle line:84%
And this adds some elements
I've not heard before.

00:55:16.414 --> 00:55:17.581 align:middle line:84%
Actually I would
put it this way.

00:55:17.581 --> 00:55:19.283 align:middle line:90%
It brings everything together --

00:55:19.283 --> 00:55:20.818 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Give us a
hint of one or two.

00:55:20.818 --> 00:55:22.653 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: -- in one place
I've never quite seen it

00:55:22.653 --> 00:55:23.821 align:middle line:90%
that way.

00:55:23.821 --> 00:55:27.625 align:middle line:84%
It reminds me of
Ken Wilber's work

00:55:27.625 --> 00:55:30.594 align:middle line:84%
with all the different
lines of development.

00:55:30.594 --> 00:55:34.432 align:middle line:84%
You know there are basic
lines, emotional kinesthetic,

00:55:34.432 --> 00:55:40.004 align:middle line:84%
intellectual, spiritual lines
that have to develop in balance

00:55:40.004 --> 00:55:42.440 align:middle line:84%
in order to have the sustainable
individual and not somebody

00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:46.644 align:middle line:84%
who is going to end up as
an egomaniac or depressive

00:55:46.644 --> 00:55:48.879 align:middle line:84%
or dismissing something
that's important in life.

00:55:48.879 --> 00:55:51.482 align:middle line:84%
Certain emotional
development is arrested.

00:55:51.482 --> 00:55:54.618 align:middle line:84%
That's not sustainable because
eventually they're going

00:55:54.618 --> 00:55:56.387 align:middle line:90%
to have disease.

00:55:56.387 --> 00:55:58.355 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Disease on
a number of levels.

00:55:58.355 --> 00:56:00.825 align:middle line:84%
One thing I've noticed
even in the Waldorf system,

00:56:00.825 --> 00:56:03.260 align:middle line:84%
Rudolph Steiner's
anthroposophical method

00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:07.565 align:middle line:84%
of education was the thing that
came first was that you were

00:56:07.565 --> 00:56:11.235 align:middle line:84%
to develop your creativity and
your confidence with each other.

00:56:11.235 --> 00:56:14.605 align:middle line:84%
And if you've been in a
Waldorf school the kindergartens

00:56:14.605 --> 00:56:16.841 align:middle line:84%
in particular everybody
wants to go back

00:56:16.841 --> 00:56:18.843 align:middle line:84%
to kindergarten once you
see a Waldorf kindergarten.

00:56:18.843 --> 00:56:21.879 align:middle line:84%
I mean this is a
fairyland, a paradise.

00:56:21.879 --> 00:56:23.414 align:middle line:90%
There are no computers there.

00:56:23.414 --> 00:56:25.216 align:middle line:84%
There's nobody pushing
you to learn math

00:56:25.216 --> 00:56:26.751 align:middle line:90%
at that stage of the game.

00:56:26.751 --> 00:56:31.822 align:middle line:84%
It's not so much inward
as outward expression.

00:56:31.822 --> 00:56:36.727 align:middle line:84%
And what these little kids do
with each other is to me amazing

00:56:36.727 --> 00:56:39.864 align:middle line:84%
because creativity
always comes first.

00:56:39.864 --> 00:56:42.233 align:middle line:90%
It precedes all other learning.

00:56:42.233 --> 00:56:45.436 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to me what you're
saying in this to be able

00:56:45.436 --> 00:56:49.406 align:middle line:84%
to give that beautiful
environment

00:56:49.406 --> 00:56:53.711 align:middle line:84%
to a child is the very thing,
they need to have the permission

00:56:53.711 --> 00:56:56.046 align:middle line:84%
to start expressing
themselves without fear.

00:56:56.046 --> 00:56:57.548 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's something
that doesn't make sense.

00:56:57.548 --> 00:57:00.851 align:middle line:84%
Instead of by the time you're in
kindergarten training them to go

00:57:00.851 --> 00:57:03.187 align:middle line:84%
on to this private
school, that private school

00:57:03.187 --> 00:57:05.322 align:middle line:84%
so you can get a job as
an engineer or something.

00:57:05.322 --> 00:57:08.459 align:middle line:90%
Ick. That's not life.

00:57:08.459 --> 00:57:09.627 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: That's
what you would do

00:57:09.627 --> 00:57:11.562 align:middle line:84%
in a social sustainability
design team looking

00:57:11.562 --> 00:57:12.663 align:middle line:90%
at education.

00:57:12.663 --> 00:57:16.033 align:middle line:84%
Let's take Steiner's
philosophy of education.

00:57:16.033 --> 00:57:17.835 align:middle line:84%
What are the assumptions
under that?

00:57:17.835 --> 00:57:20.671 align:middle line:84%
Is creativity really the key
thing we need at this age?

00:57:20.671 --> 00:57:22.106 align:middle line:90%
Is he right about this?

00:57:22.106 --> 00:57:23.307 align:middle line:90%
Let's go deeper.

00:57:23.307 --> 00:57:25.743 align:middle line:84%
Let's compare that to
Piaje's [phonetic] system

00:57:25.743 --> 00:57:30.447 align:middle line:84%
or some other system
and put it all together.

00:57:30.447 --> 00:57:34.018 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they're
saying is there's a lot

00:57:34.018 --> 00:57:37.021 align:middle line:84%
of great information but it's
not been put together according

00:57:37.021 --> 00:57:38.289 align:middle line:90%
to the three criteria.

00:57:38.289 --> 00:57:39.657 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:57:39.657 --> 00:57:40.991 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: And so they're
simplifying it with something

00:57:40.991 --> 00:57:42.827 align:middle line:90%
to focus your mind around.

00:57:42.827 --> 00:57:45.196 align:middle line:84%
When you get to the
three and you feel it

00:57:45.196 --> 00:57:48.933 align:middle line:84%
and you sense it then write
this validation statement.

00:57:48.933 --> 00:57:51.435 align:middle line:84%
And that sounds kind of
odd that this is all going

00:57:51.435 --> 00:57:52.603 align:middle line:84%
to just come down
to a statement.

00:57:52.603 --> 00:57:53.737 align:middle line:90%
Did you get it right?

00:57:53.737 --> 00:57:55.005 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it is.

00:57:55.005 --> 00:57:58.108 align:middle line:84%
Because the validation
statement goes with your design

00:57:58.108 --> 00:58:01.111 align:middle line:84%
to the database,
this global database.

00:58:01.111 --> 00:58:04.582 align:middle line:84%
And people are going to read
your validation statement

00:58:04.582 --> 00:58:06.483 align:middle line:84%
and say, you know, I don't
think that's quite right.

00:58:06.483 --> 00:58:08.586 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to redo this.

00:58:08.586 --> 00:58:09.987 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take
all their data,

00:58:09.987 --> 00:58:12.523 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take the Steiner
stuff and all this other stuff,

00:58:12.523 --> 00:58:17.761 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to do a
better version of a design

00:58:17.761 --> 00:58:19.997 align:middle line:84%
of an elementary
school, and I'm going

00:58:19.997 --> 00:58:21.165 align:middle line:90%
to put that in the database.

00:58:21.165 --> 00:58:22.233 align:middle line:84%
So when you go to the
database you're going

00:58:22.233 --> 00:58:24.935 align:middle line:90%
to see a bunch of designs.

00:58:24.935 --> 00:58:29.006 align:middle line:84%
And over time cross-culturally
there will be a

00:58:29.006 --> 00:58:30.574 align:middle line:90%
validated design.

00:58:30.574 --> 00:58:32.509 align:middle line:90%
That's the idea of this.

00:58:32.509 --> 00:58:34.745 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So we only have
a couple minutes left.

00:58:34.745 --> 00:58:35.913 align:middle line:90%
We have this little graph.

00:58:35.913 --> 00:58:37.915 align:middle line:84%
It's basically the
schematic of how it works.

00:58:37.915 --> 00:58:39.216 align:middle line:90%
So if you can run through that

00:58:39.216 --> 00:58:41.652 align:middle line:84%
in a couple minutes before
we wrap that would be great.

00:58:41.652 --> 00:58:44.355 align:middle line:84%
See how this looks, how it
works, how it functions.

00:58:44.355 --> 00:58:45.723 align:middle line:90%
>> Belitsos: Okay.

00:58:45.723 --> 00:58:47.758 align:middle line:84%
Well, walking through that grid
there's a part we didn't get

00:58:47.758 --> 00:58:49.426 align:middle line:90%
to so I'll get to that.

00:58:49.426 --> 00:58:50.761 align:middle line:84%
So you have the three
principles.

00:58:50.761 --> 00:58:52.096 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:58:52.096 --> 00:58:55.299 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: You have the
value that that principle is.

00:58:55.299 --> 00:58:56.901 align:middle line:84%
Then you have a belief
that's based

00:58:56.901 --> 00:58:58.702 align:middle line:84%
on the principle
which is obvious.

00:58:58.702 --> 00:59:01.739 align:middle line:84%
If you believe in the value of
education you have a belief.

00:59:01.739 --> 00:59:04.241 align:middle line:84%
Well, my belief is
everybody should go

00:59:04.241 --> 00:59:06.377 align:middle line:90%
to Steiner type education.

00:59:06.377 --> 00:59:07.778 align:middle line:90%
That's your belief.

00:59:07.778 --> 00:59:10.814 align:middle line:84%
Then you have two more things
that are in this schematic.

00:59:10.814 --> 00:59:14.485 align:middle line:84%
One is what would you
expect at a Steiner school?

00:59:14.485 --> 00:59:15.786 align:middle line:90%
Let's map that out.

00:59:15.786 --> 00:59:19.023 align:middle line:84%
And then how do we
measure that this works.

00:59:19.023 --> 00:59:22.092 align:middle line:84%
So you need to have some
empirical scientific data,

00:59:22.092 --> 00:59:23.627 align:middle line:90%
actually measure these kids.

00:59:23.627 --> 00:59:24.895 align:middle line:90%
Do intelligence tests,

00:59:24.895 --> 00:59:28.732 align:middle line:84%
do various cognitive
tests and emotional tests.

00:59:28.732 --> 00:59:31.435 align:middle line:84%
And those measurable
outcomes are

00:59:31.435 --> 00:59:33.070 align:middle line:84%
in this schematic
for a good reason.

00:59:33.070 --> 00:59:34.038 align:middle line:90%
And this is scientific.

00:59:34.038 --> 00:59:34.838 align:middle line:90%
This is not just a [inaudible].

00:59:34.838 --> 00:59:35.906 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:59:35.906 --> 00:59:37.274 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: So the
schematic takes you

00:59:37.274 --> 00:59:40.377 align:middle line:84%
through every single belief
that you have about education.

00:59:40.377 --> 00:59:41.612 align:middle line:84%
You could line them
up, there might be ten.

00:59:41.612 --> 00:59:44.682 align:middle line:84%
So you have to go
across and down.

00:59:44.682 --> 00:59:49.186 align:middle line:84%
The across has the value then
the belief, the core belief,

00:59:49.186 --> 00:59:53.924 align:middle line:84%
then the expected outcome,
and then the measured outcome.

00:59:53.924 --> 00:59:56.160 align:middle line:84%
Then you write your validation
statement to go with that.

00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:59.863 align:middle line:84%
So you're filing the
validation discursive statement

00:59:59.863 --> 01:00:02.099 align:middle line:90%
with this schematic together

01:00:02.099 --> 01:00:04.735 align:middle line:84%
in the database for
the whole planet.

01:00:04.735 --> 01:00:06.537 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: It's well
thought out.

01:00:06.537 --> 01:00:09.039 align:middle line:90%
And with that we're out of time.

01:00:09.039 --> 01:00:12.142 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank you so
much for teasing us also

01:00:12.142 --> 01:00:14.345 align:middle line:84%
with a little bit of what
else is in the Urantia Book.

01:00:14.345 --> 01:00:16.413 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure a lot of people
find it fascinating.

01:00:16.413 --> 01:00:18.782 align:middle line:90%
Very, very useful strategy.

01:00:18.782 --> 01:00:19.817 align:middle line:90%
Beautifully done.

01:00:19.817 --> 01:00:20.451 align:middle line:84%
>> Belitsos: My privilege
to be here.

01:00:20.451 --> 01:00:21.285 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Regina.

01:00:21.285 --> 01:00:22.386 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Thank you.

01:00:22.386 --> 01:00:25.022 align:middle line:84%
I have no problem with
using unseen beings

01:00:25.022 --> 01:00:25.856 align:middle line:90%
and making decisions.

01:00:25.856 --> 01:00:26.991 align:middle line:90%
I do it all the time.

01:00:26.991 --> 01:00:29.626 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps we need to bring
the conversation to more

01:00:29.626 --> 01:00:32.029 align:middle line:84%
of an expanded view
of consultants,

01:00:32.029 --> 01:00:34.531 align:middle line:84%
bring that center stage to
bring the greatest clarity

01:00:34.531 --> 01:00:36.834 align:middle line:84%
to our most important
conversations.

01:00:36.834 --> 01:00:39.470 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile you can find out the
rest of the story by picking

01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:41.605 align:middle line:84%
up a copy of Healing
a Broken World,

01:00:41.605 --> 01:00:43.674 align:middle line:84%
or the big one, the
Urantia Book.

01:00:43.674 --> 01:00:47.644 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
