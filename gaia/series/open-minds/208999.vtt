>>THERESA CHEUNG:
Dreams are a portal.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.070 align:middle line:84%
They're the first step
to awakening people

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.770 align:middle line:84%
to this incredible world
of mind, body, spirit.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:17.270 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is random.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.660 align:middle line:84%
Your dreaming mind is
super, super clever.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.700 align:middle line:84%
I have a theory that
the reason we sleep

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.560 align:middle line:84%
is because we urgently
need to dream.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.620 align:middle line:84%
Our dreams are a nocturnal
therapist and far cheaper

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:28.685 align:middle line:90%
than a real one.

00:00:28.685 --> 00:00:30.560 align:middle line:84%
The theory of relativity,
the speed of light,

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.400 align:middle line:84%
all inspired by a dream, the
periodic table, a dream, even

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.480 align:middle line:90%
Google.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's become a creativity
hack within Hollywood

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.470 align:middle line:90%
now, dreamwork.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.980 align:middle line:84%
When we have a nightmare, it's
kind of your dreaming mind

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.720 align:middle line:90%
sending tough love.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.200 align:middle line:84%
I think all dreams have a
hint about a potential future

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.295 align:middle line:90%
there for you.

00:00:49.295 --> 00:00:51.170 align:middle line:84%
All the things that you
watched on television

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.045 align:middle line:84%
and all the things that
happened in your day,

00:00:53.045 --> 00:00:56.630 align:middle line:84%
why does your dreaming mind
hone in on one particular thing?

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.959 align:middle line:90%


00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:02.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Everyone dreams,

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.379 align:middle line:84%
though many don't
know that because they

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.670 align:middle line:90%
can't remember their dreams.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.410 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, after
this conversation,

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.720 align:middle line:84%
you will begin to use your
dreams for what they really

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.290 align:middle line:84%
are intended-- to help us
refine our waking life.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.030 align:middle line:10%
Theresa Cheung is
here with us today

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.390 align:middle line:10%
from London to share a wealth
of her user-friendly information

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.760 align:middle line:10%
on dreaming from her books
"Night Vision" and "The Dream

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.560 align:middle line:10%
Dictionary."

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.440 align:middle line:10%
And this is-- oh,
this is a tome.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.482 align:middle line:90%
And you say this is 1/3--

00:01:26.482 --> 00:01:27.282 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yeah.

00:01:27.282 --> 00:01:29.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --of the
weight it started out as.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.020 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.170 align:middle line:90%
You're a productive lady.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.760 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Theresa.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.468 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Who says
dreams don't come true

00:01:34.468 --> 00:01:36.760 align:middle line:84%
because I have actually
dreamed that this would happen?

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That you'd be here?

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Yeah, precognitive
element, and here I am.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing my reality
checks, counting my fingers,

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.120 align:middle line:90%
pinching myself.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.385 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Here in America
at Gaia on set together.

00:01:47.385 --> 00:01:48.800 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: I'm so
excited, Regina.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.050 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for the opportunity.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, this is wonderful.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say, I read
the book "Night Vision,"

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.890 align:middle line:84%
and compiled a lot of
these notes based on it.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.010 align:middle line:84%
And, oh my god, I've been
telling everyone about it

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.580 align:middle line:84%
because, not only is it just
a really good, user-friendly,

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.330 align:middle line:84%
practical, let's get right
to it and without bogging us

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.580 align:middle line:84%
down with too much
science, but just enough,

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.530 align:middle line:90%
but it's stunningly beautiful.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.260 align:middle line:84%
Who's the artist that
illustrated that?

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.260 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: LÃ©a Chassagne.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.060 align:middle line:10%
And as I said,
there's a funny story

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.368 align:middle line:10%
because she's a
beautiful French artist.

00:02:21.368 --> 00:02:23.160 align:middle line:10%
But when I first saw
all the illustrations,

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.590 align:middle line:10%
there were so much erotic
element, and nipples,

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.570 align:middle line:10%
and everything that we had
to tone that down a bit.

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.560 align:middle line:10%
But people do dream
with their clothes on.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.560 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you did.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.540 align:middle line:84%
Yes, people do dream
with their clothes on.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, you toned down a
little bit of the French.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.000 align:middle line:84%
There's still beautiful nude
scenes and other scenes,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.520 align:middle line:84%
but it's the artistry, and
the color, and the whimsy.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.410 align:middle line:84%
It takes you into dream
world just looking

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.950 align:middle line:90%
at the pictures of dream world.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.860 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to
say, well done.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.240 align:middle line:84%
What a
beautifully-produced book.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.670 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Thank you.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:49.100 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's go into
dreaming a little bit,

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.280 align:middle line:84%
and you as a little kid, and why
your dharma really became about

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.540 align:middle line:90%
dreaming, for the most part--

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look at what you've
done here, all these books

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.570 align:middle line:84%
you've written--
but also paranormal.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.765 align:middle line:84%
So tell us a little bit
about the little Theresa.

00:03:03.765 --> 00:03:06.720 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: The little Theresa was
born into a family of psychics

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.240 align:middle line:84%
and spiritualists, so it
was commonplace for me

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.030 align:middle line:84%
every morning to dream
decode with my family.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.070 align:middle line:84%
It was commonplace to
go to meetings where

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.320 align:middle line:90%
people spoke to dead people.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.010 align:middle line:84%
It was commonplace to consult
astrology charts, numerology.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And so I just grew up in that
kind of traveling environment

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.240 align:middle line:84%
where it was the norm that
the invisible world was real.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.310 align:middle line:84%
However, I was home
educated as well.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.040 align:middle line:90%
And somehow-- I don't know.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.570 align:middle line:90%
Something's looking out for me--

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.910 align:middle line:84%
I managed to get a place
at King's College Cambridge

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.190 align:middle line:84%
University to read
theology and religion.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.700 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, when I
went into that heavy academic

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.650 align:middle line:84%
environment, I realized that not
everybody has the same trusting

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.880 align:middle line:84%
face and faith that there
is an invisible world.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:49.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.560 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: So I really went
through a coming of age where I

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.090 align:middle line:84%
was forced to look
at all my beliefs,

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.780 align:middle line:84%
analyze them academically,
scientifically

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.300 align:middle line:84%
because that's the environment
I was in at Cambridge,

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.550 align:middle line:90%
and to understand--

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.980 align:middle line:84%
try to understand my
childhood, really,

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.340 align:middle line:84%
and all these dreams
I'd had, and intuitions.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.570 align:middle line:84%
And that led to my career of
writing close to 100 books

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.360 align:middle line:84%
in this area, where I try to
bring in the academic as well

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.288 align:middle line:90%
as the scientific.

00:04:16.288 --> 00:04:17.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You do.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.517 align:middle line:84%
You do a wonderful
job blending it

00:04:18.517 --> 00:04:20.760 align:middle line:84%
without bogging the viewer
down because everyone

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.580 align:middle line:84%
has different proclivities
in terms of their attractions

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:24.480 align:middle line:90%
to these subjects.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.090 align:middle line:84%
Some really want to drill
down into the evidence

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.230 align:middle line:90%
and science behind it.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:29.687 align:middle line:84%
Others want the
experience of it.

00:04:29.687 --> 00:04:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And you, I thought, blended
it really beautifully.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's true that
the art does serve

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.040 align:middle line:90%
as a bridge between these two.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.400 align:middle line:84%
So you guys got the
perfect formula on this.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.610 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: That's why
footnotes are great.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.620 align:middle line:84%
You just do a
little footnote, so

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.290 align:middle line:84%
if people want to go further to
find the research behind it--

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:44.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: --they
can follow that way.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.850 align:middle line:84%
But then they can still have the
narrative thread in the book.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:48.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And you said you've
written over 100 books.

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.480 align:middle line:84%
That means, to me, do
you get any REM sleep?

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.943 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:55.943 --> 00:04:57.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: It's just
basically what I do.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:58.740 align:middle line:90%
It's become who I am.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.010 align:middle line:90%
I don't know any other way.

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.430 align:middle line:84%
I think I was born into
that family for a reason.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.200 align:middle line:84%
I went to Cambridge
for a reason.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's to kind of
mainstream these ideas

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.180 align:middle line:90%
about mind, body, and spirit.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.100 align:middle line:84%
And I'm quite interesting
because I wouldn't

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.880 align:middle line:84%
say that I'm psychic myself
or have mediumistic abilities,

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.090 align:middle line:84%
although I know and love
many people who have those.

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.720 align:middle line:84%
I think my mission has been to
research it, try and understand

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.320 align:middle line:84%
how this can be possible, to
look at the science behind it,

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.317 align:middle line:84%
and to then present
the evidence to people

00:05:28.317 --> 00:05:29.400 align:middle line:90%
to make their own mind up.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And I do that often by
collecting stories, so

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.070 align:middle line:84%
many people because I've
been around so long.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.475 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure somebody's got a
Theresa Cheung book somewhere.

00:05:37.475 --> 00:05:39.933 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You don't look like
you've been around that long.

00:05:39.933 --> 00:05:42.550 align:middle line:84%
But you have by evidence of
all these books you've written.

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:43.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yes.

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:44.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.050 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you wrote
something in this book,

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.160 align:middle line:90%
and I picked up on this.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.710 align:middle line:84%
And I thought we'd just
start with a little touch.

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.070 align:middle line:84%
It says the more intensively
we dream eyes shut,

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:57.660 align:middle line:84%
the more vibrant our
lives are while eyes open.

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.772 align:middle line:84%
Now, what does that--
what why is that?

00:05:59.772 --> 00:06:00.605 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:06:00.605 --> 00:06:02.272 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Well, we
don't actually sleep.

00:06:02.272 --> 00:06:05.400 align:middle line:84%
We think we do, but
our brains remain awake

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.720 align:middle line:90%
in that dream state.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And our waking and our dream
life are intimately connected.

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.750 align:middle line:90%
The one reflects the other.

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.940 align:middle line:84%
So how you behave
in your waking life

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.620 align:middle line:84%
is going to be reflected
in your dreams,

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.210 align:middle line:84%
and your dreams will
impact your waking life.

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.800 align:middle line:84%
So if you're having really
vivid, vibrant, insightful

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.690 align:middle line:84%
dreams, that's going to have a
knock-on effect in your waking

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:26.490 align:middle line:90%
life.

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.698 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm trying to say
is sometimes the best place

00:06:28.698 --> 00:06:29.880 align:middle line:90%
to start is the inside out.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.350 align:middle line:90%
Start with your dream life.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:34.860 align:middle line:84%
Get this really exciting,
adventurous dream world,

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.110 align:middle line:84%
and you will notice
in your waking life

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.290 align:middle line:84%
that your confidence soars,
your observational skills

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:41.760 align:middle line:90%
sore, everything.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.600 align:middle line:84%
You become more fascinated
by the person you are.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.510 align:middle line:84%
You realize that there's
more to you than the material

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.310 align:middle line:90%
because that's what dreams are.

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:54.150 align:middle line:84%
Where do we go, this magical
playground every night?

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:55.650 align:middle line:90%
Where do we go?

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.632 align:middle line:84%
Science still doesn't
know for sure.

00:06:58.632 --> 00:07:00.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is true.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.570 align:middle line:84%
Now you talk about
this a lot, and it just

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:06.110 align:middle line:84%
struck me to bring this
up because you wonder--

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:07.670 align:middle line:84%
in fact, I'm going
to ask you, so you

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:10.970 align:middle line:84%
can-- if you're allowed to speak
about it-- so you were recently

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:12.140 align:middle line:90%
on Russell Brand's show.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.970 align:middle line:84%
A couple of years ago, you
were on Russell Brand's show.

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:15.345 align:middle line:84%
And that was quite
a trip for you

00:07:15.345 --> 00:07:17.323 align:middle line:84%
to go to his estate
and all of that.

00:07:17.323 --> 00:07:18.740 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm
wondering is here you

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:22.640 align:middle line:84%
have someone like Russell, who's
so intense, also so funny, so

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.640 align:middle line:84%
private, so boom,
so much of him.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.740 align:middle line:84%
What kind of dreams
does Russell have?

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Well, we had a
segment about dreams actually

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:32.420 align:middle line:84%
on his podcast "Under
the Skin," and he

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.310 align:middle line:84%
said he only has
nightmares, which

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:36.233 align:middle line:90%
I found very, very revealing.

00:07:36.233 --> 00:07:37.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
the next question

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:38.300 align:middle line:90%
I was going to ask you.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:39.200 align:middle line:90%
This is perfect.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.370 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:42.260 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Well, I mean,
nightmares or Russell

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:43.700 align:middle line:90%
Brand because there's stories?

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:44.245 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Both.

00:07:44.245 --> 00:07:45.045 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Both.

00:07:45.045 --> 00:07:46.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, Russell Brand,
this was, really,

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:49.160 align:middle line:84%
one of my first major
celebrity interviews.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.950 align:middle line:84%
I did it a couple of years
ago because of the explosion

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:55.242 align:middle line:84%
of interest in dreaming that
the pandemic has unleashed

00:07:55.242 --> 00:07:57.200 align:middle line:84%
because so many people
were having vivid dreams

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.280 align:middle line:90%
during the lockdown.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.980 align:middle line:10%
But this was just before
the lockdown, and Russell--

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:02.322 align:middle line:10%
something about my book--

00:08:02.322 --> 00:08:04.280 align:middle line:10%
I'd written a book with
a neuroscientist called

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:07.100 align:middle line:10%
"The Premonition Code," which
is about precognitive dreaming.

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.420 align:middle line:90%
It piqued his interest.

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:10.730 align:middle line:84%
I live fairly close
to him in the UK.

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:12.110 align:middle line:90%
Off I went to his studio.

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:14.750 align:middle line:84%
Met this amazing
celebrity, and then we're

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:15.830 align:middle line:90%
suddenly in the studio.

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:17.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
humorous interview

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:19.880 align:middle line:84%
actually because
he's kind of going

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.820 align:middle line:84%
at it from the science and
the skeptical point of view.

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm sort of saying,
well, I believe,

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:28.157 align:middle line:84%
in quoting Patrick Swayze
from "Ghost," I have no idea.

00:08:28.157 --> 00:08:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And by the end of the
interview, we actually

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:31.430 align:middle line:90%
really are on the same page.

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:33.830 align:middle line:84%
It's a lovely journey
of an interview.

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:35.960 align:middle line:84%
But the section about
dreams, we talk about it,

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.789 align:middle line:84%
and he says he doesn't like
dreaming because he only

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:38.589 align:middle line:90%
has nightmares.

00:08:38.589 --> 00:08:39.950 align:middle line:90%
So I'll go into nightmares.

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:42.350 align:middle line:84%
Nightmares are
transformative gifts

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:44.690 align:middle line:84%
because when we
have a nightmare,

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:47.600 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of your dreaming
mind sending tough love

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.870 align:middle line:84%
because the gentle other
non-nightmare dreams haven't

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:51.800 align:middle line:90%
got through.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.450 align:middle line:84%
The message hasn't
got through, so they

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:56.263 align:middle line:84%
need to send you shocking
content to wake you up.

00:08:56.263 --> 00:08:58.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, it's sort of
like a-- many people I've

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:00.530 align:middle line:84%
interviewed had to have
a near-death experience,

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:02.330 align:middle line:84%
get into a car
accident or something,

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:05.100 align:middle line:84%
to awaken their abilities
or to recognize them.

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.075 align:middle line:84%
So this is the version of that
at night where you're dreaming.

00:09:08.075 --> 00:09:08.875 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:09:08.875 --> 00:09:10.042 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: I say in my books.

00:09:10.042 --> 00:09:12.830 align:middle line:84%
Our dreams are a nocturnal
therapist and far cheaper

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:14.000 align:middle line:90%
than a real one.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.720 align:middle line:84%
Every night we have this
self-healing process going on,

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.340 align:middle line:84%
where our dreaming
mind is sending us,

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:22.580 align:middle line:84%
through language of symbols
and metaphors, images for us

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:26.270 align:middle line:84%
to brainstorm about ways to
improve, and heal, and move

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:27.650 align:middle line:90%
forward in our waking life.

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:29.870 align:middle line:84%
If only we realize
the priceless gift

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:31.970 align:middle line:84%
that we've got there
every single night,

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:34.830 align:middle line:84%
and nightmares are important
because we meet our shadow

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:35.630 align:middle line:90%
side.

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:36.547 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:09:36.547 --> 00:09:38.630 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: And our shadow
side is very important

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:40.400 align:middle line:84%
because most of us
in our waking life

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.270 align:middle line:90%
like to repress or deny that.

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:44.390 align:middle line:84%
However, just as
there's day and night,

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:46.790 align:middle line:84%
there's shadow and
light within us all.

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And we have to face
that, understand it,

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.210 align:middle line:84%
love it, and then
in our waking life,

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:56.480 align:middle line:84%
know that the potential to be
toxic and negative is within us

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:59.870 align:middle line:84%
but have the moral courage to
choose to do the right thing.

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:03.080 align:middle line:84%
It's that wonderful quote
about that story about the two

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.320 align:middle line:84%
wolves within us, one that's
compassionate, and loving,

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:09.002 align:middle line:84%
and kind and the other
that is toxic and negative.

00:10:09.002 --> 00:10:11.210 align:middle line:84%
And the little boy asks the
elder of the tribe, well,

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:12.770 align:middle line:90%
which wolf wins this battle?

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And the elder says, well,
the one you choose to feed.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.990 align:middle line:84%
So nightmares are
showing us that side,

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:20.930 align:middle line:84%
saying you've got it within
you so that when you wake up,

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:23.000 align:middle line:90%
choose the right thing.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.410 align:middle line:90%
That's real moral courage.

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:26.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
the best explanation

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:28.310 align:middle line:84%
I've ever heard about
it because when I do

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:30.260 align:middle line:84%
think of that corollary
of daytime hours--

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.690 align:middle line:84%
and so many people
I've interviewed here

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:34.940 align:middle line:84%
have gone through these
really rough experiences--

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:36.650 align:middle line:84%
and then I woke up
and realized what

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:38.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm supposed to do
and to see that that's

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:42.590 align:middle line:84%
accessible to everyone every
day if they do have nightmares.

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:45.320 align:middle line:84%
And this is on kind
of a sliding scale.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.938 align:middle line:84%
There are nightmares, and then
there are nightmares, you know?

00:10:47.938 --> 00:10:49.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: And nightmares,
it's safe as well

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:51.480 align:middle line:84%
because, obviously,
with our shadow side,

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.260 align:middle line:84%
we can't go around cheating,
and lying, and murdering,

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.990 align:middle line:84%
and being serial
killers in our--

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:58.490 align:middle line:84%
you've got to
respect other people.

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:01.770 align:middle line:84%
But we can safely role play,
get it all out of our system.

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:03.020 align:middle line:90%
It's very cathartic.

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:06.620 align:middle line:84%
In the nightmare, you can be the
most toxic version of yourself,

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:08.990 align:middle line:84%
understand it, know
that-- and also

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:11.360 align:middle line:84%
kind of try to understand
why it's there.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.960 align:middle line:84%
And I call it the golden shadow,
where you heal and embrace

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.780 align:middle line:84%
that part of you as well,
because sometimes our shadow

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:20.840 align:middle line:84%
side does force us
to grow and evolve

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.930 align:middle line:84%
because if we're always
blissful and always harmonious,

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:25.970 align:middle line:84%
growth doesn't tend
to happen there.

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:28.340 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we need
to get comfortable

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:31.530 align:middle line:84%
being uncomfortable because
that makes us evolve.

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think from
all the research

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:37.160 align:middle line:84%
I've done, that the meaning
of our lives is to evolve.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with you.

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:38.840 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And everyone's on a
different trajectory,

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:43.370 align:middle line:84%
and it takes a different
stimuli for each person

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:46.850 align:middle line:84%
to be able to accomplish
that, and the willingness

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:48.920 align:middle line:84%
to embrace it, take it
on, and learn from it.

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.200 align:middle line:84%
So often, these gifts
are just floating by,

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.190 align:middle line:90%
and we don't see them.

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:52.550 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yes.

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I was going
to tell you something funny

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:55.140 align:middle line:90%
because it's on my mind.

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:57.620 align:middle line:84%
It's a dream I had just
before waking up this morning.

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:00.770 align:middle line:84%
And it was-- and I would love
for you to play with it a bit

00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:02.930 align:middle line:84%
because I think it
can be interpreted

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:05.810 align:middle line:84%
a couple of different ways,
right, in terms of the psyche.

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:08.120 align:middle line:84%
So I'll make it
brief, but we have

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.360 align:middle line:84%
a birth coming in our
family, a new little nephew.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.670 align:middle line:84%
My sister's child,
the son, and his wife

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:16.205 align:middle line:84%
are having a baby soon,
so that must have been

00:12:16.205 --> 00:12:17.330 align:middle line:90%
what was in the background.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:20.330 align:middle line:84%
So the baby's here,
and the baby's

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:21.920 align:middle line:90%
being held by his grandfather.

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:26.120 align:middle line:84%
And his grandfather has this
spiky, punky gray hair, right?

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And the baby comes out with
spiky, punky gray hair.

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.340 align:middle line:84%
So I'm looking at the little
baby and thinking, wow,

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:33.710 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I've ever seen
a full head of gray hair

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:35.300 align:middle line:90%
on a newborn.

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:36.390 align:middle line:90%
It was very funny.

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:39.350 align:middle line:84%
But then I realized, because
I had the dream again,

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:42.260 align:middle line:84%
I thought I woke up and was
telling my sister the dream,

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:43.710 align:middle line:90%
but I had the dream again.

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:46.863 align:middle line:84%
Said you've got to know
this little baby is for him.

00:12:46.863 --> 00:12:47.780 align:middle line:90%
It's for your husband.

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:49.220 align:middle line:90%
It's for Norbert.

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:52.460 align:middle line:84%
This is his love bond
is this new baby coming.

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:55.275 align:middle line:84%
And so I did call my sister
when I actually woke up,

00:12:55.275 --> 00:12:56.900 align:middle line:84%
and she's like, oh
my god, I love this.

00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:00.510 align:middle line:84%
So on that level, that can be
a couple of different things.

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:01.310 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: It can.

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:02.480 align:middle line:90%
There's so much to unpick there.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:02.960 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Regina.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Don't spend too much
time on it because we have

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:05.240 align:middle line:90%
way--

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.323 align:middle line:90%
many more dreams to go to.

00:13:06.323 --> 00:13:07.700 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: But I'm so excited.

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:11.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, 99% of our
dreams, over 99%,

00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:14.450 align:middle line:84%
are symbolic, metaphorical,
where our dreaming mind

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:17.210 align:middle line:84%
is picking up on things in our
waking life that we've missed

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:21.090 align:middle line:84%
and then, in our dreams, shows
us in that symbolic language

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:21.890 align:middle line:90%
that dreams love.

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:23.900 align:middle line:84%
Our dreaming mind is
an artist, a visionary.

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:25.373 align:middle line:90%
It speaks like a poet.

00:13:25.373 --> 00:13:26.540 align:middle line:90%
We can talk more about that.

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.580 align:middle line:84%
But there is a tiny
percentage of dreams--

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:30.680 align:middle line:84%
and I've written many
books about this--

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.390 align:middle line:90%
that are kind of paranormal.

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:34.310 align:middle line:84%
And this dream could
well fall into that.

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:36.980 align:middle line:84%
You woke up with a strong
sense that you were dreaming

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:38.210 align:middle line:90%
on behalf of someone else.

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:39.742 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, it
seemed very clear.

00:13:39.742 --> 00:13:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Well, it makes sense
because in your waking life,

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.430 align:middle line:90%
you are like an oracle.

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:45.680 align:middle line:84%
You probably do a lot on
behalf of other people.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:46.940 align:middle line:90%
You're very highly intuitive.

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:49.160 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't do what
you're doing so well

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.870 align:middle line:90%
without that intuitive ability.

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:53.750 align:middle line:84%
So of course, as I say, our
waking and our sleeping life

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:54.710 align:middle line:90%
are connected.

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:56.855 align:middle line:84%
In your dreams,
your consciousness,

00:13:56.855 --> 00:13:58.730 align:middle line:84%
your spirit, soul,
whatever you want to call,

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:00.620 align:middle line:90%
is continuing to work.

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:02.540 align:middle line:90%
You're working in your dreams.

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:04.160 align:middle line:90%
We call them sleepworker dreams.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:05.750 align:middle line:90%
And I find them very beautiful.

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:08.600 align:middle line:84%
And that is a message
for your loved

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:12.980 align:middle line:84%
one about this baby bringing
wisdom, bringing growth.

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:14.840 align:middle line:84%
The gray hair is
wisdom and growth.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:16.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could
also look at it

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:18.710 align:middle line:84%
personally because there
is a theory of dreams

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:20.427 align:middle line:84%
that every time you
dream like that movie

00:14:20.427 --> 00:14:21.635 align:middle line:90%
"Inception," when everybody--

00:14:21.635 --> 00:14:22.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Amazing dream.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:23.210 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:23.660 align:middle line:90%
I mean, amazing film.

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:25.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: --looks at the
dreamer that you are dreaming

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:28.020 align:middle line:90%
about aspects of yourself.

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And I would say, in your
work, that you are presenting

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:35.630 align:middle line:84%
ancient, timeless wisdom and
constantly reinventing it

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:36.680 align:middle line:90%
in a new way.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:37.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Baby with gray hair.

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:38.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yeah.

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:39.747 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
so that would-- it

00:14:39.747 --> 00:14:42.290 align:middle line:84%
sounds like both are very
well true in that one.

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:43.850 align:middle line:84%
And for my version
of a nightmare,

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:45.980 align:middle line:84%
and it is when I went
up to say something

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:48.770 align:middle line:84%
to the grandpa who
was guardedly holding

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:51.830 align:middle line:84%
the little gray-haired baby,
he said something snippy.

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:53.630 align:middle line:84%
That's about as bad
as my dreams get.

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:55.130 align:middle line:90%
I had my feelings hurt a little.

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:56.210 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:57.440 align:middle line:90%
That's a nightmare for me.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Oh, so no
serial killer nightmares.

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:00.012 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:15:00.012 --> 00:15:00.110 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:00.530 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:01.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: No zombies
or vampires--

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:02.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Somebody
saying something snippy,

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:03.740 align:middle line:90%
and it's like, oh.

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:05.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: --or stuck
in mud, suffocating.

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:05.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:06.110 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:06.320 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:06.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: These are top dreams.

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:07.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: None of that.

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:10.490 align:middle line:90%
Just joking, but that is true.

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:11.708 align:middle line:90%
So that's interesting.

00:15:11.708 --> 00:15:13.250 align:middle line:84%
So we can take these,
and we can look

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:15.350 align:middle line:84%
at different elements
depending because many

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:17.570 align:middle line:84%
of the people in this
audience are very intuitive,

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:20.183 align:middle line:84%
are probably also dreaming
on behalf of others.

00:15:20.183 --> 00:15:22.100 align:middle line:84%
So that's why it's nice
to be able to break it

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:24.110 align:middle line:90%
down so beautifully both ways.

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:25.340 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Absolutely.

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:28.930 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Greek oracles
would dream incubation,

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:30.680 align:middle line:84%
where people would go
with their problems,

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:31.992 align:middle line:90%
and then the oracle's there.

00:15:31.992 --> 00:15:33.700 align:middle line:84%
Maybe in another life
that was what you--

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:35.210 align:middle line:90%
you would dream on it.

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And I do know
actually some people

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:38.430 align:middle line:84%
who dream on behalf
of other people.

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:39.380 align:middle line:90%
That's what they do.

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:41.000 align:middle line:84%
I think it's utterly
beautiful, and I

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.620 align:middle line:84%
get-- people write
to me all the time,

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:44.203 align:middle line:84%
and I get so many
stories about people

00:15:44.203 --> 00:15:47.000 align:middle line:84%
who have dreamed of being at
the passing of a loved one when

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.080 align:middle line:84%
they didn't know that
loved one had departed.

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:49.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:52.040 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Incredible data, that.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.276 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, they're there.

00:15:53.276 --> 00:15:54.195 align:middle line:90%
They're a witness.

00:15:54.195 --> 00:15:56.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: How, in spirit,
holding their hand to help them

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:57.140 align:middle line:90%
over the--

00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:57.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's beautiful.

00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:59.585 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: --bridge to the other
side, whatever that may be.

00:15:59.585 --> 00:16:01.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You alluded to
something a little bit ago.

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:03.078 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to
pick back up on it,

00:16:03.078 --> 00:16:05.480 align:middle line:84%
and that is that
dreaming really started

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:09.020 align:middle line:84%
coming to the forefront
more during the pandemic.

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:12.260 align:middle line:84%
What I'm curious about is
because so much fear was

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:16.720 align:middle line:84%
perpetuated during waking
hours during the pandemic,

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:21.280 align:middle line:84%
how did that seem to affect
the content or quality of dream

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.090 align:middle line:90%
time for people?

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:23.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Well,
basically, I mean,

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:25.682 align:middle line:84%
people got more sleep if
they were on furlough,

00:16:25.682 --> 00:16:27.640 align:middle line:84%
so their mornings were
slower, giving more time

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:28.480 align:middle line:90%
for dream recall.

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.850 align:middle line:84%
They also probably got more
REM, rapid eye movement,

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:31.650 align:middle line:90%
stage sleep.

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:34.390 align:middle line:90%
So that's the rational reason.

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:36.592 align:middle line:84%
But the spiritual,
psychological reason

00:16:36.592 --> 00:16:38.050 align:middle line:84%
is that dreams were
doing what they

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:42.490 align:middle line:84%
do best, which is trying to
help, and heal us, and show us

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:45.520 align:middle line:84%
that this was an unprecedented
opportunity for us to fall

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.227 align:middle line:84%
in love with our inner
world, our inner psychic.

00:16:48.227 --> 00:16:49.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very true.

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:52.810 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: And that was why this
unleashing of dreams happen.

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:54.250 align:middle line:90%
And I am testament to that.

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:57.040 align:middle line:84%
As I said, I've been
writing about dream decoding

00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:00.970 align:middle line:84%
and the power of our
night vision for decades.

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:03.460 align:middle line:84%
But it's only been in the
last two to three years

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:04.420 align:middle line:90%
that I have suddenly--

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:06.819 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've had my
readership and my following,

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:09.040 align:middle line:84%
but I've gone on
mainstream platforms,

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:12.010 align:middle line:84%
as I say, all over the world,
including the likes of Capital

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:15.880 align:middle line:84%
Radio, to dream decode for
celebrities because everybody

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.290 align:middle line:90%
is having these dreams.

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And I hope, as we move
away from the pandemic,

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:22.480 align:middle line:84%
that we don't lose
our connection

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:23.410 align:middle line:90%
to our dreaming mind.

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:24.285 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I hope not.

00:17:24.285 --> 00:17:25.869 align:middle line:84%
But maybe this
was a breakthrough

00:17:25.869 --> 00:17:28.240 align:middle line:84%
in terms of mass
consciousness because you also

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:32.645 align:middle line:84%
told me off camera that
you're now showing on--

00:17:32.645 --> 00:17:33.445 align:middle line:90%
did you say ITV?

00:17:33.445 --> 00:17:34.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: ITV this morning.

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:35.035 align:middle line:90%
Viewer call-ins.

00:17:35.035 --> 00:17:35.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: ITV.

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:35.920 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:36.580 align:middle line:90%
So you hear--

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:36.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Never.

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:37.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:38.965 align:middle line:90%
And this is mainstream TV.

00:17:38.965 --> 00:17:39.765 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yes.

00:17:39.765 --> 00:17:43.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they have you on
decoding dreams and paranormal

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:45.650 align:middle line:90%
phenomena for the public.

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:50.380 align:middle line:84%
Now that's a big step to
acknowledge this and feed

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:52.885 align:middle line:84%
that part of their
audience on mainstream.

00:17:52.885 --> 00:17:55.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: I've learned over
the years that going on there

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:59.140 align:middle line:84%
talking about psychic
animals or life after death,

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:02.403 align:middle line:84%
mainstream can't go
there, especially the UK,

00:18:02.403 --> 00:18:03.445 align:middle line:90%
which is very skeptical--

00:18:03.445 --> 00:18:04.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, very.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:04.993 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: --the BBC.

00:18:04.993 --> 00:18:09.485 align:middle line:84%
However, when it's dreaming,
it's like they don't mind.

00:18:09.485 --> 00:18:11.860 align:middle line:84%
But what they don't realize
when I'm going on there dream

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:15.340 align:middle line:84%
decoding, I'm actually
talking about spirituality,

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:16.570 align:middle line:90%
that invisible world.

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And I've learned now that's
the way forward for me,

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:22.180 align:middle line:84%
to go on there and
dream decode for really

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:23.980 align:middle line:84%
big celebrities over in the
UK that I've done before.

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:25.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
it's OK to dream.

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:26.710 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: It's OK
because we all dream.

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:27.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:30.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: And even the
most skeptical person still

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:33.760 align:middle line:84%
has had a weird dream that they
don't know what the meaning is,

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:36.340 align:middle line:84%
and they want me to tell them
and help them understand.

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And then I explain to them it's
a bit like nocturnal therapy.

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:42.010 align:middle line:84%
Where is this invisible
world that we go to?

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:43.570 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it fun dreaming?

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:45.590 align:middle line:84%
It's like all these light
bulbs are going off.

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And I love it because
dreams are a portal.

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:50.920 align:middle line:84%
They're the first step
to awakening people

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:54.190 align:middle line:84%
to this incredible world of
mind, body, spirit out there.

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:55.720 align:middle line:90%
And long may it continue.

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And I must say that the
Millennial generation

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.575 align:middle line:84%
are particularly interested
in their dreaming.

00:19:00.575 --> 00:19:01.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, really?

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:02.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: It seems
a lot of them,

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:04.338 align:middle line:84%
the pandemic has done
that, that all the things

00:19:04.338 --> 00:19:06.850 align:middle line:84%
they used to rely on,
like their social media

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:09.910 align:middle line:84%
following, or the
career, or money,

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:12.460 align:middle line:84%
or looks to give
them sustenance, that

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:14.290 align:middle line:84%
clearly doesn't in
times like that when

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:15.550 align:middle line:90%
your health is threatened.

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:18.700 align:middle line:84%
But they found sustenance
through understanding

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:20.260 align:middle line:84%
their dreaming
life is important.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:21.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you know
this because more of them

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:22.630 align:middle line:90%
started reaching out to you.

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:23.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yes.

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:25.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, books like "Night
Vision," which what I've

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:26.280 align:middle line:90%
done for the younger--

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:27.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I love it.

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:28.810 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: --people
who are new to this--

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:30.643 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, that's
what I loved about it.

00:19:30.643 --> 00:19:32.710 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was so
beautiful, especially,

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:34.450 align:middle line:84%
like you say, for
people who have just

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:36.867 align:middle line:84%
started awakening to the notion
they should pay attention.

00:19:36.867 --> 00:19:38.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Yeah, and
there's an unparalleled

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:41.470 align:middle line:84%
interested in astrology
at the moment as well.

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:44.260 align:middle line:84%
I've done astrological profiles
for all the royal family

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:48.410 align:middle line:84%
in the UK, with major
national newspapers, including

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:51.355 align:middle line:84%
our prime minister and the
leader of the opposition.

00:19:51.355 --> 00:19:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And can you believe that
a national newspaper

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:55.720 align:middle line:84%
has asked me to give them a
psychological profile based

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:56.595 align:middle line:90%
on date of birth?

00:19:56.595 --> 00:19:58.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.250 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] I love it.

00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:00.792 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: This is
not a-- but I wrote

00:20:00.792 --> 00:20:03.880 align:middle line:84%
my "Encyclopedia of
Birthdays" again 20 years ago,

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:06.020 align:middle line:84%
and they're all
being reissued now.

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm just mentioning
this, not to pick myself up

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:10.870 align:middle line:90%
in any way--

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:13.360 align:middle line:84%
I just feel I'm a
servant of these topics--

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:15.477 align:middle line:84%
but to show the interest
is unprecedented.

00:20:15.477 --> 00:20:17.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Interest is now
really starting to rise.

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:18.430 align:middle line:90%
That's fabulous.

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:19.540 align:middle line:90%
That's good news.

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:21.748 align:middle line:90%
I find that very uplifting.

00:20:21.748 --> 00:20:23.290 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's get into
a couple of things

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:24.610 align:middle line:84%
because I want to
get into some dreams,

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:26.650 align:middle line:84%
and what certain dreams
mean, and all that.

00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:31.000 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about some of
the more biological effects

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.150 align:middle line:84%
like what REM does for
the being, for the body

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:36.430 align:middle line:84%
and also what happens
when you're binging

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:40.420 align:middle line:84%
on television on a screen with
blue light till late at night

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:42.800 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of people
started that during COVID too.

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:43.600 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yes.

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.070 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:48.190 align:middle line:84%
Netflix, et cetera, they
got a boom, didn't it?

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:50.320 align:middle line:90%
We were all watching major--

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:51.610 align:middle line:90%
binging on Netflix.

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Your dreaming mind
will seize on things

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:57.670 align:middle line:84%
in the day that have intense
emotional content to repackage

00:20:57.670 --> 00:20:58.663 align:middle line:90%
them for you at night.

00:20:58.663 --> 00:21:00.580 align:middle line:84%
However, you've got to
think of all the things

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:02.350 align:middle line:84%
that you watched on television
and all the things that

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:03.280 align:middle line:90%
happened in your day.

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:07.060 align:middle line:84%
Why does your dreaming mind
hone in on one particular thing?

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:10.420 align:middle line:84%
There are millions of
things it could choose.

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:12.130 align:middle line:84%
So of course, what we
watch on television

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:14.620 align:middle line:84%
is going to impact
our dream life.

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:17.410 align:middle line:84%
However, you've got to realize
that you your dreaming mind,

00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:19.660 align:middle line:84%
which is very clever,
could choose anything.

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:22.010 align:middle line:90%
It chooses that for a reason.

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:27.310 align:middle line:84%
And I actually encourage
watching fantasy and--

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:30.460 align:middle line:84%
but not two hours before you go
to sleep because that can have

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:33.580 align:middle line:84%
a negative effect on your sleep
because you are practicing

00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:35.950 align:middle line:84%
immersing yourself in
an alternative reality,

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:38.890 align:middle line:84%
and that's what happens in
dreaming because I've also

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:40.840 align:middle line:84%
found that there is
a strong connection

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:43.060 align:middle line:84%
between vivid
dreaming and gamers.

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:46.193 align:middle line:90%
The gaming community lucid--

00:21:46.193 --> 00:21:47.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Lucid dream?

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:48.318 align:middle line:90%
A lot of them lucid dreamers?

00:21:48.318 --> 00:21:50.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Xbox,
actually, have been

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.930 align:middle line:84%
tapping into the lucid
dreams of their gamers

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:54.970 align:middle line:84%
to fuel dream content,
and they've actually got

00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:56.540 align:middle line:90%
a platform, Power Your Dreams.

00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:57.340 align:middle line:90%
Incredible.

00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:00.910 align:middle line:84%
The next Xbox generation of
Xbox games are dream-inspired.

00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:01.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: And that can go
with the amount of dreams that

00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:05.170 align:middle line:84%
are now-- even in
Hollywood, it's

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:06.712 align:middle line:84%
happened with "The
Power of the Dog."

00:22:06.712 --> 00:22:09.068 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you know
that potential Oscar winner.

00:22:09.068 --> 00:22:10.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, I know the film.

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:10.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yes.

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:11.230 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: But what is--

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:12.938 align:middle line:10%
>>CHEUNG: Well, they
had a dreamworker on

00:22:12.938 --> 00:22:16.300 align:middle line:10%
set to help Benedict
Cumberbatch and Kirsten Dunst

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:18.592 align:middle line:10%
get into character and
meet their shadow side.

00:22:18.592 --> 00:22:19.675 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:22:19.675 --> 00:22:22.945 align:middle line:10%
>>CHEUNG: Jane Campion is
very into her dreams, as many,

00:22:22.945 --> 00:22:24.940 align:middle line:10%
like Christopher
Nolan, James Cameron.

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:26.110 align:middle line:90%
They all are very--

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:30.340 align:middle line:84%
they use their dreams as fuel
to inspire their creativity,

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:33.190 align:middle line:84%
and it's become a creativity
hack within Hollywood now,

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:36.720 align:middle line:84%
dreamwork, to help
you embrace shadow

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:39.220 align:middle line:84%
aspects of your character which
you're maybe not expressing.

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:40.020 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating.

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:41.450 align:middle line:90%
They had a dream decoder on set.

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:43.570 align:middle line:84%
I think a lady called
Kim Gillingham.

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:46.330 align:middle line:84%
She's very much in demand
now for Hollywood directors.

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:47.860 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:51.700 align:middle line:84%
I was also contacted by a
perfume company, Serge Lutens

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:53.590 align:middle line:90%
perfume company.

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:57.430 align:middle line:84%
Serge Lutens, who's a
visionary director in France,

00:22:57.430 --> 00:23:00.700 align:middle line:84%
he had a dream where he
met the femme fatale,

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:02.740 align:middle line:84%
and it inspired him
to create a perfume

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:05.010 align:middle line:90%
based on women who dream.

00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:05.810 align:middle line:90%
Unbelievable.

00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:07.095 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is fascinating.

00:23:07.095 --> 00:23:08.720 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea all of
this was going on.

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.040 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: And I was
advising-- helping them

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.720 align:middle line:84%
with their ad campaign
to tell them how

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:14.270 align:middle line:90%
to recreate a dream scenario.

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:16.370 align:middle line:84%
Again, just shows
what is happening.

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:20.690 align:middle line:84%
Movies, perfume-- companies
have been brought during COVID

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:23.030 align:middle line:84%
especially-- big
clothing companies--

00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:25.730 align:middle line:84%
I won't mention, but they're
major brands-- cosmetic brands,

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:26.840 align:middle line:90%
skincare brands--

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:30.470 align:middle line:84%
to talk to the staff about
dream decoding so then

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:33.350 align:middle line:84%
they can talk to their
clients about their dreams

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:36.200 align:middle line:84%
to have a more intimate
relationship with their clients

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:39.910 align:middle line:84%
and help them get the right
skincare or beauty product.

00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:41.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
absolutely fascinating.

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:43.480 align:middle line:84%
When I listen to
it-- well, we can

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:44.900 align:middle line:90%
go a lot of directions on that.

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:49.060 align:middle line:84%
But what I want to do is go
back for a moment to what you

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:51.760 align:middle line:84%
were talking about when
all of this information

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.650 align:middle line:84%
starts pouring through
your dream time,

00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:57.160 align:middle line:84%
and there's a particular
element that you've picked up

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:59.890 align:middle line:84%
on during the day or in
something you've watched,

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:02.175 align:middle line:84%
and we tend to think,
oh, that's random.

00:24:02.175 --> 00:24:03.550 align:middle line:84%
You're saying
quite the opposite.

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:05.860 align:middle line:84%
That's not remotely
random that your brain

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:07.450 align:middle line:90%
picked that particular item.

00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:08.830 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Nothing is random.

00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:12.940 align:middle line:84%
Your dreaming mind is
super, super clever.

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:14.620 align:middle line:84%
But the trouble is
most people give up

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:16.120 align:middle line:90%
because it doesn't make sense.

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:16.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:18.010 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: So then I
encourage them, go and read--

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:19.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They can't
find a context for it.

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:20.968 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Go and read
Coleridge's "Kubla Khan."

00:24:20.968 --> 00:24:23.530 align:middle line:84%
"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan, a
stately pleasure dome decree,

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:25.730 align:middle line:90%
where--" I know that backwards.

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:28.750 align:middle line:90%
I used it so many times.

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:32.303 align:middle line:84%
Go and read poetry that doesn't
make sense on first reading.

00:24:32.303 --> 00:24:33.220 align:middle line:90%
You have to unpick it.

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:34.180 align:middle line:90%
We have to go back to school.

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:35.752 align:middle line:84%
Like in your
literature classes, you

00:24:35.752 --> 00:24:37.210 align:middle line:84%
were taught about
pathetic fallacy.

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:39.400 align:middle line:84%
You were taught about
symbols, metaphors, puns.

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.800 align:middle line:90%
The dreaming mind loves puns.

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And what it's encouraging you
to do is to become more creative

00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:48.280 align:middle line:84%
and to brainstorm
around a symbol.

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:50.110 align:middle line:90%
What are the associations?

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:52.035 align:middle line:84%
Again, I compare it
to a work of art.

00:24:52.035 --> 00:24:53.410 align:middle line:84%
There are some
great works of art

00:24:53.410 --> 00:24:56.360 align:middle line:84%
that you can stand and gaze
in awe at because there's

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:57.160 align:middle line:90%
so much meaning--

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:58.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:58.090 --> 00:24:58.960 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: --because
you can say, well,

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:00.100 align:middle line:84%
why isn't the dreaming
mind more obvious?

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:02.350 align:middle line:84%
Because a picture, and
a poem, and a symbol

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:06.280 align:middle line:84%
says so much more for you
than just words ever can.

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:09.440 align:middle line:84%
And it wants you to see
that this is so much bigger.

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:12.700 align:middle line:84%
There's so many more
expansive connections for you.

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:15.910 align:middle line:84%
It wants you to think
like a poet, a visionary.

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:17.450 align:middle line:90%
That's what it wants you to do.

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:21.940 align:middle line:84%
So go to an art gallery, read
poetry, watch amazing movies.

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:24.350 align:middle line:84%
Of course, big shout out
for "Inception," my favorite

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:24.540 align:middle line:90%
movie--

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:25.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, me too.

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:26.320 align:middle line:90%
Big shout.

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:27.748 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: --because they show
you the potential and they

00:25:27.748 --> 00:25:27.820 align:middle line:90%
get--

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:29.868 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The layers,
the dimensions of dream.

00:25:29.868 --> 00:25:31.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: And the symbolic
language it speaks in.

00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:33.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it's beautiful.

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:35.920 align:middle line:84%
OK, now you just
triggered something in me.

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:37.900 align:middle line:84%
So you have all
these people coming

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:41.230 align:middle line:84%
to you who are looking
at how to begin

00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:45.145 align:middle line:84%
utilizing dreams in order, for
example, to sell their product.

00:25:45.145 --> 00:25:47.860 align:middle line:90%


00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:51.010 align:middle line:84%
Why can't that same faculty
be used to manipulate people

00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:52.375 align:middle line:90%
from other places?

00:25:52.375 --> 00:25:53.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Well,
I would hope not.

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:56.050 align:middle line:84%
I hope that people would
do it with integrity.

00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:58.060 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to
understand, I--

00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:00.880 align:middle line:84%
one of the things when
I'm teaching companies

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:04.000 align:middle line:84%
or whatever how to help with
dream decoding for clients

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.460 align:middle line:84%
is to say you've always
got to say the best

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:08.590 align:middle line:84%
person to interpret your
dreams is always you.

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:09.790 align:middle line:90%
It's personal.

00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:11.090 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you example.

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:13.150 align:middle line:84%
If I dream of a
dog, I love dogs.

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:15.760 align:middle line:90%
It's a beautiful loving symbol.

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:18.010 align:middle line:84%
However, if somebody had
an unfortunate experience

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:21.200 align:middle line:84%
with a dog, although,
in my dream dictionary

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:23.240 align:middle line:84%
it will say very positive
things about dogs--

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:25.310 align:middle line:84%
unconditional love,
companionship-- however,

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:27.260 align:middle line:84%
if you have had
personal association

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:29.162 align:middle line:84%
with a dog that
is unpleasant, it

00:26:29.162 --> 00:26:30.620 align:middle line:84%
will have a very
different meaning.

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:31.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:34.310 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: So always go with
your own personal gut instinct

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:35.510 align:middle line:90%
first about a symbol.

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:37.220 align:middle line:84%
My dream dictionaries,
et cetera,

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:41.443 align:middle line:84%
are the universal
common ways that we

00:26:41.443 --> 00:26:43.110 align:middle line:84%
think of these symbols
that kick start--

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:44.568 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you
still suggest you

00:26:44.568 --> 00:26:46.953 align:middle line:84%
have to go in and see what
that feels like for you.

00:26:46.953 --> 00:26:49.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: But a lot of us have
lost touch with the ability

00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:50.773 align:middle line:90%
to think symbolically.

00:26:50.773 --> 00:26:52.940 align:middle line:84%
We know in ancient times--
we go right back to time,

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:54.110 align:middle line:90%
everything was symbolic.

00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:56.360 align:middle line:90%
We thought in that deep--

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:57.530 align:middle line:90%
nothing was on the surface.

00:26:57.530 --> 00:26:59.720 align:middle line:84%
It was always
underneath the surface.

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:02.870 align:middle line:84%
We've lost that ability
over time to-- we

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:04.410 align:middle line:84%
take things so
much at face value.

00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:06.680 align:middle line:84%
We don't look for the
layers underneath.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:08.330 align:middle line:84%
So my dream dictionaries
are basically

00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:10.160 align:middle line:84%
to kick start that
part of your brain,

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:13.587 align:middle line:84%
that intuitive, brainstorming,
creative part, which

00:27:13.587 --> 00:27:15.920 align:middle line:84%
is where all great innovation
and discovery in the world

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:16.310 align:middle line:90%
begins.

00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:18.020 align:middle line:84%
Did you know that
many scientists--

00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:19.880 align:middle line:84%
Einstein was a
very vivid dreamer.

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:20.970 align:middle line:90%
The theory of relativity--

00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:21.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:24.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: --speed of light,
all inspired by a dream.

00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:25.610 align:middle line:90%
The periodic table, a dream.

00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:28.340 align:middle line:84%
Even Google was
inspired by a dream.

00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:31.340 align:middle line:84%
Now all our lives have
been changed by Google.

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:33.208 align:middle line:84%
Larry Page was at
Stanford University

00:27:33.208 --> 00:27:35.000 align:middle line:84%
not knowing quite what
to do with his life.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.230 align:middle line:90%
He felt like he didn't fit in.

00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:38.682 align:middle line:84%
He was passionate
about computers.

00:27:38.682 --> 00:27:40.140 align:middle line:84%
He had a lot lying
around his room.

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:41.540 align:middle line:84%
He went to bed
one night and then

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:44.750 align:middle line:84%
had a dream that
all the information

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:47.300 align:middle line:84%
from these computers could
be downloaded on one page.

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:49.460 align:middle line:84%
He got up at 2:00
or 3:00 AM, which

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:51.020 align:middle line:90%
I say is a very sacred time--

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:52.160 align:middle line:90%
I can explain that--

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:53.030 align:middle line:90%
did some math.

00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:54.020 align:middle line:90%
This could be possible.

00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:55.220 align:middle line:90%
Dropped out of Stanford.

00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:57.860 align:middle line:90%
Two years later created Google.

00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:02.000 align:middle line:84%
Like it or loathe it, Google
has changed our world.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.560 align:middle line:90%
And that started with a dream.

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:04.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:06.560 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
2:00 to 3:00 AM thing.

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:07.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yes.

00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:08.450 align:middle line:90%
Sacred.

00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:10.507 align:middle line:84%
If you wake up at 2:00
and 3:00 AM, most people--

00:28:10.507 --> 00:28:12.590 align:middle line:84%
I get so frustrated because
I see people who hate,

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:13.520 align:middle line:90%
feel wrong.

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:16.070 align:middle line:84%
They force themselves to go
to sleep, or they're anxious.

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:17.360 align:middle line:90%
Don't celebrate it.

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:19.430 align:middle line:84%
Your dreaming mind
has woken you up

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:21.680 align:middle line:84%
because something
in your dream is

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:24.620 align:middle line:84%
so important it wants you to
write it down and reflect.

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:26.030 align:middle line:90%
Now I spent time--

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:28.550 align:middle line:84%
before university,
actually, I wanted to go--

00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:30.290 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to be the
first female vicar.

00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:32.870 align:middle line:84%
I was very deep into
that, and I spent time

00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:33.920 align:middle line:90%
considering my options.

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
the call to prayer

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:39.350 align:middle line:84%
is early, is
between two and six.

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:41.340 align:middle line:90%
It's a very sacred time.

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at some of the
great innovators in the world,

00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:46.940 align:middle line:84%
most of their discoveries
and their eureka moments

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:49.317 align:middle line:84%
are very in those
sacred early times.

00:28:49.317 --> 00:28:50.525 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So if you wake up--

00:28:50.525 --> 00:28:50.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Write it down.

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:52.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and you don't
know why at 2:00, 3:00,

00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:54.560 align:middle line:84%
4:00 in the morning, don't
beat yourself up, squeeze

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:57.185 align:middle line:84%
your eyes shut, and say, I have
to go back to sleep right away.

00:28:57.185 --> 00:28:57.440 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Write it down--

00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:58.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Maybe take
a moment and say--

00:28:58.550 --> 00:28:58.895 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: --what's on your mind.

00:28:58.895 --> 00:28:59.120 align:middle line:90%
Write it down.

00:28:59.120 --> 00:28:59.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --what was going on?

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:00.980 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Just journal away.

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:03.440 align:middle line:84%
And it may change the world,
or it may change your life.

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:06.290 align:middle line:84%
Both, to me, are
just as important.

00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:07.220 align:middle line:90%
Your life is just--

00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:08.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The problem
for a lot of people,

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:09.260 align:middle line:90%
they're in a relationship.

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:10.610 align:middle line:90%
And you think, how do I do this?

00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:12.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to wake
my partner up if I

00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:13.820 align:middle line:90%
turn the light on and do this.

00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's a big one for
when it comes to journaling.

00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:18.060 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: That is a big one.

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:18.860 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:19.905 align:middle line:90%
It is a big one.

00:29:19.905 --> 00:29:22.280 align:middle line:84%
You've got to be respectful,
but I think creep out of bed

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:24.607 align:middle line:84%
and go to the
bathroom, sit down.

00:29:24.607 --> 00:29:26.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So keep your
journal next to the toilet.

00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:27.655 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:27.655 --> 00:29:28.780 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's a good solution.

00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:30.155 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Yeah,
and write it down

00:29:30.155 --> 00:29:32.535 align:middle line:84%
because you will be surprised
if you keep a journal.

00:29:32.535 --> 00:29:34.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Oscar Wilde
once said, I always

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:36.530 align:middle line:84%
must have something sensational
to read on the train

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:37.610 align:middle line:90%
so I bring my diary.

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:41.480 align:middle line:84%
I say bring your dream diary
because you will see over time,

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:44.180 align:middle line:84%
the dream diary is
commenting on your life.

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:46.760 align:middle line:84%
It's like this avatar,
this other world,

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:49.430 align:middle line:84%
that is commenting on
your everyday life.

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:51.110 align:middle line:90%
It's utterly fascinating.

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:53.390 align:middle line:84%
You will see precognitive
elements in your dreams.

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:55.490 align:middle line:84%
You will see that
sense of deja vu.

00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:56.390 align:middle line:90%
I dreamt this.

00:29:56.390 --> 00:29:59.570 align:middle line:84%
You will see marvelous
symbols giving you

00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:02.690 align:middle line:84%
insight that can help you
move forward with your life.

00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:05.540 align:middle line:84%
You will see your dreaming
mind constantly trying

00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:08.360 align:middle line:84%
to guide, and inspire,
and enlighten you.

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:11.580 align:middle line:84%
It's incredible, but you've
got to stick with it.

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:13.108 align:middle line:90%
There's no point just doing one.

00:30:13.108 --> 00:30:15.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you just give
us a very, very, very practical

00:30:15.650 --> 00:30:16.450 align:middle line:90%
solution.

00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:18.590 align:middle line:84%
If you're in partnership,
keep your journal

00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:20.270 align:middle line:84%
next to the toilet,
somewhere where

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:22.760 align:middle line:84%
you can go and not
disturb the other person

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:23.820 align:middle line:90%
with light at night.

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:24.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm serious.

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:29.078 align:middle line:84%
That's an excellent idea because
I wake up and think, oh--

00:30:29.078 --> 00:30:30.120 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Can't wake him.

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:31.703 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --I want
to write this down,

00:30:31.703 --> 00:30:33.720 align:middle line:84%
and then I go back
to sleep and forget.

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:33.980 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:34.220 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: You will.

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:35.637 align:middle line:84%
You must write it
down immediately

00:30:35.637 --> 00:30:37.345 align:middle line:84%
because the dreaming
mind comes--

00:30:37.345 --> 00:30:38.720 align:middle line:84%
the images in the
dream mind come

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.720 align:middle line:84%
from the world of the
unconscious, which is very

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.020 align:middle line:90%
subtle, intuition and subtle.

00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And it cannot compete
with rational reason ego,

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:48.830 align:middle line:84%
which is ruled during-- that's
why dreams are so beautiful

00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:52.070 align:middle line:84%
because they're what your
intuition notices in the day

00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:55.350 align:middle line:84%
but your ego, or your reason,
or your logic just squash.

00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:56.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:56.150 --> 00:30:57.080 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:58.370 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to deja vu.

00:30:58.370 --> 00:31:01.970 align:middle line:84%
You just brought it up a moment
ago because that is, I think,

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:06.050 align:middle line:84%
a fascinating subject and
also much misunderstood

00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:08.477 align:middle line:84%
because sometimes
you're simply--

00:31:08.477 --> 00:31:09.560 align:middle line:90%
you've been there already.

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:10.580 align:middle line:90%
You're practicing.

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:12.755 align:middle line:84%
Talk about the
implications of deja vu.

00:31:12.755 --> 00:31:15.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Oh, the
implications are astonishing.

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:18.200 align:middle line:84%
I truly believe now, in all
this research I've done--

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:20.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I started
way back in 2000,

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:22.580 align:middle line:84%
the psychological
element of dreams,

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:23.930 align:middle line:90%
and I went to the spiritual.

00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm thinking all dreams
have a precognitive element.

00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:28.775 align:middle line:84%
We just haven't
seen them play out

00:31:28.775 --> 00:31:31.400 align:middle line:84%
because when we write them down,
the future hasn't happened yet

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.470 align:middle line:84%
for us in real time,
so we don't know.

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:34.310 align:middle line:90%
So pay attention.

00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:37.610 align:middle line:84%
I think all dreams have a
hint about a potential future

00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:40.680 align:middle line:90%
there for you that plays out.

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And I think that happens every
single night in your dreams,

00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:46.820 align:middle line:84%
that you have an inkling
of a potential future.

00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:48.560 align:middle line:90%
And that is so exciting.

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:50.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And sometimes
people do gather together,

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:54.320 align:middle line:84%
and you do start practicing
things that you do

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:55.650 align:middle line:90%
want to do in dream time.

00:31:55.650 --> 00:31:56.450 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yes.

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:57.110 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you do.

00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:59.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
practice, once it happens,

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:00.477 align:middle line:84%
I've already been here,
and I've already-- you

00:32:00.477 --> 00:32:01.550 align:middle line:90%
have already been there.

00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:02.630 align:middle line:90%
You have already done it.

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:04.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Well, it shows that
there's a part of us, as I say,

00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:06.565 align:middle line:84%
call it consciousness,
spirit, or soul,

00:32:06.565 --> 00:32:09.800 align:middle line:84%
that exists independent
of our brain and our body.

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:15.438 align:middle line:84%
Something has an awareness of
our future or our greater self.

00:32:15.438 --> 00:32:16.730 align:middle line:90%
Again, it's looking out for us.

00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:18.290 align:middle line:90%
It's giving us hints and tips.

00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:20.145 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, I
did a book called

00:32:20.145 --> 00:32:21.770 align:middle line:84%
"The Premonition
Code," where we looked

00:32:21.770 --> 00:32:23.150 align:middle line:90%
into the physics of time.

00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:25.280 align:middle line:84%
Scientists don't know
what sleep or dreams are.

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:26.870 align:middle line:84%
They don't know
what time is either.

00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:29.060 align:middle line:84%
There are all these experiments
showing that the future can

00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:29.860 align:middle line:90%
influence the past.

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:31.700 align:middle line:84%
The past can
influence the future.

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:34.220 align:middle line:90%
It is so fascinating.

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:36.620 align:middle line:84%
But in our dream world,
I think it's a doorway.

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:39.225 align:middle line:84%
It's the entry point
to this spiritual world

00:32:39.225 --> 00:32:41.600 align:middle line:84%
and this timelessness because
when you go into the dream,

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:44.220 align:middle line:84%
time and space
doesn't exist anymore.

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:45.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:49.268 align:middle line:84%
It can seem like you've had an
entire dramatic play play out,

00:32:49.268 --> 00:32:50.435 align:middle line:90%
and it's been a few seconds.

00:32:50.435 --> 00:32:52.737 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Yeah, and that's
why afterlife dreams

00:32:52.737 --> 00:32:53.570 align:middle line:90%
can be very healing.

00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And especially, again, to
reference the pandemic,

00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:59.360 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people had dreams of
meeting departed loved ones,

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:00.990 align:middle line:84%
and these dreams
were very healing.

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:03.740 align:middle line:84%
There is research to
show that in around 90%

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:06.710 align:middle line:84%
of cases, people who have an
afterlife dream, that means

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:08.600 align:middle line:84%
that they have a
conversation in their dreams

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:11.120 align:middle line:84%
with someone who's departed,
actually deal better

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:13.010 align:middle line:90%
with the grieving process.

00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:14.320 align:middle line:90%
Is it an afterlife sign?

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:15.120 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:16.328 align:middle line:90%
I don't know all the answers.

00:33:16.328 --> 00:33:17.690 align:middle line:90%
Potentially, it could be.

00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:18.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And with this audience, they'd
be very comfortable with that.

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:23.310 align:middle line:84%
OK, you're bringing
to mind something I

00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:24.560 align:middle line:90%
hadn't planned on bringing up.

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:25.520 align:middle line:90%
It just popped in.

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:29.010 align:middle line:84%
A friend of mine, who
is also a very talented,

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:32.360 align:middle line:84%
very adept channeler-- and I
don't use that word lightly--

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:36.500 align:middle line:84%
a real one, very sensitive
and dreams a lot too--

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:39.140 align:middle line:84%
so we all get together
with this group of people

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:41.240 align:middle line:84%
through this strange
situation-- it

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:42.950 align:middle line:84%
all came together
at the last minute--

00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:46.490 align:middle line:84%
and all end up with this
strange man on a vision quest.

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:47.420 align:middle line:90%
No one planned it.

00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:48.260 align:middle line:90%
It just happened.

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:50.660 align:middle line:90%
This is in real life.

00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:53.180 align:middle line:90%
We get to her son's house.

00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And she's saying, well, maybe
our son will let us stay there.

00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:57.900 align:middle line:90%
My son will let us stay there.

00:33:57.900 --> 00:33:58.910 align:middle line:90%
So we go and stay there.

00:33:58.910 --> 00:34:01.370 align:middle line:84%
And the leader of
the pack is kind

00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:03.710 align:middle line:84%
of taking advantage, eating
the food in the refrigerator

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:06.230 align:middle line:84%
and really making a
nuisance of himself.

00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And so she kept
apologizing to her son.

00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:10.190 align:middle line:90%
This is the interesting part.

00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:13.860 align:middle line:84%
I am so sorry we did
this to you again.

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:15.659 align:middle line:84%
And he said, what are
you talking about?

00:34:15.659 --> 00:34:18.110 align:middle line:84%
She said, well, the last time
I brought all these people.

00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:20.600 align:middle line:84%
I am so sorry we did
this to you again.

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:21.870 align:middle line:90%
I'll never do this again.

00:34:21.870 --> 00:34:24.900 align:middle line:84%
And he said, mom, you've
never done this before.

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:28.400 align:middle line:84%
So later, she goes, and
she's talking to her guide.

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:29.699 align:middle line:90%
We're talking to her guide.

00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:32.179 align:middle line:84%
They said, well, you
have, but you all

00:34:32.179 --> 00:34:34.610 align:middle line:84%
got together and practiced
this in dream time.

00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:37.027 align:middle line:84%
And she was thinking
that it was real life.

00:34:37.027 --> 00:34:38.735 align:middle line:84%
She couldn't tell the
difference anymore.

00:34:38.735 --> 00:34:40.670 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Remarkable, isn't it?

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:42.280 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I love that.

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:44.280 align:middle line:84%
I think it's "Inception,"
or is it "The Matrix?"

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:45.159 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:34:45.159 --> 00:34:46.909 align:middle line:84%
These dream-inspired
movies, have you ever

00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:48.949 align:middle line:84%
had a dream that was
so real that it's only

00:34:48.949 --> 00:34:51.210 align:middle line:84%
when you wake up that you
thought it was a dream?

00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:52.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:52.250 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:52.820 align:middle line:90%
All the time.

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:53.695 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Incredible.

00:34:53.695 --> 00:34:57.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I'm so
passionate about this.

00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:59.252 align:middle line:90%
And science can't explain it.

00:34:59.252 --> 00:35:00.335 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, they cannot.

00:35:00.335 --> 00:35:01.880 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: But these stories--

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:02.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They can't
explain consciousness.

00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:03.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: No.

00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:04.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So there you go.

00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:05.715 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: They're
trying, though.

00:35:05.715 --> 00:35:09.680 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole emerging
breed of scientists.

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:12.050 align:middle line:84%
And I actually have worked
quite closely with them

00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:14.000 align:middle line:90%
for the last six years.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.420 align:middle line:84%
I support them, do
webinars with them,

00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:19.070 align:middle line:84%
co-authored a book
with one of them.

00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:23.690 align:middle line:84%
The science of consciousness is
a really exciting emerging area

00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:26.630 align:middle line:84%
that science is willing to go
there now and show that science

00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:27.890 align:middle line:90%
and spirit are actually--

00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:28.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it's starting.

00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:29.600 align:middle line:90%
Definitely starting.

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:29.900 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: It's starting.

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:31.775 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They don't
have it nailed down yet,

00:35:31.775 --> 00:35:33.643 align:middle line:90%
but they'll get there over time.

00:35:33.643 --> 00:35:35.060 align:middle line:84%
OK, one thing I
want to talk about

00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:37.550 align:middle line:84%
is a lot of people
say, A, I don't dream.

00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:38.730 align:middle line:90%
They're not dreaming.

00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:39.530 align:middle line:90%
They're forgetting.

00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:40.580 align:middle line:90%
They're not remembering.

00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:43.910 align:middle line:84%
So let's give people
a couple little tips

00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:45.975 align:middle line:84%
on how we can start
recalling dreams because--

00:35:45.975 --> 00:35:46.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Absolutely.

00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:49.910 align:middle line:84%
Brain scans show that we
dream every single night,

00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:51.800 align:middle line:84%
and you have at least
five or six dreams.

00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:53.150 align:middle line:90%
You're just not recalling them.

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:55.230 align:middle line:90%
And that could be for a reason.

00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:57.500 align:middle line:84%
You're probably very, very
busy, and preoccupied,

00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:59.060 align:middle line:84%
and very immersed
in the material

00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:00.210 align:middle line:90%
world in your waking life.

00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:03.870 align:middle line:84%
You could also be someone with a
very logical, rational mindset.

00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:06.440 align:middle line:84%
And if you-- the story you've
told yourself all your life is

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:09.050 align:middle line:84%
that dreams are meaningless--
we're taught that from an early

00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:12.050 align:middle line:84%
age, and I'm on a mission
to overthrow that--

00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:14.210 align:middle line:84%
of course, you're not
going to remember it

00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:17.580 align:middle line:84%
because your reason and your
logic are overriding it.

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:19.750 align:middle line:84%
So the first tip is
to pay more attention

00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:22.300 align:middle line:84%
to the possibility of dreams
because like anything in life,

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:24.550 align:middle line:84%
you're dreaming mind is
crying out for your attention.

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And where your attention goes,
that's where the reward is.

00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:30.430 align:middle line:84%
I predict people watching
this will dream tonight

00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:31.497 align:middle line:90%
because they're thinking.

00:36:31.497 --> 00:36:33.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They'll remember
their dreams, you mean.

00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:35.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Yeah, well,
they will remember it.

00:36:35.050 --> 00:36:36.550 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they will dream, and
they will recall them--

00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:37.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
they'll recall them.

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:39.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: --because their
attention during the day

00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:40.090 align:middle line:90%
has diverted it.

00:36:40.090 --> 00:36:43.420 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to start actually
taking dreams seriously.

00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:45.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure your
audience will anyway.

00:36:45.250 --> 00:36:48.160 align:middle line:84%
But you've also got to start
not just taking them seriously

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:50.530 align:middle line:84%
but to think they have
something of value to teach me.

00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:55.090 align:middle line:84%
Your attitude to dream life is
key in whether you recall it.

00:36:55.090 --> 00:36:57.250 align:middle line:84%
Number two, are you
getting enough REM sleep?

00:36:57.250 --> 00:36:59.050 align:middle line:84%
If you're not having
a good night's sleep

00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:01.390 align:middle line:84%
and your bedroom isn't
a very relaxing place,

00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:03.010 align:middle line:90%
that's not going to help.

00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:06.140 align:middle line:84%
Number three, are you
writing down your dreams?

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:09.040 align:middle line:84%
Even if something comes up
like a bicycle in the morning,

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:11.350 align:middle line:84%
even if it's just a random
word, write it down.

00:37:11.350 --> 00:37:14.260 align:middle line:84%
The very act of writing it down
will prompt your dreaming mind

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:16.450 align:middle line:84%
the next morning because
we are creatures of habit.

00:37:16.450 --> 00:37:18.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're conditioning
yourself to remember then.

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:19.135 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:19.135 --> 00:37:21.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: The key thing,
though, is the first 90 seconds

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:22.090 align:middle line:90%
when you wake up.

00:37:22.090 --> 00:37:23.560 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people do
everything which

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:25.480 align:middle line:84%
is the total opposite
of what they should do.

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:26.650 align:middle line:90%
You've got to keep still.

00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:28.450 align:middle line:84%
So if you wake up in
the fetal position,

00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:30.940 align:middle line:84%
stay in that position
just for 90 seconds or so.

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:33.620 align:middle line:84%
Keep your eyes closed because
as soon as you wake it up,

00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:36.880 align:middle line:90%
you jet it into waking life.

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:39.460 align:middle line:84%
Ideally, also, wake up
without an alarm clock

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:41.080 align:middle line:84%
because an alarm
clock is too brutal.

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:44.380 align:middle line:84%
Try and wake up naturally,
and just stay in that position

00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:46.570 align:middle line:84%
because any physical
movement will put you

00:37:46.570 --> 00:37:47.920 align:middle line:90%
into the waking world.

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:50.890 align:middle line:84%
Stay in that position and
just see what dreams may come.

00:37:50.890 --> 00:37:54.270 align:middle line:84%
If nothing comes, recall the
feeling because that feeling--

00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:56.020 align:middle line:84%
we all wake up feeling
slightly different.

00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:57.645 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we're more
happy than others.

00:37:57.645 --> 00:38:00.220 align:middle line:84%
That would often be as
a result of the dream.

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:01.210 align:middle line:90%
And write it down.

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:03.880 align:middle line:84%
Again, the action
of writing it down

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:05.770 align:middle line:84%
sends a message to your
dreaming mind, look,

00:38:05.770 --> 00:38:07.190 align:middle line:90%
she's taking me seriously.

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.990 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I'm excited.

00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:09.610 align:middle line:84%
It's like someone who's
been texting you for years

00:38:09.610 --> 00:38:11.140 align:middle line:84%
and trying to get
a date, and then--

00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:11.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:13.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: [LAUGHS] --and
then they're noticing me.

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:14.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm excited.

00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:14.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:17.470 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: I'm going to send an
amazing dream the next night.

00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:20.020 align:middle line:84%
During the day also,
do some reality checks.

00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:21.485 align:middle line:90%
Ask yourself, is this a dream?

00:38:21.485 --> 00:38:22.360 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I don't know.

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:24.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everything you're
saying is I think a thought,

00:38:24.970 --> 00:38:27.250 align:middle line:84%
and then you're talking
about that the next second.

00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:28.750 align:middle line:84%
So I don't have to
ask you anything.

00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:29.360 align:middle line:90%
Go for it.

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:29.800 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Another thing--

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:30.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's just
what I was thinking.

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:31.060 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: --vitamin B6.

00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:32.465 align:middle line:84%
There is actually
a study to show.

00:38:32.465 --> 00:38:33.265 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:38:33.265 --> 00:38:35.920 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: If you're lacking in
vitamin B6 or the B vitamins,

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:38.050 align:middle line:84%
it's related to
vivid dream recall.

00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And as I said,
science shows that we

00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:42.850 align:middle line:84%
don't know why we dream,
but scientists agree now

00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:45.640 align:middle line:84%
that dreams are important for
our mental, emotional, and

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:47.860 align:middle line:84%
psychological health
and well-being.

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:50.413 align:middle line:84%
When they do test and
people are deprived--

00:38:50.413 --> 00:38:52.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't think-- I think
they do it on animals.

00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:54.640 align:middle line:90%
I hate that, but they do.

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:57.860 align:middle line:90%
It leads to increased mortality.

00:38:57.860 --> 00:39:03.430 align:middle line:84%
So dreaming is very important
for our holistic well-being.

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And I have a theory
that we don't

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.790 align:middle line:84%
know why we sleep
because it's not to rest

00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:07.900 align:middle line:90%
because we fidget in our sleep.

00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And our brains are active in
dreaming, so we're not resting.

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:12.220 align:middle line:84%
I have a theory that
the reason we sleep

00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:14.380 align:middle line:84%
is because we
urgently need to dream

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:16.180 align:middle line:84%
because our dreams
are cathartic,

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:18.010 align:middle line:90%
and healing, and regenerating.

00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:19.720 align:middle line:84%
I have that theory
that we need--

00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:21.670 align:middle line:90%
the reason we sleep is to dream.

00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:23.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I think you're--

00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:26.350 align:middle line:84%
actually, I think you're right,
being someone who dreams a lot

00:39:26.350 --> 00:39:32.000 align:middle line:84%
and feeling that, like you
say, that cathartic experience.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, like you've worked
through things too.

00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:34.180 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yes.

00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:36.388 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's like you're
constantly working through

00:39:36.388 --> 00:39:39.280 align:middle line:84%
during dream time and finding
solutions for yourself,

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:40.810 align:middle line:90%
creating all the time.

00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:43.510 align:middle line:84%
It's such a refreshing
period of our lives

00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:46.090 align:middle line:84%
to be able to
experience all of that

00:39:46.090 --> 00:39:50.120 align:middle line:84%
without the resistance of the
physical world time and space.

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:51.370 align:middle line:90%
You don't need permission.

00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:54.640 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to have any
kind of external tools.

00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:56.398 align:middle line:84%
All the things we
would dream to do

00:39:56.398 --> 00:39:57.940 align:middle line:84%
and we would love
to do in real life,

00:39:57.940 --> 00:39:59.718 align:middle line:90%
we can do easily in dream time.

00:39:59.718 --> 00:40:00.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: It's great fun.

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:02.177 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's
very satisfying.

00:40:02.177 --> 00:40:04.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: It's this fun movie
in your mind every night,

00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:06.650 align:middle line:84%
far better than Netflix,
far more infinite.

00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:07.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Far.

00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:09.130 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: And it's
all about you,

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:12.790 align:middle line:84%
and it's trying to help and
heal you and show you just

00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:14.380 align:middle line:84%
how infinite and
fascinating you are.

00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:14.635 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:14.635 --> 00:40:16.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: I think when people
get older, often they think,

00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:17.140 align:middle line:90%
well, that's it.

00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:17.940 align:middle line:90%
That's me.

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:18.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm me.

00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:20.140 align:middle line:90%
I've stopped it, you know?

00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:22.120 align:middle line:84%
You're dreaming mind
is saying, no, do not

00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:23.590 align:middle line:90%
go gentle into that good night.

00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:26.020 align:middle line:90%
You are incredibly fascinating.

00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:28.630 align:middle line:84%
You could have the next
life-changing idea here,

00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:30.700 align:middle line:84%
or your life could
change radically.

00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:33.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to show you
that you're infinite.

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:35.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about that, about finding

00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:37.838 align:middle line:84%
your own solutions for one
because a lot of people

00:40:37.838 --> 00:40:39.130 align:middle line:90%
want to use dreams practically.

00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:40.640 align:middle line:90%
Like I have a problem.

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:42.170 align:middle line:90%
Can you help me find a solution?

00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:45.190 align:middle line:84%
So what's the best way
to engage with your self

00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:47.830 align:middle line:84%
in terms of finding solutions
and having them presented

00:40:47.830 --> 00:40:48.970 align:middle line:90%
in a way you can recognize?

00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:50.917 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Ask your
dreaming mind before you

00:40:50.917 --> 00:40:53.500 align:middle line:84%
go to sleep at night-- now I'm
going to talk about that period

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:55.840 align:middle line:84%
before you go to sleep at
night, that period before,

00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:57.580 align:middle line:90%
between waking and sleeping.

00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:00.040 align:middle line:84%
It's a magic time
when your brain

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:02.950 align:middle line:84%
goes into the theta state,
which is very impressionable.

00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:05.240 align:middle line:84%
The brains of young children
are often in that state,

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:07.420 align:middle line:84%
and that's why negative
messaging given

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:10.060 align:middle line:84%
to young children is so damaging
because it becomes ingrained.

00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:12.850 align:middle line:84%
However, twice a day, we have
an incredible opportunity

00:41:12.850 --> 00:41:16.060 align:middle line:84%
to change our life and
reprogram our mind for finding

00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:17.530 align:middle line:90%
solutions and being positive.

00:41:17.530 --> 00:41:20.560 align:middle line:84%
That's just on sleeping
and immediately on waking.

00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:22.650 align:middle line:84%
Please treasure those
moments because--

00:41:22.650 --> 00:41:24.880 align:middle line:84%
and they're the moments
that are close to dreams.

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:26.440 align:middle line:84%
So before you go
to sleep at night,

00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:28.630 align:middle line:84%
just run through your
problem in your mind

00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:31.870 align:middle line:84%
and say, dreaming mind,
send me some answers,

00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:35.500 align:middle line:84%
send me some direction,
send me some symbols.

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:37.582 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
morning, write them down.

00:41:37.582 --> 00:41:39.040 align:middle line:84%
Don't try and decode
straight away.

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:39.620 align:middle line:90%
You're busy.

00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:41.078 align:middle line:84%
You've got to get
on with your day.

00:41:41.078 --> 00:41:43.330 align:middle line:84%
The best time to decode is
actually later in the day

00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:45.100 align:middle line:84%
or before you go to bed at
night because your mind's

00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:45.900 align:middle line:90%
on dreaming.

00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:51.220 align:middle line:84%
Free associate, Google-- there's
some actually great dream

00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:53.440 align:middle line:90%
things online that can help you.

00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:56.380 align:middle line:84%
But be a bit wary
though when you do that.

00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:59.440 align:middle line:84%
Any dream decoder that has
a definitive explanation

00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:00.845 align:middle line:90%
for a symbol, stay away.

00:42:00.845 --> 00:42:01.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:03.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: It's got
to be kept fluid,

00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:04.795 align:middle line:84%
and it's got to be open
to your interpretation.

00:42:04.795 --> 00:42:05.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, here's one.

00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:06.340 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:07.330 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Yeah,
these are common--

00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:08.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Goodness gracious.

00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:09.550 align:middle line:90%
What do we have?

00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:11.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Psychological
and spiritual A to Z of--

00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:12.588 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is everything.

00:42:12.588 --> 00:42:15.520 align:middle line:84%
It's like, lipstick, living
room, lock, locus, lollipop,

00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:19.180 align:middle line:84%
loneliness, loss, lizards,
ghosts, germs, gerbils.

00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:21.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there is
everything in here.

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:23.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Freud and
Jung, that, obviously,

00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:26.480 align:middle line:84%
the godparents of
dream interpretation.

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:27.280 align:middle line:90%
But also--

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:28.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know
something not in here

00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:29.500 align:middle line:90%
that I've dreamed about.

00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:30.550 align:middle line:90%
Pig dogs.

00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:31.580 align:middle line:90%
Cute little pig dogs.

00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:32.380 align:middle line:90%
They're like dogs.

00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:32.800 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: It's a pig and a dog.

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:33.600 align:middle line:90%
There's an animals.

00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:34.400 align:middle line:90%
Look under animals.

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:35.200 align:middle line:90%
You could--

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:38.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Have they made it and
created a pig dog with carpet

00:42:38.110 --> 00:42:39.370 align:middle line:90%
around the center of them?

00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:40.390 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:41.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: That's
the dreaming mind.

00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:43.300 align:middle line:84%
See, what your
dreaming mind does,

00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:44.675 align:middle line:84%
it allows you to
make connections

00:42:44.675 --> 00:42:47.030 align:middle line:84%
like that your rational mind
would not allow you to do--

00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:47.830 --> 00:42:48.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:42:48.490 --> 00:42:50.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: --because the only
thing missing in dreams is

00:42:50.350 --> 00:42:51.220 align:middle line:90%
ration, and--

00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:51.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Rationality.

00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:52.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: --reason, and logic.

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:53.670 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:56.620 align:middle line:84%
So set the intention to
dream, ask your dreaming mind

00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:59.450 align:middle line:84%
for a solution, and if you
don't get an answer immediately,

00:42:59.450 --> 00:43:00.550 align:middle line:90%
doesn't matter.

00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:01.575 align:middle line:90%
Don't force.

00:43:01.575 --> 00:43:02.950 align:middle line:84%
Have fun with your
dreaming mind.

00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:04.742 align:middle line:84%
Ask your dreaming mind
the following night.

00:43:04.742 --> 00:43:07.450 align:middle line:84%
As I say, dreams should not
be interpreted in isolation.

00:43:07.450 --> 00:43:09.940 align:middle line:84%
They are connected,
like a series,

00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:12.130 align:middle line:84%
like a series that
runs and runs.

00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:14.680 align:middle line:84%
Your favorite series of all
time on TV, just think of that.

00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:16.013 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just let it run, yeah.

00:43:16.013 --> 00:43:20.075 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: And it will unpick
all the answers over time.

00:43:20.075 --> 00:43:22.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You just have to
have the desire and intention.

00:43:22.450 --> 00:43:23.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yes.

00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:24.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Perfect.

00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:26.600 align:middle line:84%
OK, we're almost out of--
we've had so much fun.

00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:29.110 align:middle line:84%
I have three pages of
things we never got to here.

00:43:29.110 --> 00:43:33.460 align:middle line:84%
But maybe just give us two
of the most prominent themes

00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:35.320 align:middle line:90%
people dream around the world.

00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:37.120 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Well, number one--

00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:39.920 align:middle line:84%
actually, did you know there's
a top 10 of dreams or a top 100?

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:41.200 align:middle line:90%
It's typically falling--

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:42.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Falling.

00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:44.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: --the
sensation of falling,

00:43:44.290 --> 00:43:47.020 align:middle line:84%
and especially during the
pandemic, a lot of people

00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:48.280 align:middle line:90%
were reporting this dream.

00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And it simply means you're
feeling a bit unsupported.

00:43:51.130 --> 00:43:53.470 align:middle line:84%
However, pay attention
to your emotion

00:43:53.470 --> 00:43:55.908 align:middle line:84%
as you fall because
if you're OK,

00:43:55.908 --> 00:43:57.950 align:middle line:84%
it suggests you're going--
just go with the flow.

00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:58.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Go with the flow.

00:43:58.370 --> 00:43:59.890 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Go with the flow.

00:43:59.890 --> 00:44:02.380 align:middle line:84%
And another very, very common
dream-- oh, there's so--

00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:03.250 align:middle line:90%
I want to give you a top 10.

00:44:03.250 --> 00:44:04.917 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know this
is terrible to say

00:44:04.917 --> 00:44:06.010 align:middle line:90%
just do two or three.

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:07.753 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: But the
opposite is flying.

00:44:07.753 --> 00:44:08.920 align:middle line:90%
I'd love everybody to have--

00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:09.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love flying dreams.

00:44:09.070 --> 00:44:09.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: --flying
dreams because that's

00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:11.500 align:middle line:90%
the most incredible dream.

00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:14.950 align:middle line:10%
It shows you need to see the
bigger picture of your life

00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:16.270 align:middle line:10%
and not focus on the details.

00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:17.930 align:middle line:90%
Look at the bigger picture.

00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:18.730 align:middle line:90%
Also, rise above.

00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:20.740 align:middle line:84%
If you're going through
difficult times, rise above.

00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:21.860 align:middle line:90%
You are not your thoughts.

00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:22.902 align:middle line:90%
You're not your emotions.

00:44:22.902 --> 00:44:24.250 align:middle line:90%
You have choice.

00:44:24.250 --> 00:44:27.040 align:middle line:84%
You can influence your dreams,
your thoughts, your feelings.

00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:28.570 align:middle line:90%
You are bigger than them.

00:44:28.570 --> 00:44:30.070 align:middle line:84%
That's what it's
trying to show you.

00:44:30.070 --> 00:44:31.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Any final thoughts?

00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:33.040 align:middle line:90%
We're just out of time here.

00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:34.040 align:middle line:90%
This has been wonderful.

00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:34.998 align:middle line:90%
We could talk for days.

00:44:34.998 --> 00:44:37.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Oh, a Helen
Keller quote comes to mind.

00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:39.230 align:middle line:84%
"The best things
in life are unseen.

00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:43.040 align:middle line:84%
That's why we close our eyes
when we cry, kiss, and dream."

00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:45.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: On that,
thank you so much.

00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:48.227 align:middle line:84%
I thoroughly enjoyed
this conversation.

00:44:48.227 --> 00:44:50.685 align:middle line:84%
And even though you had to fly
over from London to do this,

00:44:50.685 --> 00:44:53.880 align:middle line:84%
