00:00:27.765 --> 00:00:30.010 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: As we
watch, often in horror,

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.540 align:middle line:10%
at the things people and
families and governments

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.740 align:middle line:10%
do to each other, we might find
ourselves asking the question,

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.330 align:middle line:10%
is that the best we can do?

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, according to today's
guest, Daniel Raphael,

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.740 align:middle line:90%
the answer is no.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.370 align:middle line:84%
But it might take
a little guidance

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.320 align:middle line:90%
from some celestial beings.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.180 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.000 align:middle line:84%
And author of "Healing
a Broken World"

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.740 align:middle line:84%
is what I didn't
say in the open.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And you say this-- I want to
get to know you a little bit--

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.720 align:middle line:84%
but this wasn't an
easy book to write.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DANIEL RAPHAEL:
No, it was not.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In a word, no.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.950 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.250 align:middle line:84%
Before we go there, let's
talk about your background.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.780 align:middle line:84%
Because here you were,
a nice Lutheran boy,

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.750 align:middle line:84%
and then now you are
a person who channels

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.300 align:middle line:90%
other beings that come through.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.600 align:middle line:90%
You had many things happen.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.970 align:middle line:90%
You were in Vietnam.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And also, you worked in the
felony corrections business,

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.910 align:middle line:84%
and this must have
had quite an impact

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.841 align:middle line:84%
on how you viewed social
structure on a personal level

00:01:22.841 --> 00:01:23.340 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.450 align:middle line:84%
So let's just start
with your own journey,

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.070 align:middle line:84%
including your stint with
criminal corrections.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.160 align:middle line:10%
>>RAPHAEL: Well, as you say, I
was born in a devout Lutheran

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.990 align:middle line:10%
home, and my spiritual journey
began at about age five.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.540 align:middle line:10%
And I found myself in
Sunday school coloring

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:50.030 align:middle line:10%
a picture of Abraham with
a knife over his head about

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.892 align:middle line:10%
to kill his son on the altar.

00:01:52.892 --> 00:01:55.183 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I had a problem
when I was in Lutheran Sunday

00:01:55.183 --> 00:01:56.836 align:middle line:90%
school with that too.

00:01:56.836 --> 00:01:58.470 align:middle line:90%
I thought, oh, come on.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.380 align:middle line:90%
That's not what happens.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.470 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPHAEL: And I asked
my Sunday school teacher,

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.710 align:middle line:84%
and I asked my mother about
that, and they had no answer.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.289 align:middle line:84%
So the next thing that
happened was Easter time.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.140 align:middle line:90%
Well, go figure.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.160 align:middle line:84%
Here we were coloring
another picture of Jesus

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.220 align:middle line:84%
on the cross between
the two robbers.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And I asked the
teacher about that

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.900 align:middle line:84%
and asked my mother about that
and why Jesus was on the cross.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And they gave me the
old story about making

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.370 align:middle line:90%
a sacrifice for man's sins.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And that just, even at age five,
that didn't make sense to me.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.970 align:middle line:90%
It absolutely didn't make sense.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.540 align:middle line:84%
The logic of it
was totally absent.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was
with you on that,

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.770 align:middle line:90%
asking the same questions.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPHAEL: And it took
me another 40 years,

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.870 align:middle line:84%
until I was about
45, 47 years old,

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.340 align:middle line:84%
before I was able
to have the time

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.910 align:middle line:84%
to do the spiritual,
the theological journey

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.100 align:middle line:84%
to discover the
reasons those occurred

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.040 align:middle line:90%
and why they're illogical.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.835 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:03:01.835 --> 00:03:05.649 align:middle line:84%
Let's go into a little more
personal history, perhaps

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:07.440 align:middle line:84%
working with people
who had been in trouble

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.110 align:middle line:84%
in their life started
fashioning your views as well.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.720 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPHAEL: Well, when I
started at the penitentiary,

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.180 align:middle line:84%
I'd never known
anybody to be arrested,

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.200 align:middle line:84%
ever in jail, had never
visited anybody in prison.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, what prompted
you to end up in this job?

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.670 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPHAEL: We have to go
backwards a little bit.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:29.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, go backwards.

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:30.010 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: OK?

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.190 align:middle line:84%
When I was in
Vietnam, I realized

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.350 align:middle line:84%
that I had been helped
in a counseling situation

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.800 align:middle line:84%
with my Lutheran pastor, and
I liked that environment.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.120 align:middle line:90%
I liked that helping system.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.790 align:middle line:84%
So I applied to the university
to enter in a MSW program

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.170 align:middle line:84%
to become a clinical
psychologist.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.070 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to
approve me, but I

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.510 align:middle line:84%
was one of, oh umpteen, many
dozen people who applied,

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.020 align:middle line:90%
and I wasn't accepted.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.380 align:middle line:84%
So when I got back from
Vietnam, my wife's aunt

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.580 align:middle line:84%
was the superintendent
at the women's prison.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, they
have five new openings

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.900 align:middle line:84%
for prison counselors next
door at the main prison.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.100 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you apply for that?

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was so
green I didn't even

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.250 align:middle line:84%
know the difference between
a clinical psychologist

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.280 align:middle line:90%
and a caseworker, paper-pusher.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.210 align:middle line:90%


00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.420 align:middle line:84%
But so there I was
working in the prison.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:39.150 align:middle line:84%
Had my office on the third floor
of E block, 400 men in a block,

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.510 align:middle line:90%
cell block.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And it was really interesting,
Regina, that I really

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.070 align:middle line:84%
came to appreciate people
as unknown qualities

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.180 align:middle line:84%
and quantities, that no matter
who sat across from you--

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.850 align:middle line:84%
they may have tattoos
all over them.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.450 align:middle line:84%
They may have a grizzled
face, just been rode hard

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.910 align:middle line:90%
and put away wet, so to speak.

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.673 align:middle line:84%
But if you got to know them
and found out who was inside,

00:05:04.673 --> 00:05:10.860 align:middle line:84%
you oftentimes discover
someone worthwhile to talk to.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.540 align:middle line:90%
And so that's one side of it.

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.150 align:middle line:84%
The other side is
that I had never

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.440 align:middle line:84%
seen such moral
impoverishment in society

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.620 align:middle line:90%
so bluntly face to face with me.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And I did intake
reports, and I had

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:31.460 align:middle line:84%
to review the crimes that
they committed and horrendous,

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.280 align:middle line:90%
just horrendous.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And so that really began
my thinking about, what

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:45.200 align:middle line:84%
are the origins of such
unethical, immoral behavior,

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.110 align:middle line:90%
the lack of social conscience?

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And is it heredity or is it
environment sort of thing?

00:05:51.550 --> 00:06:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And so that experience was
a real grinding process

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.035 align:middle line:84%
to hone me and the course
of my life in the future.

00:06:05.035 --> 00:06:07.100 align:middle line:84%
As there was a
spiritual component

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.990 align:middle line:90%
I knew that was a reality.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.180 align:middle line:84%
I knew there was a social
component-- emotional,

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.420 align:middle line:84%
family, physical,
parents, the whole thing.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered, too, why is
it a ghetto mother would have

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:27.920 align:middle line:84%
8 or 10 children out of
wedlock from as many men,

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:34.070 align:middle line:84%
and three of the children would
become professionals-- doctor,

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:39.310 align:middle line:84%
accountant, attorney,
teachers, professors?

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.659 align:middle line:90%
How does that happen?

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:43.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that
gets to be your nature

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.280 align:middle line:84%
versus nurture
question, doesn't it?

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.080 align:middle line:84%
And then something
beyond all of that.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.860 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Yes.

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And something beyond
all that and is

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:52.560 align:middle line:90%
coincidence, happenstance.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.410 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I remember from my
childhood, the wisdom gathering

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.980 align:middle line:84%
that I did early on in
life, that I remember some

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:05.162 align:middle line:84%
of the conversations standing
beside my dad in the field

00:07:05.162 --> 00:07:06.620 align:middle line:84%
as he was talking
to other farmers,

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:11.210 align:middle line:84%
and they were sharing wisdoms
and talk about events.

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:14.310 align:middle line:84%
And I would note some of
those wisdoms that came about.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes that
a person's life

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:19.980 align:middle line:84%
can be changed by
one conversation

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:23.870 align:middle line:84%
not even directed to them
but that they overhear.

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:28.836 align:middle line:84%
And so whenever we have
contact with someone,

00:07:28.836 --> 00:07:30.210 align:middle line:84%
when I have contact
with someone,

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:34.130 align:middle line:84%
I always see the potential
that maybe come out of that.

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:38.040 align:middle line:84%
In the last 10, 15
years, I have had

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:44.480 align:middle line:84%
no un-arranged
relationships with people.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.904 align:middle line:84%
People don't come into my life
anymore without something--

00:07:46.904 --> 00:07:48.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There
has to be purpose.

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.580 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPHAEL: --a purpose
and something occurring.

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And so I give appreciation to
that moment and that person

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.450 align:middle line:84%
because I never know what
I can contribute to them

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:59.664 align:middle line:84%
and what they can contribute
to me and who may be listening.

00:07:59.664 --> 00:08:00.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, absolutely.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:01.490 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:05.010 align:middle line:84%
So now somewhere along the
way, you got some kind of knock

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:08.460 align:middle line:84%
on the noggin, some kind
of closed brain trauma?

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:08.960 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.668 align:middle line:90%
So what happened?

00:08:09.668 --> 00:08:11.075 align:middle line:90%
Because that shifted your life.

00:08:11.075 --> 00:08:11.700 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Yes.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.026 align:middle line:90%
It shifted it tremendously.

00:08:13.026 --> 00:08:16.060 align:middle line:90%


00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:21.100 align:middle line:84%
There was a period of
time before that happened

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:27.260 align:middle line:84%
where my life went kaput, and I
left corrections due to stress.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.440 align:middle line:90%
And one thing leads to another.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:35.340 align:middle line:84%
And eventually I was
putting a bicycle away,

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.010 align:middle line:84%
and I'd rigged a
pulley to pull it up

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:40.919 align:middle line:84%
in the rafters in
my mother's garage.

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And I was standing
on this ladder,

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:47.710 align:middle line:84%
and the next thing I knew I
was in hospital with my arm

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:49.820 align:middle line:90%
in a sling.

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.730 align:middle line:90%
I was on morphine.

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And my first thought, how
am I going to pay for this?

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:03.300 align:middle line:84%
Almost immediately it's like,
that's not your concern.

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:05.630 align:middle line:90%
They're here to help you heal.

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:06.631 align:middle line:90%
Take care of that later.

00:09:06.631 --> 00:09:08.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When you say
almost immediately,

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:09.790 align:middle line:90%
is that a thought you had?

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:11.630 align:middle line:90%
Or was it a transmission?

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:12.500 align:middle line:90%
Was it a voice?

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:13.881 align:middle line:90%
Well, how did that come to you?

00:09:13.881 --> 00:09:15.880 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPHAEL: It was inner
thought, but the clarity

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.260 align:middle line:90%
was really poignant.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.150 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to the fall,
OK, because something

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:22.950 align:middle line:84%
really incredible
happened at the time.

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:25.490 align:middle line:90%


00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:27.770 align:middle line:84%
I landed on the
concrete floor head

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:30.880 align:middle line:84%
first after falling
off a 6-foot ladder.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:33.355 align:middle line:84%
Hit my left side of my
head on the concrete floor.

00:09:33.355 --> 00:09:36.260 align:middle line:90%


00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.430 align:middle line:84%
The brain is in a
fluid state, and so it

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:42.335 align:middle line:84%
banged back and forth, and
I had an internal contusion,

00:09:42.335 --> 00:09:45.060 align:middle line:90%
a bruise to my brain.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:50.000 align:middle line:84%
But I was out for about four
hours, and during that time

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.826 align:middle line:84%
I got to see the wiring under
the board of the universe.

00:09:53.826 --> 00:09:55.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Explain
the experience.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.075 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPHAEL: It was a
transpersonal experience.

00:09:57.075 --> 00:10:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And through regression
therapy I remembered that.

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:06.020 align:middle line:84%
And I remember it was an
out-of-body experience as well.

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:08.860 align:middle line:84%
And my body was
laying over there,

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:14.310 align:middle line:84%
and I was standing,
floating there.

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:18.390 align:middle line:84%
And my perspective
of my body then

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:21.580 align:middle line:84%
was just as though
you would have

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:24.127 align:middle line:84%
the same feeling about the
coat you left out on the rack.

00:10:24.127 --> 00:10:26.085 align:middle line:84%
You haven't thought of
it since then, have you?

00:10:26.085 --> 00:10:28.944 align:middle line:84%
I had no regard for
that body at all.

00:10:28.944 --> 00:10:31.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that seems to
be what most people experience

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.940 align:middle line:84%
once they, for whatever
reason, are jettisoned out.

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:34.960 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Yeah.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And so after that happened,
through the next two or three

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:44.040 align:middle line:84%
years, it was a
very slow process.

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.700 align:middle line:84%
I underwent-- one
of the symptoms

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:50.220 align:middle line:84%
of a traumatic closed head
injury is personality change.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:54.510 align:middle line:90%
And we'll let that sit.

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:55.230 align:middle line:90%
OK, for a bit.

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:58.770 align:middle line:90%


00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:02.640 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, when
I was viewing my body,

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:05.360 align:middle line:84%
I had the understanding
that I could

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.690 align:middle line:84%
either cross over or
stay here and complete

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:11.320 align:middle line:90%
the work I had begun.

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And I chose to stay
here and complete

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.710 align:middle line:90%
the work that I had begun.

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:21.420 align:middle line:84%
I'd begun-- back in Vietnam,
I had had some notes

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.350 align:middle line:84%
from about the demonstrations
of the students

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:25.452 align:middle line:84%
and Kent State and
all that stuff,

00:11:25.452 --> 00:11:27.160 align:middle line:84%
and I thought there
must be a better way.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And that began some of
my earliest thoughts

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:31.310 align:middle line:90%
on sustainable democracy.

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:31.810 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:36.070 align:middle line:90%


00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:41.200 align:middle line:84%
So I came back, and I had
to recuperate physically,

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.560 align:middle line:90%
and I had to heal myself.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.540 align:middle line:84%
During that episode, between
the time after corrections

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.700 align:middle line:84%
and this accident,
I had virtually

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:53.300 align:middle line:84%
lost everything-- wife,
children, retirement,

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:54.680 align:middle line:90%
all the assets.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And then the hospital bill
took out the rest of the cash.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.240 align:middle line:84%
So after that, I began
a long-term period

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.270 align:middle line:90%
of living as an ascetic.

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:08.750 align:middle line:84%
I lived as an ascetic for about
10, 12 years and very simply.

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:16.580 align:middle line:84%
And during that time, I began
to realize that my thinking was

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:19.360 align:middle line:90%
different than it was before.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.660 align:middle line:90%
It was qualitatively different.

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:28.930 align:middle line:84%
And that I had the same history,
same children, same wives,

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:33.200 align:middle line:84%
same parents, all that
stuff, same relationships,

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.150 align:middle line:90%
but I was thinking differently.

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:37.660 align:middle line:84%
It was like someone
else's thought.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And because of my work
in criminal corrections,

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:46.760 align:middle line:84%
I knew the difference
between schizophrenia,

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:50.130 align:middle line:84%
dissociative personality
disorder, multiple personality

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:53.150 align:middle line:90%
disorder, and hallucinations.

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:54.150 align:middle line:90%
And I fit none of those.

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:57.790 align:middle line:90%


00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And so 1993, I left Oregon
and lighted into Colorado

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:06.400 align:middle line:90%
to stay with my relatives.

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:12.270 align:middle line:84%
And in December 1994, I
changed my name completely.

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:16.000 align:middle line:84%
Because I had run into some
other people who had the same

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.420 align:middle line:84%
problem, and some people
had tried to go back to work

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:21.375 align:middle line:90%
and couldn't.

00:13:21.375 --> 00:13:25.710 align:middle line:84%
I think of a powerful marketing
executive, this woman I met.

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:28.192 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I
was a breadwinner.

00:13:28.192 --> 00:13:28.900 align:middle line:90%
I was going back.

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:29.650 align:middle line:90%
This is my career.

00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:31.040 align:middle line:90%
This is who I am.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I went
back on a Wednesday,

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.375 align:middle line:90%
and I left on Thursday.

00:13:37.375 --> 00:13:39.080 align:middle line:84%
I put everything in
a box and went home.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because she's
fundamentally different.

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:41.260 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPHAEL: Yeah,
mentally different.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:42.520 align:middle line:90%
She didn't have the drive.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:42.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:43.540 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Yeah.

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:44.165 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:44.165 --> 00:13:45.370 align:middle line:90%
And so that happened to you.

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:45.995 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Yes.

00:13:45.995 --> 00:13:49.102 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you change your
name away from x to the name

00:13:49.102 --> 00:13:50.560 align:middle line:84%
we know you as now,
Daniel Raphael.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:51.700 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Daniel Raphael.

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:52.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:53.840 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPHAEL: Prior to
the time, the angels

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:57.000 align:middle line:90%
had been calling me Daniel.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.980 align:middle line:84%
They knew my name, but they'd
always addressed me as Daniel.

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:04.710 align:middle line:84%
And so when I changed my
name-- I like the Italian name.

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:09.910 align:middle line:84%
So it was either Donatello,
or one of the Ninja Turtles,

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:10.870 align:middle line:90%
or Raphael.

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:13.490 align:middle line:90%
And so I chose Raphael.

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:14.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:18.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, somewhere in this mix, you
began coming into association

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:22.180 align:middle line:84%
with your angels, guides,
we all have different names

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:22.890 align:middle line:90%
for the beings.

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:23.520 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Yes.

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us about that,
because that now sets up

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:26.350 align:middle line:90%
the story.

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:28.350 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPHAEL: Well, I'd been
talking to my guardian

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:30.890 align:middle line:90%
angel most of my life.

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:35.700 align:middle line:84%
When I was alone by myself
and out playing or working,

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:36.960 align:middle line:90%
I'd talk to my guardian angel.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.840 align:middle line:84%
I didn't hear
anything at that time.

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:39.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I was going to ask.

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:41.584 align:middle line:84%
So talking to them,
it was a one-way deal.

00:14:41.584 --> 00:14:42.250 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Yeah.

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:50.910 align:middle line:84%
So during my recovery, I had
a period-- I was deeply alone.

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:53.350 align:middle line:90%
Let me go-- yeah, deeply alone.

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And so I began talking
to my guardian angel.

00:14:56.890 --> 00:14:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
what is your name?

00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:00.980 align:middle line:90%
Nada, nothing.

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:02.200 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.710 align:middle line:84%
So I knew how they
worked because I'd

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:07.280 align:middle line:84%
read-- in the '70s
and '80s, '90s,

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.950 align:middle line:84%
they had a lot of
angel books out.

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:12.700 align:middle line:84%
So one day I was
reading something.

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.070 align:middle line:90%
I knew it was Eah something.

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:21.555 align:middle line:84%
And one day I was reading a book
totally unrelated to the name.

00:15:21.555 --> 00:15:24.210 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going, it's Leah.

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:27.720 align:middle line:90%
And I said, is that your name?

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:28.830 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:31.370 align:middle line:84%
So when you ask a
question, they will

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:33.460 align:middle line:84%
answer before the last
syllable of your question.

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:34.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:35.380 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: OK?

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And so that
authenticates it for me.

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:39.840 align:middle line:90%


00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:46.710 align:middle line:84%
And then in 1992, I sat
in on a Urantia Book--

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:49.350 align:middle line:90%
a study group, a reading group.

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:53.430 align:middle line:84%
And some friends of
mine had said, well,

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:55.550 align:middle line:84%
you need to come to
the reading group.

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:57.460 align:middle line:84%
It's different
than it used to be.

00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.415 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, I've
been to dozens of them.

00:15:59.415 --> 00:16:02.019 align:middle line:84%
And you've been to one,
you've been to them all.

00:16:02.019 --> 00:16:03.560 align:middle line:84%
And they said, no,
this is different.

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:05.740 align:middle line:90%
So I went.

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:08.550 align:middle line:84%
And there was my
ex-wife, my soon to be

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:13.420 align:middle line:84%
ex-wife, sitting in a
corner in an easy chair.

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:15.280 align:middle line:90%
And no one was saying anything.

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't see any Urantia
Books under the chairs

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:19.660 align:middle line:90%
or on their laps.

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:22.460 align:middle line:90%
So I was quiet.

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon
someone said, well,

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:28.470 align:middle line:84%
I guess everybody who's going
to be here is going to be here.

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:30.330 align:middle line:84%
And so everybody
closed their eyes

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:32.040 align:middle line:84%
for a moment of
silence, an invocation.

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon my ex-wife
began channeling Abigail.

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:43.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, my ex-wife and I had
done public speaking together.

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:44.840 align:middle line:84%
We'd done a lot of
writing together.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.290 align:middle line:84%
And I knew who this
woman was and who

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:50.830 align:middle line:84%
she was bringing
through was not her,

00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:53.300 align:middle line:84%
but someone who really
had a grasp of the larger

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:55.850 align:middle line:84%
perspectives of the
Urantia Book and talked

00:16:55.850 --> 00:17:00.170 align:middle line:84%
about our evolving
relationship between ourselves

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:05.490 align:middle line:84%
and spirit and our lives in
this world and our world itself.

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:07.840 align:middle line:84%
And I learned that
her job, Abigail's job

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:12.140 align:middle line:84%
and other teachers' jobs,
was to introduce people

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:19.380 align:middle line:84%
to universal social conscience,
ethics, and morality.

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:21.839 align:middle line:90%
It's a Teaching Mission.

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:24.990 align:middle line:90%
So I drove home.

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And after the third
time I said, well,

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:30.950 align:middle line:84%
Christ, Michael, Jesus, that
person, personality, I said,

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:33.640 align:middle line:84%
do you think this
would be helpful to me

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:37.670 align:middle line:84%
help your world enter in
the days of light and life?

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:38.830 align:middle line:90%
I would like to do this.

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And I ask your permission,
and you'd lead me into that.

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:50.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, one year later, I became a
clairaudient conscious channel.

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:52.976 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And does that
lead us to the being?

00:17:52.976 --> 00:17:54.130 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: To the being.

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:55.787 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To the
being, Monjoronson.

00:17:55.787 --> 00:17:56.370 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: No.

00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:59.249 align:middle line:84%
Monjoronson doesn't show
up into my life until 2006.

00:17:59.249 --> 00:17:59.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:00.940 align:middle line:90%
So let's just pick it up.

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:02.275 align:middle line:90%
So we're still in the '90s then.

00:18:02.275 --> 00:18:02.900 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Yes.

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:05.316 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's talk about
how you got to Monjoronson,

00:18:05.316 --> 00:18:07.920 align:middle line:84%
and then we're going to talk
about the quality and the type

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.340 align:middle line:84%
of information that
was coming through.

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:09.965 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Yes.

00:18:09.965 --> 00:18:12.840 align:middle line:90%


00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:16.390 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't doing very much
channeling in the '90s.

00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:20.580 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't until 1998,
'99 that I really

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:25.220 align:middle line:84%
became fluent,
continuous, very smooth.

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:28.844 align:middle line:90%


00:18:28.844 --> 00:18:33.945 align:middle line:84%
And I was doing some-- my own
channeling, TRing, Transmitting

00:18:33.945 --> 00:18:37.270 align:middle line:84%
and Receiving, on the
keyboard close-eyed.

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:38.240 align:middle line:90%
So I had to glue--

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:38.948 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:18:38.948 --> 00:18:41.440 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPHAEL: --some
buttons to my keyboard

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:43.100 align:middle line:90%
so I can read it later on.

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:48.280 align:middle line:84%
And so then I
wouldn't read them.

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:49.724 align:middle line:84%
It's like writing
letters to God.

00:18:49.724 --> 00:18:51.640 align:middle line:84%
You put the letters away,
and a week later you

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:53.160 align:middle line:90%
open it up and read it.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:57.920 align:middle line:84%
And you can measure
the validity of it.

00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:59.585 align:middle line:90%
And so that's what I do.

00:18:59.585 --> 00:19:03.810 align:middle line:84%
I was really startled at
some of the quality of it,

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:05.860 align:middle line:90%
and I read closely.

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:09.010 align:middle line:84%
You will continue to hear
the word "discernment"

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:10.210 align:middle line:90%
through my discussion.

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:13.580 align:middle line:84%
Discerning, knowing how
to discern carefully

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:16.540 align:middle line:84%
is a secret to gaining
wisdom and what

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:20.360 align:middle line:84%
is good wisdom and
what is bad wisdom.

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:24.390 align:middle line:90%
And also the art of inquiry.

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:25.760 align:middle line:90%
That's vital.

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And before I was channeling,
I learned the art of inquiry.

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:33.540 align:middle line:84%
I had to deal with
my guardian angel,

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:36.470 align:middle line:84%
and I would do the
yes/no business.

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:39.710 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually,
before I could hear,

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:48.100 align:middle line:84%
I began to not
test, but say, how's

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:50.530 align:middle line:90%
my work going to be tomorrow?

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:52.254 align:middle line:90%
It'll be light.

00:19:52.254 --> 00:19:53.295 align:middle line:90%
What tools should I take?

00:19:53.295 --> 00:19:56.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, this sounds
like psychic stuff.

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:58.014 align:middle line:84%
And I would have the
list-- are you sure

00:19:58.014 --> 00:19:59.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to need this tool?

00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:00.730 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:03.690 align:middle line:84%
So I'd take it, put it
in the car, away we go.

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:05.980 align:middle line:84%
Next day I was like,
glad I brought that.

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:09.180 align:middle line:84%
So these were living
affirmations of connection.

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And what they really want
to do during this era

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:17.484 align:middle line:84%
is to establish personal
relationships with us.

00:20:17.484 --> 00:20:18.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:20.840 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: OK?

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.332 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It has to be
a very frustrating job.

00:20:23.332 --> 00:20:27.950 align:middle line:84%
If you are assigned to help
humanity or an individual who

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:31.450 align:middle line:84%
has no idea you exist and
never calls upon your services,

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:32.855 align:middle line:90%
that's a very boring job.

00:20:32.855 --> 00:20:33.480 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Yes.

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Frustrating
and boring.

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:39.370 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPHAEL: I had done
something early in my life.

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:43.360 align:middle line:84%
As this child growing
older before graduation

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.290 align:middle line:84%
from high school,
I'd always prayed

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:48.410 align:middle line:90%
to help others help themselves.

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:51.590 align:middle line:90%
I also prayed to do God's will.

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:54.880 align:middle line:84%
So helping others
to help themselves,

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.670 align:middle line:84%
it's better to
teach people to fish

00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:59.300 align:middle line:90%
rather than provide the fish.

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And doing God's will, I
didn't learn the true aspect

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:08.670 align:middle line:84%
of how you know that until
about six, seven years ago.

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And that is if there's something
in your life that you need

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:18.306 align:middle line:84%
or something that would
be beneficial to others,

00:21:18.306 --> 00:21:19.430 align:middle line:90%
you ask for an opportunity.

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:22.680 align:middle line:90%


00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:26.370 align:middle line:84%
People pray-- not my will,
but your will be done.

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:28.800 align:middle line:84%
But I pray for
opportunities to come

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:31.230 align:middle line:84%
to me that would
lead me into the work

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:32.890 align:middle line:90%
that I'm supposed to do.

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And one time I waited
for three years.

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:38.400 align:middle line:90%
Three years.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:39.600 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.110 align:middle line:90%
That's a while.

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:43.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, but there's
no time in the same sense

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:44.410 align:middle line:90%
from their domain.

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:45.380 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: No.

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very
astute thing you said.

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:52.180 align:middle line:84%
Because they operate totally
on developmental progress.

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:52.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:54.470 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Time is irrelevant.

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:57.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:59.725 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPHAEL: And so
we'll get into what

00:21:59.725 --> 00:22:03.589 align:middle line:84%
is the time right now for them
to show up and begin helping

00:22:03.589 --> 00:22:04.630 align:middle line:90%
us much more consciously.

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:04.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:06.770 align:middle line:84%
So now let's get to
where you met Monjoronson

00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:09.675 align:middle line:84%
and then get into
the work that started

00:22:09.675 --> 00:22:12.050 align:middle line:84%
becoming the framework for
the work you're doing now in--

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:12.675 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Yes.

00:22:12.675 --> 00:22:15.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --"Healing
a Broken World."

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:16.790 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPHAEL: I had
heard of a conference

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:19.170 align:middle line:90%
in Santa Barbara in 2006.

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:22.320 align:middle line:90%
I think it was early 2006.

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And two women had used a team
approach with a group of people

00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:35.280 align:middle line:84%
to achieve some sort of a
goal or object or completion

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.330 align:middle line:90%
of a project.

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:38.970 align:middle line:84%
And that they also
had one person

00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:43.930 align:middle line:84%
who was a channel who would
just be there as a consultant,

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:45.600 align:middle line:90%
not as an ongoing contributor.

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.710 align:middle line:84%
But when people
get stuck, they ask

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:50.360 align:middle line:90%
the consultant for this answer.

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:54.630 align:middle line:90%
So I thought, wow, that's great.

00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And I had already
developed a schema, format,

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:06.050 align:middle line:84%
for asking questions
that led to fulfillment,

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:11.490 align:middle line:84%
and so I began to
think about that.

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And how do we develop
a group of people?

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:18.470 align:middle line:90%
And so I do a lot of meditation.

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:20.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, meditate
or contemplation

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:23.630 align:middle line:90%
as well and reflective thinking.

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:26.480 align:middle line:84%
They're all in the
same park, ballpark.

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:30.240 align:middle line:84%
And it came to me
that what we needed

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:31.690 align:middle line:90%
was a team that had roles.

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:35.380 align:middle line:90%


00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And I knew from group
dynamics that you would

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:39.690 align:middle line:90%
need between 5 and 11 people.

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:42.650 align:middle line:90%
Optimum number is 7 to 9.

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And then if you had
specific roles in there,

00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:50.430 align:middle line:84%
like as a facilitator-- not a
leader, a facilitator, and then

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:51.310 align:middle line:90%
a recorder.

00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:53.970 align:middle line:84%
The recorder would
record the ahas,

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:55.990 align:middle line:90%
those conceptual developments.

00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:58.850 align:middle line:84%
And also when
people have an aha,

00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:01.704 align:middle line:84%
sometimes it takes the group
off in a different direction.

00:24:01.704 --> 00:24:02.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:04.000 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPHAEL: So someone
needs to remember

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.310 align:middle line:90%
that last line of inquiry.

00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:08.640 align:middle line:90%
So the recorder does that too.

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes
people wander around

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:13.310 align:middle line:84%
and they go, oh, well,
that was a great idea,

00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:15.600 align:middle line:84%
but we need to get back
to-- well, where were we?

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:16.690 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
recorder comes in.

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:17.220 align:middle line:90%
Very simple.

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:18.190 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:20.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're
looking at a functional

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.326 align:middle line:90%
kind of group dynamic.

00:24:21.326 --> 00:24:21.950 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Yes.

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:22.533 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:22.533 --> 00:24:24.777 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPHAEL: That curious
people would ask.

00:24:24.777 --> 00:24:25.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:28.510 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPHAEL: Art of inquiry type
thing, people in the community.

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:30.700 align:middle line:90%
And then there was a consultant.

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:36.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, this team composition can
be secular, totally secular

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:40.050 align:middle line:84%
without any spirituality,
or it can be

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:42.350 align:middle line:90%
with the spiritual orientation.

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:45.050 align:middle line:84%
The consultant
would be some person

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:48.510 align:middle line:84%
who understands the intention of
the group, the project they're

00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:51.810 align:middle line:84%
working, and sees the intention
of social sustainability

00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:54.400 align:middle line:84%
as a long-term project,
not just 5 years

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.530 align:middle line:90%
or 50 years but 500 years.

00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:59.640 align:middle line:84%
How does our piece contribute
to the sustainability

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:03.970 align:middle line:84%
of global civilization, or
society, or communities?

00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And then the rest of the
members are inquiring members.

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:09.020 align:middle line:90%
They're the most vital.

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:11.890 align:middle line:84%
Everybody asks
questions, but their job

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:15.000 align:middle line:84%
is to ask competent, capable,
and cogent questions.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.350 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:21.446 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the
composition of that.

00:25:21.446 --> 00:25:26.030 align:middle line:84%
That developed out of
that 2006, 2007, 2008.

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:32.700 align:middle line:84%
And in 2007, I held a
workshop in Snowbird, Utah

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:36.310 align:middle line:84%
and invited people to
come and participate

00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:38.300 align:middle line:90%
to learn about this process.

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't necessarily to
do it, to do the work of a team

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:46.110 align:middle line:84%
but to learn to
understand it and what

00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:48.790 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual beings
were up to you

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:52.540 align:middle line:84%
and why this was
needed at this time.

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:58.550 align:middle line:84%
And then in 2008, I had a
workshop in San Miguel de

00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:03.590 align:middle line:84%
Allende, Mexico, and it
was a vacationing workshop.

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:05.570 align:middle line:84%
So we worked four
hours in the morning,

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:06.870 align:middle line:90%
and the rest of the day is--

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:08.334 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, San Miguel's
nice for that, yeah.

00:26:08.334 --> 00:26:09.310 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Yes.

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And that was very successful,
and it broke even.

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:15.390 align:middle line:90%


00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:16.950 align:middle line:90%
And then there was a hiatus.

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:20.890 align:middle line:90%
In 2009, I did my first YouTube.

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And all during this
time, these concepts

00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:26.420 align:middle line:84%
were beginning to
develop and evolve.

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And I was working daily
with the spiritual teachers

00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:34.640 align:middle line:84%
who were working with
me in this progress.

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And you got to throw away
your clock working with them.

00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:41.920 align:middle line:84%
What you're looking for
is the next aha, the next

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:43.095 align:middle line:90%
spontaneous development--

00:26:43.095 --> 00:26:43.761 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:43.761 --> 00:26:47.280 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPHAEL: --the one development
that leads to another.

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:52.219 align:middle line:84%
And so that brings us up
pretty close to the present.

00:26:52.219 --> 00:26:52.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:55.569 align:middle line:84%
Well, where did
Monjoronson come in?

00:26:55.569 --> 00:26:56.860 align:middle line:90%
That's what I was asking, yeah.

00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:58.704 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Monjoronson.

00:26:58.704 --> 00:27:00.370 align:middle line:84%
It's really interesting
you bring him up

00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:03.915 align:middle line:84%
because I repudiated
him to begin with.

00:27:03.915 --> 00:27:07.760 align:middle line:84%
His name came up in about
2004, and I didn't channel him.

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And I thought this is just some
machination of somebody else's

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:16.500 align:middle line:84%
mind, and so I left that
alone for two or three years.

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:20.570 align:middle line:84%
And finally, I was
meditating one day,

00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:24.090 align:middle line:84%
and he came in and said,
this is Monjoronson.

00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:26.770 align:middle line:90%
May I have a word with you?

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:29.470 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:31.790 align:middle line:84%
So that validated that, and
one thing led to another.

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And then we did a series of
sessions, transcribed sessions

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:39.250 align:middle line:84%
every two weeks with
conversations with Monjoronson.

00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:42.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what was the
nature of the transmission that

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:44.300 align:middle line:90%
was going on?

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:48.480 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPHAEL: His work is
to use the people who

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:51.260 align:middle line:84%
graduated or came out of
the Teaching Mission who

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:53.720 align:middle line:84%
were morally and
ethically responsible

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:57.310 align:middle line:84%
and responsive to
then become players

00:27:57.310 --> 00:27:59.670 align:middle line:84%
in the Magisterial Mission,
which is a much more

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:04.830 align:middle line:84%
pragmatic approach to social
evolution, social development,

00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:08.265 align:middle line:90%
that societies could evolve.

00:28:08.265 --> 00:28:11.272 align:middle line:90%


00:28:11.272 --> 00:28:12.460 align:middle line:90%
I'll leave it at that.

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:15.470 align:middle line:90%


00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:18.850 align:middle line:84%
So it's interesting,
Regina, that

00:28:18.850 --> 00:28:21.840 align:middle line:84%
being a channel-- I've been an
active channel for 20 years.

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And when you sit as a
channel and this wisdom

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:29.600 align:middle line:84%
comes through you, and you
are just part of the audience,

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:34.540 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, and I'm listening
to it as anybody else is.

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:38.550 align:middle line:84%
And much of it is just like,
well, that's new to me.

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:40.830 align:middle line:84%
It's very interesting, and
more pieces of the puzzle

00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:42.640 align:middle line:90%
get put in.

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:46.333 align:middle line:90%
So this whole process developed.

00:28:46.333 --> 00:28:52.990 align:middle line:84%
And the big project of his
work is not the reclamation.

00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:56.710 align:middle line:84%
This is not to reform people
or to reclaim societies.

00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:59.890 align:middle line:84%
This is to create something
new because there's

00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:02.090 align:middle line:90%
no fixing the old paradigms.

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:05.150 align:middle line:84%
That's the wisdom
that comes through

00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:07.370 align:middle line:84%
and which many other
teachers say as well.

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:12.660 align:middle line:90%


00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:15.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, the reason
I ask is because now

00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:19.880 align:middle line:84%
when we start getting into the
actual functional framework

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:22.570 align:middle line:84%
of all of this information
that was amassed--

00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:25.730 align:middle line:84%
and I assume it was through
you and a group of individuals.

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:28.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, are many
groups of people--

00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:30.850 align:middle line:84%
how did it work where this
whole body of information

00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:36.120 align:middle line:84%
came through in terms of
giving a blueprint for creating

00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:38.603 align:middle line:90%
socially sustainable societies?

00:29:38.603 --> 00:29:43.010 align:middle line:90%


00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:45.360 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPHAEL: The body
of my channel work

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:49.250 align:middle line:84%
really begins in
August, September 2001,

00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:51.680 align:middle line:84%
after Snowbird--
and we came back.

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:55.470 align:middle line:10%
And a lady who lives
in Loveland said, well,

00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:58.570 align:middle line:10%
why don't you come up and let's
have a weekly-- or every two

00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:01.025 align:middle line:10%
weeks-- a session where we
have somebody come through

00:30:01.025 --> 00:30:01.730 align:middle line:10%
to teach us?

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:07.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, the first teacher that
came through was Rayson,

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:10.040 align:middle line:84%
and he taught us for
two, three years.

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And so then after that,
we had several subjects

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:14.610 align:middle line:90%
that came about.

00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:16.920 align:middle line:84%
But we'd meet every
two weeks, and this

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:21.580 align:middle line:84%
was recorded and transcribed
and sent out to people

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:25.100 align:middle line:90%
on the mailing list by email.

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:30.480 align:middle line:84%
Then when I got more
clear that Monjoronson

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:34.310 align:middle line:84%
was a legitimate individual
and that there was something

00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:38.410 align:middle line:84%
to do meaningful
with them, for him,

00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:39.910 align:middle line:90%
I began to have more interest.

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's when my time
in Vietnam and my notes

00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:48.540 align:middle line:84%
and the developments
of these thoughts

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:51.120 align:middle line:84%
came together, come
together, with my thoughts

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:53.127 align:middle line:90%
of social sustainability.

00:30:53.127 --> 00:30:54.335 align:middle line:90%
First, it was sustainability.

00:30:54.335 --> 00:30:59.840 align:middle line:84%
He talked about sustainability
in 2004 and 2006 and so on.

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:03.660 align:middle line:84%
But then it became
very much more honed,

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:06.450 align:middle line:84%
particularly in the
last three, four years,

00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:10.570 align:middle line:90%
as "sustainability" is the word.

00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:12.550 align:middle line:84%
Everybody talks
about sustainability.

00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And so I was guided to
discern the difference

00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:22.660 align:middle line:84%
between the subcategories
of sustainability

00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:24.170 align:middle line:84%
as material
sustainability, which

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:28.820 align:middle line:84%
is quantity object-oriented,
and social sustainability, which

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:32.010 align:middle line:90%
was quality value-oriented.

00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:34.480 align:middle line:90%
One has to do with people.

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:39.000 align:middle line:84%
If there's no people, then
the world would heal itself.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.990 align:middle line:84%
So to have sustainability
of our material world,

00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:44.960 align:middle line:84%
we need to do as
many Boulderites do,

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:48.030 align:middle line:84%
participate in some
project of sustainability.

00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:52.620 align:middle line:84%
But how about reclaiming-- how
about inventing, developing,

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:56.106 align:middle line:84%
creating sustainable
family dynamics?

00:31:56.106 --> 00:31:56.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:58.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is where we
start getting into more

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:00.575 align:middle line:90%
of what was told to you, right?

00:32:00.575 --> 00:32:01.200 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Yes.

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:01.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:04.770 align:middle line:90%
So we can go through this.

00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:07.340 align:middle line:84%
The framework here has
a few different areas

00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:10.800 align:middle line:84%
to it-- government, business,
culture, and individual.

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:12.700 align:middle line:84%
So we're starting,
it sounds like,

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:14.440 align:middle line:84%
more on an individual
level then.

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:17.270 align:middle line:84%
Let's go from there, and let's
get very specific about what

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:20.040 align:middle line:84%
the information was that
came through in terms of,

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:24.610 align:middle line:84%
how do you begin growing
socially-responsible cultures

00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:27.400 align:middle line:84%
starting with the
individual that is

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:28.824 align:middle line:90%
being birthed into the world?

00:32:28.824 --> 00:32:30.490 align:middle line:84%
Because some of this
gets controversial.

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:34.370 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about-- very
controversial actually--

00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:37.350 align:middle line:90%
about the nature of parenting.

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:38.410 align:middle line:90%
What's required?

00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:42.040 align:middle line:84%
Or in their ideal
vision of it, what

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:44.730 align:middle line:84%
would be required
for parents to even

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:46.010 align:middle line:90%
have children to begin with?

00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:47.660 align:middle line:84%
So let's start
there in this story.

00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:48.080 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Sure.

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:48.880 align:middle line:90%
Excellent question.

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:52.470 align:middle line:84%
It begins with a
procreative couple, that is,

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:55.110 align:middle line:84%
two individuals who want
to live together and want

00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:57.900 align:middle line:90%
to have a family.

00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:01.500 align:middle line:84%
And they are the
individuals who enculturate

00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:03.450 align:middle line:90%
the child, their children.

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:07.470 align:middle line:84%
And so we must begin with
the enculturating parents

00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:12.730 align:middle line:84%
first so that they understand
their responsibilities

00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:15.610 align:middle line:84%
to bring in a child
who will eventually

00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:20.390 align:middle line:84%
learn their skills to transmit
their own social skills

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:23.270 align:middle line:84%
to their children,
the grandchildren,

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:25.300 align:middle line:84%
so that they are
socially sustainable.

00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:26.040 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:28.490 align:middle line:90%
That is the ultimate object.

00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:31.930 align:middle line:84%
Society has a play in
that most definitely.

00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:35.870 align:middle line:84%
So you start with the
procreative couple.

00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:42.117 align:middle line:84%
And as they learn how to
raise their child-- let's

00:33:42.117 --> 00:33:43.700 align:middle line:84%
leave those specifics
alone for a bit.

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:44.980 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:47.580 align:middle line:90%
Let's get the larger picture.

00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:49.190 align:middle line:90%
They will raise this child.

00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:52.230 align:middle line:84%
They'll learn about
child development,

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:54.150 align:middle line:84%
what children learn
at different ages,

00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:56.620 align:middle line:84%
and how they
participate in that.

00:33:56.620 --> 00:34:00.310 align:middle line:84%
Then how they participate
in raising that child

00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:05.610 align:middle line:84%
and enculturating a child is a
tremendous educational process

00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:08.747 align:middle line:84%
for themselves as well
because this is in preparation

00:34:08.747 --> 00:34:09.705 align:middle line:90%
for being grandparents.

00:34:09.705 --> 00:34:13.929 align:middle line:90%


00:34:13.929 --> 00:34:16.594 align:middle line:90%
So that's the individual.

00:34:16.594 --> 00:34:18.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So these are
very specific protocols

00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:21.450 align:middle line:84%
that were brought through
by the channel beings?

00:34:21.450 --> 00:34:22.550 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Mm-hmm.

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:23.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:25.750 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPHAEL: They brought
through the continuum

00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:27.600 align:middle line:90%
of sustainability.

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:32.795 align:middle line:84%
The continuum begins before
birth, and pregnancy,

00:34:32.795 --> 00:34:36.850 align:middle line:84%
the birth, first two
weeks, first couple months,

00:34:36.850 --> 00:34:38.010 align:middle line:90%
first year.

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:40.659 align:middle line:84%
And then what are the
significant markers,

00:34:40.659 --> 00:34:43.150 align:middle line:84%
developmental markers,
social markers that

00:34:43.150 --> 00:34:46.790 align:middle line:84%
occur during a person's
life until they leave home?

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:49.980 align:middle line:84%
And during each of
these stages, the child

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:58.695 align:middle line:84%
learns specific skills, and
specific attitudes and values.

00:34:58.695 --> 00:35:03.090 align:middle line:90%


00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:06.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And who is the
arbiter of that information?

00:35:06.130 --> 00:35:11.255 align:middle line:84%
The beings pass some of this
information on, and then

00:35:11.255 --> 00:35:14.100 align:middle line:84%
who is supposed to give
these directives as

00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:15.740 align:middle line:84%
to how these children
should be raised?

00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And what is the
expectation in terms

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:22.060 align:middle line:90%
of levels of participation?

00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:23.610 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Excellent question.

00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:26.570 align:middle line:84%
As you know, there's no
making anybody do anything.

00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:27.710 align:middle line:90%
Correct?

00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And so there are no external
arbiters, as people,

00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:34.810 align:middle line:90%
as bodies, a group.

00:35:34.810 --> 00:35:39.390 align:middle line:84%
But there are values that
are intrinsic, innate,

00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:43.370 align:middle line:90%
to us as individuals.

00:35:43.370 --> 00:35:45.295 align:middle line:90%
Our species is sustainable.

00:35:45.295 --> 00:35:49.120 align:middle line:90%


00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:53.020 align:middle line:84%
Our species, Homo sapiens,
have been in existence anywhere

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:55.811 align:middle line:90%
from 40,000 to 400,000 years.

00:35:55.811 --> 00:35:56.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or more.

00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:59.080 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Or more.

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:02.940 align:middle line:84%
So what is it that has
sustained our species?

00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:04.580 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we kill each other.

00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:05.720 align:middle line:90%
We even eat each other.

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:08.290 align:middle line:90%


00:36:08.290 --> 00:36:11.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have so
many wars and so on.

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:14.410 align:middle line:84%
But what has driven
us to succeed?

00:36:14.410 --> 00:36:17.340 align:middle line:84%
What has urged us
on to "progress"?

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:19.750 align:middle line:90%
Put that in quotes.

00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:29.880 align:middle line:84%
It is the core values of quality
of life, growth, and equality.

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:33.610 align:middle line:90%
Most of us understand growth.

00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:35.340 align:middle line:90%
We grow.

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:36.075 align:middle line:90%
We learn skills.

00:36:36.075 --> 00:36:37.370 align:middle line:90%
We learn knowledges.

00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:38.810 align:middle line:90%
We learn relationships.

00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:42.010 align:middle line:84%
We know how to manage
work and develop those

00:36:42.010 --> 00:36:46.890 align:middle line:84%
so that we can improve
the quality of our life.

00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:50.955 align:middle line:84%
The hardest one to get-- and
quality of life is interpreted,

00:36:50.955 --> 00:36:52.305 align:middle line:90%
can be personally interpreted.

00:36:52.305 --> 00:36:55.500 align:middle line:90%


00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:58.275 align:middle line:84%
And we have seen some people
interpret quality of life

00:36:58.275 --> 00:37:03.340 align:middle line:84%
as humongous amounts of money,
huge houses, many houses, cars,

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:05.670 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, and so on, to
be in the right society.

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:09.640 align:middle line:90%


00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:10.900 align:middle line:90%
So it's interpreted.

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:15.780 align:middle line:84%
But what sustains us as
people and as families

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:19.790 align:middle line:84%
and as societies and communities
into the next year and so on?

00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:20.430 align:middle line:90%
It's not cars.

00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:21.750 align:middle line:90%
It's not houses.

00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:24.680 align:middle line:84%
It's our relationships
with each other.

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:29.310 align:middle line:84%
The one thing that is grossly
absent from the basic thinking

00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:32.840 align:middle line:84%
of most people is a true
understanding of sustainability

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:33.770 align:middle line:90%
in terms of equality.

00:37:33.770 --> 00:37:36.590 align:middle line:90%


00:37:36.590 --> 00:37:44.156 align:middle line:84%
If you met five other Regina
Merediths as yourself,

00:37:44.156 --> 00:37:46.630 align:middle line:84%
you would love
them the same way.

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:50.912 align:middle line:84%
You would want the same
things for them, wouldn't you?

00:37:50.912 --> 00:37:52.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or whatever
their unique expression

00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:54.790 align:middle line:84%
is of what they
wanted for themselves.

00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:55.075 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Sure.

00:37:55.075 --> 00:37:55.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:59.200 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPHAEL: So the golden
rule-- do unto others

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:04.110 align:middle line:84%
as you would have them do
unto you-- is multicultural.

00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:08.880 align:middle line:84%
It's in existence in
almost all cultures.

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:12.470 align:middle line:84%
We have moved up from that
to the next level of morality

00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:14.690 align:middle line:90%
of pay it forward.

00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:17.560 align:middle line:84%
But there's no guide
for pay it forward.

00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And there's no guide
for the golden rule.

00:38:20.050 --> 00:38:22.840 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean giving every
person that comes by you

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:25.550 align:middle line:90%
a Ferrari or smart car?

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:27.010 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:32.390 align:middle line:84%
So the arbiter for determining
this are those three values.

00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:35.330 align:middle line:90%


00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:41.440 align:middle line:84%
What sustains you must sustain
others in the same way.

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:44.995 align:middle line:90%


00:38:44.995 --> 00:38:47.390 align:middle line:84%
The trouble we
have in our culture

00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:49.730 align:middle line:90%
is there's too many people.

00:38:49.730 --> 00:38:52.230 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think lives are so
cheap in Africa, in the Middle

00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:53.410 align:middle line:90%
East, and other countries?

00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:55.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When you say there
are too many people, that

00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:59.100 align:middle line:84%
starts getting into
what many would consider

00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:02.960 align:middle line:84%
to be more elitist thinking,
that the population needs

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:05.410 align:middle line:90%
to be reduced, for example.

00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:09.590 align:middle line:84%
Is Urantia work
saying the same thing?

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:13.000 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPHAEL: Yes, in ways, but
there's no arbiter for that.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.850 align:middle line:84%
There's no religion, no
politics to determine that.

00:39:16.850 --> 00:39:25.040 align:middle line:84%
So our planet has only so
many million arable hectares.

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:28.300 align:middle line:90%
It has only so much clean water.

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:32.990 align:middle line:84%
Has only so much land
that can produce food.

00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And the quotient involves number
of people per square mile.

00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:43.240 align:middle line:90%
Well, do you include oceans?

00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:43.945 align:middle line:90%
Nope.

00:39:43.945 --> 00:39:45.660 align:middle line:90%
Do you include deserts?

00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:47.350 align:middle line:90%
Nope.

00:39:47.350 --> 00:39:48.690 align:middle line:90%
What do you consider?

00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:52.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, wherever people could
materially become sustainable.

00:39:52.210 --> 00:39:54.750 align:middle line:90%


00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:57.980 align:middle line:84%
So our planet has far
exceeded the number

00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:00.840 align:middle line:90%
of people that is sustainable.

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:04.320 align:middle line:84%
And it has been given through
these channelings anywhere

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:09.915 align:middle line:84%
from 1.75 to a maximum
of 3 billion people.

00:40:09.915 --> 00:40:12.081 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I mean,
and that is up for debate.

00:40:12.081 --> 00:40:12.580 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:12.740 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Sure.

00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:14.365 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --there
are other people that

00:40:14.365 --> 00:40:16.520 align:middle line:84%
say if we were doing things
in an intelligent way,

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:19.120 align:middle line:84%
if we were using the resources
in an intelligent way,

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:23.750 align:middle line:84%
if we were actually
introducing very sustainable,

00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:26.840 align:middle line:84%
non-polluting, and
effective new technologies,

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:28.095 align:middle line:90%
that whole dynamic changes.

00:40:28.095 --> 00:40:28.970 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Well, yes.

00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:29.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There is
plenty of water.

00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:31.390 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPHAEL: What's the
first word you used?

00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:31.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There are seeds.

00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:32.872 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: If.

00:40:32.872 --> 00:40:34.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's right.

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:38.370 align:middle line:90%
But we're all capable of that.

00:40:38.370 --> 00:40:39.920 align:middle line:84%
Those templates
are already there.

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:41.630 align:middle line:90%
That technology's already there.

00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:45.490 align:middle line:84%
It seems like there may be
even more so an effort to,

00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:48.470 align:middle line:84%
on some level, suppress
what could actually

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:52.550 align:middle line:84%
be the salvation of the
species quite easily.

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:54.245 align:middle line:84%
And so, I mean, do
they talk about this?

00:40:54.245 --> 00:40:54.870 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Yes.

00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:57.750 align:middle line:84%
Our species is
incredibly fragile.

00:40:57.750 --> 00:40:59.555 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
incredibly resourceful.

00:40:59.555 --> 00:41:00.180 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Yes.

00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:00.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Both.

00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:01.315 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Yes.

00:41:01.315 --> 00:41:04.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so when you talk
about this population needing

00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:10.220 align:middle line:84%
to be reduced by over half,
or even more than that,

00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:13.050 align:middle line:84%
who or what would
determine that?

00:41:13.050 --> 00:41:15.679 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPHAEL: The next
series of cataclysms.

00:41:15.679 --> 00:41:16.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:19.570 align:middle line:84%
So you're saying it's kind of
a self-organizing thing that's

00:41:19.570 --> 00:41:20.740 align:middle line:90%
happening on some level.

00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:21.750 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: This is Gaia.

00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:26.089 align:middle line:84%
Gaia is a
self-balancing organism.

00:41:26.089 --> 00:41:27.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I
mean, there appears

00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:29.810 align:middle line:84%
to be some evidence we've
been wiped out before,

00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:31.080 align:middle line:90%
or large percentages of us.

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:31.705 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Yes.

00:41:31.705 --> 00:41:32.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So OK.

00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:34.590 align:middle line:84%
So the Urantia
work and this work

00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:37.710 align:middle line:84%
is saying by natural
processes, there

00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:39.620 align:middle line:84%
will be a reduction
in the population.

00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:41.720 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, what
we're trying to do

00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:44.910 align:middle line:84%
is lay down templates
for sustainable

00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:48.500 align:middle line:84%
thinking, behaving, and working
together so that you don't

00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:50.620 align:middle line:90%
get into this situation again.

00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:53.120 align:middle line:84%
Although we don't know that
that's the case, of course.

00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:56.745 align:middle line:84%
We don't know the genesis
for these various calamities,

00:41:56.745 --> 00:41:57.245 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:41:57.245 --> 00:41:58.350 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Yes.

00:41:58.350 --> 00:42:00.750 align:middle line:90%
There are two intentions.

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:04.750 align:middle line:84%
One is to create a
sustainable template

00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:08.140 align:middle line:84%
before the cataclysms
reduce the population so

00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:10.880 align:middle line:84%
that during reconstruction
these templates can

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:14.220 align:middle line:84%
be used and applied
to then develop

00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:17.260 align:middle line:90%
sustainable social structures.

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:21.350 align:middle line:84%
The second intention
is to develop the world

00:42:21.350 --> 00:42:25.930 align:middle line:84%
into a place that would
eventually become peaceful.

00:42:25.930 --> 00:42:29.180 align:middle line:90%
We yearn for social stability.

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:32.010 align:middle line:84%
People talk about
they yearn for peace.

00:42:32.010 --> 00:42:35.580 align:middle line:84%
You have to have
social stability first.

00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:38.880 align:middle line:84%
The three pillars of
a functional society

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:44.150 align:middle line:84%
is a society, the political
aspect, government,

00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:47.841 align:middle line:84%
and the
economic/financial aspect.

00:42:47.841 --> 00:42:49.340 align:middle line:84%
When those are
functioning, then you

00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:51.970 align:middle line:84%
can have the possibility
of a functional society.

00:42:51.970 --> 00:42:55.310 align:middle line:84%
If one of those breaks down,
you got problems, big problems.

00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:56.340 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:42:56.340 --> 00:43:00.500 align:middle line:84%
So what they are trying
to do-- let me go around

00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:06.180 align:middle line:84%
the bush here-- is to invest
those values, those three

00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:11.300 align:middle line:84%
values, into the organizational
structures of organizations.

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:14.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it sounds like
the central theme as to what

00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:17.090 align:middle line:84%
you said earlier, that makes
that, that drives that,

00:43:17.090 --> 00:43:19.440 align:middle line:90%
is equality.

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:21.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, what does
that word actually

00:43:21.090 --> 00:43:24.580 align:middle line:84%
mean within the
context of all of this?

00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:26.330 align:middle line:84%
I know you said a
little bit before, but--

00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:28.640 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPHAEL: That means
giving the same value

00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:35.060 align:middle line:84%
to somebody in Chad
and Lagos, Africa

00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:37.770 align:middle line:84%
as you would a person in
Baltimore that you've never

00:43:37.770 --> 00:43:40.100 align:middle line:90%
met.

00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:41.450 align:middle line:90%
That's the equality of it.

00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:44.050 align:middle line:90%


00:43:44.050 --> 00:43:49.440 align:middle line:84%
In order for individuals--
the cutting edge of equality

00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:53.463 align:middle line:84%
is giving everyone
the same opportunity

00:43:53.463 --> 00:43:55.860 align:middle line:84%
to improve their
quality of life,

00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:58.964 align:middle line:84%
to grow, as you
would anybody else.

00:43:58.964 --> 00:44:00.170 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:01.650 align:middle line:90%
That's a large pill to swallow.

00:44:01.650 --> 00:44:02.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:44:02.650 --> 00:44:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And so, I mean,
within that framework,

00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:08.027 align:middle line:90%
that's not how it is right now.

00:44:08.027 --> 00:44:08.610 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: No.

00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:12.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: People
are not-- none of us

00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:13.890 align:middle line:90%
are equal to anything else.

00:44:13.890 --> 00:44:17.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're individual
beings with our own potentials.

00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:19.280 align:middle line:84%
We're incarnating
into societies,

00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:21.660 align:middle line:84%
some that are more
sustainable than others.

00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:23.950 align:middle line:84%
But also, at the other
end of that tree,

00:44:23.950 --> 00:44:26.860 align:middle line:84%
you have people of
magnificent wealth

00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:28.930 align:middle line:84%
who have garnered
this and their control

00:44:28.930 --> 00:44:31.770 align:middle line:84%
over resources for
themselves, for example.

00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:33.230 align:middle line:90%
So now how does that factor?

00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:34.760 align:middle line:90%
How is that dealt with?

00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:37.440 align:middle line:84%
Because one would assume,
and it's certainly

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:39.970 align:middle line:84%
proving to be true at this
point, that the people who do

00:44:39.970 --> 00:44:42.220 align:middle line:84%
control a lot of the
world's resources,

00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:45.870 align:middle line:84%
people who could
just as easily lend

00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:49.040 align:middle line:84%
to the repair of a lot of
the damage that's been done,

00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:52.110 align:middle line:84%
aren't giving any of
it up voluntarily.

00:44:52.110 --> 00:44:54.770 align:middle line:90%
So where does this factor in?

00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:58.560 align:middle line:84%
How do you begin working
with these higher principles

00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:00.250 align:middle line:90%
on a planet of free will?

00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And that might even dovetail
into the original Urantia

00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:07.120 align:middle line:84%
story about the origins,
from this point of view,

00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:09.230 align:middle line:90%
of how humans came to be.

00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:12.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, that was a
much more simple task

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:15.970 align:middle line:84%
than taking a
fully-developed planet

00:45:15.970 --> 00:45:20.100 align:middle line:84%
with every kind of thought
and idea and expectation

00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:23.150 align:middle line:84%
and trying to make it back into
something homogeneous again.

00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:25.030 align:middle line:90%
That's where it gets dicey.

00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:28.000 align:middle line:90%
So maybe explain all of this.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.970 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPHAEL: I'll bite
off just a little bit.

00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:30.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A little bit.

00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:31.230 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Just a little bit.

00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:31.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Little chunks.

00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:33.060 align:middle line:84%
So you can take it
in little chunks.

00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:36.800 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPHAEL: Their work always
begins with the individual.

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:38.400 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:41.220 align:middle line:84%
They're not here
to fix democracies.

00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:45.440 align:middle line:84%
They're not here to fix
societies or economies.

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:47.970 align:middle line:84%
They're here to
assist individuals

00:45:47.970 --> 00:45:53.020 align:middle line:84%
to have better lives that are
in accord with the quality

00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:57.584 align:middle line:84%
of life, to grow, and to give
the same opportunity to others.

00:45:57.584 --> 00:45:58.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To be respectful--

00:45:58.750 --> 00:45:59.170 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Yeah.

00:45:59.170 --> 00:45:59.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --to others.

00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:00.100 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPHAEL: Respectful
to others--

00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:01.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:02.760 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPHAEL: --on an
individual basis.

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:03.460 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:09.700 align:middle line:84%
So when you look at
the global economy

00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:14.040 align:middle line:84%
and realize that there are
several trillion dollars that

00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:17.310 align:middle line:84%
are held in financial
instruments--

00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:19.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely, that
could be released and utilized

00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:20.735 align:middle line:90%
on some levels.

00:46:20.735 --> 00:46:21.360 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Yes.

00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:22.693 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, but they're not.

00:46:22.693 --> 00:46:25.040 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: But they're not.

00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:30.040 align:middle line:84%
How would an individual,
a multi-billionaire,

00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:33.630 align:middle line:84%
move their fortunes
to assist others?

00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:37.980 align:middle line:84%
It would have to be involved in
some program that would assist

00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:42.480 align:middle line:84%
others, individuals, working
in teams and at local levels,

00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:46.300 align:middle line:84%
to improve their quality
of life, to grow,

00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:48.300 align:middle line:84%
and to do that equally
as their neighbors would.

00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:51.150 align:middle line:90%


00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:56.010 align:middle line:84%
This is not done from
hierarchies on down.

00:46:56.010 --> 00:47:01.680 align:middle line:84%
This work of the celestials
and of healing our societies

00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:06.550 align:middle line:84%
and these three pillars must
begin at the local level.

00:47:06.550 --> 00:47:09.101 align:middle line:84%
Hierarchies are incapable
of doing it themselves.

00:47:09.101 --> 00:47:11.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if we can
get a reflection of that,

00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:15.280 align:middle line:84%
would that mean that the
celestials on the other side

00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:17.810 align:middle line:84%
are working around the
clock with humanity

00:47:17.810 --> 00:47:21.480 align:middle line:84%
on an individual basis to
inspire some of this higher

00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:26.102 align:middle line:84%
behavior in all of us,
including those who are-- well,

00:47:26.102 --> 00:47:28.560 align:middle line:84%
which, of course, it would have
to extend-- those who could

00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:31.660 align:middle line:84%
make a big difference
because they have garnered

00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:34.450 align:middle line:84%
large amounts of resources,
control, and power?

00:47:34.450 --> 00:47:36.570 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Right.

00:47:36.570 --> 00:47:38.080 align:middle line:90%
Yes, they do.

00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:39.340 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:43.410 align:middle line:84%
They won't ever
abrogate, or refute,

00:47:43.410 --> 00:47:47.450 align:middle line:84%
or deny the possibility
of someone's decision.

00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:50.910 align:middle line:84%
Once a decision is made
by a mortal, that's it.

00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:51.410 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:52.624 align:middle line:90%
That's in stone.

00:47:52.624 --> 00:47:54.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So where do the
celestials come into this?

00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:55.581 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Options.

00:47:55.581 --> 00:47:59.050 align:middle line:90%


00:47:59.050 --> 00:48:02.870 align:middle line:84%
When you bought your car, you
were thinking about, well,

00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:04.975 align:middle line:84%
I've got a college
fund for the kids.

00:48:04.975 --> 00:48:07.640 align:middle line:84%
I got some other
things to think about.

00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:09.880 align:middle line:90%
What are my options?

00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:15.530 align:middle line:84%
So it does not violate
our self-will or our will

00:48:15.530 --> 00:48:17.520 align:middle line:84%
to be given more
options in thinking

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:23.100 align:middle line:84%
about our resources or our
problems and how to solve them.

00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:25.340 align:middle line:84%
So they are looking
for people who

00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:27.520 align:middle line:90%
are open to receive options.

00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:28.900 align:middle line:90%
Some people are closed.

00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:29.480 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:30.030 align:middle line:90%
Time out.

00:48:30.030 --> 00:48:31.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:48:31.070 --> 00:48:31.986 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: No options.

00:48:31.986 --> 00:48:34.410 align:middle line:90%
This is my option.

00:48:34.410 --> 00:48:36.050 align:middle line:90%
My way or the highway.

00:48:36.050 --> 00:48:38.530 align:middle line:84%
So with those, there's
no going forward.

00:48:38.530 --> 00:48:41.110 align:middle line:84%
But people who are
curious or wonder-- I

00:48:41.110 --> 00:48:44.640 align:middle line:84%
mean, there are truly
wonderfully wealthy people,

00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:50.280 align:middle line:84%
billionaires, who sit on this
money and going, now what?

00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:52.729 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:48:52.729 --> 00:48:54.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there has
been an assumption,

00:48:54.270 --> 00:48:57.290 align:middle line:84%
especially in this community
because it dovetails also

00:48:57.290 --> 00:49:00.820 align:middle line:84%
into the conspiracy community,
that while we can fully accept

00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:04.740 align:middle line:84%
that there are people who are
in the lower socioeconomic rungs

00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:07.930 align:middle line:84%
that are good-- you have people
that are beautiful people,

00:49:07.930 --> 00:49:11.260 align:middle line:84%
expressive, creative people here
to help and those who aren't.

00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:12.280 align:middle line:90%
It's exactly the same.

00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:12.980 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't matter.

00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:13.880 align:middle line:90%
You go vertical.

00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:16.435 align:middle line:84%
There are always good beings
and good people throughout.

00:49:16.435 --> 00:49:17.060 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Yes.

00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:19.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there are always
those who are more closed.

00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:20.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:21.799 align:middle line:90%
So I get that part.

00:49:21.799 --> 00:49:23.590 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPHAEL: They're
looking for open people.

00:49:23.590 --> 00:49:24.173 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:49:24.173 --> 00:49:26.000 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the beings
on the other side

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.190 align:middle line:84%
are looking for open
people that they

00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:33.120 align:middle line:84%
can start influencing or working
with or making suggestions

00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:34.197 align:middle line:90%
of options to.

00:49:34.197 --> 00:49:35.030 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Yes, yes.

00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:35.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:37.450 align:middle line:84%
So that's how this
is playing out.

00:49:37.450 --> 00:49:38.880 align:middle line:84%
Compared to in the
beginning where

00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:41.505 align:middle line:84%
it was more-- sounds like in the
Urantia work, in the beginning

00:49:41.505 --> 00:49:44.730 align:middle line:84%
it was a much more
top-down kind of directive

00:49:44.730 --> 00:49:47.670 align:middle line:84%
that appears to have gone
on with society as it

00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:50.315 align:middle line:84%
may have been developing
in its primitive stages.

00:49:50.315 --> 00:49:53.125 align:middle line:84%
And a lot more difficult,
like I said earlier.

00:49:53.125 --> 00:49:55.100 align:middle line:84%
Do they have to
individually, then,

00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:56.630 align:middle line:90%
get to each of these people?

00:49:56.630 --> 00:50:00.600 align:middle line:84%
So that's why you said it might
be a 500 or 5,000-year plan?

00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:01.630 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Mm-hmm.

00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:02.404 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:50:02.404 --> 00:50:03.070 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Yeah.

00:50:03.070 --> 00:50:06.260 align:middle line:84%
We were pretty much left
on our own for a long time.

00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:08.750 align:middle line:84%
But this is the first
time that the planet

00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:12.350 align:middle line:90%
has been totally inhabited.

00:50:12.350 --> 00:50:15.455 align:middle line:84%
There is the advent
of cataclysms.

00:50:15.455 --> 00:50:17.580 align:middle line:90%
How about the weather back East?

00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:22.427 align:middle line:84%
How about the hurricanes, the
rainfall, and the tornadoes?

00:50:22.427 --> 00:50:23.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:50:23.010 --> 00:50:24.140 align:middle line:90%
The weather is changing.

00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:25.260 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Yes.

00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:26.640 align:middle line:90%
That's just weather.

00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:29.480 align:middle line:84%
We really haven't experienced
much tectonic problems yet.

00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:32.110 align:middle line:90%


00:50:32.110 --> 00:50:37.230 align:middle line:84%
And you realize
if some large city

00:50:37.230 --> 00:50:41.250 align:middle line:84%
went under-- Los Angeles
is what-- California's

00:50:41.250 --> 00:50:45.490 align:middle line:84%
the eighth largest
economy in the world?

00:50:45.490 --> 00:50:47.680 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it would have an
impact throughout the world.

00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:48.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And sure it would.

00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:48.982 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Yeah.

00:50:48.982 --> 00:50:51.065 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So are they
saying that these things are

00:50:51.065 --> 00:50:54.500 align:middle line:84%
inevitable if human beings
don't change their behavior,

00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:55.790 align:middle line:90%
thoughts, characteristics?

00:50:55.790 --> 00:50:59.580 align:middle line:90%
Or what are these beings saying?

00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:03.050 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPHAEL: They're saying
these are natural developments.

00:51:03.050 --> 00:51:06.160 align:middle line:84%
We have seen them
coming for hundreds

00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:07.460 align:middle line:90%
of years, thousands of years.

00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:08.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they're
building up again--

00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:09.180 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPHAEL: And they're
building up again.

00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:10.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and about
to go through a round.

00:51:10.170 --> 00:51:10.780 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPHAEL: And it is the
Chinese philosophy of chaos.

00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:19.820 align:middle line:84%
In chaos, there's
opportunity and disaster.

00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:22.430 align:middle line:90%
Which will you choose?

00:51:22.430 --> 00:51:28.010 align:middle line:84%
If there's no hierarchy that can
reform itself and make things

00:51:28.010 --> 00:51:33.050 align:middle line:84%
better, if there is not
the motivation or awareness

00:51:33.050 --> 00:51:39.690 align:middle line:84%
at the local level to do
so, then there must be this

00:51:39.690 --> 00:51:45.290 align:middle line:84%
format-- what did you call
it?-- this format, this plan,

00:51:45.290 --> 00:51:49.745 align:middle line:84%
to be given to people that they
can reconstruct their societies

00:51:49.745 --> 00:51:50.245 align:middle line:90%
afterwards.

00:51:50.245 --> 00:51:53.580 align:middle line:90%


00:51:53.580 --> 00:51:56.320 align:middle line:84%
These events, the cataclysms
and the destruction

00:51:56.320 --> 00:52:00.060 align:middle line:84%
of societies and
nations, we've seen it

00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:02.200 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over again.

00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:06.740 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to bring out a point
that-- when's the last time

00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:10.560 align:middle line:84%
you ever heard of a successful,
sustainable Chinese dynasty?

00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:11.550 align:middle line:90%
Never.

00:52:11.550 --> 00:52:12.570 align:middle line:90%
Egyptian dynasty?

00:52:12.570 --> 00:52:14.100 align:middle line:90%
Never.

00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:14.890 align:middle line:90%
The Roman Empire.

00:52:14.890 --> 00:52:15.440 align:middle line:90%
Never.

00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:16.510 align:middle line:90%
English empire.

00:52:16.510 --> 00:52:17.010 align:middle line:90%
Never.

00:52:17.010 --> 00:52:19.570 align:middle line:90%


00:52:19.570 --> 00:52:22.700 align:middle line:84%
How many corporations do you
know of over 500 years old?

00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:24.320 align:middle line:90%
None.

00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:27.770 align:middle line:84%
How many societies and nations
have succumbed to time?

00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:28.270 align:middle line:90%
None.

00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:32.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But might not
that be a matter of the fact

00:52:32.190 --> 00:52:36.610 align:middle line:84%
that life is dynamic,
our creation is dynamic.

00:52:36.610 --> 00:52:39.250 align:middle line:84%
What serves us in one
moment and we embrace

00:52:39.250 --> 00:52:41.150 align:middle line:84%
in one moment for
our own learning

00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:44.330 align:middle line:84%
may not serve us
in 50 or 100 years.

00:52:44.330 --> 00:52:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And this is just sort of the
natural flow of life, right?

00:52:47.790 --> 00:52:49.640 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: When you're ignorant.

00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:52.870 align:middle line:84%
But if you knew the
principles of sustainability,

00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:54.932 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't you want
to adopt those?

00:52:54.932 --> 00:52:59.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the only
sustainable organism,

00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:03.530 align:middle line:84%
sentient organism that
we identify at least,

00:53:03.530 --> 00:53:05.270 align:middle line:90%
is Homo sapiens.

00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:06.605 align:middle line:90%
So what has sustained us?

00:53:06.605 --> 00:53:10.260 align:middle line:90%


00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:14.650 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible to
invest organizations

00:53:14.650 --> 00:53:17.640 align:middle line:90%
with these three values?

00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:21.840 align:middle line:84%
I say yes, it is, and
still make a profit.

00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:27.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, the other day, a friend
of mine gave me an aha.

00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:30.020 align:middle line:84%
He says, well sure,
Daniel, you can

00:53:30.020 --> 00:53:31.820 align:middle line:90%
have sustainable organizations.

00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:36.580 align:middle line:84%
But we have seen organizations
that are caring about people,

00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:38.200 align:middle line:90%
but they lack heart.

00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:44.560 align:middle line:84%
They lack love,
compassion, and empathy.

00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And so I recently
wrote a paper on that--

00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:51.020 align:middle line:90%
"Self-Sustaining Emotions."

00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:53.560 align:middle line:84%
That even if you had a
sustainable government,

00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:56.680 align:middle line:90%
it could be heartless.

00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:59.640 align:middle line:84%
But you'd want one
that was compassionate,

00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:05.060 align:middle line:84%
that was both just and merciful
and had empathy for people.

00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And that this would be
a criteria of judgments,

00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:14.110 align:middle line:90%
like a court order.

00:54:14.110 --> 00:54:17.720 align:middle line:84%
In the future in a
sustainable society,

00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:19.800 align:middle line:84%
that judgments were
to be based on,

00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:24.630 align:middle line:84%
does this help the
sustainability of individuals?

00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:28.880 align:middle line:84%
Does this help improve the
quality of people's lives?

00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:31.010 align:middle line:90%
Does this help people grow?

00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:33.160 align:middle line:84%
And would we do the same
thing for a rich person

00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:35.680 align:middle line:84%
as we would a poor, or
whether they're black

00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:39.750 align:middle line:90%
or white or red or yellow?

00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And further, does this
show a care and concern

00:54:43.870 --> 00:54:47.180 align:middle line:84%
for those individuals
involved, both the plaintiff

00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:51.330 align:middle line:84%
and the defendant
and the society?

00:54:51.330 --> 00:54:55.460 align:middle line:90%
So we have a long ways to go.

00:54:55.460 --> 00:55:00.960 align:middle line:84%
We're working with a really
primitive civilization

00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:05.060 align:middle line:84%
when you take a look at
what we do to each other.

00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:07.060 align:middle line:84%
Think of what's
happened in Syria

00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:12.110 align:middle line:84%
and the displaced people who
are in Jordan and Turkey.

00:55:12.110 --> 00:55:13.800 align:middle line:90%
It tears my heart out.

00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:14.740 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:20.330 align:middle line:84%
So there is room
for improvement.

00:55:20.330 --> 00:55:24.440 align:middle line:84%
This is the first time,
Regina, that we can consciously

00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:26.880 align:middle line:84%
think about a
process to transcend

00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:28.585 align:middle line:90%
our organizational failures.

00:55:28.585 --> 00:55:31.164 align:middle line:90%


00:55:31.164 --> 00:55:33.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This specific
process you're talking about

00:55:33.330 --> 00:55:34.561 align:middle line:90%
that these beings have given.

00:55:34.561 --> 00:55:35.310 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Mm-hmm.

00:55:35.310 --> 00:55:38.016 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So another
question I would have is--

00:55:38.016 --> 00:55:39.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't think
anybody would argue

00:55:39.390 --> 00:55:43.650 align:middle line:84%
there's room for improvement,
nor that we need to behave

00:55:43.650 --> 00:55:45.880 align:middle line:84%
in perhaps a little
more selfless

00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:49.070 align:middle line:84%
way when it comes to
containing the whole.

00:55:49.070 --> 00:55:51.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think there are very
few people that would disagree

00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:54.940 align:middle line:84%
with that, as long as
we still had intact

00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:59.520 align:middle line:84%
our creativity, our
individuality, our free will,

00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:01.530 align:middle line:84%
and our means to express
our self in the thing

00:56:01.530 --> 00:56:05.200 align:middle line:84%
that we were uniquely
endowed with from birth

00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:07.450 align:middle line:84%
or even before,
as long as society

00:56:07.450 --> 00:56:11.090 align:middle line:84%
had that full color and
richness and so forth.

00:56:11.090 --> 00:56:12.570 align:middle line:84%
And yet, at the
same time, you have

00:56:12.570 --> 00:56:14.500 align:middle line:90%
these regions of the world.

00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:18.190 align:middle line:84%
You have different
religious philosophies

00:56:18.190 --> 00:56:21.440 align:middle line:84%
and so forth-- and motivating
factors in each society.

00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:25.690 align:middle line:84%
So wouldn't this kind
of system of protocols

00:56:25.690 --> 00:56:29.360 align:middle line:84%
need to uniquely
inculcate into each

00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:31.790 align:middle line:84%
of the societies in its
own way, not necessarily

00:56:31.790 --> 00:56:35.670 align:middle line:90%
from one central theme?

00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:37.122 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Is that a question?

00:56:37.122 --> 00:56:38.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So I'm asking that.

00:56:38.330 --> 00:56:41.100 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't it need to come
through a variety of means,

00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:44.060 align:middle line:84%
a variety of inspirations
that match maybe

00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:48.300 align:middle line:84%
or reflect the beliefs and
desires of a given culture?

00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:52.050 align:middle line:84%
Granted, we know we're still
immature and have much room

00:56:52.050 --> 00:56:53.500 align:middle line:90%
to grow.

00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:55.690 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Yes.

00:56:55.690 --> 00:56:58.900 align:middle line:84%
If you look at these
values and these emotions,

00:56:58.900 --> 00:57:00.990 align:middle line:90%
they're not culturally specific.

00:57:00.990 --> 00:57:03.650 align:middle line:84%
You'll find the desire
for improved quality

00:57:03.650 --> 00:57:09.750 align:middle line:84%
of life in all cultures
and races and nations.

00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:14.980 align:middle line:84%
These can be interpreted
in ways which

00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:21.340 align:middle line:84%
are in agreement with the
ethnic identity of groups.

00:57:21.340 --> 00:57:23.350 align:middle line:84%
You will find, and
I won't state them,

00:57:23.350 --> 00:57:26.890 align:middle line:84%
but you will find that there
will be some groups which

00:57:26.890 --> 00:57:29.800 align:middle line:84%
are doctrinaire and
adamantly could not

00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:31.820 align:middle line:84%
accept these three
values because they

00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:33.670 align:middle line:90%
don't see people as equal.

00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:36.750 align:middle line:84%
And they have rules that show
them that they aren't equal,

00:57:36.750 --> 00:57:40.150 align:middle line:84%
and they shouldn't
be treated equal.

00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:42.490 align:middle line:90%
There's no changing that.

00:57:42.490 --> 00:57:45.120 align:middle line:84%
But this begins at
an individual level.

00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:49.080 align:middle line:84%
This begins through
the attraction

00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:52.970 align:middle line:84%
of people who would like to have
peace in their neighborhood,

00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:57.930 align:middle line:84%
peace in their community,
peace in their family.

00:57:57.930 --> 00:58:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And so this begins at the
local level with individuals.

00:58:02.730 --> 00:58:05.590 align:middle line:90%


00:58:05.590 --> 00:58:07.470 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I share
this with people--

00:58:07.470 --> 00:58:11.470 align:middle line:84%
and I've been invited to
a public setting in Pueblo

00:58:11.470 --> 00:58:15.535 align:middle line:84%
next spring to discuss it-- and
we have such a Western mind,

00:58:15.535 --> 00:58:19.890 align:middle line:84%
such a linear mind, and such a
mind that seeks effectiveness.

00:58:19.890 --> 00:58:23.836 align:middle line:90%
But they want it done now.

00:58:23.836 --> 00:58:25.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
a characteristic

00:58:25.210 --> 00:58:26.590 align:middle line:90%
of our quadrant on the planet.

00:58:26.590 --> 00:58:30.810 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPHAEL: Hey, we need a
Samson to tear down the walls

00:58:30.810 --> 00:58:31.980 align:middle line:90%
and heal everything.

00:58:31.980 --> 00:58:36.110 align:middle line:84%
We need a Solomon to pass
his tremendous judgment.

00:58:36.110 --> 00:58:41.060 align:middle line:84%
But in this setting, we
all must become Solomons.

00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:42.030 align:middle line:90%
That's asking a lot.

00:58:42.030 --> 00:58:44.290 align:middle line:84%
But it's asking
for the very best

00:58:44.290 --> 00:58:48.670 align:middle line:84%
that people can deliver
for their own lives.

00:58:48.670 --> 00:58:52.960 align:middle line:84%
Why would a father disparage
and mistreat a daughter

00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:56.210 align:middle line:84%
and give her less,
no college education,

00:58:56.210 --> 00:58:59.325 align:middle line:84%
but would pay for his
son's college education?

00:58:59.325 --> 00:58:59.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:58:59.950 --> 00:59:02.080 align:middle line:84%
These are ways of disparity
that have to be rectified.

00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:02.835 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Yeah.

00:59:02.835 --> 00:59:03.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:06.300 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: How does that?

00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:10.490 align:middle line:84%
And so it goes
back to intention.

00:59:10.490 --> 00:59:11.583 align:middle line:90%
I do coaching.

00:59:11.583 --> 00:59:15.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm a holistic life coach,
and I coach couples.

00:59:15.180 --> 00:59:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And I just shocked this
one couple when I did this.

00:59:20.410 --> 00:59:23.840 align:middle line:84%
They were having problems, and
they were looking down the road

00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:25.820 align:middle line:90%
to divorce if it kept going.

00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:28.570 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, what
was your intention

00:59:28.570 --> 00:59:30.830 align:middle line:90%
for marrying this man?

00:59:30.830 --> 00:59:32.520 align:middle line:90%
Well, I loved him.

00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:35.624 align:middle line:84%
I said, no, love is not enough
to make a relationship work.

00:59:35.624 --> 00:59:37.290 align:middle line:84%
You have to have some
dynamics in there.

00:59:37.290 --> 00:59:41.710 align:middle line:84%
You have to sell some really
give and take in there.

00:59:41.710 --> 00:59:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him, well,
what was your intention?

00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:48.766 align:middle line:84%
And they both stated what the
intention was at that time.

00:59:48.766 --> 00:59:50.390 align:middle line:84%
And I said, now, what
is your intention

00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:53.040 align:middle line:90%
now for being with this woman?

00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:56.000 align:middle line:84%
What is your intention now
for being with this man?

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.970 align:middle line:84%
So we must look
to intention when

00:59:58.970 --> 01:00:01.970 align:middle line:84%
we-- and money is
a real huge culprit

01:00:01.970 --> 01:00:04.500 align:middle line:90%
in bending morality and ethics.

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And it can do all the
most disparaging things

01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:08.800 align:middle line:90%
in the name of "goodness."

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:10.810 align:middle line:90%
Put that in quotes.

01:00:10.810 --> 01:00:14.540 align:middle line:84%
So these three values
and these three emotions

01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:19.060 align:middle line:84%
really give us a universal
guide for assisting individuals,

01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:23.740 align:middle line:84%
for assisting non-profits,
for assisting global councils,

01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:27.124 align:middle line:84%
community councils for
determining and weighing

01:00:27.124 --> 01:00:28.415 align:middle line:90%
the projects that they sponsor.

01:00:28.415 --> 01:00:33.150 align:middle line:90%


01:00:33.150 --> 01:00:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And so there are now thousands
of people hearing this message.

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:43.980 align:middle line:84%
The interesting thing about
social sustainability,

01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:55.900 align:middle line:84%
even with professors-- do you
recall Professor Albert-- he's

01:00:55.900 --> 01:00:58.280 align:middle line:84%
recently deceased,
and he brought out

01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:01.300 align:middle line:84%
the exponential
growth of populations.

01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:07.180 align:middle line:84%
And he was a professor
emeritus at CU-Boulder.

01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:11.716 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him one
evening at a meeting where

01:01:11.716 --> 01:01:12.965 align:middle line:90%
we could ask questions of him.

01:01:12.965 --> 01:01:15.960 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what do you see
as a substantial difference

01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:20.140 align:middle line:84%
between material sustainability
and social sustainability?

01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:23.432 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, really,
there's no difference.

01:01:23.432 --> 01:01:25.140 align:middle line:84%
If we don't have
material sustainability,

01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:26.348 align:middle line:90%
then we won't have society's.

01:01:26.348 --> 01:01:29.070 align:middle line:90%


01:01:29.070 --> 01:01:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And I just didn't ask
any more questions

01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:36.860 align:middle line:84%
because his concern was
about material sustainability

01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:37.920 align:middle line:90%
sustaining people.

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:41.470 align:middle line:84%
But how do people
sustain themselves?

01:01:41.470 --> 01:01:46.340 align:middle line:84%
When I meet healthy families,
generation after generation

01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:51.170 align:middle line:84%
of healthy people who love
each other, it's foreign to me.

01:01:51.170 --> 01:01:53.350 align:middle line:90%
How do we do this?

01:01:53.350 --> 01:01:56.090 align:middle line:84%
And how do we teach
others how to do that?

01:01:56.090 --> 01:01:58.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So in summary, because
we're just about out of time--

01:01:58.920 --> 01:01:59.600 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Sure.

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:02.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --what my
understanding is, is there

01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:05.430 align:middle line:84%
a group of celestial beings--
there are many of them-- who

01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:09.892 align:middle line:84%
would like to reach
through into our awareness

01:02:09.892 --> 01:02:11.850 align:middle line:84%
and help us understand
that there's another way

01:02:11.850 --> 01:02:14.040 align:middle line:84%
to structure our
societies, our governments,

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:16.220 align:middle line:84%
the way we do
families, and so forth?

01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:18.030 align:middle line:84%
And they may or
may not be totally

01:02:18.030 --> 01:02:19.300 align:middle line:90%
cohesive in their message.

01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:22.180 align:middle line:84%
It might have a slightly
different flavor

01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:24.850 align:middle line:84%
for the individual, culture,
family, and so forth.

01:02:24.850 --> 01:02:28.320 align:middle line:84%
And that by beginning
to embrace some

01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:31.290 align:middle line:84%
of this on an
individual basis, we

01:02:31.290 --> 01:02:33.370 align:middle line:90%
can start this healing process.

01:02:33.370 --> 01:02:38.260 align:middle line:84%
But it also sounds like there
is very specific information

01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:41.310 align:middle line:84%
that essentially trickles
down into designed teams

01:02:41.310 --> 01:02:45.762 align:middle line:84%
for structuring society and such
that "Healing a Broken World"

01:02:45.762 --> 01:02:47.970 align:middle line:84%
is actually referring to as
templates that could also

01:02:47.970 --> 01:02:50.405 align:middle line:84%
be consciously adopted by
humans if they desired.

01:02:50.405 --> 01:02:51.030 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Yes.

01:02:51.030 --> 01:02:52.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is that
more or less correct?

01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:53.843 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: That's correct.

01:02:53.843 --> 01:02:56.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, any
final thoughts on that?

01:02:56.020 --> 01:03:01.160 align:middle line:84%
Because we just about
like have a minute left.

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:04.400 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPHAEL: There's no
miracles, but there is help.

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:08.260 align:middle line:10%
And they do have a design,
and they shared that with us.

01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:12.570 align:middle line:10%
It's up to us to use
that design or not.

01:03:12.570 --> 01:03:15.830 align:middle line:10%
And it's not our problem
because this world

01:03:15.830 --> 01:03:18.490 align:middle line:10%
is an incubator of new
souls, and the quality

01:03:18.490 --> 01:03:22.774 align:middle line:10%
of souls that cross over needs
to improve, according to them.

01:03:22.774 --> 01:03:24.940 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of people
cross over to the other side

01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:28.070 align:middle line:90%
and going, I've had enough.

01:03:28.070 --> 01:03:30.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going forward.

01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:31.720 align:middle line:90%
And that's the end of it.

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:36.330 align:middle line:84%
So what we lose when they
do that is their experience.

01:03:36.330 --> 01:03:38.140 align:middle line:84%
And this is all about
bringing experience

01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:39.900 align:middle line:90%
to the First Source and Center.

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:43.240 align:middle line:84%
The First Source and Center is
perfect, but it's incomplete.

01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:45.850 align:middle line:90%


01:03:45.850 --> 01:03:49.480 align:middle line:84%
The thing that God
lacks is experience.

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:51.800 align:middle line:84%
God is perfect
but is not living.

01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:54.060 align:middle line:90%
So he needs to live through us.

01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And so when we strive to
improve our lives in ways

01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:00.570 align:middle line:84%
that help others
and helps ourselves,

01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:03.997 align:middle line:84%
then that experience
becomes part of the matrix.

01:04:03.997 --> 01:04:04.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very good.

01:04:04.830 --> 01:04:05.729 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:04:05.729 --> 01:04:07.520 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for your time
and thank you for--

01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:07.880 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: You're welcome.

01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:09.255 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --sharing
a little bit.

01:04:09.255 --> 01:04:11.390 align:middle line:84%
We just barely really
even touched on it.

01:04:11.390 --> 01:04:11.600 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Just a bit.

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:13.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And as you said,
it was a very difficult book

01:04:13.450 --> 01:04:13.950 align:middle line:90%
to write.

01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:15.240 align:middle line:90%
It's controversial.

01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:19.021 align:middle line:84%
People need to go in and look at
the information for themselves,

01:04:19.021 --> 01:04:19.520 align:middle line:90%
then.

01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:20.290 align:middle line:90%
Is that fair enough?

01:04:20.290 --> 01:04:20.940 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: That's fair enough.

01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:22.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
weigh it themselves.

01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:22.280 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:22.500 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPHAEL: Thank you.

01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:23.666 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you, Daniel.

01:04:23.666 --> 01:04:26.350 align:middle line:10%
Again, the book is called
"Healing a Broken World,"

01:04:26.350 --> 01:04:28.440 align:middle line:10%
which is available
through major booksellers.

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:32.360 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
