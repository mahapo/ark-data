00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.750 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: Raise your
hand if you've found yourself

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.530 align:middle line:10%
asking the question,
is that all there is?

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.570 align:middle line:10%
This is the question Itzhak
Beery was asking himself

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.520 align:middle line:10%
as he sat in his office in
New York City, surrounded

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.840 align:middle line:10%
by his accolades and awards
in the advertising industry

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.780 align:middle line:10%
yet feeling oddly empty.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.790 align:middle line:84%
This feeling propelled
him onto a path he never

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.370 align:middle line:84%
would have dreamt
possible-- that of a shaman

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.200 align:middle line:90%
in the Yachak tradition.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.930 align:middle line:84%
He's with us to tell us
how his life was upended

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.470 align:middle line:84%
and what took shape
on the other side.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.500 align:middle line:84%
It's so funny because when
we think of shamanism,

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.620 align:middle line:84%
we think of things
like shapeshifting.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.670 align:middle line:84%
And as I was looking at your
life and reading your book,

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.747 align:middle line:84%
I realize you are a
shapeshifter in the extreme.

00:01:07.747 --> 00:01:09.580 align:middle line:10%
>> ITZHAK BEERY: Now
that you are saying it,

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.510 align:middle line:10%
I have to agree with you.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.110 align:middle line:10%
It's quite a journey.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.670 align:middle line:10%
And if you put it
this way, it's true.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:23.100 align:middle line:10%
My life really shapeshifted
from an atheist skeptic.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.630 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Atheist skeptic.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:26.890 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:33.980 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: Into a believer
in the shamanic tradition

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.130 align:middle line:84%
or in the spiritual and in the
connection between the unseen

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.412 align:middle line:90%
and the seen world.

00:01:41.412 --> 00:01:43.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's not
what you came from.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.730 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: No.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.090 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's talk
about what you came from.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.048 align:middle line:90%
Will start in New York.

00:01:46.048 --> 00:01:49.740 align:middle line:84%
So you were kind of high-end
stuff in the advertising

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.960 align:middle line:84%
industry-- high-end
clients, glamour, cosmetics.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.790 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: Yes, I had clients
like that-- Gucci, Revlon,

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:00.640 align:middle line:90%
Ferragamo.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And I worked with a lot of
airlines and other clients

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.070 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:13.140 align:middle line:84%
But at the end,
it'll keep you empty.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.370 align:middle line:84%
The meaning of life is not
really in that industry.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.900 align:middle line:84%
It's really what
makes you happy.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And my career started as an
artist, as a visual artist.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And I had relatively small
success in that, too.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.090 align:middle line:84%
But I guess the
real shapeshifting

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.520 align:middle line:90%
began by coincidence, to me.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.650 align:middle line:90%
Or the way I saw it as a--

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: A lot of big turns
of events in life appear to be

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.057 align:middle line:90%
coincidence to begin with.

00:02:47.057 --> 00:02:47.640 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: Yes.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.890 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But let's go back to
your roots then in childhood.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.985 align:middle line:84%
You were raised in a
kibbutz in Israel, right?

00:02:52.985 --> 00:02:53.610 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: Yeah.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.480 align:middle line:84%
I was born and raised in the
kibbutz near the Sea of Galilee

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.140 align:middle line:84%
in Israel by the slope of a
mountain, Mount Gilboa, which

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.020 align:middle line:84%
is a very famous
mountain in the Bible.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.020 align:middle line:84%
So we grew up with
a big connection

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.520 align:middle line:84%
to the biblical
time, in many ways,

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.114 align:middle line:84%
but never with religion
aspects of that.

00:03:13.114 --> 00:03:15.280 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: In fact, it was
interesting in your book,

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.770 align:middle line:84%
you talk about you were part of
an experimental community that

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.530 align:middle line:84%
was really more looking at
the good of the group over

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.180 align:middle line:84%
the individual, more
socialistic in nature.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.940 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: Yes.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.650 align:middle line:84%
That was the attempt
to create new humans

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.110 align:middle line:84%
and new human
consciousness, where

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.950 align:middle line:84%
the work of the land and
the work of the community

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.360 align:middle line:84%
is more important than the
individual's aspiration.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And did that
naturally incorporate atheism

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.450 align:middle line:90%
as a backdrop?

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.140 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: Yes, because
if you remember,

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.060 align:middle line:84%
all these people who built
the kibbutz ran away from

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:03.630 align:middle line:84%
their home in Poland and Russia,
from very religious homes.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.440 align:middle line:84%
It was only recently
that I discovered

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:11.850 align:middle line:84%
that my great grandfather was
a very famous Kabbalistic rabbi

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.310 align:middle line:90%
and healer.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.079 align:middle line:90%
It was a secret.

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.209 align:middle line:90%
Nobody talked about it.

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.839 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What happened in
that time that created the need

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:27.110 align:middle line:84%
to turn away from the
original religious practices?

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.730 align:middle line:84%
I know even in Israel
when I was there--

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.260 align:middle line:84%
it's been probably
almost 10 years now--

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.330 align:middle line:84%
I realized that
most of the populace

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.110 align:middle line:90%
is secular, not religious.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.020 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.170 align:middle line:84%
What were they
turning away from?

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:45.330 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: They rebel against
the control or the old ideas

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.950 align:middle line:90%
of religion.

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.170 align:middle line:84%
There was a new generations
between the two wars, the First

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:57.580 align:middle line:84%
World War and the second one,
who wanted to be more secular.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.790 align:middle line:90%
They wanted to find new ideas.

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.200 align:middle line:84%
The communication in the world
started to be more available,

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.500 align:middle line:84%
and communism or the
idea of socialism

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:13.150 align:middle line:90%
started to fly around Europe.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:19.250 align:middle line:84%
And those children really
rebelled against their parents,

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.664 align:middle line:84%
which is very natural
because every child rebelled

00:05:22.664 --> 00:05:23.580 align:middle line:90%
against their parents.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:24.510 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We did
it, just differently,

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.056 align:middle line:90%
in San Francisco and California.

00:05:26.056 --> 00:05:26.555 align:middle line:90%
But yes.

00:05:26.555 --> 00:05:27.370 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: Exactly.

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And I expect my children
to do that, too.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.660 align:middle line:84%
Each generation is trying
to find its own path.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And for them was to leave
their parents behind, leave

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.050 align:middle line:84%
the religion behind,
leave all of that behind

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.760 align:middle line:84%
and come back to a new
land and become farmers,

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.140 align:middle line:84%
to be grounded in the
natural experience,

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:56.360 align:middle line:84%
to return to the Hebrew
or the biblical land,

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:03.670 align:middle line:84%
but not in the spiritual,
but more as land workers,

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.750 align:middle line:84%
to really dig themselves
into the land.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:12.080 align:middle line:84%
So in the kibbutz, we celebrated
a lot of the Jewish holidays.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.970 align:middle line:84%
But we celebrated them
in a different way.

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.320 align:middle line:84%
It was a celebration
of the four seasons.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:23.690 align:middle line:84%
It was a celebration of the
fruits and of the work we--

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The
bounty of your labor.

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:26.240 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: Exactly.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.120 align:middle line:84%
So it didn't have
any religion aspect.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And even if we learned
or studied the Bible,

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:34.930 align:middle line:90%
it was more for history.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:40.900 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't about the
religion aspect of it.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And we lived-- our
kibbutz was on top

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:50.400 align:middle line:84%
of a sixth century or fifth
century Hebrew settlement

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.170 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And we grew up with Roman
coins and with stone arrows

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:04.180 align:middle line:90%
and with shreds of old tools.

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:08.380 align:middle line:84%
We sat in the caves of
the old ancient people.

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:13.510 align:middle line:84%
So for us, the fifth
century and the 20th century

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:15.410 align:middle line:84%
were very, very close,
and we didn't really

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.320 align:middle line:90%
understand how close we are.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.200 align:middle line:84%
I only understand it now because
I'm doing this shamanic work,

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:24.100 align:middle line:84%
and we're working with
a lot the ancestry

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.560 align:middle line:90%
aspects of spirituality.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.230 align:middle line:84%
But we grew up with
that, with the spirit

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:33.330 align:middle line:84%
of the mountain where King
Saul cursed the mountain.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And the great army chief Gideon
was fighting the Plishtim.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:47.160 align:middle line:84%
So there was a lot
of that around us.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The spirit
of that around you.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.700 align:middle line:84%
And yet at the same time,
this comes back later

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.530 align:middle line:84%
on because you were
used to digging around

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:59.660 align:middle line:84%
in the dirt with little
worms and microbes

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:02.720 align:middle line:84%
under your fingernails and
the land, which is ultimately

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.910 align:middle line:84%
what you ended up turning
toward when it was time

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:08.730 align:middle line:84%
for you to have your
coincidental experience

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:09.947 align:middle line:90%
and be called elsewhere.

00:08:09.947 --> 00:08:10.530 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: Yes.

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's the
shapeshifter you're

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:17.520 align:middle line:84%
talking about because I'm
shapeshifting into something

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:22.960 align:middle line:84%
that feels familiar to me
from the childhood, maybe.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.830 align:middle line:84%
But I'm taking it into
a different level.

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:30.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think that I'm so grateful
for the way you put it together

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.940 align:middle line:84%
because in many ways,
I'm combining it now

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:37.080 align:middle line:84%
with my ancestry,
which is making peace

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.260 align:middle line:84%
with that part in
me that doesn't

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:44.470 align:middle line:84%
have to hate religion or the
spirituality but accept it.

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And my great grandfather
devoted his life

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.640 align:middle line:84%
to the fight between
good and evil,

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:53.610 align:middle line:84%
which is something that
in the shamanic tradition

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:56.650 align:middle line:90%
is a very strong practice.

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:59.570 align:middle line:90%
And I ended up doing that.

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:03.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing a lot of work with
extractions and possesions

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:04.940 align:middle line:90%
and work with evils.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:08.920 align:middle line:84%
And even in the
ayahuasca ceremony

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.990 align:middle line:84%
that I had in the
jungle in Brazil,

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:16.330 align:middle line:84%
I had experienced this with the
messages from those spirits.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:22.036 align:middle line:84%
So it's quite amazing to
me that I am returning--

00:09:22.036 --> 00:09:23.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: To your lineage.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.570 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: Exactly.

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:27.860 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now, you
had also, as a youth,

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:31.730 align:middle line:84%
your own paranormal experiences
that you tended to ignore

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:32.500 align:middle line:90%
or dismiss.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:35.630 align:middle line:84%
But these aptitudes
were already starting

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:40.150 align:middle line:84%
to develop in you at a
young age, it sounds like.

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:42.990 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: I think
that they were.

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:48.730 align:middle line:84%
But I think I was ashamed
of them or afraid of them.

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:52.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Your comrades
may not have appreciated it.

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.870 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: You remember, we grew
up in a kibbutz where everybody

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:57.680 align:middle line:90%
had to be like everybody else.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
what I'm saying.

00:09:58.490 --> 00:09:59.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.360 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: And so anything
that-- if you were too sensitive

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:06.780 align:middle line:84%
or you're too
dreamy or different,

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:10.090 align:middle line:90%
it really didn't look very good.

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And so you tried to mold
yourself to other people's

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.670 align:middle line:90%
behavior and expectations.

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:20.270 align:middle line:84%
So in many ways, I
learned to suppress that.

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And then when I did have
these feelings or emotions

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.634 align:middle line:84%
or visions, I kind
of dismissed them.

00:10:26.634 --> 00:10:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
it's not just me.

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:34.410 align:middle line:84%
I think that it's every
child that grew up in America

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:39.280 align:middle line:90%
today feel very much like that.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:45.084 align:middle line:84%
Our society is not celebrating
the ability of children

00:10:45.084 --> 00:10:52.080 align:middle line:84%
to see visions and talk
to imaginary friends,

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.090 align:middle line:84%
to their power
animals, in many ways.

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:56.870 align:middle line:90%
We give them stuffed animals.

00:10:56.870 --> 00:11:00.610 align:middle line:84%
But when children develop that
emotional connection to them,

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:05.810 align:middle line:84%
we're taking it away from
them because this is childish.

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:09.900 align:middle line:84%
But this is the way children
start to understand the world.

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.136 align:middle line:84%
And they know it, I
think, better than we do.

00:11:12.136 --> 00:11:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
before it's shut down.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.967 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: Exactly.

00:11:15.967 --> 00:11:16.550 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:18.880 align:middle line:84%
Let's get you out of
the office in New York

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:22.270 align:middle line:84%
City and your Revlon contract
and all that sort of thing.

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And then how did
you end up-- what

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:25.770 align:middle line:84%
was the coincidence
that happened,

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:27.840 align:middle line:84%
and then how did you
end up connecting

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.400 align:middle line:84%
with John Perkins, whom
I've also interviewed,

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.730 align:middle line:90%
and then also Michael Harner?

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:36.840 align:middle line:84%
How did that whole
journey begin?

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:42.090 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: In my late 30s, I
started to feel really empty.

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And I was asking
myself, what's next?

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:50.370 align:middle line:90%
What is it that I'm here for?

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And I walked around for a
couple of years wondering.

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:06.120 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't really find why.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And the craziness happened
because a friend of mine

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:13.190 align:middle line:84%
invited me to go with
him to Kalani, to Hawaii,

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:14.180 align:middle line:90%
the big island.

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:15.560 align:middle line:90%
There was a men's retreat there.

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:16.325 align:middle line:90%
And he says, come.

00:12:16.325 --> 00:12:17.960 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.590 align:middle line:84%
He was, at that time, in
the middle of his divorce,

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:21.870 align:middle line:90%
and I was depressed.

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:23.630 align:middle line:90%
And I said, why not?

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:25.460 align:middle line:90%
Let's do that.

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:27.460 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't have the money.

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:28.830 align:middle line:90%
I had three kids.

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And my wife is a dancer,
so she wasn't making money.

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And business and people
to pay salaries for I

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:40.000 align:middle line:90%
could not imagine.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.190 align:middle line:84%
And the coincidence happened
that a person I know--

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:51.190 align:middle line:84%
and I owe her so much--
offered me money for ticket.

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:56.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how, where
this idea came to her.

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:59.860 align:middle line:84%
But I took that
money, and I went.

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:03.200 align:middle line:90%
And it really changed my life.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:12.790 align:middle line:84%
I had this incredible experience
there, many experiences there,

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:14.010 align:middle line:90%
that I wrote in the book.

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And I started to see the
world in a different way.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.200 align:middle line:84%
But I think that
something very important

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.280 align:middle line:84%
happened was that before
my flight to Hawaii,

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:31.330 align:middle line:84%
I could not-- I mean, I
really want to have a book.

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.660 align:middle line:84%
It's 10 and a half
hours from New York.

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:35.340 align:middle line:90%
I needed a book to read.

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:37.100 align:middle line:84%
So I was looking for
a book about Hawaii

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:38.315 align:middle line:90%
to understand Hawaii more.

00:13:38.315 --> 00:13:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And so I ran into
Barnes & Noble Books.

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.910 align:middle line:90%
And I ran to the new releases.

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:46.430 align:middle line:84%
My car, my taxi was
waiting for me outside.

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:49.420 align:middle line:84%
And I ran to the new
release books, and I said,

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:50.890 align:middle line:90%
could you help me find a book?

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:51.800 align:middle line:90%
Maybe about Hawaii?

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.945 align:middle line:84%
And he says, oh,
there's a book now here.

00:13:53.945 --> 00:13:55.570 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at it,
and I just took it.

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:56.130 align:middle line:90%
It was Hank Wesselman.

00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:57.296 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love this part.

00:13:57.296 --> 00:13:59.240 align:middle line:90%
Hank Wesselman.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.800 align:middle line:90%
gt;gt; BEERY: "Spiritwalker."

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.130 align:middle line:90%
And it really changed my life.

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:02.300 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.320 align:middle line:90%
That was a really profound book.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.403 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: And I love Hank.

00:14:04.403 --> 00:14:07.024 align:middle line:84%
He's a wonderful,
wonderful teacher.

00:14:07.024 --> 00:14:08.440 align:middle line:84%
But I think that
what happened was

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:12.510 align:middle line:84%
that I was sitting on the plane,
and I was starting to read it.

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:18.210 align:middle line:84%
And I started to feel that there
are some answers, that he's

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:20.210 align:middle line:90%
answering my questions.

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:24.200 align:middle line:84%
And I started to really
cry because I finally

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:29.370 align:middle line:84%
read something that really
resonated deep into my soul.

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:31.350 align:middle line:90%
And that was so beautiful.

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't stop reading
it until I finished it.

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:37.025 align:middle line:84%
And in the last
chapter or so, there

00:14:37.025 --> 00:14:39.900 align:middle line:84%
is a description he
wrote about a workshop he

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:41.280 align:middle line:90%
took with Michael Harner.

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, I never heard
of shamanism before.

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:46.400 align:middle line:90%
I never heard of Michael Harner.

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.540 align:middle line:90%
He's a big star now.

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:49.750 align:middle line:90%
But I never heard of it.

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:53.170 align:middle line:90%
But I came back to New York.

00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:55.800 align:middle line:84%
And then two months later, I
took the New York Open Center

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.550 align:middle line:84%
catalog, and the Michael
Harner workshop was there.

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:01.810 align:middle line:84%
So I said, well, that's
too much of a coincidence.

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:07.010 align:middle line:90%
So I jumped into the workshop.

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:08.520 align:middle line:90%
And I was very skeptical.

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:13.140 align:middle line:84%
I saw 200 people sitting there,
and I said, this is not for me.

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:14.649 align:middle line:90%
This is all crazy people.

00:15:14.649 --> 00:15:15.690 align:middle line:90%
And what am I doing here?

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:17.860 align:middle line:90%
This is not for me.

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:20.390 align:middle line:84%
But the experience
that I went through,

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:23.550 align:middle line:90%
it was so deep and so moving.

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And they resonate so
strongly with my partner

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:32.680 align:middle line:90%
that I could not deny them.

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:34.805 align:middle line:84%
And I said, if there
is some truth to it,

00:15:34.805 --> 00:15:37.270 align:middle line:90%
I really need to explore that.

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I took
some more workshops.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And then one of those
workshops was John Perkins,

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:46.810 align:middle line:90%
a year or so later.

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:49.190 align:middle line:90%
And John is wonderful.

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:55.030 align:middle line:84%
He's full of enthusiasm
and knowledge of the Shuar

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:58.260 align:middle line:90%
and the people of the Andes.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.997 align:middle line:90%
And I just knew I had to go.

00:16:01.997 --> 00:16:03.830 align:middle line:84%
I went to my wife, and
I said, I have to go.

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:05.320 align:middle line:90%
And she said, you must be crazy.

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:06.210 align:middle line:90%
How can you leave us?

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:09.295 align:middle line:90%
I mean, no money, no work.

00:16:09.295 --> 00:16:10.170 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Got to go.

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: I said,
I just got to go.

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:14.885 align:middle line:84%
And I always tell
these people-- people

00:16:14.885 --> 00:16:17.010 align:middle line:84%
who said I don't have money
and I don't have time--

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:20.317 align:middle line:84%
because if your heart,
guts tells you to do,

00:16:20.317 --> 00:16:21.650 align:middle line:90%
you've got to follow your heart.

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:22.566 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:16:22.566 --> 00:16:24.630 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: And I went.

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And it really, again,
shifted my life.

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And I met there Jose Joaquin
Pineda, who became my teacher.

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:35.680 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Don Jose.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:36.080 align:middle line:90%
No, not Don Jose.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:36.720 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: Don Jose.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:37.150 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:38.816 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: Yeah, Don
Jose Joaquin Pineda,

00:16:38.816 --> 00:16:44.820 align:middle line:84%
who two years later became--
I became his apprentice.

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And I had a series of very
profound healings with him,

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:52.240 align:middle line:90%
with visions.

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And one of them was
the initiation vision

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:59.490 align:middle line:84%
on the mountains, which I
shapeshifted into the eagle,

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:03.350 align:middle line:90%
which is in part of that book.

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:10.579 align:middle line:84%
And then I was always asking
myself if this is for me.

00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:12.150 align:middle line:90%
I was still very skeptic.

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:15.280 align:middle line:84%
I never really took it as a--
I was in the middle of it.

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:20.220 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have the perspective
of time to really look at it.

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:24.869 align:middle line:84%
And it took him
two or three years

00:17:24.869 --> 00:17:28.657 align:middle line:84%
to push me to start
to do the work myself.

00:17:28.657 --> 00:17:30.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: He was seeing
something in you that you

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:32.200 align:middle line:90%
didn't see in yourself.

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: Absolutely.

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:35.590 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:39.140 align:middle line:84%
And there are many times I
still don't see it in myself.

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:44.290 align:middle line:84%
I still think that--
what did he see?

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:48.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, you have
extreme sensitivity, for one.

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:53.220 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: Yes, but there's
also another element, I think.

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:54.180 align:middle line:90%
You can be sensitive.

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:55.400 align:middle line:90%
But you have to be powerful.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:00.900 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: You have to know how
to cut and to be a warrior with

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:03.410 align:middle line:90%
keeping your sensitivity, too.

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And I never believed that
I had that power in me

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:12.280 align:middle line:84%
to go so deep and so
profound, like he did.

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.080 align:middle line:90%
I always admire him.

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:18.690 align:middle line:84%
He's such an amazing Yachak,
comes from a lineage,

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:19.894 align:middle line:90%
like five generations of--

00:18:19.894 --> 00:18:22.060 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I've heard about
Don Jose through others.

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:22.559 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:22.559 --> 00:18:24.760 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: Oh.

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.250 align:middle line:90%
He's powerful.

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:30.420 align:middle line:84%
Very strong, masculine,
and knowledgeable.

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:34.660 align:middle line:90%
And you can't mess up with him.

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:37.179 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: He doesn't
suffer fools gladly.

00:18:37.179 --> 00:18:38.220 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: No, not at all.

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:38.886 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:38.886 --> 00:18:41.300 align:middle line:84%
So you had to play the fool
a time or two, I suppose,

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:42.160 align:middle line:90%
in the beginning.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.677 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: No, I never did.

00:18:43.677 --> 00:18:44.260 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No?

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:44.900 align:middle line:90%
Never happened?

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:45.870 align:middle line:90%
You never tripped up?

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:46.377 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:18:46.377 --> 00:18:47.460 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: No, I never did.

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:50.030 align:middle line:90%


00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:54.610 align:middle line:84%
It was very strange because
I never asked him questions.

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:57.120 align:middle line:84%
When I tried, he looked
at me in such a way

00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:00.450 align:middle line:90%
that I stopped on my heels.

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:02.900 align:middle line:84%
So I learned not
to ask questions,

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:04.750 align:middle line:90%
not to expect anything.

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And he gave me more and more
to do in the ceremonies.

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And really over
lunch and dinners,

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:15.440 align:middle line:84%
we-- he never really
taught me in the same way

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:18.630 align:middle line:84%
that-- he never did
a workshop for me.

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:22.620 align:middle line:84%
It's through being with him
that I learned all of that.

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:25.830 align:middle line:84%
And that, I think,
that's what people today

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:29.810 align:middle line:84%
are so missing is the direct
connection with the souls

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:31.770 align:middle line:84%
of the people who are
coming from the earth

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:33.290 align:middle line:90%
and doing this work.

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:35.891 align:middle line:84%
They want to go
to one workshop--

00:19:35.891 --> 00:19:37.640 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, for
a weekend and get it.

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.740 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: And then
they become shamans.

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:41.240 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work this way.

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:47.770 align:middle line:84%
You really have to
feel it, own it.

00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And I was really lucky because
I had this work with Don Jose.

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And then I worked with Ipupiara,
who is a Brazilian shaman,

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:00.450 align:middle line:90%
for 12 years.

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:02.090 align:middle line:84%
I assisted him and
worked with him

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:04.500 align:middle line:90%
and worked on trips with him.

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.480 align:middle line:90%
And he was such a dear friend.

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:09.030 align:middle line:90%
He passed away a few years ago.

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And he really taught me a
lot about Amazonian healing

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:15.660 align:middle line:90%
and traditions.

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:21.420 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very incredibly
lucky in that way.

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:26.380 align:middle line:84%
But when I look at it, I
never went to Ecuador trip

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:29.212 align:middle line:84%
hoping that I would
become a shaman.

00:20:29.212 --> 00:20:29.920 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:31.346 align:middle line:90%
You weren't striving for that.

00:20:31.346 --> 00:20:32.220 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: Not at all.

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:32.886 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:20:32.886 --> 00:20:34.120 align:middle line:90%
They chose you.

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:37.070 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: And when I
read, many years ago,

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:40.520 align:middle line:84%
Carlos Castaneda's book, and he
met this shaman and becomes his

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:44.900 align:middle line:84%
apprentice, I said, that
happened to only strange

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:47.600 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.060 align:middle line:90%
It would never happen to me.

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:51.390 align:middle line:90%
But why me?

00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:55.350 align:middle line:84%
But it does happen to all of
us if you are open, if you

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:58.290 align:middle line:90%
allow yourself to accept that.

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And it may not be
Jose Joaquin Pineda.

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:03.870 align:middle line:90%
It may not be Ipupiara.

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:06.490 align:middle line:90%
But it might be somebody else.

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:10.650 align:middle line:84%
You've got to be really
open-hearted to accept it.

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:14.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's talk
about something we are talking

00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:17.380 align:middle line:84%
at the lunch table about earlier
today because it's a little--

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:19.150 align:middle line:90%
I was joking with you initially.

00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:22.070 align:middle line:84%
But we were talking about
the ayahuasca experience.

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And one part of the
experience for a lot of people

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:29.910 align:middle line:84%
is that whatever's going on
in their stomach comes up.

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:34.090 align:middle line:84%
And you were saying that
unbeknownst to most people,

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:39.530 align:middle line:84%
it appears, the shaman
often examine the contents

00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:40.640 align:middle line:90%
of that person's stomach.

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've never
heard this before.

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:45.120 align:middle line:84%
Talk to us about that,
about what happened to you,

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:46.890 align:middle line:84%
and what you
discovered about that.

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:50.170 align:middle line:90%


00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:54.340 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: I did not read all
the books about ayahuasca.

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't really see all
the movies about ayahuasca.

00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:59.610 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if
they did not say it.

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:02.240 align:middle line:84%
But there are certain
things that people do not

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:10.170 align:middle line:84%
mention-- that ayahuasca
is a healing brew or tea.

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:15.980 align:middle line:84%
And it mostly is to
alkalize your stomach

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:19.020 align:middle line:90%
or your whole system.

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:25.830 align:middle line:84%
The combination of the natema
or the vine and the chacruna

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:32.780 align:middle line:84%
leaves create this
bitter drink that clear

00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:34.630 align:middle line:90%
and cleans your stomach.

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And that is the first
priority-- to remove bacteria,

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:45.490 align:middle line:84%
to remove parasites, to
remove all this stuff that

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:46.360 align:middle line:90%
is in their food.

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:48.120 align:middle line:90%
They eat raw food.

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:49.440 align:middle line:90%
They don't have refrigerations.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.310 align:middle line:90%
They don't cook.

00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:51.970 align:middle line:90%
I mean it's all there.

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:54.370 align:middle line:90%
So this is the main thing.

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And when you purge,
you purge the physical

00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:04.030 align:middle line:84%
and this emotional, spiritual
content of your stomach

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:09.400 align:middle line:84%
because in the stomach we
hold fear, trauma, emotions,

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:10.300 align:middle line:90%
memories.

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:11.610 align:middle line:90%
Everything is in our stomach.

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:14.450 align:middle line:90%


00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:18.820 align:middle line:84%
So the shamans or the
ayahuascaro-- now,

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:22.187 align:middle line:84%
I want to also make
distinction between--

00:23:22.187 --> 00:23:23.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The shaman
and ayahuascaro?

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:24.450 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: Yes.

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:26.790 align:middle line:84%
It is very important
because there

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:32.956 align:middle line:84%
are some people who are
trained to hand ayahuasca

00:23:32.956 --> 00:23:36.880 align:middle line:90%
to their clients.

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.920 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't
make them shamans.

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.030 align:middle line:90%
They may not see spirit.

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:42.930 align:middle line:90%
They may not talk to spirit.

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:45.920 align:middle line:84%
They may not know, even,
how to manipulate spirit

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:49.586 align:middle line:84%
to heal the clients in the
process of the ayahuasca

00:23:49.586 --> 00:23:50.085 align:middle line:90%
journey.

00:23:50.085 --> 00:23:53.240 align:middle line:90%


00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:55.000 align:middle line:90%
They know how to hold space.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.780 align:middle line:90%
That's a different place.

00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:01.070 align:middle line:90%


00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:07.040 align:middle line:84%
Shamans in the Amazon
give ayahuasca.

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:10.270 align:middle line:90%


00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:12.630 align:middle line:90%
They're not ayahuascaro.

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And so they work through you,
with you, through the process,

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:22.610 align:middle line:84%
through their icaros,
and through working

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:23.580 align:middle line:90%
with the spirit.

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And they heal you
one on one, not 60

00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:33.840 align:middle line:90%
or 80 people at the same time.

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:38.664 align:middle line:84%
And so they are very in tune
to what's going on with you.

00:24:38.664 --> 00:24:41.080 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They can see where
you're going and the beings,

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:43.990 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes, that you're being
confronted with and so forth.

00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:45.181 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: Yes.

00:24:45.181 --> 00:24:47.510 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's like they go
into the journey with you.

00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:48.485 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: Exactly.

00:24:48.485 --> 00:24:52.690 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, but
they see what you do.

00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:55.140 align:middle line:90%
I had this ability, too.

00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:58.330 align:middle line:84%
And I was journeying
with another person

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:01.030 align:middle line:90%
when I was observing him.

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And I worked with his
emotion, with the loss

00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:07.090 align:middle line:90%
of his mother and whatever.

00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:12.720 align:middle line:90%
That's very important.

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:18.840 align:middle line:84%
And so the shamans, when you
puke your-- he goes there.

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And he sees on the ground
what you are purging.

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:27.770 align:middle line:84%
And by the quantity,
the quality,

00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:30.890 align:middle line:84%
and what's in it--
you remember, he's

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:35.570 align:middle line:84%
also on ayahuasca-- he sees the
spirit that comes out of you.

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:38.830 align:middle line:84%
He can determine in what
kind of state you are.

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:41.670 align:middle line:90%


00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:47.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, for me, after doing a
few more ayahuasca journeys

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:53.600 align:middle line:90%
in Brazil, my purge was clear.

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:58.170 align:middle line:84%
So he offered me to become his
apprentice, which I declined

00:25:58.170 --> 00:26:01.170 align:middle line:90%
because it's not my way.

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:09.220 align:middle line:84%
But when you find ways to
clear your emotional world

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:15.839 align:middle line:84%
and your health, then you can
become a shaman, a healer.

00:26:15.839 --> 00:26:17.380 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So yeah,
it's interesting.

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:20.111 align:middle line:84%
I'd never heard those
distinctions before.

00:26:20.111 --> 00:26:20.610 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:25.420 align:middle line:84%
Now let's go into what--
some of the modalities

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:27.580 align:middle line:90%
that you were trained in.

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:32.390 align:middle line:84%
And we can start-- where
is the best place to start?

00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:34.880 align:middle line:84%
With all of the various--
I mean, candle reading.

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:36.530 align:middle line:90%
Let's start with candle reading.

00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:39.599 align:middle line:84%
I found candle reading
really an interesting concept

00:26:39.599 --> 00:26:40.140 align:middle line:90%
in your book.

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:42.056 align:middle line:84%
And they taught you how
to do candle readings.

00:26:42.056 --> 00:26:43.630 align:middle line:90%
Do you still do them?

00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:45.280 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: I do
them all the time.

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is the first
session of healing,

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:51.700 align:middle line:84%
is to be able to
do candle reading.

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:54.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now, explain to
everyone what candle reading

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:56.880 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:00.240 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: Candle reading
is probably the fastest way

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:05.120 align:middle line:84%
to diagnose physical,
emotional, and spiritual element

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:09.410 align:middle line:84%
of the client the first
time he comes to you.

00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:12.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's a technique
that many of the Yachaks

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:17.390 align:middle line:84%
or the shamans of the Andes
are using all the time.

00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:20.180 align:middle line:84%
They use, mostly,
two techniques.

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:21.390 align:middle line:90%
One is the candle reading.

00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:23.120 align:middle line:90%
One is a palm reading.

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:25.330 align:middle line:90%
Both techniques are used.

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:28.690 align:middle line:84%
And I use it in combination
because many times

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:31.750 align:middle line:84%
what you see in the candle
reflects in the hands.

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:32.865 align:middle line:90%
And it gives--

00:27:32.865 --> 00:27:33.990 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Some validation.

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:35.900 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: Validation
of information.

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it gives
you a new observation

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:46.110 align:middle line:84%
because it enlarges the
scope of the diagnostic.

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:49.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So explain how the
candle ceremony or reading

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:50.490 align:middle line:90%
works.

00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:54.630 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: So the wax, when
you rub it on your body,

00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:56.266 align:middle line:90%
absorbs your physical--

00:27:56.266 --> 00:27:57.890 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you
take a candle, right?

00:27:57.890 --> 00:27:58.240 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: Yes.

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:00.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And then the client
would just kind of rub it up

00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:01.657 align:middle line:90%
against your body.

00:28:01.657 --> 00:28:02.240 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: Yes.

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:04.500 align:middle line:84%
You start from the
top of your head,

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:07.530 align:middle line:84%
over your face, your left
hand, your right hand,

00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:08.650 align:middle line:90%
your entire body.

00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:09.350 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So it
gets your energy.

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:11.641 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: And you close your
eyes, and you concentrate.

00:28:11.641 --> 00:28:14.660 align:middle line:84%
You bring all the issues and
the problems and the questions

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:17.560 align:middle line:84%
that you came for
healing into the candle.

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:20.030 align:middle line:90%
And the candle absorbs it.

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:23.395 align:middle line:84%
Now, the candles come from
the same manufacturer.

00:28:23.395 --> 00:28:25.890 align:middle line:90%
There are 72 in each box.

00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:28.590 align:middle line:84%
And every time you
light a candle,

00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:32.040 align:middle line:90%
it's different because--

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:34.850 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so explain this,
the burning pattern and how you

00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:35.680 align:middle line:90%
read it.

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:39.990 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: So it's
the burning pattern.

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:42.210 align:middle line:90%
It's the colors.

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:44.360 align:middle line:90%
It's the movement of the wick.

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:47.270 align:middle line:90%
It's the dripping of the wax.

00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:52.070 align:middle line:84%
It's the size and the
shape of the flame.

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:53.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm writing about it.

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:56.060 align:middle line:84%
I wrote about it in this
book with a little bit of it.

00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:58.659 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to extend on
it in my next book, which

00:28:58.659 --> 00:28:59.950 align:middle line:90%
is going to be about a healing.

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:02.010 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to really
do step-by-step on it

00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:03.910 align:middle line:84%
because I think it's
really important.

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:05.434 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's fascinating.

00:29:05.434 --> 00:29:06.600 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: It is fascinating.

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And I'm teaching
it in my workshops

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:12.320 align:middle line:84%
because I believe that
people should use it.

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:14.980 align:middle line:10%
It's such a-- not
easy, I would say.

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:17.840 align:middle line:10%
But it took me
two years to learn

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:20.230 align:middle line:10%
because nobody taught me that.

00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:22.434 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You observed
it through who?

00:29:22.434 --> 00:29:23.850 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: Don Jose
Joaquin Pineda.

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:24.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:27.780 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: Well, but he
is teaching the old way.

00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:30.980 align:middle line:84%
You sit behind
me, and you watch.

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:34.480 align:middle line:84%
So I sat for two years
behind his back and watched.

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And I was like admiring
his amazing ability,

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:42.212 align:middle line:84%
wondering why I am so
stupid and I can't get it.

00:29:42.212 --> 00:29:43.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I remember
reading that.

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:45.180 align:middle line:84%
You're just like,
this isn't for me.

00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:46.350 align:middle line:90%
I can't do it.

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:47.740 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: I can't do it.

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And then one day,
this woman walked in.

00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at her
candle, and I said,

00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:57.340 align:middle line:84%
Jose, she has problems
with her stomach.

00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:59.110 align:middle line:90%
And he says, shh.

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:02.580 align:middle line:90%
I knew I got it.

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:05.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so after that,
you started initiating them

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:07.520 align:middle line:90%
on your own?

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:12.000 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: Well, after that, I
continued to watch him behind

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:12.530 align:middle line:90%
his back.

00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:13.970 align:middle line:90%
But then I understood.

00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:16.040 align:middle line:90%
I got the concept.

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:18.670 align:middle line:84%
And Ipupiara added
to it another layers

00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:20.680 align:middle line:84%
of the colors and
shapes, which is more

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:22.430 align:middle line:90%
in the Brazilian tradition.

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:28.060 align:middle line:84%
And so I brought both Don Jose
and Ipupiara-- by the way,

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:28.980 align:middle line:90%
they knew each other.

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:32.820 align:middle line:84%
They were together at
Omega in the gathering

00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:36.410 align:middle line:84%
of shamans with John Perkins,
brought them together.

00:30:36.410 --> 00:30:37.960 align:middle line:84%
You know, Don Jose
Joaquin Pineda

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:39.945 align:middle line:84%
was a teacher of
John Perkins, too.

00:30:39.945 --> 00:30:40.570 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:43.435 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: I did not know
that for many years.

00:30:43.435 --> 00:30:44.060 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:44.976 align:middle line:90%
He was with the Shuar.

00:30:44.976 --> 00:30:45.550 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:46.220 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: Yes.

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:50.950 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very strong
connection there, too.

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:54.210 align:middle line:84%
So I brought these two
teachings together.

00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And now I teach
it in my courses.

00:30:57.350 --> 00:31:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And I have people in
Amsterdam, in Turkey, in Italy,

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:07.780 align:middle line:84%
in Israel that are healers
that are using it now.

00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And so my mission is really
to bring that tool to--

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:16.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And it's
specifically diagnostic.

00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:17.710 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: It is diagnostic.

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:18.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:23.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's so powerful
because it's so simple.

00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And you go-- if you
see somebody's trauma,

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:33.620 align:middle line:84%
you can diagnose to it the exact
time or the exact year of when

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:34.560 align:middle line:90%
the trauma happened.

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:35.310 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Really?

00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:37.297 align:middle line:90%
Through that same modality?

00:31:37.297 --> 00:31:37.880 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: Yes.

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:41.040 align:middle line:90%
And you can see sexual trauma.

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:42.670 align:middle line:90%
You can see emotional.

00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:45.220 align:middle line:90%
You can see ancestors.

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:46.730 align:middle line:90%
You can see people at work.

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:48.510 align:middle line:90%
You can see their homes.

00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:49.690 align:middle line:90%
You can travel.

00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:51.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's all
in that because you

00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:54.610 align:middle line:84%
have to remember that
it's based on the concept

00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:58.034 align:middle line:84%
that around each of
us, there's an energy.

00:31:58.034 --> 00:31:58.700 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Sure.

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:01.070 align:middle line:84%
The aura has lots
of information.

00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:06.520 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: We call it egg shell
or the energy field around you

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:13.670 align:middle line:84%
surrounded by a shield with the
positive ions that go around

00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:14.860 align:middle line:90%
and the negative.

00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:17.720 align:middle line:84%
And they protect
you like the same

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:22.120 align:middle line:84%
as the atmosphere around
the globe or like the egg.

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:28.300 align:middle line:84%
So in that energy field,
we keep our memories.

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:30.720 align:middle line:90%
We keep our traumas.

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:36.760 align:middle line:84%
Everything is around
you-- your grandmother.

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:40.630 align:middle line:90%
So everything is here.

00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:43.970 align:middle line:84%
It's just the question
is, can you see it?

00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:45.420 align:middle line:90%
And what do you do with it?

00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:46.400 align:middle line:90%
So I see.

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:48.450 align:middle line:84%
So I can speak to
those spirits, and I

00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:54.820 align:middle line:84%
can invite them to give
me information, what

00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:57.600 align:middle line:90%
the messages for people are.

00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:00.550 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that every
person can do that.

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:02.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So when you're
doing the candle readings

00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:05.400 align:middle line:84%
and the diagnosis, you're
also-- because you're tapping

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:08.260 align:middle line:84%
into that matrix
of all information,

00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:14.770 align:middle line:84%
you're getting feedback and
also suggestions from the other

00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:17.000 align:middle line:84%
spirits or beings
or aspect of self?

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.530 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: Yeah.

00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:22.540 align:middle line:84%
I had a great, great, great
grandmother from Sicily

00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:25.950 align:middle line:90%
came to one of my clients.

00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And she was complimenting
me for working with her

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:36.370 align:middle line:84%
because she needed to
give her a ceremony

00:33:36.370 --> 00:33:40.730 align:middle line:90%
to do with a group of women.

00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And so she was teaching
me this fire ceremony

00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:47.016 align:middle line:90%
that they were doing in Sicily.

00:33:47.016 --> 00:33:48.140 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: A fire ceremony?

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:51.820 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: Fire
ceremony at midnight.

00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:54.420 align:middle line:84%
And she showed me
how they put the fire

00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:58.810 align:middle line:84%
and walk on the fire and the
stones that are all around it

00:33:58.810 --> 00:34:01.910 align:middle line:84%
and how they keep all
the energies there.

00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:04.090 align:middle line:90%
But it's about empowering women.

00:34:04.090 --> 00:34:07.560 align:middle line:84%
But it's at midnight,
when the husband's asleep.

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:10.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:34:10.350 --> 00:34:12.690 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: And that woman,
she became a healer.

00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:15.420 align:middle line:90%


00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:19.780 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Tell us-- maybe
give us one interesting example

00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:23.610 align:middle line:84%
of exactly what you were
seeing in the candle reading

00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:26.590 align:middle line:84%
of an individual and how it
showed itself within the flame

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:29.679 align:middle line:84%
and the wax and everything,
just so we can have a portrait

00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:32.109 align:middle line:84%
in our mind of what
that looks like.

00:34:32.109 --> 00:34:33.650 align:middle line:84%
I know you've done
thousands of them.

00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:37.380 align:middle line:84%
Just choose one that
pops into your head.

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:40.670 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: I like this example
because it was so mundane

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:41.429 align:middle line:90%
in many ways.

00:34:41.429 --> 00:34:42.449 align:middle line:90%
This woman came to me.

00:34:42.449 --> 00:34:46.270 align:middle line:84%
She was working with a
big bank in New York.

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:49.270 align:middle line:90%
She was executive secretary.

00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And she and her immediate
boss got into trouble

00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:58.460 align:middle line:84%
because she found
some irregularities

00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:01.460 align:middle line:90%
in her bookkeeping or something.

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:09.317 align:middle line:84%
And her boss wanted to
fire her or to demote her.

00:35:09.317 --> 00:35:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking
at the candle, and I

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:19.350 align:middle line:84%
saw this guy wearing brown,
short guy with brown suit.

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And he said he's
going to protect her.

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:26.510 align:middle line:84%
And then there was another
guy with a black suit,

00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:28.380 align:middle line:90%
tall with black hair.

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:31.780 align:middle line:90%
The other guy was bald.

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:37.390 align:middle line:84%
So I asked her if she
had another boss who

00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:41.900 align:middle line:84%
liked to wear brown
suits, and he likes her.

00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:44.075 align:middle line:84%
And there's another guy
who doesn't with the black,

00:35:44.075 --> 00:35:45.260 align:middle line:90%
da da da.

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:46.290 align:middle line:90%
And she said, yes.

00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:47.410 align:middle line:90%
How do you know?

00:35:47.410 --> 00:35:49.256 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, they are here.

00:35:49.256 --> 00:35:55.715 align:middle line:84%
I said, he said he
wants to protect you.

00:35:55.715 --> 00:35:58.300 align:middle line:90%
And she says, I can't go to him.

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:01.070 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm a secretary.

00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:02.340 align:middle line:90%
Why I can go to--

00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:04.180 align:middle line:90%
I said, he likes you.

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:06.410 align:middle line:84%
He said he's going
to protect you.

00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And that guy, he's going
to create problems.

00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:11.469 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The black-haired
and black-suited guy.

00:36:11.469 --> 00:36:13.135 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: He's going
to create problems.

00:36:13.135 --> 00:36:15.550 align:middle line:90%
And I said, you go next week.

00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:19.020 align:middle line:84%
You go to him, and you
speak to the short, brown--

00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:21.150 align:middle line:90%
and it happened.

00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And he told me what
to tell her, that he's

00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:26.710 align:middle line:90%
going to be her boss with her.

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:34.172 align:middle line:84%
So the whole work happened
exactly like he said.

00:36:34.172 --> 00:36:36.630 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So people don't just
come for physical maladies.

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:40.047 align:middle line:84%
They can be spiritual,
emotional, mental, anything.

00:36:40.047 --> 00:36:40.630 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: Yes.

00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:43.129 align:middle line:84%
Well, in shamanism, there
is no difference between--

00:36:43.129 --> 00:36:44.170 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No separation.

00:36:44.170 --> 00:36:44.670 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:47.640 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: Yeah, between
the physical, emotional,

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:52.100 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual world, the
disease, the physical disease,

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:52.946 align:middle line:90%
is a demonstration.

00:36:52.946 --> 00:36:54.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, that's
what I was wondering.

00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:57.160 align:middle line:84%
Did she have some physical
symptoms that were going on?

00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:57.800 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: No.

00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:58.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:01.540 align:middle line:84%
So for her it was more of
an emotional, spiritual,

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:02.885 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:37:02.885 --> 00:37:03.510 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: Yeah.

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:06.080 align:middle line:90%


00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:11.220 align:middle line:84%
That particular woman was--
there's another technique

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:16.706 align:middle line:84%
that I'm talking about there
is about the ethics seeing.

00:37:16.706 --> 00:37:21.170 align:middle line:90%
I had a decision with her.

00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:25.400 align:middle line:84%
In that technique,
you pass your hands

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:27.480 align:middle line:90%
on different parts of the body.

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And you're listening to the
different sides, to the heart,

00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:35.150 align:middle line:84%
to the male, female,
and your sexual--

00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:36.610 align:middle line:90%
and you can really tell.

00:37:36.610 --> 00:37:41.800 align:middle line:84%
And there are images that
are coming into your mind.

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is that
whatever comes to your mind,

00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:48.590 align:middle line:84%
you share it with the clients,
and they can share with you.

00:37:48.590 --> 00:37:51.620 align:middle line:90%


00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And when I was touching
her female part,

00:37:58.290 --> 00:38:02.730 align:middle line:84%
I saw her as a 16-year-old
girl, had an abortion.

00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And when I shared
it with her, she

00:38:09.850 --> 00:38:15.994 align:middle line:84%
broke down because it was the
first person that she ever--

00:38:15.994 --> 00:38:17.410 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Had to
share that with.

00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:17.909 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:17.909 --> 00:38:18.820 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: Share with.

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:20.500 align:middle line:84%
She never shared
with her mother.

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:23.860 align:middle line:84%
Never shared with
anyone in the world.

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And then I put my hand
on the muscular side,

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:32.040 align:middle line:84%
and I saw the guy, the
17-year-old boyfriend.

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And I described him exactly
what it is and what he told her.

00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And it was such a great healing,
the release of that secret.

00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:45.620 align:middle line:90%


00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:49.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's, I think,
the power of shamanism

00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:54.430 align:middle line:84%
because you can go
so deep so quickly.

00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And you heal those soul, or
the part of the soul that

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:01.160 align:middle line:90%
are ashamed of themselves.

00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:07.670 align:middle line:84%
They're not willing to come out
and be a person in the world.

00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:17.799 align:middle line:84%
So that release of acknowledging
her misfortune at that time

00:39:17.799 --> 00:39:18.465 align:middle line:90%
was an amazing--

00:39:18.465 --> 00:39:20.370 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Freed
energy up in her.

00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:21.260 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: Yes.

00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:26.190 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now, OK, before
we get onto the Aztec seeing

00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:29.464 align:middle line:84%
and some other things--
you're in New York City.

00:39:29.464 --> 00:39:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And you're doing candle
readings and Aztec readings.

00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:32.890 align:middle line:90%
How are things at home?

00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:33.890 align:middle line:90%
How'd your home life go?

00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:36.970 align:middle line:90%


00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: Well, when I started
to do that or walk on that

00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:48.540 align:middle line:84%
path, it really brought a
lot of anxiety in my family.

00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:51.310 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I would guess.

00:39:51.310 --> 00:39:55.360 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: All of a sudden,
Daddy's not there much.

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:58.870 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, he's going
to these places, crazy places.

00:39:58.870 --> 00:40:01.955 align:middle line:84%
He's doing things
that nobody does.

00:40:01.955 --> 00:40:02.830 align:middle line:90%
What happened to him?

00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:04.490 align:middle line:90%
Well, I was in a midlife crisis.

00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:07.380 align:middle line:90%


00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:08.222 align:middle line:90%
But for them--

00:40:08.222 --> 00:40:10.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That was like
buying a red Corvette.

00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:13.507 align:middle line:84%
You just happened to
take off for the Andes.

00:40:13.507 --> 00:40:15.006 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: I prefer
that, by the way.

00:40:15.006 --> 00:40:17.410 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, of course.

00:40:17.410 --> 00:40:25.130 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: But for them, it was
a little tough because they saw

00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:27.930 align:middle line:90%
me through these experiences.

00:40:27.930 --> 00:40:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to bring these
experiences back to them.

00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:36.850 align:middle line:84%
Like I came one time from
the Shuars, the Amazon.

00:40:36.850 --> 00:40:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And I brought this
water canteen.

00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:41.550 align:middle line:90%
And I opened it up.

00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:44.940 align:middle line:84%
And there was like red
ants in the whole thing.

00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And they're spreading
all around the house.

00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:50.010 align:middle line:90%
And so they really understood.

00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:53.390 align:middle line:84%
They had this
visceral experience

00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:57.940 align:middle line:84%
of what it means to be
bitten by fire ants.

00:40:57.940 --> 00:40:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And we still talk
about that experience

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:03.790 align:middle line:90%
because it was so frightening.

00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:07.435 align:middle line:84%
And I brought elements from
there and drums and feathers

00:41:07.435 --> 00:41:08.949 align:middle line:90%
and spears.

00:41:08.949 --> 00:41:11.240 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So they thought
you'd gone off the deep end.

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:11.990 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: Exactly.

00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:13.410 align:middle line:90%
And especially my daughter.

00:41:13.410 --> 00:41:15.390 align:middle line:84%
She thought that
I'm drug addict,

00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:17.572 align:middle line:90%
doing ayahuasca and all that.

00:41:17.572 --> 00:41:18.280 align:middle line:90%
And I understand.

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:19.810 align:middle line:90%
They were afraid.

00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:22.080 align:middle line:84%
They saw me through
these changes.

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:25.650 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's changed
because when I started to teach,

00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:28.160 align:middle line:84%
when I started to do
healing, and they started

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:35.520 align:middle line:84%
to hear that people
are benefiting from it,

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:38.310 align:middle line:84%
they started to get used
to it and proud of it.

00:41:38.310 --> 00:41:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And I think that-- I was
talking to that with my wife.

00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:47.546 align:middle line:84%
And I think that I gave
them a really great example

00:41:47.546 --> 00:41:49.330 align:middle line:90%
to follow their heart.

00:41:49.330 --> 00:41:49.960 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:52.500 align:middle line:84%
What a beautiful
gift for all of them.

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:53.340 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: Yeah.

00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:55.331 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And your story
for others, as well.

00:41:55.331 --> 00:41:55.830 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:55.830 --> 00:41:59.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's go back into
some of the modalities.

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:00.870 align:middle line:90%
You mentioned Aztec seeing.

00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:03.380 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds like
these modalities,

00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:06.210 align:middle line:84%
the common theme
here is the ability

00:42:06.210 --> 00:42:10.687 align:middle line:84%
to access the information
within another person's field.

00:42:10.687 --> 00:42:11.270 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: Yes.

00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And Ipupiara used to say
that we are all shamans.

00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:24.710 align:middle line:84%
Every person that watches us and
every person in this universe--

00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:30.100 align:middle line:84%
and not just every person but
every animal and everything

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:35.080 align:middle line:84%
that is alive-- have
visions or sees.

00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:39.430 align:middle line:90%
It's not exclusive to humans.

00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:44.450 align:middle line:84%
But humans have the
responsibility to use it.

00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
we all have that.

00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:48.930 align:middle line:90%
We are born with it.

00:42:48.930 --> 00:42:50.640 align:middle line:90%
It's in our DNA.

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:53.820 align:middle line:84%
And you can heal in
many different ways.

00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:55.320 align:middle line:90%
You can heal with your voice.

00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:57.540 align:middle line:84%
You can heal with
the words you say.

00:42:57.540 --> 00:42:59.800 align:middle line:90%
You can heal with a touch.

00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:02.230 align:middle line:90%
You can heal with your hugs.

00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:04.540 align:middle line:90%
And we are all dreaming.

00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:06.700 align:middle line:90%
We all have deja vus.

00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:10.220 align:middle line:84%
We all have experiences
that we cannot explain--

00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:12.640 align:middle line:84%
when the phone rings,
you know who it is.

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:14.920 align:middle line:90%
It's very common.

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:18.960 align:middle line:84%
But what's common also is
that we are all denying it.

00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's this
book that I wrote,

00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:25.650 align:middle line:84%
that that's the gift of
shamanism is to really

00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:32.015 align:middle line:84%
give permission to people to
embrace it, use it, and verify

00:43:32.015 --> 00:43:35.790 align:middle line:90%
it, that it's not a [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:35.790 --> 00:43:40.140 align:middle line:84%
It's not the stories of the
grandmothers or the grandmother

00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:41.900 align:middle line:90%
stories.

00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:43.240 align:middle line:90%
It's real.

00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:46.230 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that
we have to remember,

00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:51.360 align:middle line:84%
that the survival of our
species depend on our ability

00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:55.280 align:middle line:84%
to connect between the worlds,
between the unseen world

00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:58.790 align:middle line:90%
and what we call the real world.

00:43:58.790 --> 00:44:02.750 align:middle line:84%
That's really what
kept us humans

00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:06.560 align:middle line:90%
for so many years on this earth.

00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:10.580 align:middle line:84%
And the danger that
we are now living

00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:12.690 align:middle line:84%
in this digital
society-- and that's

00:44:12.690 --> 00:44:15.450 align:middle line:84%
what I wrote in this book,
about the big shutdown

00:44:15.450 --> 00:44:20.260 align:middle line:84%
of the senses-- is that we
are depending more and more

00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:24.440 align:middle line:84%
on our tablets, on our
iPhones, on our computers.

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:26.310 align:middle line:84%
We're really shutting
down our senses.

00:44:26.310 --> 00:44:29.340 align:middle line:84%
So everybody goes
to their iPhone

00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:31.970 align:middle line:84%
and finds out what
the temperature is.

00:44:31.970 --> 00:44:34.420 align:middle line:84%
Nobody puts their
hands out the window.

00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:37.120 align:middle line:90%


00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:39.530 align:middle line:84%
Somebody reminded
me yesterday as I

00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:45.140 align:middle line:84%
was talking to him about
the people in Sri Lanka,

00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:49.480 align:middle line:84%
on the island when
the tsunami happened,

00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:55.740 align:middle line:84%
they were so connected to the
land and to their weather,

00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:59.280 align:middle line:84%
to the spirit, they
knew the tsunami comes.

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:01.750 align:middle line:84%
But the people in the
cities, the people

00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:05.800 align:middle line:84%
who were disconnected, stayed
on the beach in the hotels.

00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:06.510 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:09.500 align:middle line:84%
Their senses
weren't registering.

00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:15.870 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: So that's the danger,
in this symbolic, small way,

00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:20.890 align:middle line:84%
for us not listening to nature,
not listening to the forces

00:45:20.890 --> 00:45:27.297 align:middle line:84%
of spirit, not connecting to
our innate ability to see.

00:45:27.297 --> 00:45:27.880 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:29.710 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm going
to backtrack a bit.

00:45:29.710 --> 00:45:32.470 align:middle line:84%
And you just made mention
of it a while back.

00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:36.610 align:middle line:84%
But let's go to the
subject of soul retrieval.

00:45:36.610 --> 00:45:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And this disconnectedness
that we're

00:45:38.890 --> 00:45:40.700 align:middle line:84%
having from the
whole web of life,

00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:43.240 align:middle line:84%
I'll be curious to
see how that shows up

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:44.930 align:middle line:84%
within the subject
of soul retrieval.

00:45:44.930 --> 00:45:47.290 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
it in general terms

00:45:47.290 --> 00:45:49.770 align:middle line:84%
as you learned from
the shaman and how

00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:53.470 align:middle line:84%
one can start incorporating
the disowned part's of self.

00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:57.250 align:middle line:90%


00:45:57.250 --> 00:46:00.470 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: So according
to some shamanic--

00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:03.010 align:middle line:84%
I can't for all
shamanic experience,

00:46:03.010 --> 00:46:07.980 align:middle line:84%
that tradition because shamanic
traditions are varied all over

00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:09.430 align:middle line:90%
the world.

00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:11.780 align:middle line:90%
They're practiced differently.

00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:19.154 align:middle line:84%
We are really trying to
make a unified globalization

00:46:19.154 --> 00:46:20.070 align:middle line:90%
of the word shamanism.

00:46:20.070 --> 00:46:24.080 align:middle line:90%


00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:25.147 align:middle line:90%
It's not McDonald's.

00:46:25.147 --> 00:46:25.730 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:27.560 align:middle line:84%
It's whatever that
culture's practice is.

00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:28.310 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: Exactly.

00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:31.370 align:middle line:84%
At So, for instance,
Don Jose Joaquin Pineda

00:46:31.370 --> 00:46:36.650 align:middle line:84%
was saying that he does soul
retrieval only at midnight

00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:43.640 align:middle line:84%
and in the spring because that's
the time where the soul can

00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:49.000 align:middle line:90%
reconnect and find itself.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.100 align:middle line:84%
It happened to me too, is that
sometimes during the sessions

00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:58.910 align:middle line:84%
the soul comes in
without any intervention

00:46:58.910 --> 00:47:01.960 align:middle line:84%
and people possess their
soul back and receive it.

00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And I can see it coming
or I see it going.

00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:09.530 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk
about soul retrieval,

00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:16.920 align:middle line:84%
we tend to think about it that
when we have trauma, accidents,

00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:22.430 align:middle line:84%
sexual abuse, physical abuse,
or any other things like that,

00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:32.100 align:middle line:84%
or when we are facing occasion
where we are not in control--

00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:34.010 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Great
amounts of fear.

00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:38.720 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: Yes, or uncertainty.

00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:44.420 align:middle line:84%
We allow part of ourself to
leave so we would not feel

00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:48.365 align:middle line:90%
the depth of the pain and our--

00:47:48.365 --> 00:47:50.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's like we
disassociate from an aspect

00:47:50.490 --> 00:47:50.990 align:middle line:90%
of ourself.

00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:52.800 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: Exactly.

00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:56.790 align:middle line:84%
The problems with that
is that we are always

00:47:56.790 --> 00:48:01.120 align:middle line:84%
operating on the same
subject from the same age

00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:04.181 align:middle line:90%
that that soul part leaves.

00:48:04.181 --> 00:48:05.930 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So we're
stuck in this pattern.

00:48:05.930 --> 00:48:06.920 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: Exactly.

00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:11.090 align:middle line:84%
We are always-- so
the role of the shaman

00:48:11.090 --> 00:48:18.480 align:middle line:84%
is to journey to the other
worlds as their spirit guides

00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:22.710 align:middle line:84%
to bring him to that
incident, to see

00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:26.330 align:middle line:84%
what happened at
that time, and then

00:48:26.330 --> 00:48:30.150 align:middle line:84%
to track the soul to
see where the soul is

00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:34.430 align:middle line:84%
and find it and
convince that soul

00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:37.960 align:middle line:84%
or ask the soul if it
wants to come back.

00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:41.320 align:middle line:84%
I had cases that it
didn't because they

00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:43.410 align:middle line:84%
say that the other
person is not ready.

00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:47.100 align:middle line:90%
And in many cases, they did.

00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to
bring this back,

00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:57.070 align:middle line:84%
blow it into the
person's heart and crown

00:48:57.070 --> 00:49:04.320 align:middle line:84%
and reunite the
person with its soul.

00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:07.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's not the end
of it because now you

00:49:07.870 --> 00:49:10.165 align:middle line:84%
have to start to get
part of the integration.

00:49:10.165 --> 00:49:14.460 align:middle line:90%


00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:18.240 align:middle line:84%
The person that received that
needs to acknowledge that.

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:22.340 align:middle line:84%
And he needs to work through
it, through journey work,

00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:27.240 align:middle line:84%
through-- I give people to
adopt a doll in their shape,

00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:32.080 align:middle line:84%
to take care of it for a period
of time or other techniques,

00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:35.850 align:middle line:90%
to get used to it.

00:49:35.850 --> 00:49:38.540 align:middle line:84%
So some people-- the
expression of that

00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:44.020 align:middle line:84%
is that some people feel
the most joyous time

00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:48.210 align:middle line:84%
off their life, like their
childhood was given them back.

00:49:48.210 --> 00:49:53.640 align:middle line:84%
Some people feel-- like
another client of mine,

00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:57.790 align:middle line:90%
she stopped drinking.

00:49:57.790 --> 00:49:59.830 align:middle line:90%
She was addicted, alcoholic.

00:49:59.830 --> 00:50:02.580 align:middle line:90%


00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:07.370 align:middle line:84%
So there are many
different-- but you

00:50:07.370 --> 00:50:11.360 align:middle line:84%
have to remember that
once the soul is back,

00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:16.000 align:middle line:84%
it's your responsibility to be
the great host, which brings me

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.400 align:middle line:84%
to something that is very
important because a lot

00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:24.646 align:middle line:84%
of people come to shamans hoping
that he will do it to them,

00:50:24.646 --> 00:50:28.560 align:middle line:84%
that they will just bring
their body, lay down,

00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:32.900 align:middle line:84%
he'll do some magic
tricks, and it will happen.

00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:37.300 align:middle line:84%
And like Ipupiara used
to say, 50% of healing

00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:43.100 align:middle line:84%
comes from the earth,
Pachamama, mama tierra.

00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:47.640 align:middle line:90%
40% comes from the client.

00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:51.990 align:middle line:90%
And 10% comes from the shaman.

00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:59.200 align:middle line:84%
And he said that
mostly to remind

00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:04.560 align:middle line:84%
us, the healers, that we are
only there to facilitate,

00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:06.760 align:middle line:90%
not to heal.

00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:09.350 align:middle line:90%
And it's not really up to us.

00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And I think that it's also
important in the soul retrieval

00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:19.450 align:middle line:84%
process that people
have to do the work.

00:51:19.450 --> 00:51:22.200 align:middle line:90%
They have to really want it.

00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:24.990 align:middle line:84%
They can't come to
magicians to spit

00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:30.020 align:middle line:90%
on them to make them better.

00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:30.930 align:middle line:90%
That's not healing.

00:51:30.930 --> 00:51:33.170 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They have to
participate in their own

00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:34.780 align:middle line:90%
recovery.

00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:37.330 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: They have to want it.

00:51:37.330 --> 00:51:38.938 align:middle line:90%
They have to be committed to it.

00:51:38.938 --> 00:51:41.870 align:middle line:90%


00:51:41.870 --> 00:51:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And I saw in my
work, I saw, when

00:51:48.310 --> 00:51:50.770 align:middle line:84%
people are committed,
the miracle that happens.

00:51:50.770 --> 00:51:53.220 align:middle line:84%
I have a woman I've been
working with for 12 years now.

00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:57.170 align:middle line:84%
She came to me when
she was in total panic.

00:51:57.170 --> 00:52:01.220 align:middle line:84%
Three times a week she
was completely gone.

00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:03.650 align:middle line:84%
She couldn't operate
in the world.

00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:11.130 align:middle line:84%
She was a teacher for
children, retired.

00:52:11.130 --> 00:52:12.880 align:middle line:90%
And we turned it all around.

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:14.120 align:middle line:90%
We did a soul retrieval.

00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:15.460 align:middle line:90%
We found the cause of it.

00:52:15.460 --> 00:52:17.110 align:middle line:90%
We brought the soul back.

00:52:17.110 --> 00:52:20.537 align:middle line:90%
She started to create, to paint.

00:52:20.537 --> 00:52:21.120 align:middle line:90%
Not only that.

00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:24.560 align:middle line:84%
She'd paint, but she started to
show in galleries and museums.

00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:25.800 align:middle line:90%
And she 60s.

00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:27.750 align:middle line:90%
Now she's is 70-something.

00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:33.740 align:middle line:84%
But her life shapeshifted
through this soul retrieval

00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:35.750 align:middle line:90%
and this healing.

00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And now she comes to me,
we just talk about family

00:52:39.330 --> 00:52:46.210 align:middle line:84%
because there's nothing much in
the original reason she came.

00:52:46.210 --> 00:52:48.190 align:middle line:90%
But she is committed.

00:52:48.190 --> 00:52:50.040 align:middle line:90%
She's maintaining.

00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And she does whatever
we worked on.

00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:56.430 align:middle line:90%
She does her homework.

00:52:56.430 --> 00:52:58.780 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You know, this
conversation is just flying,

00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:00.020 align:middle line:90%
time-wise.

00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:01.630 align:middle line:90%
We have a few minutes left here.

00:53:01.630 --> 00:53:03.620 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot to cover,
but we're not going to.

00:53:03.620 --> 00:53:04.120 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:05.161 align:middle line:90%
People can read the book.

00:53:05.161 --> 00:53:07.930 align:middle line:84%
We're touching on enough to
get a feeling about what you're

00:53:07.930 --> 00:53:09.700 align:middle line:90%
about and your work is about.

00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:12.840 align:middle line:84%
Just very quickly,
maybe we can, before we

00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:14.770 align:middle line:84%
go to the ways in
which people can start

00:53:14.770 --> 00:53:18.540 align:middle line:84%
igniting their own
capacities, is the notion

00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:22.290 align:middle line:84%
of house clearing, of
making sure your space is

00:53:22.290 --> 00:53:25.310 align:middle line:84%
clear of any, maybe,
negative influences.

00:53:25.310 --> 00:53:29.200 align:middle line:90%


00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:33.740 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: We have to remember
that when we are walking,

00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:37.260 align:middle line:84%
there is this eggshell
energy all around us,

00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:40.840 align:middle line:84%
where we're carrying all of
these energies and spirit.

00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And we take it with us to
every room, every place,

00:53:48.770 --> 00:53:51.950 align:middle line:90%
every office we visit.

00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And every time that somebody
walks into your space,

00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:59.580 align:middle line:90%
they bring their energy, too.

00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And there are many times you
sit next to somebody on the bus,

00:54:03.310 --> 00:54:05.370 align:middle line:84%
and you feel that
energy coming to you.

00:54:05.370 --> 00:54:08.240 align:middle line:84%
And you were just
fine before, right?

00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:09.520 align:middle line:90%
And something changed.

00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:12.540 align:middle line:84%
So the same thing
happened in the house.

00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you stories--
your hair will stand up--

00:54:15.850 --> 00:54:22.541 align:middle line:84%
what happened in homes and the
miracles of house clearing.

00:54:22.541 --> 00:54:24.540 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So really
quickly, how do we do that?

00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:28.055 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: So the same way
that you do the la limpia,

00:54:28.055 --> 00:54:33.120 align:middle line:84%
the cleansing ceremony, the
Ecuadorian Andes ceremony which

00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:40.890 align:middle line:84%
you blow trago and you blow fire
and smoke and tobacco and we

00:54:40.890 --> 00:54:46.120 align:middle line:84%
clap with your stones and with
your bells and sing the song

00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:48.160 align:middle line:90%
and the chants and all that.

00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:50.210 align:middle line:84%
That's the same
thing you do at home.

00:54:50.210 --> 00:54:53.660 align:middle line:84%
Basically, you want to
shake and move this energy

00:54:53.660 --> 00:54:56.840 align:middle line:84%
so the energy will start
flowing outside the window,

00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:58.260 align:middle line:90%
outside the door.

00:54:58.260 --> 00:55:02.180 align:middle line:84%
You have to put green
plants in your home.

00:55:02.180 --> 00:55:05.630 align:middle line:84%
Green plants are very important
to absorb negative energies.

00:55:05.630 --> 00:55:07.950 align:middle line:84%
There is a lot of
techniques you can do.

00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:11.460 align:middle line:84%
But home and house
office cleansing

00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:13.462 align:middle line:84%
is very important
for the well-being

00:55:13.462 --> 00:55:14.670 align:middle line:90%
of the people who live there.

00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:16.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So we can use sage.

00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:18.870 align:middle line:84%
We can use our little
Tibetan chimes.

00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:22.820 align:middle line:84%
We can use clapping, anything
that creates percussive sound

00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:23.920 align:middle line:90%
and smoke.

00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:26.049 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: Especially under
the bed and the corners.

00:55:26.049 --> 00:55:27.090 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, thank you.

00:55:27.090 --> 00:55:27.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, the corners.

00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:30.750 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: And especially
in the kitchen.

00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And especially in places where
energy cannot move because you

00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:40.440 align:middle line:84%
have to remember that negative
energy is heavy energy.

00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:42.720 align:middle line:90%
It sinks down.

00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And what we want, we want
to move it up, shake it,

00:55:48.330 --> 00:55:51.610 align:middle line:90%
make it lighter and flow.

00:55:51.610 --> 00:55:54.300 align:middle line:84%
Good energy's an
energy that flows.

00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:58.210 align:middle line:84%
That's what happens when
we dance, when we walk.

00:55:58.210 --> 00:56:01.560 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's so important
to do yoga and to do exercise

00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:04.400 align:middle line:84%
and to walk and to
dance because it

00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:06.669 align:middle line:90%
brings new flow into the body.

00:56:06.669 --> 00:56:08.460 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Gets rid of
the stagnant energy,

00:56:08.460 --> 00:56:09.127 align:middle line:90%
energy patterns.

00:56:09.127 --> 00:56:09.876 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: Exactly.

00:56:09.876 --> 00:56:11.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Very important.

00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:11.600 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:14.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, with our last few
minutes left, you say,

00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:17.450 align:middle line:84%
as your mentors
have said, all of us

00:56:17.450 --> 00:56:19.940 align:middle line:90%
are born shaman by nature.

00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:21.770 align:middle line:84%
It's a matter of
learning what you can do

00:56:21.770 --> 00:56:23.640 align:middle line:90%
to access these parts of self.

00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:25.780 align:middle line:84%
So at the very end
of your book, you

00:56:25.780 --> 00:56:27.760 align:middle line:84%
have a list of about
15 different things.

00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:30.700 align:middle line:84%
But maybe just give us the
top three or four things

00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:34.870 align:middle line:84%
that we can do to start
opening this process of being

00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:36.980 align:middle line:90%
able to see.

00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:40.150 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I think the first
thing I would recommend is

00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:44.300 align:middle line:84%
write down your dreams, your
visions, your experiences,

00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:46.490 align:middle line:90%
your coincidence.

00:56:46.490 --> 00:56:48.990 align:middle line:90%
Write it down.

00:56:48.990 --> 00:56:51.830 align:middle line:84%
Even if you don't believe
in it, it doesn't matter.

00:56:51.830 --> 00:56:54.700 align:middle line:84%
Just write them
down and see what

00:56:54.700 --> 00:56:58.950 align:middle line:84%
they tell you about yourself
and about the people around you.

00:56:58.950 --> 00:57:00.580 align:middle line:84%
If you have a
dream that somebody

00:57:00.580 --> 00:57:05.120 align:middle line:84%
comes from your family or
your friends, call them.

00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:10.050 align:middle line:84%
Verify, if you feel
like you're stupid.

00:57:10.050 --> 00:57:11.115 align:middle line:90%
Just find out.

00:57:11.115 --> 00:57:12.240 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Just touch base.

00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:14.260 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to tell
them, hey, I had a dream.

00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:14.782 align:middle line:90%
Are you OK?

00:57:14.782 --> 00:57:16.490 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: No, tell
them you have a dream.

00:57:16.490 --> 00:57:17.760 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, you
have to tell them?

00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:18.260 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:19.930 align:middle line:84%
So you have to put
yourself on the line.

00:57:19.930 --> 00:57:21.570 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: Exactly.

00:57:21.570 --> 00:57:23.110 align:middle line:90%
Don't be embarrassed.

00:57:23.110 --> 00:57:25.240 align:middle line:90%
Everybody dreams.

00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And you will find out that
other people had the same things

00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:29.700 align:middle line:90%
about you, too.

00:57:29.700 --> 00:57:33.410 align:middle line:90%
So meditate.

00:57:33.410 --> 00:57:36.190 align:middle line:84%
If you can't do it every
day, find a practice

00:57:36.190 --> 00:57:40.150 align:middle line:84%
that you can close your eyes,
be it 20 minutes, 30 minutes.

00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:41.010 align:middle line:90%
Just quiet.

00:57:41.010 --> 00:57:48.280 align:middle line:84%
And just instead of the
Buddhism way of meditating,

00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:50.560 align:middle line:90%
go with your visions.

00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:52.620 align:middle line:90%
See where they take you.

00:57:52.620 --> 00:57:57.160 align:middle line:84%
You will be surprised how
spirit works through you when

00:57:57.160 --> 00:57:59.754 align:middle line:90%
you allow them to speak to you.

00:57:59.754 --> 00:58:01.920 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And isn't there
a little nuance in there,

00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:06.060 align:middle line:84%
that as it takes you, don't
grab and analyze and shut down

00:58:06.060 --> 00:58:06.720 align:middle line:90%
the process?

00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:08.170 align:middle line:90%
Just follow it.

00:58:08.170 --> 00:58:09.490 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: Exactly.

00:58:09.490 --> 00:58:12.530 align:middle line:84%
They will lead you to places
you would never believe.

00:58:12.530 --> 00:58:15.190 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So just close
your eyes and let it begin.

00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:16.030 align:middle line:90%
>> BEERY: Exactly.

00:58:16.030 --> 00:58:18.230 align:middle line:90%
It's like watching a television.

00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And just, with your
eyes closed, dream it.

00:58:23.970 --> 00:58:26.190 align:middle line:84%
It is the most
amazing experiences.

00:58:26.190 --> 00:58:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's how you start
long-distance viewing.

00:58:33.130 --> 00:58:37.580 align:middle line:84%
That's how spirit stops to
send you to wherever you want.

00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:40.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Remote
viewing in some-- I mean,

00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:43.260 align:middle line:84%
in the military parlance,
it's called remote viewing.

00:58:43.260 --> 00:58:45.624 align:middle line:84%
And I think you call it
psychonavigation here.

00:58:45.624 --> 00:58:47.540 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: It is a
psychonavigation because you

00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:51.410 align:middle line:84%
allow your psyche to take you,
to navigate into this world

00:58:51.410 --> 00:58:53.210 align:middle line:90%
that you may not dream to be.

00:58:53.210 --> 00:58:57.750 align:middle line:84%
But I visit my family
constantly in Israel.

00:58:57.750 --> 00:58:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And I see exactly
what happened there.

00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:01.715 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I know you got chewed
out by one person who said quit

00:59:01.715 --> 00:59:02.548 align:middle line:90%
following me around.

00:59:02.548 --> 00:59:03.170 align:middle line:90%
Its invasive.

00:59:03.170 --> 00:59:06.420 align:middle line:90%
Ask permission first.

00:59:06.420 --> 00:59:07.480 align:middle line:90%
Any final thought?

00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:10.820 align:middle line:84%
Just a final thought that you
want to share with everyone?

00:59:10.820 --> 00:59:13.560 align:middle line:90%


00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:17.200 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: I think the most
important part for me about

00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:20.210 align:middle line:84%
writing a book is not to
be ashamed of your visions

00:59:20.210 --> 00:59:24.980 align:middle line:84%
and about your dreams and
about that part up yourself

00:59:24.980 --> 00:59:28.550 align:middle line:84%
and to understand that this
is that capacity of humans,

00:59:28.550 --> 00:59:32.480 align:middle line:84%
to vision, to dream, to be
connected to the unseen world

00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:37.130 align:middle line:84%
and understand that this
world, this other world,

00:59:37.130 --> 00:59:41.640 align:middle line:90%
directly influences who we are.

00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:45.360 align:middle line:84%
It's not your fault. You
just have to learn from it.

00:59:45.360 --> 00:59:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And that permission
is very important.

00:59:49.540 --> 00:59:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And then to understand
that it's also

00:59:51.430 --> 00:59:55.210 align:middle line:84%
very important for
our own survival

00:59:55.210 --> 01:00:00.150 align:middle line:84%
to be connected to the messages
that we receive constantly

01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:04.270 align:middle line:84%
from our ancestors,
from our other spirits,

01:00:04.270 --> 01:00:06.090 align:middle line:90%
from the spirit of nature.

01:00:06.090 --> 01:00:10.850 align:middle line:84%
They all come here, and
they all come to help.

01:00:10.850 --> 01:00:13.170 align:middle line:84%
They don't come here
to create havoc.

01:00:13.170 --> 01:00:15.770 align:middle line:90%


01:00:15.770 --> 01:00:19.240 align:middle line:10%
On the other side, there
is other spirits who do.

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:21.400 align:middle line:10%
But we need to separate that.

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:27.870 align:middle line:10%
But we need to be able to
negotiate between the worlds

01:00:27.870 --> 01:00:32.710 align:middle line:10%
and to see how it affects
us and to learn from it

01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:37.620 align:middle line:10%
and to learn that you
are a spiritual being,

01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:42.904 align:middle line:10%
not just what your
five senses tells you.

01:00:42.904 --> 01:00:43.820 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:45.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, I can see
why they chose you.

01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:49.190 align:middle line:84%
You have a very kind
of an innate humility

01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:50.877 align:middle line:90%
about you and this sensitivity.

01:00:50.877 --> 01:00:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, you're
a warrior or you

01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:54.210 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't have been
able to do what you did

01:00:54.210 --> 01:00:58.000 align:middle line:84%
and stand up to it
within society alone.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And you've done a beautiful
job in documenting

01:01:00.610 --> 01:01:01.740 align:middle line:90%
this for all of us.

01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:02.620 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:04.510 align:middle line:84%
>> BEERY: Thank you
so much for having me.

>> REGINA: Filled with personal
stories of his experiences,

01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:11.180 align:middle line:84%
"The Gift of Shamanism" is
highly personal and inspiring

01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:14.480 align:middle line:84%
as to how anyone of us can
choose a path to awakening.
