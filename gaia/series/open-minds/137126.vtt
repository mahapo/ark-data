>>REGINA MEREDITH:
With Obamacare

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.490 align:middle line:10%
on the verge of
collapse and people

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.700 align:middle line:10%
left wondering what their
future is in terms of health,

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.890 align:middle line:10%
I would suggest we need
to move beyond wondering

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.420 align:middle line:10%
how we're going
to be taking care

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.090 align:middle line:10%
of versus caring for ourselves.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.070 align:middle line:84%
Energy medicine
practitioner, Glenn Streeter,

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.890 align:middle line:84%
is with us today to talk
about the future of medicine

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.840 align:middle line:84%
and what is already
available to us

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.780 align:middle line:84%
by the way are both
prevention and also cure.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.890 align:middle line:84%
Although, I know I'm not
supposed to say cure.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.260 align:middle line:84%
Nonetheless, there are a myriad
of amazingly effective cures

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.470 align:middle line:84%
without ever having to walk into
an allopathic doctor's office.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:01.270 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.740 align:middle line:84%
>>GLENN STREETER:
That's absolutely true.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.879 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's talk
about your own background.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:05.860 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
what happened when

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.318 align:middle line:84%
you were a little kid, how you
came into the world, how you

00:01:08.318 --> 00:01:10.960 align:middle line:84%
ended up deciding to go
into the field of medicine,

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.680 align:middle line:84%
and then how you took a really
deep dive into energy medicine

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.162 align:middle line:90%
and alternatives.

00:01:16.162 --> 00:01:17.620 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Well,
I had a rough go.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.320 align:middle line:10%
I was born 3 1/2 pounds.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.490 align:middle line:10%
And they didn't think
that I would make it.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.120 align:middle line:10%
Two months in an incubator,
basically sick a lot

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.380 align:middle line:10%
as a child.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.100 align:middle line:10%
Until I was about 14 years
old and bought a juicer

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.691 align:middle line:10%
with my paper route money
and started reading--

00:01:32.691 --> 00:01:33.940 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You bought a juicer?

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.380 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: All the
books that I could find.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Instead
of comic books?

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:37.900 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.120 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: And by
21, I was trying out

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.450 align:middle line:90%
for the Pittsburgh Pirates.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.529 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So did you
educate yourself?

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:46.570 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: I'm really
grateful for the work that

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:47.740 align:middle line:90%
was done at that time.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.580 align:middle line:84%
Although it was very tiny
compared to what we have now.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:52.380 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And then I went to school
and then got a medical degree

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.160 align:middle line:84%
in sports medicine,
and was really blessed

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.240 align:middle line:84%
with some great mentors,
and a lot of curiosity.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And the technology has kind of
kept pace with my curiosity.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's been very exciting
to watch the costs come down

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.500 align:middle line:84%
and the efficacy
go up dramatically.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What are we
bathed in right now?

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:24.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean might it be fair to say
that the notion of Obamacare

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.880 align:middle line:84%
and any kind of government
supports for our health care,

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.310 align:middle line:84%
because it's so tied to
the medical industry,

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.770 align:middle line:84%
that the falling away of
this might be a good thing?

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.080 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: Oh, absolutely.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.280 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's kind
of what I'm thinking.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.583 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Let's remember
that the battle of life

00:02:40.583 --> 00:02:43.130 align:middle line:84%
is the archoncy
versus anarchy, right?

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.920 align:middle line:90%
It's central versus freedom.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing that battle
played out right now in America

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.870 align:middle line:90%
and around the world.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And no more is that more
critical than in health care.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.660 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Particularly, where
we live in an ironic time.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's trite, but the
best and the worst of times.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.370 align:middle line:84%
We're being poisoned
from every angle.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.440 align:middle line:84%
But we also have these
amazing solutions

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.762 align:middle line:90%
to every single problem.

00:03:06.762 --> 00:03:08.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you're
not going to find it

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.554 align:middle line:84%
at your allopathic doctor's
office, unfortunately.

00:03:10.554 --> 00:03:11.353 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: No.

00:03:11.353 --> 00:03:13.030 align:middle line:84%
Because they're under
a different model

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.340 align:middle line:84%
that is created by the petroleum
industry and Big Pharma

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.320 align:middle line:90%
as an offspring of that.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And that model is inaccurate,
because every health issue

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.410 align:middle line:90%
is a voltage problem.

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.080 align:middle line:84%
And we've been told that
it's a chemistry problem.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.630 align:middle line:90%
Voltage precedes chemistry.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.820 align:middle line:84%
Cancer, for example
is plus 30 millivolts.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.910 align:middle line:84%
Whereas we can regenerate tissue
and we can get it to minus 50

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.710 align:middle line:90%
millivolts.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.900 align:middle line:84%
And the devices that
we're going to discuss

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.430 align:middle line:84%
do have the
capability to do that.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.570 align:middle line:84%
There's thousands of
studies on PubMed.com,

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.950 align:middle line:90%
in Europe for 40 years.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.850 align:middle line:84%
There's even devices going back
to the late 1800s in America.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.500 align:middle line:84%
And that whole
movement was basically

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.669 align:middle line:84%
shut down by Big Pharma
which is really fascinating.

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:56.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, absolutely.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.800 align:middle line:84%
Some of the casualties
were Dingo, Rife.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.660 align:middle line:84%
All of these early
pioneers were humiliated,

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.780 align:middle line:84%
defamation of their
character, their labs

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.690 align:middle line:84%
smashed, shut down,
humiliated, and mostly died

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.656 align:middle line:90%
poor and unknown.

00:04:12.656 --> 00:04:14.530 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's just been
in the last 30 years

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:15.840 align:middle line:90%
there's a resurgence of this.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.459 align:middle line:84%
And would you say it's because
the new technologies are now

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.300 align:middle line:84%
starting to make an
appearance for real

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.930 align:middle line:90%
across the board on the scene?

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:24.730 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: Yes.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.650 align:middle line:90%
And part of that's the cost.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.360 align:middle line:84%
The cost has come
down dramatically

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.910 align:middle line:84%
for the same level
or more of efficacy.

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And a lot more accuracy, because
we have new testing procedures

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.710 align:middle line:90%
that brilliant people like Rife.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.020 align:middle line:84%
And Reich never had
access to, right?

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.004 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:39.004 --> 00:04:40.420 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: So we
can be much more

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.690 align:middle line:84%
specific with the
choice of device

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.730 align:middle line:90%
for each individual client.

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
very much tailor made.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.470 align:middle line:84%
A real medical approach
should be for the individual.

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:50.920 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: Absolutely.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're
not going to get that.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.517 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Cookbooks
are very, very difficult

00:04:54.517 --> 00:04:55.350 align:middle line:90%
to follow sometimes.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:01.660 align:middle line:84%
Give us an idea of say
an alternative-- what

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.920 align:middle line:84%
we would call an alternative--
device product that

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.940 align:middle line:84%
has come to the fore that had
a really prohibitive price

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.466 align:middle line:84%
tag on it once upon a time
that it's now affordable to us.

00:05:12.466 --> 00:05:13.840 align:middle line:84%
Give us a couple
examples of what

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.130 align:middle line:90%
you're talking about there.

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.580 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Heart
rate variability

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.280 align:middle line:84%
is about a 40-year-old
technology that

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.040 align:middle line:84%
is incredibly useful
for the practitioner

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.620 align:middle line:90%
even to this day based upon EKG.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.160 align:middle line:84%
Nerveexpress.com, I
have a $5,000 device

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.980 align:middle line:84%
that I bought from them
a decade ago which is now

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.903 align:middle line:90%
a free app on your smartphone.

00:05:33.903 --> 00:05:34.810 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.170 align:middle line:90%


00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:38.240 align:middle line:90%
So I'm a bad investor sometimes.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know
smartphones the fact is

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.495 align:middle line:84%
amazing technologies
are emerging on it.

00:05:43.495 --> 00:05:44.610 align:middle line:90%
And this is free?

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.485 align:middle line:84%
So it went from $5,000 to
a free app, and it works?

00:05:47.485 --> 00:05:49.110 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: It works
phenomenally well.

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.800 align:middle line:90%
Just as well.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.240 align:middle line:84%
Now there's not
as many parameters

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.300 align:middle line:90%
as my clinical version.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And only the first
100 tests are free.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:56.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:57.240 align:middle line:90%
You've teased everyone.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.350 align:middle line:90%
So what is this app?

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:59.790 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: Nerveexpress.com.

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:00.880 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead and download it.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.050 align:middle line:84%
It's about $100 for the chest
strap and the Bluetooth.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.690 align:middle line:84%
And it will change your life,
because if you're an athlete,

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.970 align:middle line:84%
you can see if you're
overtrained or under-trained.

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.470 align:middle line:84%
If you're sick and you're
taking a new supplement,

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.680 align:middle line:84%
you can see whether it's
actually working for you

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.660 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.800 align:middle line:84%
The HRV will tell
you instantaneously.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.770 align:middle line:90%
And it's not invasive.

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:18.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:19.230 align:middle line:90%
That's fabulous.

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:20.030 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.620 align:middle line:90%
Give us another example.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.860 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: NuVision
nuvisionusa.com

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.230 align:middle line:90%
fascinating product.

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:30.040 align:middle line:84%

>>REGINA: And it's a diagnostic.

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:41.830 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Well, we don't
like to use that word.

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:42.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:42.520 align:middle line:90%
What do you call it?

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.820 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Testing
and assessment.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, assessment tool.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.375 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: We can have a long
discussion on diagnostics,

00:06:47.375 --> 00:06:48.487 align:middle line:90%
if you'd like, but--

00:06:48.487 --> 00:06:50.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I would like to
have a short conversation when

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.010 align:middle line:90%
you're done sharing this, yes.

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:54.720 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Testing
and assessment.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.070 align:middle line:90%
So that's a trajectory device.

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:58.980 align:middle line:84%
It's looking at where
you're headed energetically.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:02.850 align:middle line:84%
Part of the problem with Western
medicine's view on testing

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:05.310 align:middle line:90%
is taking a snapshot.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.800 align:middle line:84%
You and I are making
a film right now.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.990 align:middle line:90%
It has energy to it.

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And how much more can we
learn from a motion picture

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.830 align:middle line:90%
than we can from a photograph?

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:17.570 align:middle line:84%
So NuVision is actually a motion
picture of your life from start

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:18.370 align:middle line:90%
to finish.

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And so you can see what
you're going to die from

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.990 align:middle line:90%
and you can fix it now.

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:23.460 align:middle line:90%
I know that sounds morbid, but--

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:25.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sounds like
you're playing god, there.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:26.680 align:middle line:90%
Right, god?

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.480 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: No.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.397 align:middle line:90%
It's just information.

00:07:28.397 --> 00:07:29.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's just information.

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:30.720 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: It's
the Information Age.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.511 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
the truth of the matter

00:07:32.511 --> 00:07:35.370 align:middle line:84%
is no matter what quarter you
look to, you can go to the ETs

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:38.460 align:middle line:84%
and ask them, or you can go to
interdimensional spirit guides

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:39.880 align:middle line:90%
and ask them.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.560 align:middle line:84%
And they will tell you
that the human species

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:47.010 align:middle line:84%
is about to have a bump
up in the span of life

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:50.386 align:middle line:84%
once we are able to smooth
through this period of time.

00:07:50.386 --> 00:07:51.760 align:middle line:84%
We're up against
a lot right now.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.360 align:middle line:84%
Like you say, we're being
poisoned on every single level

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:55.900 align:middle line:90%
and dimension of our being.

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.830 align:middle line:84%
But once the poisoning
stops, apparently humanity

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:01.830 align:middle line:84%
is set to start living at
least another 30 or 40 years

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:04.566 align:middle line:84%
than what we are doing now,
projected into the 120s

00:08:04.566 --> 00:08:05.366 align:middle line:90%
and 130s.

00:08:05.366 --> 00:08:06.060 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: Absolutely.

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
you're talking about

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.060 align:middle line:84%
is the emergence
of the technologies

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:10.990 align:middle line:84%
that simply allow
us to live into that

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.740 align:middle line:84%
and until our
expiration date comes.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:13.540 align:middle line:10%
Right?

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:14.340 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: Um-hmm.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.360 align:middle line:90%


00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.874 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if it's
worth going into diagnostics

00:08:20.874 --> 00:08:22.290 align:middle line:84%
a little bit,
because I don't want

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:24.929 align:middle line:84%
to chew up too much of our time,
but to help people understand

00:08:24.929 --> 00:08:26.970 align:middle line:84%
what happens when they go
to the doctor's office.

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:28.892 align:middle line:84%
And they're doing a
standard blood panel.

00:08:28.892 --> 00:08:31.350 align:middle line:84%
And they come back and say you
need one of these five drugs

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:34.262 align:middle line:84%
that are recommended by
our company, our HMO.

00:08:34.262 --> 00:08:36.220 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Imagine if
you live in a small town

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:38.039 align:middle line:84%
and you're hundreds of
miles from anywhere.

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:39.902 align:middle line:84%
And there's three
restaurants in town.

00:08:39.902 --> 00:08:42.360 align:middle line:84%
You'd get pretty bored with
those restaurants after awhile.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.776 align:middle line:84%
And then you come
to the big city,

00:08:43.776 --> 00:08:47.110 align:middle line:84%
and you have a whole
array of choices.

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:49.200 align:middle line:84%
Western medicine has
limited themselves

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.380 align:middle line:84%
to the three restaurants
in the Western town

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:55.860 align:middle line:84%
to cholesterol and blood
sugar and other parameters

00:08:55.860 --> 00:09:00.430 align:middle line:84%
that, although important,
they're not measuring voltage.

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:04.197 align:middle line:84%
So, therefore, they're
already obsolete in the view.

00:09:04.197 --> 00:09:06.780 align:middle line:84%
What we're doing with NuVision
is we're measuring the voltage.

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And this is a voltage future
for driving, for medicine,

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.080 align:middle line:90%
for everything.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And the sooner we get onboard
to that, the faster we can heal.

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:20.340 align:middle line:84%
Because the number one risk,
health risk, in the world right

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:22.832 align:middle line:84%
now is iatrogenic
causes in America.

00:09:22.832 --> 00:09:23.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Explain that.

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:25.600 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Iatrogenic,
doctor caused.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.920 align:middle line:84%
I think it's number three
leading cause of death, right?

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.360 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Well I think
it just went to number one,

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.734 align:middle line:84%
depending on what
study you read.

00:09:31.734 --> 00:09:34.020 align:middle line:84%
But it's cancer, heart
disease, obviously

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:35.260 align:middle line:90%
those are the big three.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:35.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:36.720 align:middle line:84%
That means our doctors
are killing us.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.136 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: But, even when it
comes to more subtle issues,

00:09:39.136 --> 00:09:41.790 align:middle line:84%
like psychological issues or
depression or what have you,

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:42.990 align:middle line:90%
that's a voltage problem.

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And it cannot be addressed
through chemistry

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:46.170 align:middle line:90%
appropriately.

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:48.540 align:middle line:84%
Those products actually
rewire the brain

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:49.836 align:middle line:90%
into a non-human state.

00:09:49.836 --> 00:09:52.440 align:middle line:90%


00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.370 align:middle line:90%
These are a big problem.

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And all of these things
that we're discussing

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:58.740 align:middle line:84%
can help people
ease off of that,

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.140 align:middle line:84%
kind of like being thrown off
a building with a parachute

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.450 align:middle line:90%
rather than without one.

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:07.100 align:middle line:84%
When it's time to titrate
off of these products,

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:11.820 align:middle line:84%
it's very important to do so in
a controlled, sensitive manner

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:16.860 align:middle line:84%
using voltage and using products
like CBD which is going to be

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.630 align:middle line:90%
legal in 50 states very soon.

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:20.532 align:middle line:84%
And it's very safe for
infants and elderly.

00:10:20.532 --> 00:10:21.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we
need to understand

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:23.450 align:middle line:90%
CBD doesn't make you high.

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:23.810 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: No.

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:24.610 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:27.205 align:middle line:84%
You get all the benefits
of marijuana without--

00:10:27.205 --> 00:10:28.960 align:middle line:84%
because it's not
marijuana, it's hemp.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, OK.

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:34.439 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: But watch out for
garbage products from China.

00:10:34.439 --> 00:10:36.730 align:middle line:84%
It's critical that you get
organic products when you're

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:38.440 align:middle line:90%
talking about all of these.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:42.190 align:middle line:84%
What is it that took
you down the rabbit

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:44.262 align:middle line:84%
hole of energy medicine
to where you really

00:10:44.262 --> 00:10:45.220 align:middle line:90%
discovered the voltage?

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:47.930 align:middle line:84%
Sounds like you were
really quite a researcher

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:50.020 align:middle line:84%
and explorer, even when
you were a teenager.

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:53.320 align:middle line:84%
Did you run into the subject
of voltage back then?

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.400 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: I was a huge fan
of a lot of those pioneers

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.200 align:middle line:90%
back then.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.450 align:middle line:90%
Reading everything I could find.

00:10:58.450 --> 00:10:59.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:00.440 align:middle line:90%
No more needs to be said.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.840 align:middle line:84%
So you understood
the voltage story.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.020 align:middle line:10%
>>STREETER: I did and
I internalized it,

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:08.110 align:middle line:10%
because I was, as I
said, I had a rough go.

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And to be able to feel that
sensation of not being sick

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:14.500 align:middle line:84%
and to be vibrant
and to be strong,

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.990 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to hold onto that
and to share that with people.

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:19.420 align:middle line:84%
Because what else
are we here for?

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:20.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.100 align:middle line:90%
Truly.

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:22.040 align:middle line:90%
Truly.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.840 align:middle line:84%
And so for you, you
finally you started

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:30.910 align:middle line:84%
launching into helping to
evaluate and ultimately help

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:33.400 align:middle line:84%
co-create various
products that you felt

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.790 align:middle line:84%
would be the best fit for
people on an individual basis,

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:39.650 align:middle line:84%
that you could create
individualized protocols with.

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:43.150 align:middle line:10%
But your passion has been
clientele and working

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:44.560 align:middle line:10%
with your patients.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.930 align:middle line:84%
And this has been kind of the
cornerstone of your career

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:48.240 align:middle line:90%
it sounds like?

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.040 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: Yeah.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:52.570 align:middle line:84%
I've had some very fascinating
people, including world class

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:56.320 align:middle line:84%
athletes and older
folks who were

00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:04.270 align:middle line:84%
looking for another lease
on life, infants, animals.

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:06.920 align:middle line:84%
We work with a lot of horses
and dogs and cats, as well.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.800 align:middle line:90%
That's very rewarding.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.600 align:middle line:84%
Because the energy
medicine, there's

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.244 align:middle line:84%
no placebo effect
with the animals.

00:12:13.244 --> 00:12:15.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And for the
most part, these-- we're

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.285 align:middle line:84%
going to be talking about
some of these things that

00:12:17.285 --> 00:12:19.540 align:middle line:84%
are available to
us, these products

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.130 align:middle line:90%
and services available to us.

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:24.220 align:middle line:84%
Do you find that they tend
to work pretty equally

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:28.110 align:middle line:84%
among the animal kingdom,
humans to dogs and cats?

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:29.110 align:middle line:90%
The same energy devices?

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Animals are
more sensitive and much more

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:31.665 align:middle line:90%
responsive.

00:12:31.665 --> 00:12:32.465 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:12:32.465 --> 00:12:34.902 align:middle line:90%
Fair enough.

00:12:34.902 --> 00:12:37.110 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: The horse is
either limping or she's not.

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:37.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:38.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:40.930 align:middle line:84%
They don't have any
built-in biases against it.

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:41.730 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:43.314 align:middle line:84%
So one of the
things I've noticed,

00:12:43.314 --> 00:12:44.980 align:middle line:84%
because I've interviewed
a lot of people

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:48.610 align:middle line:84%
that are interested in energy
healing-- not interested, that

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:52.270 align:middle line:84%
are vested, deeply
vested in energy healing.

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:54.670 align:middle line:84%
And one of them was
Dr. Jerry Tenant.

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you have very
similar beliefs in terms of--

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:03.430 align:middle line:84%
or findings, in terms of the
notion that energy in the body,

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:05.710 align:middle line:84%
the energy production of
the body, the voltage,

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:09.200 align:middle line:84%
is the key to our
health in every organ,

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:11.842 align:middle line:84%
and I guess almost all
chronic diseases, right?

00:13:11.842 --> 00:13:13.300 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Well
chronic and acute.

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:15.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Chronic
and acute issues.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And, also, I've
interviewed a lot of people

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.630 align:middle line:84%
in some of the
exotic technology.

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:24.280 align:middle line:84%
Some the ones you like and
prefer, very similar to,

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.620 align:middle line:84%
but what comes up
over and over is

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:30.370 align:middle line:84%
a lot of these products say, or
claim, that this is something

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:34.090 align:middle line:84%
that NASA has been
exploring or NASA's

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:35.650 align:middle line:84%
been trying to
get the patent on.

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:39.790 align:middle line:84%
And why does NASA always come
up in these conversations?

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:41.470 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Well,
I've had conversations

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:44.470 align:middle line:84%
with a number of
these NASA people.

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And they have spent millions of
dollars testing PEMF therapy,

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:52.100 align:middle line:90%
SCENAR therapy, laser therapy.

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:53.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: BEMER Therapy.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:56.040 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Right,
well, BEMER's PEMF.

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:56.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:58.006 align:middle line:90%
It's just a different level.

00:13:58.006 --> 00:14:00.430 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Because
they realized

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:01.930 align:middle line:84%
that you can't bring
pharmaceuticals

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:05.080 align:middle line:84%
into space in any practical
way, shape, or form, right?

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.330 align:middle line:84%
You'd have to bring a trailer
behind the space shuttle

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:09.659 align:middle line:84%
to carry all of the
different potions

00:14:09.659 --> 00:14:11.200 align:middle line:84%
for every different
potential malady.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.783 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they're
highly motivated,

00:14:12.783 --> 00:14:15.160 align:middle line:84%
because they have to keep
these people in extremely

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:15.400 align:middle line:90%
good health.

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:15.730 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: Yeah.

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:16.760 align:middle line:84%
They're world
class athletes when

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:19.051 align:middle line:84%
comes to their fitness and
their health and everything,

00:14:19.051 --> 00:14:20.650 align:middle line:90%
and their mental capacity.

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:24.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So would you
say they've been then

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:27.220 align:middle line:84%
at the very leading
edge of prompting

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:28.270 align:middle line:90%
the development of this?

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:31.016 align:middle line:84%
Or are there other forces that
have been behind the scenes?

00:14:31.016 --> 00:14:32.890 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: There's
plenty of backyard garage

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:34.630 align:middle line:84%
people from Europe,
and what have

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:38.950 align:middle line:84%
you, who have done some
pretty stellar work as well.

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:41.650 align:middle line:84%
NASA things tend to get
lost in a bureaucracy.

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:46.685 align:middle line:84%
And where's the NASA ad
for their PEMF device

00:14:46.685 --> 00:14:49.415 align:middle line:84%
if they're really serious
about spending our tax money

00:14:49.415 --> 00:14:51.040 align:middle line:84%
and not sharing their
findings with us.

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.123 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's
what I was going to get to.

00:14:53.123 --> 00:14:56.670 align:middle line:84%
Seems to be for a very select
group of a few men and women.

00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:58.990 align:middle line:84%
No one else benefits from
all of the money they

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:01.687 align:middle line:84%
put our tax dollars
into in terms

00:15:01.687 --> 00:15:03.770 align:middle line:84%
of the research and
development of these products.

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:05.853 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Because we
live in a tapeworm economy.

00:15:05.853 --> 00:15:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's not a model that
works with a tapeworm economy.

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:11.570 align:middle line:84%
As Catherine Austin Fitts
speaks so eloquently about it.

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: She was just here.

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:13.970 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: Oh, she was?

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:15.490 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, I missed her.

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:17.320 align:middle line:84%
But you know that
the tapeworm economy

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:20.830 align:middle line:84%
relies on Big Pharma as another
part of that snake that's

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:21.700 align:middle line:90%
eating itself.

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And that just doesn't
work in the model.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:27.190 align:middle line:84%
But I really feel like we've
had a break energetically

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:29.630 align:middle line:90%
just in what's happened.

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:32.360 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that there's
a political solution to this.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.860 align:middle line:84%
But what it's done
is it's changed--

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:35.651 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're talking
about the election.

00:15:35.651 --> 00:15:36.500 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: Yeah.

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.170 align:middle line:84%
The energy has shifted
to the point where

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:41.870 align:middle line:84%
it's time for those of us
with solutions to come out

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:45.710 align:middle line:84%
and say we're not going
to be stifled anymore.

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:46.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:47.090 align:middle line:90%
Big time.

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:49.048 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Because the
truth needs to be told.

00:15:49.048 --> 00:15:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And we have been lied to at
every level about everything.

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:54.860 align:middle line:84%
But, particularly, to my
heart, the medical piece.

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:57.050 align:middle line:84%
Because when I
see four-year-olds

00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:59.720 align:middle line:84%
dying from infections
that we can clear up

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:01.700 align:middle line:90%
in a day with safe products.

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:05.570 align:middle line:84%
Or when I see 15-year-olds
on psych meds who

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:10.200 align:middle line:84%
have lost their humanity,
that makes me mad.

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:14.690 align:middle line:84%
Because I got a chance
to be functional.

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:15.940 align:middle line:90%
And I want that for everybody.

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:18.065 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's why
you're here, because you're

00:16:18.065 --> 00:16:19.200 align:middle line:90%
dedicated to this.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.990 align:middle line:84%
And so I think maybe
at this point we

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:23.772 align:middle line:90%
can start kind of moving into--

00:16:23.772 --> 00:16:25.980 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about some of
the simpler elements of what

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:28.080 align:middle line:84%
increases the
voltage in the body.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And we'll get increasingly
more what at this moment

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.390 align:middle line:84%
is considered exotic,
but as you would

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:34.740 align:middle line:90%
say this is not exotic at all.

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:36.670 align:middle line:84%
It's right here,
anybody can use it.

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:40.020 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
just movement alone,

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:44.310 align:middle line:84%
because we are a pretty
sedentary society at large.

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:49.170 align:middle line:84%
What does movement do to the
voltage production of the body?

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:51.720 align:middle line:84%
And also what kind
of movement creates

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.730 align:middle line:90%
the most useful voltage?

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:56.310 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Oh, those
are great questions.

00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:58.440 align:middle line:84%
Voltage is created in
the body through movement

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:01.200 align:middle line:84%
through what's called the
Piezoelectric Effect, which is

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.220 align:middle line:90%
pressure creating electricity.

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.500 align:middle line:84%
This is why we derive so
much pleasure from a massage

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.109 align:middle line:84%
or from acupuncture
or so much value.

00:17:08.109 --> 00:17:10.470 align:middle line:84%
This is why the foam
roller or the exercise ball

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:13.290 align:middle line:84%
works so well is because
the pressure creates

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:14.149 align:middle line:90%
a voltage change.

00:17:14.149 --> 00:17:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And it actually puts us into
the negative voltage which

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:20.147 align:middle line:90%
is counter-intuitively healing.

00:17:20.147 --> 00:17:21.980 align:middle line:84%
As far as movement, I'm
glad you asked that,

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:26.010 align:middle line:84%
because I've tested thousands
of athletes and non-athletes

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:27.000 align:middle line:90%
for 30 years.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you that it is
very important for us to move.

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.930 align:middle line:84%
But it's also very
important for us

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:36.120 align:middle line:90%
to think about how we're moving.

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:36.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was
the next question.

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:38.656 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Are we working
out or are we working in?

00:17:38.656 --> 00:17:40.260 align:middle line:84%
I actually have
world class athletes

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.090 align:middle line:84%
whose adrenals
and their thyroids

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:45.990 align:middle line:84%
are total trashed from
overtraining, particularly

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:48.000 align:middle line:90%
cardiovascular activity.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Once you get to a
certain level of function

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.440 align:middle line:84%
in terms of your VO2
max, it's very difficult

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.717 align:middle line:84%
to keep bumping that
needle up any higher.

00:17:54.717 --> 00:17:56.550 align:middle line:84%
You're basically training
the nervous system

00:17:56.550 --> 00:18:01.380 align:middle line:84%
to deal with the burn
of free radicals.

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:04.050 align:middle line:90%
And I was an ultramarathoner.

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:05.649 align:middle line:90%
I did the 100th Boston Marathon.

00:18:05.649 --> 00:18:07.940 align:middle line:84%
I know what it's like to be
an ultra-endurance athlete.

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:10.050 align:middle line:84%
I was on the team that
broke the world speed

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:13.568 align:middle line:84%
record on the Appalachian
Trail in 1991.

00:18:13.568 --> 00:18:15.443 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know how
it is to use your body

00:18:15.443 --> 00:18:16.526 align:middle line:90%
to get the best out of it.

00:18:16.526 --> 00:18:19.060 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: I love
endurance activities.

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:21.030 align:middle line:84%
But the best way to do
that is a combination

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:22.530 align:middle line:90%
of working out and working in.

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:25.260 align:middle line:84%
So walks in nature
where you're not

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:26.850 align:middle line:84%
trying to get to the
top of something,

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:29.880 align:middle line:84%
but you just strolling,
or yoga or Pilates

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:32.527 align:middle line:84%
versus the hard, hard
workout all of the time.

00:18:32.527 --> 00:18:34.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I was wondering,

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:36.674 align:middle line:84%
because that's always what has
seemed intuitively correct.

00:18:36.674 --> 00:18:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: And the
data bears this out.

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:40.080 align:middle line:90%
It's overwhelming with the HRV.

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.281 align:middle line:84%
You can actually watch
people's HRV improve

00:18:42.281 --> 00:18:43.530 align:middle line:90%
dramatically when they begin--

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:44.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Heart
variability rate.

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:45.060 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: --to work in.

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:45.860 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:47.730 align:middle line:84%
They work in, they
begin to breathe.

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:51.240 align:middle line:84%
They're not just expending
energy all the time.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:53.484 align:middle line:10%
And as you said yoga.

00:18:53.484 --> 00:18:54.900 align:middle line:84%
Something was just
kind of popping

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:56.550 align:middle line:90%
through my field of vision.

00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And what about the
notion then of not

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:02.970 align:middle line:84%
just the movement and the
stretching of the meridians

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:05.310 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, but the
squeezing of the organs

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:08.250 align:middle line:84%
that happens when you're
in these various postures

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:09.894 align:middle line:84%
where you're
closing on yourself?

00:19:09.894 --> 00:19:11.310 align:middle line:84%
Because we always
think of yoga as

00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:13.470 align:middle line:84%
expansive, but are
we doing something

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:15.780 align:middle line:84%
interesting to our
organs in this way?

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.560 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: Oh, absolutely.

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.950 align:middle line:84%
I know that you know
the spiritual background

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:21.340 align:middle line:90%
and value of yoga.

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:25.145 align:middle line:84%
But just purely
physiologically, absolutely.

00:19:25.145 --> 00:19:26.520 align:middle line:84%
I think the other
important thing

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:29.670 align:middle line:84%
that you don't get from most
weight training or resistance

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:32.337 align:middle line:84%
training programs
is that yoga teaches

00:19:32.337 --> 00:19:34.920 align:middle line:84%
us to focus from the top of the
head to the bottom of the feet

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:37.530 align:middle line:84%
and to integrate
all of that fascia

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:41.250 align:middle line:84%
and all of those meridians
and systems as a whole.

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:44.670 align:middle line:90%
And how do they interact as one?

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:48.270 align:middle line:84%
Rather than sitting on a
machine and pushing where you're

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:50.860 align:middle line:84%
disabling certain muscles
and enabling others

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:53.250 align:middle line:84%
that may not be appropriate,
because we don't

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:56.105 align:middle line:90%
play hockey sitting on a stool.

00:19:56.105 --> 00:19:57.990 align:middle line:90%
So why would we train that way?

00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:00.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, this
is me to a good point.

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:01.560 align:middle line:90%
I hate gyms, OK?

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:03.480 align:middle line:90%
And I join them.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.570 align:middle line:84%
And then I let it go dormant
and I go a few times.

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:09.830 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is going and
doing resistance training

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:11.490 align:middle line:90%
well, OK, it's not fun.

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:13.350 align:middle line:84%
And I know life can't
be fun every minute.

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:15.800 align:middle line:84%
But for me, I like real
movement, I like dancing.

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.100 align:middle line:90%
Tango.

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:17.912 align:middle line:90%
I tango.

00:20:17.912 --> 00:20:18.870 align:middle line:90%
I've tangoed for years.

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:22.560 align:middle line:84%
But tango and yoga and
walking, and I feel best then.

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:25.090 align:middle line:84%
What is it in our
beings, and I know

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:28.380 align:middle line:84%
it may be more gender
oriented, that is

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:30.030 align:middle line:90%
resisting resistance training?

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:33.537 align:middle line:84%
Is there something
inherently maybe damaging

00:20:33.537 --> 00:20:34.370 align:middle line:90%
in it on some level?

00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:35.760 align:middle line:90%
Are we're just doing it poorly?

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.800 align:middle line:84%
When does it come
into play as useful?

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Well, if you
look at all of the data

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.890 align:middle line:84%
from every angle, the
most bang for the buck

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:46.282 align:middle line:84%
does come from an appropriate
resistance training.

00:20:46.282 --> 00:20:47.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's what I hear.

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:48.420 align:middle line:90%
That's why I keep joining--

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:49.830 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Even more
than yoga and even more

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:51.120 align:middle line:90%
than a number of others.

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.536 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I've
read those studies,

00:20:52.536 --> 00:20:53.860 align:middle line:90%
that's why I join the gym, but.

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:56.318 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: But, I do have a
number of people who have been

00:20:56.318 --> 00:21:00.485 align:middle line:84%
to a company that I won't name
that's kind of a new franchise

00:21:00.485 --> 00:21:02.860 align:middle line:84%
where they make people squat
like Arnold Schwarzenegger--

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:03.495 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, is this Cross Fit?

00:21:03.495 --> 00:21:03.930 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: Ooh.

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:04.763 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm sorry.

00:21:04.763 --> 00:21:06.204 align:middle line:90%
That's what I hear.

00:21:06.204 --> 00:21:07.620 align:middle line:84%
That's what I keep
hearing people.

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:08.990 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: I have people
crawling into my office.

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:10.720 align:middle line:84%
They can't talk
after the third day

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:14.980 align:middle line:84%
because they were forced
into some fascistic regime

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:19.250 align:middle line:84%
of the 20-year-old wanting
the 80-year-old to perform

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:20.050 align:middle line:90%
at their level.

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:21.610 align:middle line:90%
And that's just not appropriate.

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:22.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:22.650 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:23.450 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:25.277 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry, I said it.

00:21:25.277 --> 00:21:26.110 align:middle line:90%
You're off the hook.

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:28.810 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: At
EnergyMedFit, we do

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:30.730 align:middle line:84%
all of the appropriate
intake with people.

00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:32.770 align:middle line:84%
Not just HRV and
NuVision, but we

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:35.500 align:middle line:84%
do a physical
assessment to determine

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:37.810 align:middle line:84%
where is appropriate to
plug-in for some folks.

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:38.860 align:middle line:90%
It's Palates for some.

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:39.820 align:middle line:90%
It's dance for some.

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:42.910 align:middle line:84%
It's I'm going to the
gym with them one-on-one.

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
do this properly.

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
accelerate appropriately.

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:50.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is there
a one size fits all

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:51.940 align:middle line:90%
in just the basic concept?

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:54.610 align:middle line:84%
As you say, the studies show
that doing some resistance

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:57.400 align:middle line:90%
training is good for the body.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.200 align:middle line:84%
Can you encapsulate--
I mean you know

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:02.110 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Mercola has some
little workouts on his site

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:03.280 align:middle line:90%
and different people do.

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.890 align:middle line:84%
Is there something you can point
us to so people can go online

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:08.650 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh, I could
probably do that.

00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:10.080 align:middle line:90%
That would be OK.

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.220 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:13.220 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: I hate to
blow other people's horns,

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:14.800 align:middle line:90%
but this guy is so brilliant.

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.050 align:middle line:84%
Go to YouTube and
type in Ido Portal.

00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:18.299 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How do you spell it?

00:22:18.299 --> 00:22:22.060 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: I-D-O P-O-R-T-A-L.
I've been training, as I said,

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:25.420 align:middle line:84%
since 14 years old
on my paper route.

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:27.360 align:middle line:84%
I've been weight
training since that time.

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:29.380 align:middle line:90%
And this stuff blows me away.

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:30.560 align:middle line:90%
It is so fascinating.

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:31.810 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't use any weight.

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:32.893 align:middle line:90%
You can do it on the road.

00:22:32.893 --> 00:22:35.230 align:middle line:84%
You can do it in your
backyard or the living room.

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:36.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's he look like?

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:39.130 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: He's an Israeli
gymnast who's of medium size,

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:41.900 align:middle line:90%
rugged thick, guy.

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:44.169 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen anyone
move like this before.

00:22:44.169 --> 00:22:46.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It takes the
place of going to the gym?

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:47.600 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: It's the hardest
thing I've ever done.

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:49.016 align:middle line:84%
And it takes the
place of the gym.

00:22:49.016 --> 00:22:51.137 align:middle line:84%
I can't even do
his medium program.

00:22:51.137 --> 00:22:53.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, how's it going
to serve someone like me?

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:55.469 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Oh, because
there's a basic program.

00:22:55.469 --> 00:22:56.369 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:22:56.369 --> 00:22:57.910 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: On some
of the movements,

00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:00.599 align:middle line:84%
I can't do the medium it's
very, very challenging.

00:23:00.599 --> 00:23:02.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But he
does have a beginner

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:04.707 align:middle line:84%
level that is useful to all
of us that we can do at home?

00:23:04.707 --> 00:23:06.040 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: And it's really fun.

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:06.840 align:middle line:90%
And it's brilliant.

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.460 align:middle line:90%
And it's new and exciting.

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:09.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, that's exciting.

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:09.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:10.410 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:11.050 align:middle line:90%
Ido Portal.

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:12.924 align:middle line:84%
So we've got to have
another tool for people.

00:23:12.924 --> 00:23:14.830 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: He's my
new movement favorite.

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:15.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK Good.

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:16.120 align:middle line:90%
So all right.

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:18.650 align:middle line:84%
Well that kind of covers the
whole movement element of it.

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:20.530 align:middle line:84%
You gave us something
to take away.

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:23.260 align:middle line:84%
We know that walking and yoga
and a good walk in nature

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:25.330 align:middle line:90%
are beneficial to us as well.

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:27.700 align:middle line:84%
Now I'd like to go to
the next element, which

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:31.460 align:middle line:84%
is which foods or food groups
help create the greatest

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:32.260 align:middle line:90%
voltage.

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And I know we're
highly individualized,

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:35.090 align:middle line:90%
but, in general?

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:35.890 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: OK.

00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:38.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, you have to go to the
bottom of the food chain.

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:42.690 align:middle line:84%
So all of your quality algae
products, like bioage.com.

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:45.420 align:middle line:90%


00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:46.660 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely phenomenal.

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:49.000 align:middle line:84%
Each pill contains
about the equivalent

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.420 align:middle line:84%
of 10 pounds of spinach in
terms of nutrient density.

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:57.790 align:middle line:84%
So one of the big things, I know
you know this, about anti-aging

00:23:57.790 --> 00:23:59.960 align:middle line:90%
is food reduction.

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:03.880 align:middle line:84%
So if we can cut our
food intake by just 20%,

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:06.910 align:middle line:84%
and add foods that have higher
voltage, like this product--

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:07.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Like algae.

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:09.700 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: --then the
hunger doesn't even

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:13.000 align:middle line:84%
occur because we're satiated
by all of those minerals

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.500 align:middle line:90%
and all of those enzymes.

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:16.240 align:middle line:90%
Because that's what obesity is.

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:20.950 align:middle line:84%
It's the body's cry for certain
nutrients that are not present.

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:24.692 align:middle line:84%
When we satisfy that cry, then
there's no need to store fat.

00:24:24.692 --> 00:24:25.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So micronutrients--

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:27.580 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: That's not the
only reason for obesity.

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:30.010 align:middle line:84%
Heavy metals is another big
one, as well, but we can talk--

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:30.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going
to get into that.

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:31.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:32.620 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: OK.

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:35.720 align:middle line:84%
As far as raising voltage,
so fresh fruit and vegetable

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:39.124 align:middle line:84%
juices in a rotating pattern
where some are astringent,

00:24:39.124 --> 00:24:40.915 align:middle line:84%
like beets and what
have you, and then some

00:24:40.915 --> 00:24:43.180 align:middle line:84%
are nourishing like
carrots and very sugary.

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:47.300 align:middle line:84%
But we don't want to get
into having the same juice

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:48.100 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about
mixing them altogether?

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:51.520 align:middle line:84%
Better to stay
astringent and then

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.105 align:middle line:84%
sweet and alternate
than mix them?

00:24:53.105 --> 00:24:54.610 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Well,
Dr. Norman Walker

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:56.380 align:middle line:84%
wrote the definitive
book on juicing.

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:58.790 align:middle line:84%
And you can still
pick that up online.

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:01.109 align:middle line:90%
I think he lived to be 108.

00:25:01.109 --> 00:25:02.275 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Dr. Norman Walker.

00:25:02.275 --> 00:25:03.080 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:06.340 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: And you can
just look for recipes.

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:07.840 align:middle line:84%
Certain things
it's very important

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:10.600 align:middle line:84%
that they don't be mixed
because especially folks with GI

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:11.800 align:middle line:90%
disturbances.

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:12.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:15.496 align:middle line:84%
So Dr. Walker
explains all of this?

00:25:15.496 --> 00:25:17.620 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: And if you
don't want to buy a juicer--

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:18.610 align:middle line:90%
I know it's a pain.

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:21.130 align:middle line:90%
I have three of them.

00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:23.530 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes I'm in a hurry.

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:26.140 align:middle line:84%
There's at the store, now,
especially here in Colorado,

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:28.900 align:middle line:84%
you can get organic,
non-pasteurized fresh fruit

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:31.470 align:middle line:84%
and vegetable juices from a
lot of these manufacturers.

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And I would really urge everyone
to just have one of these a day

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:36.410 align:middle line:90%
and watch your life change.

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:37.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really.

00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:37.600 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: Yes.

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.430 align:middle line:84%
Just because it's
got voltage in it.

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:40.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the
thing is I thought

00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:44.080 align:middle line:84%
the voltage started
reducing the further away

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:45.450 align:middle line:90%
from the actual pressing it is.

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:46.408 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: Absolutely.

00:25:46.408 --> 00:25:49.090 align:middle line:84%
But wouldn't you rather
have that particular product

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:53.380 align:middle line:90%
than a big bowl of GMO pasta?

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:54.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:55.720 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: We have
to pick our poison.

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are they
flash pasteurized?

00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:57.490 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: No.

00:25:57.490 --> 00:25:58.290 align:middle line:90%
They're not.

00:25:58.290 --> 00:25:59.950 align:middle line:90%
That's the thing.

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:02.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Again, if you can
tell us which of those products

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:04.780 align:middle line:84%
are out there at the
store that are not

00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:07.330 align:middle line:84%
flash pasteurized, because I
know one of the big labels is.

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:08.110 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: I'm so visual.

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:09.890 align:middle line:84%
I can see the label,
but I can't tell you--

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:11.431 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What's
the label look like?

00:26:11.431 --> 00:26:13.430 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I'll know.

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:15.420 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Just go to
Lucky's, or Whole Foods,

00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:17.770 align:middle line:90%
or wherever, Vitamin Cottage.

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:19.410 align:middle line:84%
They'll have
something like this.

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:21.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's non
flash pasteurized.

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:21.890 align:middle line:90%
That's what you want.

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:22.560 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: That's
the important thing.

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:24.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you want to
drink it as soon as possible.

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:25.130 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
keep these around

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:25.990 align:middle line:84%
in the refrigerator
for a few days.

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:27.380 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: They don't last.

00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:28.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:28.460 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:29.870 align:middle line:90%
But better, yet, get a juicer.

00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:32.180 align:middle line:84%
I find that those do
not work for my body,

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:34.387 align:middle line:84%
because there's something
in my digestive system

00:26:34.387 --> 00:26:36.470 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't like a juice
that's been sitting around

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:37.280 align:middle line:90%
for a while.

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:40.261 align:middle line:84%
Where right out of the
juicer, no problem.

00:26:40.261 --> 00:26:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the
liveness of the enzymes.

00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:44.450 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: It's the monatomics
that actually come out

00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:45.824 align:middle line:84%
of the juice from
the vegetables.

00:26:45.824 --> 00:26:47.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Explain this to us.

00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:48.290 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:50.640 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: When you have
two molecules of a metal,

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:51.440 align:middle line:90%
it's a metal.

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:53.420 align:middle line:84%
But when you break it
down to one molecule,

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:54.530 align:middle line:90%
it becomes a ceramic.

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes a monatomic,
which is incredibly conductive.

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:02.270 align:middle line:84%
So we just turned our
body from copper wiring

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:04.700 align:middle line:90%
into a fiber optic system.

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And just like in the video,
things that are sluggish,

00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:08.570 align:middle line:90%
that's sickness.

00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:11.720 align:middle line:84%
Things that are moving
quickly is health.

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:13.029 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing what that can do.

00:27:13.029 --> 00:27:14.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And within
how many minutes

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:17.900 align:middle line:84%
do we have to drink it before
that effect starts dying off?

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:21.024 align:middle line:84%
Right after you've pressed
the juice or squeezed it.

00:27:21.024 --> 00:27:22.940 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Well, yeah,
the sooner the better.

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:24.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You want to
drink it right away.

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:24.840 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: Right.

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:27.320 align:middle line:84%
But there is a magic
of the gods there,

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.810 align:middle line:84%
if you look go back to
the Ark of the Covenant

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:31.599 align:middle line:84%
and all of the
passion about gold.

00:27:31.599 --> 00:27:32.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Monatomic gold.

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:35.130 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: It's so fascinating.

00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:35.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:36.230 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.560 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:37.320 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.278 align:middle line:84%
That's the first time
I've actually heard that.

00:27:39.278 --> 00:27:43.370 align:middle line:84%
That that ceramic exists within
live juices at the moment you

00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:44.170 align:middle line:90%
juice them.

00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:45.260 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: And algae.

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:45.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And algae.

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:46.370 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:48.119 align:middle line:84%
What about the notion
of taking your juice

00:27:48.119 --> 00:27:51.532 align:middle line:84%
and then freezing
it right away versus

00:27:51.532 --> 00:27:53.615 align:middle line:84%
letting it sit in the
refrigerator for three days.

00:27:53.615 --> 00:27:55.198 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Well,
again, we're talking

00:27:55.198 --> 00:27:56.550 align:middle line:90%
about the lesser of evils.

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:59.001 align:middle line:84%
It's not a good idea because
you might as well get it

00:27:59.001 --> 00:28:00.750 align:middle line:84%
from the store if
you're going to do that.

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:01.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:01.640 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:03.840 align:middle line:84%
Just because some people do do
that, I wanted to put it out.

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:06.380 align:middle line:10%
>>STREETER: And speaking of
food that's nutrient condensers,

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:07.790 align:middle line:10%
let's talk about quality meats.

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:11.900 align:middle line:10%
Because they do have a very
high level of nutrients

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:13.490 align:middle line:10%
to give to the body.

00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And certainly we could
talk for five hours

00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:17.120 align:middle line:90%
about veganism versus meat.

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:19.190 align:middle line:84%
But for these
practical purposes,

00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:24.140 align:middle line:84%
let's just say let's focus on
bison and turkey and quality

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:28.340 align:middle line:84%
eggs and to really try to
eliminate anything that's

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:32.360 align:middle line:84%
not organic, because there's
so much evil condensed

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:34.510 align:middle line:90%
into those nonorganic meats.

00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:36.050 align:middle line:90%
That's really important.

00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:37.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And pasteurized,
as well, right?

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: Right.

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully
humanely slaughtered.

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:44.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if one is
eating animal proteins,

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:50.690 align:middle line:84%
is it fair to say that a
basic conscious, classic vegan

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:54.320 align:middle line:84%
diet with a spectrum
of the fresh foods one

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:58.250 align:middle line:84%
needs combined with a modest
or moderate amount of that

00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:00.950 align:middle line:84%
works well for people that
do better on a more paleo

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:02.270 align:middle line:90%
diet for example?

00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:06.290 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Um-hmm I've seen
vegans turn their life around

00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:11.750 align:middle line:84%
in one day with a paleo
diet, especially athletes.

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:12.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:14.240 align:middle line:90%
It's such a big topic.

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:15.540 align:middle line:90%
It's so emotionally charged.

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:19.460 align:middle line:84%
Because we're talking about
spirituality and the ethics

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:20.730 align:middle line:90%
of eating other species.

00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And we really that's not what
we're here to talk about.

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:25.547 align:middle line:84%
So everyone has to
do that journey.

00:29:25.547 --> 00:29:27.380 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: I eat meat,
but I aspire not to.

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:28.882 align:middle line:90%
Let me put it that way.

00:29:28.882 --> 00:29:30.590 align:middle line:84%
Because I love the
critters, all of them.

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:32.810 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to see
them treated that way.

00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:35.439 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to take on
that negative energy either.

00:29:35.439 --> 00:29:37.730 align:middle line:84%
But I know that when I'm a
vegan, I'm hungry every half

00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:38.120 align:middle line:90%
an hour.

00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:39.661 align:middle line:84%
So if someone can
help me with that--

00:29:39.661 --> 00:29:42.190 align:middle line:90%


00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:44.460 align:middle line:90%
there's no satiety.

00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:47.225 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where do fats and the
omegas and such feed into this?

00:29:47.225 --> 00:29:49.850 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: I'm glad you asked,
because actually the whole food

00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:52.520 align:middle line:84%
pyramid has been turned
upside down by those of us

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:54.340 align:middle line:84%
in the energy
medicine community.

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:56.880 align:middle line:84%
Fats are the absolute
most important nutrient

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:58.490 align:middle line:90%
that we can possibly eat.

00:29:58.490 --> 00:30:02.750 align:middle line:84%
The reason being is that
we are fat/water being.

00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:06.110 align:middle line:84%
Kind of like an exercise physio
ball represents the cell,

00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:07.610 align:middle line:90%
represents fat.

00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:10.160 align:middle line:84%
What we can transport
in and out of that cell

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:12.740 align:middle line:84%
as fast as possible,
that's health.

00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:16.250 align:middle line:84%
When things become difficult
and production and distribution

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:20.390 align:middle line:84%
slow to a crawl, then
bad things happen.

00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:23.567 align:middle line:84%
So if we look at the hierarchy
of fats, the best that

00:30:23.567 --> 00:30:25.400 align:middle line:84%
in the world, we're
back to the algae again.

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:26.200 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:28.010 align:middle line:84%
Because it's the bottom
of the food chain.

00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:31.130 align:middle line:84%
The second best fat,
scientifically I believe,

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:33.620 align:middle line:90%
is coconut oil.

00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:38.000 align:middle line:84%
I think it's critical that
everybody take coconut oil.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.652 align:middle line:84%
Olive oil, good
quality olive oil.

00:30:40.652 --> 00:30:42.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That has nines,
a lot of omega nines in it.

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:43.660 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: Right.

00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:44.810 align:middle line:90%
But then most other fats--

00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:46.270 align:middle line:90%
oh, well, let me say this.

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:51.110 align:middle line:84%
Avocado, food fats like that,
nuts and seeds are fine.

00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:53.520 align:middle line:84%
But just a caveat about
nuts and nut butters

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:56.750 align:middle line:84%
is that they tend to be
rancid very, very quickly.

00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:59.945 align:middle line:90%
So not a good staple.

00:30:59.945 --> 00:31:03.050 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you how many vegan
girls that I have for patients

00:31:03.050 --> 00:31:06.130 align:middle line:84%
who all they want to do is
snack on nuts and peanut butter

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:07.610 align:middle line:90%
and almond all day.

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:10.170 align:middle line:90%
Not good.

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:12.470 align:middle line:90%
Because of the rancidity.

00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:16.130 align:middle line:84%
Bison fat, phenomenal
saturated fat.

00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:18.170 align:middle line:90%
And just from a 3D standpoint--

00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:20.420 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to have the
spiritual discussion about it

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:23.840 align:middle line:84%
now-- but bacon is
not that bad for you

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:26.240 align:middle line:90%
just from a fat standpoint.

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:27.680 align:middle line:90%
Some pork products, eggs.

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:30.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about cod liver
oil, you know, the fish oils?

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:31.190 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: They're all rancid.

00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:32.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Rancid?

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:32.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.200 align:middle line:90%
Well I know Udo pretty well.

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.410 align:middle line:90%
Udo Erasmus.

00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And he's been talking
about this rancidity issue

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.040 align:middle line:90%
for a long time.

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And he tends to skew a
little more toward hemp

00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:49.370 align:middle line:84%
and other vegetarian sources
for the omega 3, 6, and 9s.

00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:52.440 align:middle line:84%
Would you tend to agree with
that if they're kept properly?

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:53.630 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: Mm-hmm.

00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:54.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:55.527 align:middle line:90%
In terms of rancidity?

00:31:55.527 --> 00:31:57.860 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: The only problem
with some of those products

00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:02.060 align:middle line:84%
is that they're all
polyunsaturated PUFAs right?

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:04.250 align:middle line:90%
Polyunsaturated fatty acids.

00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:06.380 align:middle line:84%
They're leading us down
the estrogen pathway,

00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:08.420 align:middle line:90%
unfortunately.

00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:10.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you have to add
your coconut oil back in.

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:13.377 align:middle line:84%
Get your saturated fats, ghee
and so forth back in with it.

00:32:13.377 --> 00:32:14.960 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Don't
be afraid of butter.

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:15.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Don't be afraid?

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:15.950 align:middle line:90%
I love butter.

00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:17.575 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: But only
cook with coconut.

00:32:17.575 --> 00:32:19.370 align:middle line:84%
Everything else is
not safe to cook with.

00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:20.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:21.000 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.400 align:middle line:84%
Can we show this
little video right now?

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:24.150 align:middle line:84%
Because we're going
to get into the energy

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:26.390 align:middle line:84%
medicine devices in a
moment and NuVision.

00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And what people are seeing
in this little video,

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:31.730 align:middle line:84%
explain to them
what they're seeing.

00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:33.890 align:middle line:90%
And what it is by way--

00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:36.680 align:middle line:84%
well, you explain what
it is that's changing

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:40.220 align:middle line:84%
the pace at which the
blood or the fluids

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:42.050 align:middle line:90%
are running through the vessels.

00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:43.820 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Well,
that's being caused

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:50.810 align:middle line:84%
by a pulsed electromagnetic
field, PEMF therapy,

00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:54.290 align:middle line:84%
that any time you put
electricity through a wire,

00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:57.410 align:middle line:84%
you have a field that
comes out from that wire.

00:32:57.410 --> 00:32:59.630 align:middle line:84%
How far that field
extends from the wire

00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:02.000 align:middle line:90%
depends on a number of factors.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.960 align:middle line:84%
But the effects on the body
are almost all positive.

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:06.980 align:middle line:90%
It's unbelievable.

00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:09.650 align:middle line:84%
There really are no
bad PEMF devices.

00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:12.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Basically, it's
taking what a lot of us

00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:15.740 align:middle line:84%
are, well, constituted of
which is really stagnant blood.

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:18.330 align:middle line:84%
Stagnant, stagnant movement
of the vital fluids

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:19.160 align:middle line:90%
through our body.

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:22.190 align:middle line:84%
First of all, what happens when
these fluids become stagnant

00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:24.087 align:middle line:90%
and they're not moving?

00:33:24.087 --> 00:33:25.670 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Well,
when you have toxins

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:28.550 align:middle line:84%
that are not being
eliminated, imagine the trucks

00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:30.920 align:middle line:90%
on strike in a large city.

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:32.360 align:middle line:90%
That's a problem.

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:34.430 align:middle line:84%
That's really the first
problem for everyone

00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:34.610 align:middle line:90%
from a health standpoint.

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:35.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Toxicity?

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:36.280 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: Yes.

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:37.850 align:middle line:90%
We need to focus on detox.

00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:39.620 align:middle line:84%
I prefer to do it
on a daily basis

00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:41.690 align:middle line:84%
where I'm taking
certain products

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:44.120 align:middle line:90%
and using PEMF daily to detox.

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:47.070 align:middle line:84%
Because it is astounding
for that as well.

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:49.580 align:middle line:84%
And rather than doing
the one big detox, kind

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:51.470 align:middle line:84%
of like losing
weight for a wedding,

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:56.060 align:middle line:84%
why wouldn't you want to
just be fit all the time?

00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:59.690 align:middle line:84%
Not that I'm against
the individual cleanses.

00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:03.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's
detoxifying the body.

00:34:03.050 --> 00:34:05.259 align:middle line:84%
That's not happening when
you've got stagnant fluids.

00:34:05.259 --> 00:34:06.058 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: Right.

00:34:06.058 --> 00:34:08.169 align:middle line:84%
And then you can't bring
new nutrients in as well.

00:34:08.169 --> 00:34:08.969 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:34:08.969 --> 00:34:11.719 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: So lactic
acid builds up.

00:34:11.719 --> 00:34:16.372 align:middle line:84%
And the arthritis process
begins, calcification.

00:34:16.372 --> 00:34:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what we're
witnessing with this slow down

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:22.610 align:middle line:84%
is the body is a big
calcium factory, OK?

00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:26.075 align:middle line:84%
If it's not moved, it
will just be a statue.

00:34:26.075 --> 00:34:27.949 align:middle line:84%
That's what happens when
people are in a body

00:34:27.949 --> 00:34:30.270 align:middle line:90%
cast for months at a time.

00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:33.530 align:middle line:84%
So what the PEMF
does is it creates

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:37.070 align:middle line:84%
a vasodilation in all
of those distal tissues

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:40.596 align:middle line:84%
like the fingers, and the ends
of the lung, and the alveoli.

00:34:40.596 --> 00:34:42.679 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even the tissues
surrounding the organs.

00:34:42.679 --> 00:34:44.030 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: Absolutely.

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:47.246 align:middle line:84%
And so when we open
up that blood flow,

00:34:47.246 --> 00:34:48.620 align:middle line:84%
it's the difference
between a mud

00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:54.150 align:middle line:84%
pond and a beautiful
crystal clear spring river.

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:56.640 align:middle line:84%
Which one do you want
to be inside, right?

00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:57.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:59.500 align:middle line:84%
We're going to-- and
we could go tangential,

00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:01.250 align:middle line:84%
but let's take a look
at this little video

00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:03.620 align:middle line:84%
to show what happened
when this body was

00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:05.280 align:middle line:90%
exposed to a PEMF device.

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:06.080 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:06.780 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:07.580 align:middle line:90%

>>REGINA: So, I love that
video, because it just

00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:18.260 align:middle line:84%
shows you how effective
these devices are.

00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:19.760 align:middle line:84%
And there are a
whole range of them,

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:21.884 align:middle line:90%
but they all do good, right?

00:37:21.884 --> 00:37:23.640 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Oh,
they're all valuable.

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:24.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:27.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's go into--
because I feel the pressure.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.190 align:middle line:84%
We have so much good
stuff to talk about

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:30.800 align:middle line:84%
and I'm feeling the
pressure of time.

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:33.290 align:middle line:84%
Let's go into the
assessment tool

00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:35.660 align:middle line:84%
called NuVision
kind of just what it

00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:38.980 align:middle line:84%
does, because you work pretty
regularly with your clients

00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:39.910 align:middle line:90%
with this.

00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:41.750 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Well, for
the past 30 years,

00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:45.260 align:middle line:84%
I've played with a lot of
the best testing assessment

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:49.130 align:middle line:84%
tools from the alternative
side, like EAV,

00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:51.080 align:middle line:84%
electroacupuncture
according to Vol,

00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:56.390 align:middle line:84%
ONDAMED, a lot of the ones using
electro interstitials scan.

00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:58.210 align:middle line:90%
These are all fantastic.

00:37:58.210 --> 00:38:00.990 align:middle line:90%
They've show consistent results.

00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:03.050 align:middle line:84%
But what used to
take me four hours

00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:07.210 align:middle line:84%
takes five minutes
now with NuVision.

00:38:07.210 --> 00:38:10.975 align:middle line:84%
And it is available
for the public to have.

00:38:10.975 --> 00:38:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And we can do it over the
telephone with 95% accuracy.

pathogens, and
toxins, heavy metals.

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:53.030 align:middle line:84%
It's really mind blowing and
almost difficult to digest

00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.870 align:middle line:90%
the first session.

00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:56.150 align:middle line:84%
But as we go along,
people take little bites

00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:57.860 align:middle line:90%
and make little changes.

00:38:57.860 --> 00:38:59.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing
what can happen.

00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:02.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The point is, I
think, on a larger scale,

00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:07.700 align:middle line:84%
many people watching this
show don't have a lot of--

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:09.380 align:middle line:90%
are afraid of AI, basically.

00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:12.050 align:middle line:84%
We fear it, because we can
see the ways in which it

00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:15.380 align:middle line:90%
can be used against humanity.

00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is a good
point to make that there

00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:20.780 align:middle line:84%
are those people with that
degree of intelligence

00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:25.010 align:middle line:84%
that really are working to help
us continue our organic life

00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:25.811 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:39:25.811 --> 00:39:26.685 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: Well put.

00:39:26.685 --> 00:39:27.810 align:middle line:90%
That's very important.

00:39:27.810 --> 00:39:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And again, just to
look at it as a tool.

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:34.760 align:middle line:84%
Fire can burn down your home
but also keep you warm at night.

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:36.230 align:middle line:84%
Although there are
some tools that

00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:38.980 align:middle line:84%
are unacceptable in my world,
like the whole transhuman

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:39.780 align:middle line:90%
movement.

00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:40.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Don't even go there.

00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:41.585 align:middle line:90%
We don't need to go there.

00:39:41.585 --> 00:39:41.690 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: No.

00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:42.380 align:middle line:90%
I just want to make that point--

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:43.317 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I get it.

00:39:43.317 --> 00:39:45.150 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: --that I'm
not a transhuman, not

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:45.984 align:middle line:90%
one of these freaks.

00:39:45.984 --> 00:39:46.783 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:39:46.783 --> 00:39:47.670 align:middle line:90%
I love nature.

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:51.110 align:middle line:84%
And I love organic
things, chopping wood.

00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:52.220 align:middle line:90%
I don't need all of that.

00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:55.130 align:middle line:84%
I don't want a chip in my
head with the internet.

00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:56.810 align:middle line:90%
I'll never take the chip.

00:39:56.810 --> 00:40:01.400 align:middle line:84%
However, anything short of
that, I'm fascinated by it.

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:02.690 align:middle line:90%
I see the accuracy of it.

00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:04.500 align:middle line:90%
And I don't see any downside.

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:05.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:05.570 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:06.770 align:middle line:90%
So here's the positive view.

00:40:06.770 --> 00:40:09.900 align:middle line:84%
So now we have tools that
can assess every aspect

00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:11.120 align:middle line:90%
of our being in five minutes.

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:13.640 align:middle line:84%
So it's giving people
like you, people

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:16.970 align:middle line:84%
that are in the medical field,
to actually help and enhance

00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:18.320 align:middle line:90%
human health.

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:19.970 align:middle line:84%
A really good glimpse
into us and you

00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:22.370 align:middle line:84%
find there are certain
things you do find

00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:23.870 align:middle line:90%
that are common that are scary.

00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:25.820 align:middle line:84%
And we're just going
to name names and be

00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:29.120 align:middle line:84%
done with it, because we've all
been subjected to this stuff.

00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:30.350 align:middle line:90%
And, yet, we're still here.

00:40:30.350 --> 00:40:31.520 align:middle line:90%
We're alive.

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:33.140 align:middle line:84%
You might be tired,
but we're alive.

00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:33.950 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:35.916 align:middle line:84%
And so let's just talk
about some of the things

00:40:35.916 --> 00:40:38.540 align:middle line:84%
you're finding that are showing
up in virtually everybody who's

00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:39.580 align:middle line:90%
living on Earth.

00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:43.130 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Well, another
magnificent aspect of NuVision

00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:46.610 align:middle line:84%
is as a world wide
demographic study.

00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:49.100 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine if we had
one in every household

00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:52.826 align:middle line:84%
around the world we could pick
up an Ebola scare instantly,

00:40:52.826 --> 00:40:54.950 align:middle line:84%
because it would show up
on NuVision, and we'd say,

00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:56.960 align:middle line:90%
oh, it's happening over here.

00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:02.150 align:middle line:84%
Or, boy, there's a flu
outbreak here over here.

00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:04.670 align:middle line:84%
So with that being said,
there are some patterns

00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:06.800 align:middle line:90%
that are very disturbing.

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:08.840 align:middle line:84%
One is that pretty
much 100% of us

00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:11.180 align:middle line:84%
have aluminum and
barium poisoning.

00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:13.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This would
be chemtrail related.

00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:16.250 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Most have mercury
poisoning from the fillings,

00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:18.965 align:middle line:84%
but also from vaccinations
and from other things.

00:41:18.965 --> 00:41:22.110 align:middle line:90%


00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:25.910 align:middle line:84%
Most have Lyme or at
least an exposure.

00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:27.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Lyme isn't
coming from ticks.

00:41:27.690 --> 00:41:28.490 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: No.

00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:30.979 align:middle line:90%


00:41:30.979 --> 00:41:32.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's an evil laugh.

00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:33.410 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what that's about.

00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:35.960 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Well, I've
studied Lyme extensively, too,

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:38.790 align:middle line:90%
and it's definitely created--

00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:41.367 align:middle line:84%
It's not an organic
disease, put it that way.

00:41:41.367 --> 00:41:42.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: More
genetically engineered.

00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:44.825 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: And it's
got a purpose behind it.

00:41:44.825 --> 00:41:47.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what's
the purpose behind it?

00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:48.730 align:middle line:90%
This is a really good audience.

00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:49.640 align:middle line:90%
They want to hear.

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:51.140 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: It's a
eugenics program.

00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:52.967 align:middle line:90%


00:41:52.967 --> 00:41:54.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're trying
to weed people out.

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:56.841 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: We have numbers
challenges right now.

00:41:56.841 --> 00:42:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And so we really have to prove
our value to the universe.

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:02.150 align:middle line:84%
We have to be
valuable to the group.

00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And we can't just be,
we have to be valuable.

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:09.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
as one interview I

00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:10.680 align:middle line:84%
did with a man
named George Green

00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:13.990 align:middle line:84%
ages who got too close in
the Carter administration.

00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:15.730 align:middle line:84%
He said he was there
in the meetings

00:42:15.730 --> 00:42:19.810 align:middle line:84%
and overheard the term for
us which is useless eaters.

00:42:19.810 --> 00:42:23.020 align:middle line:84%
So Lyme disease, genetically
created Lyme disease,

00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:26.350 align:middle line:84%
is very useful in helping weaken
our immune systems and such

00:42:26.350 --> 00:42:29.070 align:middle line:84%
to the point where a
lot of us won't be here,

00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:30.750 align:middle line:90%
or cannot procreate.

00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:33.250 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Well, that's part
of the binary warfare program.

00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:36.830 align:middle line:84%
But it's not just one item that
does us in, it's a combination.

00:42:36.830 --> 00:42:42.010 align:middle line:84%
So when you combine aspartame
with fluoride and Wi-Fi.

00:42:42.010 --> 00:42:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And you have a triangulation
and a trajectory

00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:47.710 align:middle line:84%
to really bring that
person's voltage down.

00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:49.660 align:middle line:84%
But notice that they
do it the slow way

00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:51.790 align:middle line:84%
so that they'll have to
utilize their services

00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:54.977 align:middle line:84%
and they can drain their
bank account before they die.

00:42:54.977 --> 00:42:56.560 align:middle line:84%
This is all very
carefully calculated.

00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:59.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We're batteries.

00:42:59.850 --> 00:43:02.080 align:middle line:84%
We're batteries to
the system and we're

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:03.466 align:middle line:90%
being drained very rapidly.

00:43:03.466 --> 00:43:04.840 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER:
Particularly after 65

00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:07.270 align:middle line:84%
when our usefulness
ceases to them.

00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:10.060 align:middle line:84%
So it's really important that
we take the bull by the horns

00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:11.950 align:middle line:84%
and we make health our
number one priority,

00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:14.380 align:middle line:90%
because nothing else matters.

00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:17.550 align:middle line:84%
Especially right now, especially
with the battle that's coming.

00:43:17.550 --> 00:43:19.390 align:middle line:90%
Let's hope it's a spiritual one.

00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:21.430 align:middle line:84%
But we have to be
strong and we have

00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:23.552 align:middle line:84%
to be healthy,
because if you're not,

00:43:23.552 --> 00:43:24.760 align:middle line:90%
you're a burden to the group.

00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And you know sometimes I'm
that burden when I'm injured.

00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:34.100 align:middle line:90%
But it's exciting.

00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:37.137 align:middle line:84%
We have a solution to
almost every problem.

00:43:37.137 --> 00:43:38.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We have a
good chunk of time left.

00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:40.260 align:middle line:90%
Let's start moving into those.

00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:41.550 align:middle line:90%
We've talked about food.

00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:42.620 align:middle line:90%
We've talked about fats.

00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:43.800 align:middle line:90%
We've talked about movement.

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:45.620 align:middle line:84%
So these are things
we can all take on.

00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:46.910 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't cost us anything.

00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:48.660 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk about
the things that you'd

00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:50.670 align:middle line:84%
have to actually
invest in a little bit

00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:52.230 align:middle line:90%
right down to some supplements.

00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that you
do that you're particularly

00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:58.560 align:middle line:90%
invested in--

00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:02.730 align:middle line:84%
and I have to say so far
it seems great to me--

00:44:02.730 --> 00:44:04.740 align:middle line:90%
is that Nanoxyde?

00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:07.000 align:middle line:90%
Can you talk about this?

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:07.800 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: Yes.

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:09.360 align:middle line:84%
The Germans during
World War II were

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:11.670 align:middle line:84%
working on a replacement
for penicillin

00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:15.720 align:middle line:84%
because they realized the
limitations of a bacteria only

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:17.760 align:middle line:90%
antibiotic.

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:21.440 align:middle line:84%
They knew that silver
had amazing qualities

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:23.040 align:middle line:84%
as an anti pathogen.
But they knew

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:25.920 align:middle line:84%
that if they bonded to oxygen,
it would be even more powerful.

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:29.340 align:middle line:84%
But they never really
finished the experiment.

00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:33.065 align:middle line:84%
So after the war, that scientist
came to Pueblo, Colorado.

00:44:33.065 --> 00:44:34.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Who was that?

00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:35.250 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: I don't
recall his name.

00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:36.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:38.010 align:middle line:10%
>>STREETER: He began to work
with a local gentleman who

00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:38.810 align:middle line:10%
was a go-getter.

00:44:38.810 --> 00:44:40.800 align:middle line:84%
And they began to
perfect the product.

00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And it became an underground
phenomenon for a long time,

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:49.770 align:middle line:84%
and has really begun to come
out of the shadows now because

00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:54.780 align:middle line:84%
of its value and pertinence
with a very, very high success

00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:57.270 align:middle line:84%
rate on infectious
agents that have not been

00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:58.839 align:middle line:90%
able to be dealt with before.

00:44:58.839 --> 00:45:01.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's interesting,
because as people are listening

00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:04.080 align:middle line:84%
to you, I know a lot of
people are thinking, oh,

00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:06.690 align:middle line:90%
but I have my colloidal silver.

00:45:06.690 --> 00:45:08.100 align:middle line:90%
And I have my nano silver.

00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:09.540 align:middle line:90%
And I'm using it at home.

00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:11.250 align:middle line:84%
Is this the same
product or is there

00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:13.917 align:middle line:84%
some difference to the normal
nano silver you would find?

00:45:13.917 --> 00:45:16.500 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Well, you Can also
try to take a bicycle from here

00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:19.402 align:middle line:90%
to California if you want to.

00:45:19.402 --> 00:45:21.530 align:middle line:90%
Colloidal silvers are great.

00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:22.930 align:middle line:90%
But you get what you pay for.

00:45:22.930 --> 00:45:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And the efficacy of making
the molecule smaller

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:31.920 align:middle line:84%
and adding the
oxygen is so greater.

00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:34.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's the size of the
molecule plus the oxygen.

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:35.615 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Plus the oxygen.

00:45:35.615 --> 00:45:37.740 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: You've interviewed
someone recently who

00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:40.420 align:middle line:84%
that this product saved his
life and his wife's life.

00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:41.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I did.

00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:41.570 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: Yes.

00:45:41.570 --> 00:45:42.596 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You want to tell us.

00:45:42.596 --> 00:45:43.072 align:middle line:90%
I guess you can't.

00:45:43.072 --> 00:45:43.550 align:middle line:90%
Never mind.

00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:45.450 align:middle line:84%
If he didn't tell me,
then I'm not going ask.

00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:47.950 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: But it was
really unbelievable.

00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And we just had a
patient with MRSA

00:45:50.490 --> 00:45:52.226 align:middle line:90%
who was healed in two weeks.

00:45:52.226 --> 00:45:53.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Explain
MRSA to our audience.

00:45:53.850 --> 00:45:55.830 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Well, that's
methicillin-resistant staph

00:45:55.830 --> 00:45:56.630 align:middle line:90%
infection.

00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And there's not antibiotics
that work on this.

00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:00.130 align:middle line:90%
It's really really heinous.

00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:02.460 align:middle line:90%
And I see it every now and then.

00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:05.083 align:middle line:84%
But two bottles of this
product and it was gone.

00:46:05.083 --> 00:46:07.700 align:middle line:90%


00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:10.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you also, this has
different distribution systems.

00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:13.410 align:middle line:84%
It's a liquid that you
can take a capsule of just

00:46:13.410 --> 00:46:16.260 align:middle line:84%
on a daily basis to kind of keep
everything clean in the body.

00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:18.150 align:middle line:84%
But you also use a
nebulizer with it?

00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:21.330 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: You can use it for
a nebulizer for lung cancer,

00:46:21.330 --> 00:46:24.165 align:middle line:84%
or for pneumonia,
bronchitis, asthma,

00:46:24.165 --> 00:46:25.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sinus infections?

00:46:25.290 --> 00:46:26.770 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: Sinus infections.

00:46:26.770 --> 00:46:28.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And almost everybody
has that with the chemtrails

00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:29.510 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:29.680 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: That's right.

00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:30.971 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Some version of that.

00:46:30.971 --> 00:46:32.850 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: This is
a really good defense

00:46:32.850 --> 00:46:34.290 align:middle line:90%
against chemtrails.

00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:35.850 align:middle line:90%
Probably one of the best.

00:46:35.850 --> 00:46:37.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's really
useful information.

00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:39.330 align:middle line:90%
So the product--

00:46:39.330 --> 00:46:42.210 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Let's remember
it's not a chelator.

00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:43.010 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:44.005 align:middle line:90%
It's an anti pathogen.

00:46:44.005 --> 00:46:46.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's not going
to chelate the other junk out

00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:46.890 align:middle line:90%
of the body.

00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:47.520 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: No.

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:48.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:51.112 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: And this
is in liquid form.

00:46:51.112 --> 00:46:52.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The name of
that product again?

00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:54.130 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: Nanoxyde.com

00:46:54.130 --> 00:46:55.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Nanoxyde.com
does come.

00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:58.120 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: N-A-N-O-X-Y-D-E.

00:46:58.120 --> 00:46:58.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:46:58.920 --> 00:46:59.830 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:46:59.830 --> 00:47:00.630 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:06.150 align:middle line:84%
So let's move on from there
to now the PEMF devices.

00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:08.640 align:middle line:84%
Because now we're looking
at that video we saw,

00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:11.130 align:middle line:84%
that was in direct
response to someone

00:47:11.130 --> 00:47:12.670 align:middle line:90%
being exposed to a PEMF device.

00:47:12.670 --> 00:47:13.470 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: Right.

00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:15.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk about
the whole array of them.

00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:19.832 align:middle line:84%
Because I've been
evaluating them for a while.

00:47:19.832 --> 00:47:21.540 align:middle line:84%
I've been sleeping on
a Biomat for years.

00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:23.960 align:middle line:84%
That's low tech
comparatively, but nice.

00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:25.290 align:middle line:90%
It offered some benefits to me.

00:47:25.290 --> 00:47:30.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm feeling like the world has
changed in the last 10 years.

00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:33.240 align:middle line:84%
My friends, people,
friends, and acquaintances,

00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:35.720 align:middle line:84%
myself are all feeling that
we need something a little bit

00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:36.520 align:middle line:90%
more.

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:39.090 align:middle line:84%
We're not being protected
from the onslaught

00:47:39.090 --> 00:47:41.150 align:middle line:90%
of all of this junk.

00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:44.970 align:middle line:84%
So PEMF you believe is
that's the way to go.

00:47:44.970 --> 00:47:47.700 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Well, I'm also
a comparative technologist.

00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:50.790 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really blessed to
have people dropping devices

00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:51.630 align:middle line:90%
off all the time.

00:47:51.630 --> 00:47:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And we have a lab that
we can test things in.

00:47:54.750 --> 00:47:57.430 align:middle line:84%
We can test supplements
in chemicals as well.

00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:59.610 align:middle line:84%
But we also have
an electronics lab.

00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's really fascinating to
look at all the differences.

00:48:02.350 --> 00:48:03.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:48:03.150 --> 00:48:04.490 align:middle line:90%
So what are your findings?

00:48:04.490 --> 00:48:06.564 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: There are
no bad PEMF devices,

00:48:06.564 --> 00:48:07.480 align:middle line:90%
let's put it that way.

00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:08.396 align:middle line:90%
Let's start with that.

00:48:08.396 --> 00:48:10.110 align:middle line:90%
They're all marvelous.

00:48:10.110 --> 00:48:14.010 align:middle line:84%
But there are certainly better
PEMF devices, by a long shot,

00:48:14.010 --> 00:48:16.000 align:middle line:90%
for particular issues.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:16.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:17.340 align:middle line:90%
Explain that.

00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:19.540 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: So, they
basically fall into two camps.

00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:22.450 align:middle line:84%
One is the mat camp
with low power.

00:48:22.450 --> 00:48:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And then the other is
the "ringer" camp, quote

00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:24.940 align:middle line:90%
and quote unquote.

00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:25.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's that mean?

00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:26.820 align:middle line:90%
Ringer.

00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:29.820 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Ringer means that
the waveform is sharp enough

00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:32.650 align:middle line:90%
to be like the crack of a whip.

00:48:32.650 --> 00:48:34.600 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the lower
powered mats are

00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:38.200 align:middle line:84%
more of a nourishing
induction type of thing

00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:40.360 align:middle line:84%
where they're attempting
to change the Krebs

00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:45.130 align:middle line:84%
cycle through continuous
low intensity pulses.

00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:48.410 align:middle line:84%
The challenge is that
the ambient is 0.5 Gauss.

00:48:48.410 --> 00:48:49.210 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:48:49.210 --> 00:48:52.260 align:middle line:90%
That's the PEMF the earth.

00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:53.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:54.887 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: If we're
not above 0.5, then--

00:48:54.887 --> 00:48:56.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
getting interference.

00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:57.340 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: --what are we doing?

00:48:57.340 --> 00:48:58.456 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:48:58.456 --> 00:48:59.830 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: But
if you get a half

00:48:59.830 --> 00:49:01.600 align:middle line:84%
an inch away from
the applicator,

00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:03.640 align:middle line:90%
you're already at 1/2 power.

00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:06.040 align:middle line:84%
So it's really
important to understand

00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:09.310 align:middle line:84%
where that happy bell
curve falls in terms

00:49:09.310 --> 00:49:11.140 align:middle line:90%
of super fast outcomes.

00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And the ringer devices are
much more capable of doing that

00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:15.670 align:middle line:90%
than the low powered mats.

00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:19.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what are a
couple of the well known mats

00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:21.622 align:middle line:84%
versus ringers so we get
an idea, because people

00:49:21.622 --> 00:49:23.580 align:middle line:84%
are going to want to
start surfing and looking.

00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:26.830 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: BEMER and
MRS would be the two best

00:49:26.830 --> 00:49:29.140 align:middle line:90%
sellers in the mat category.

00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:31.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And those
have good reputations.

00:49:31.070 --> 00:49:32.740 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: They
are great products.

00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:36.310 align:middle line:84%
All we're saying is that
there's one made here in Boulder

00:49:36.310 --> 00:49:40.150 align:middle line:84%
that is a ringer that is much
more powerful than those.

00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:43.630 align:middle line:84%
But it can also be turned down
to work in those capacities.

00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:47.350 align:middle line:84%
But can also be turned up to
regrow cartilage in a knee,

00:49:47.350 --> 00:49:51.160 align:middle line:84%
to deal with a torn
rotator cuff, perhaps.

00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:54.370 align:middle line:84%
Those mat-type devices have
good pain relief for those,

00:49:54.370 --> 00:49:56.170 align:middle line:84%
but in terms of
tissue regeneration,

00:49:56.170 --> 00:49:58.790 align:middle line:84%
they don't have the
penetration because they're not

00:49:58.790 --> 00:49:59.590 align:middle line:90%
powerful enough.

00:49:59.590 --> 00:50:02.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what about
detoxing an immune system?

00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:03.400 align:middle line:90%
How does interface with that?

00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:05.191 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Well,
they're fantastic for all

00:50:05.191 --> 00:50:07.270 align:middle line:84%
of those systemic
long-term, what

00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:08.880 align:middle line:90%
we would call transient issues.

00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:10.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that makes
sense because we just

00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:13.570 align:middle line:84%
saw the capillary action, for
example, in that little film

00:50:13.570 --> 00:50:17.350 align:middle line:84%
of what-- that was a BEMER mat--
what that is promoting which

00:50:17.350 --> 00:50:18.860 align:middle line:90%
boom, was like a super highway.

00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:20.735 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: The thing
with the ringer devices

00:50:20.735 --> 00:50:24.580 align:middle line:84%
is that we have that extra
horsepower if we need it

00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:25.649 align:middle line:90%
for orthopedic issues.

00:50:25.649 --> 00:50:27.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it does
the whole range?

00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:28.856 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: But we
can also turn it down

00:50:28.856 --> 00:50:31.030 align:middle line:84%
and we can take
care of the sleep

00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:33.820 align:middle line:84%
and the systemic disorders
that the lower powered

00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:35.075 align:middle line:90%
devices will deal with.

00:50:35.075 --> 00:50:36.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's it called?

00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:37.992 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: It's called
pulsedharmonix.com.

00:50:37.992 --> 00:50:38.791 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:50:38.791 --> 00:50:39.860 align:middle line:90%
Pulsed Harmonix.

00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:41.590 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: With an x.

00:50:41.590 --> 00:50:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's a smaller
device, not the full body size

00:50:44.650 --> 00:50:46.310 align:middle line:90%
mat like a Biomat or a BEMER.

00:50:46.310 --> 00:50:47.110 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: Right.

00:50:47.110 --> 00:50:49.160 align:middle line:90%
It's a two by three foot mat.

00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:51.250 align:middle line:84%
And what we found,
though, is that to attempt

00:50:51.250 --> 00:50:53.260 align:middle line:84%
to make a mat that's
eight feet long to treat

00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:56.020 align:middle line:84%
the entire body, you get such
a dissipation of the current,

00:50:56.020 --> 00:50:59.110 align:middle line:84%
that we're really
weakening it to the point

00:50:59.110 --> 00:51:02.386 align:middle line:84%
where we're not going to get
the results with certain issues.

00:51:02.386 --> 00:51:03.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So where
would a person

00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:06.040 align:middle line:84%
place it on their body for
overall health maintenance

00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:06.520 align:middle line:90%
if they want?

00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:07.640 align:middle line:90%
Can they use it every day?

00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:08.290 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: Oh, absolutely.

00:51:08.290 --> 00:51:08.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:51:08.590 --> 00:51:09.220 align:middle line:90%
So where would they place it?

00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:11.830 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: They could do
it here for the thyroid

00:51:11.830 --> 00:51:16.594 align:middle line:84%
or on the adrenals, and on
the head for detox, liver,

00:51:16.594 --> 00:51:18.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, and
now interesting.

00:51:18.010 --> 00:51:19.360 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
have liver issues

00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:20.984 align:middle line:84%
these days because
of all these toxins.

00:51:20.984 --> 00:51:25.000 align:middle line:84%
But, it's almost an epidemic
what's happened to the thyroid,

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:26.290 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:51:26.290 --> 00:51:28.120 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: Oh, yeah.

00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:30.071 align:middle line:90%
The thyroid is so critical.

00:51:30.071 --> 00:51:32.320 align:middle line:84%
It's critical that everyone
be on an iodine supplement

00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:33.405 align:middle line:90%
every day as well.

00:51:33.405 --> 00:51:34.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is
Lugol's good enough?

00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:35.613 align:middle line:90%
Is that pretty good?

00:51:35.613 --> 00:51:37.710 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Lugol's,
I still use it 1844.

00:51:37.710 --> 00:51:38.920 align:middle line:90%
It's good enough for me.

00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:39.323 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:51:39.323 --> 00:51:39.726 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:51:39.726 --> 00:51:40.700 align:middle line:90%
And it's not expensive.

00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:42.800 align:middle line:84%
I might buy it on
Amazon, Lugol's iodine.

00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:43.000 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: No.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:43.750 align:middle line:90%
It's fantastic.

00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:46.100 align:middle line:84%
And it can be used topically
for cuts and things like that.

00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:47.850 align:middle line:84%
Although, it's expensive
for that purpose.

00:51:47.850 --> 00:51:50.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it is helping to
nourish the thyroid that's been

00:51:50.770 --> 00:51:52.090 align:middle line:90%
trashed by all of the--

00:51:52.090 --> 00:51:54.320 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Well let's
remember what the thyroid does

00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:57.280 align:middle line:84%
is that it takes iodine
and it distributes it

00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:01.300 align:middle line:84%
to the skin as a kind of
a chainmail or a wetsuit,

00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:03.392 align:middle line:84%
if you will, to keep
the bad guys out.

00:52:03.392 --> 00:52:05.350 align:middle line:84%
This is how people can
work in the dirt all day

00:52:05.350 --> 00:52:08.140 align:middle line:84%
and not get sick, because
the iodine is in their hands.

00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:09.667 align:middle line:90%
And it's killing the bugs.

00:52:09.667 --> 00:52:10.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:52:10.750 --> 00:52:13.374 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: But the more that we
have an onslaught in the skin,

00:52:13.374 --> 00:52:16.090 align:middle line:84%
the more that the thyroid has
to dial up iodine for the skin.

00:52:16.090 --> 00:52:19.210 align:middle line:84%
And then there's not much left
for the thyroid to regulate--

00:52:19.210 --> 00:52:19.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, that's
the supplement.

00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:21.040 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: --the
endocrine system.

00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:21.910 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:23.206 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely critical.

00:52:23.206 --> 00:52:26.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Lugol's L-U-G-O-L-S.
I buy just on Amazon.

00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:27.280 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:30.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have about five
minutes left to talk about some

00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:32.755 align:middle line:84%
of the other
nutrients that help.

00:52:32.755 --> 00:52:34.130 align:middle line:84%
We need to look
at something that

00:52:34.130 --> 00:52:36.550 align:middle line:84%
chelates all of
these heavy metals

00:52:36.550 --> 00:52:39.700 align:middle line:84%
and awful toxins, aluminum,
et cetera, out of the body.

00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:41.930 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: That's
a good question.

00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:45.040 align:middle line:84%
I always like to give a
rainbow of intensities, right?

00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:46.780 align:middle line:84%
So the bottom of
that rainbow might

00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:52.460 align:middle line:84%
look like cilantro or an
algae product like the BioAge

00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:55.020 align:middle line:90%
that we talked about.

00:52:55.020 --> 00:52:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And then as we
move up that scale,

00:52:56.890 --> 00:52:59.700 align:middle line:90%
we have sulfur, bentonite clay.

00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:00.877 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Is that like MSM?

00:53:00.877 --> 00:53:03.460 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Yes, but we want to
be careful that a lot of those

00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:04.714 align:middle line:90%
have a lot of fillers.

00:53:04.714 --> 00:53:06.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You want to get
a really pure MSM product.

00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:08.421 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: And the
purest I've found

00:53:08.421 --> 00:53:11.832 align:middle line:84%
is SuperSulfur which
we have on Vitalife.

00:53:11.832 --> 00:53:12.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Super sulfur?

00:53:12.790 --> 00:53:14.020 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:15.770 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: And then
moving up that scale,

00:53:15.770 --> 00:53:20.440 align:middle line:84%
we get to glutathione,
which sulfur is actually

00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:22.680 align:middle line:90%
a precursor to.

00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And then there are
folks who offer

00:53:24.790 --> 00:53:30.430 align:middle line:84%
really brilliant glutathiones
that are sublingual.

00:53:30.430 --> 00:53:32.599 align:middle line:90%
And then there is EDTA.

00:53:32.599 --> 00:53:33.515 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's that?

00:53:33.515 --> 00:53:34.800 align:middle line:90%
No one's heard of that.

00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:38.950 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: EDTA is decades old,
developed in Europe, brought

00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:40.630 align:middle line:90%
over by Dr. Garry Gordon.

00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:41.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:42.160 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:43.326 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: It's a chelator.

00:53:43.326 --> 00:53:44.770 align:middle line:90%
It binds to heavy metals.

00:53:44.770 --> 00:53:46.957 align:middle line:90%
But it's also a vasodilator.

00:53:46.957 --> 00:53:48.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:50.560 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: So it's kept
literally thousands of people

00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:53.150 align:middle line:84%
from having to have open heart
surgery, tens of thousands.

00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:53.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:53:53.450 --> 00:53:54.560 align:middle line:90%
Say it again?

00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:56.195 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: EDTA.

00:53:56.195 --> 00:53:57.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
can find that online?

00:53:57.820 --> 00:53:59.560 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: That's available
on Vitalife as well.

00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:00.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:05.110 align:middle line:84%
So you invested yourself and
put some of your own resources

00:54:05.110 --> 00:54:06.445 align:middle line:90%
behind some of these products.

00:54:06.445 --> 00:54:07.570 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: Oh, absolutely.

00:54:07.570 --> 00:54:08.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, because
they're the ones

00:54:08.590 --> 00:54:09.970 align:middle line:84%
you found most
effective, I take it.

00:54:09.970 --> 00:54:10.770 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: Yeah.

00:54:10.770 --> 00:54:14.410 align:middle line:84%
And I know that everyone is
so tired of the product game,

00:54:14.410 --> 00:54:15.670 align:middle line:90%
but they have to understand--

00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:16.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We don't
like being sold to.

00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:17.710 align:middle line:90%
We're sick of it.

00:54:17.710 --> 00:54:20.800 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: But if you
have an object, which

00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:24.550 align:middle line:84%
is your human body, it needs
to have the oil changed.

00:54:24.550 --> 00:54:26.110 align:middle line:90%
It needs the air filter cleaned.

00:54:26.110 --> 00:54:29.350 align:middle line:84%
We need to understand that a
certain amount of our money

00:54:29.350 --> 00:54:30.560 align:middle line:90%
needs to go towards these.

00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:33.300 align:middle line:84%
And I can help people sort
through, with a budget,

00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:35.830 align:middle line:84%
help them juggle what
should I prioritize,

00:54:35.830 --> 00:54:38.180 align:middle line:84%
because we can't
be on everything.

00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And the NuVision really
does a brilliant job

00:54:40.030 --> 00:54:42.100 align:middle line:90%
of helping to prioritize that.

00:54:42.100 --> 00:54:45.280 align:middle line:84%
We don't want necessarily the
latest product dujour just

00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:46.510 align:middle line:90%
because it's cool.

00:54:46.510 --> 00:54:48.310 align:middle line:84%
We want it because
we need it now.

00:54:48.310 --> 00:54:50.879 align:middle line:90%


00:54:50.879 --> 00:54:52.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm going
to kind of go off

00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:54.970 align:middle line:84%
on a tangent for
just a moment here,

00:54:54.970 --> 00:54:57.370 align:middle line:90%
because it just popped up.

00:54:57.370 --> 00:54:59.080 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:01.582 align:middle line:84%
So NuVision scans
tells you everything.

00:55:01.582 --> 00:55:03.040 align:middle line:84%
It tells you what
you could die of,

00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:04.810 align:middle line:84%
but it's going to tell
you the solutions,

00:55:04.810 --> 00:55:07.450 align:middle line:90%
and what your trajectory is.

00:55:07.450 --> 00:55:09.400 align:middle line:90%
But, also, then the way back.

00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:11.380 align:middle line:84%
So we can rebalance
our health back out.

00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:13.840 align:middle line:84%
What about you were talking
about the mind-body connection

00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:14.640 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:16.857 align:middle line:84%
Some people don't do
well with having images

00:55:16.857 --> 00:55:18.940 align:middle line:84%
put in their head of what
they're going to die of,

00:55:18.940 --> 00:55:21.481 align:middle line:84%
even if you're telling them they
have the solution right here

00:55:21.481 --> 00:55:22.450 align:middle line:90%
in front of them.

00:55:22.450 --> 00:55:25.030 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that when you're
working with certain people,

00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:26.800 align:middle line:84%
you assess their
personality type

00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:29.404 align:middle line:84%
and say they don't need to have
that picture in their head.

00:55:29.404 --> 00:55:30.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
tell them you're

00:55:30.820 --> 00:55:32.430 align:middle line:90%
going to benefit from this.

00:55:32.430 --> 00:55:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And this could avoid
this general area.

00:55:34.450 --> 00:55:35.630 align:middle line:90%
Do you do that with people?

00:55:35.630 --> 00:55:36.490 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: Oh, absolutely.

00:55:36.490 --> 00:55:37.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK Good.

00:55:37.210 --> 00:55:37.690 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:55:37.690 --> 00:55:38.920 align:middle line:84%
Because some people
really don't want

00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:39.290 align:middle line:90%
know what's under the skin.

00:55:39.290 --> 00:55:41.620 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Most people
don't to see the screen

00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:43.510 align:middle line:90%
because it's overwhelming.

00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we all
have less junk in this.

00:55:45.670 --> 00:55:48.490 align:middle line:84%
You have four-year-old
cancer patients.

00:55:48.490 --> 00:55:49.840 align:middle line:90%
We all have it in us.

00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:53.770 align:middle line:84%
I think we need to understand
our spirit must be pretty darn

00:55:53.770 --> 00:55:58.030 align:middle line:84%
strong to be able to have to
somehow continue animating us

00:55:58.030 --> 00:56:03.790 align:middle line:84%
through this onslaught of
really death-oriented toxins.

00:56:03.790 --> 00:56:07.240 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Well, let's remember
what the entire goal of life,

00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:09.280 align:middle line:84%
no matter what
that life is, it's

00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:12.280 align:middle line:90%
to survive and to procreate.

00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:13.780 align:middle line:90%
We are doing the same thing.

00:56:13.780 --> 00:56:16.990 align:middle line:84%
Those of us who are going
to move humanity forward,

00:56:16.990 --> 00:56:18.610 align:middle line:90%
we're modifying.

00:56:18.610 --> 00:56:19.960 align:middle line:90%
Our DNA is changing.

00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:21.750 align:middle line:84%
And we're becoming
more resilient even

00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:24.160 align:middle line:84%
in the onslaught
of these chemicals.

00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:25.150 align:middle line:90%
And you know why?

00:56:25.150 --> 00:56:26.950 align:middle line:84%
Because we have the
will and because we

00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:28.820 align:middle line:90%
have the spirit behind us.

00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to make
it, but if you don't have

00:56:32.050 --> 00:56:34.432 align:middle line:90%
that attitude, you may not.

00:56:34.432 --> 00:56:35.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
really important.

00:56:35.890 --> 00:56:37.330 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: So,
that is important.

00:56:37.330 --> 00:56:38.980 align:middle line:84%
When we say we
put our foot down.

00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:40.510 align:middle line:90%
And we say, I love it here.

00:56:40.510 --> 00:56:42.530 align:middle line:84%
And I love the
people in my life.

00:56:42.530 --> 00:56:43.690 align:middle line:90%
And I love my experiences.

00:56:43.690 --> 00:56:46.407 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like them to continue
for a little bit longer,

00:56:46.407 --> 00:56:48.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do what it
takes to make that happen.

00:56:48.490 --> 00:56:49.364 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:56:49.364 --> 00:56:51.580 align:middle line:84%
And just the sheer
fact that you have

00:56:51.580 --> 00:56:55.550 align:middle line:84%
that spirit that that's alive
itself will animate the body.

00:56:55.550 --> 00:56:56.664 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: Absolutely.

00:56:56.664 --> 00:56:58.330 align:middle line:84%
And the answers will
be provided for us.

00:56:58.330 --> 00:56:59.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
answers will be provided.

00:56:59.550 --> 00:57:01.170 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Sounds
corny, but it's true.

00:57:01.170 --> 00:57:02.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We see
miracles every day.

00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:03.310 align:middle line:90%
They're not miracles.

00:57:03.310 --> 00:57:04.320 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
spirit is capable of.

00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:04.840 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: But
there's something

00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:06.710 align:middle line:84%
deeper that I'd like
to get to for a second.

00:57:06.710 --> 00:57:06.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:07.540 align:middle line:90%
And we have about a second.

00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:09.730 align:middle line:84%
>>STREETER: Us in our
spirit as individuals

00:57:09.730 --> 00:57:12.640 align:middle line:84%
and as a collective, we
are becoming modified,

00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:13.720 align:middle line:90%
we're becoming malleable.

00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And where we're still
strong and resilient,

00:57:15.550 --> 00:57:18.100 align:middle line:84%
but we're learning how to
bend around this monster

00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:21.455 align:middle line:84%
and how to beat
it by withdrawing.

00:57:21.455 --> 00:57:22.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm
really big, unplug.

00:57:22.830 --> 00:57:23.996 align:middle line:90%
>>STREETER: Don't engage it.

00:57:23.996 --> 00:57:25.219 align:middle line:90%
Don't engage it.

00:57:25.219 --> 00:57:27.010 align:middle line:84%
When you have free
time, get out in nature.

00:57:27.010 --> 00:57:27.940 align:middle line:90%
Go do some yoga.

00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:28.740 align:middle line:90%
Meditate.

00:57:28.740 --> 00:57:30.100 align:middle line:90%
Go sit by a river.

00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:30.970 align:middle line:90%
Play with animals.

00:57:30.970 --> 00:57:33.880 align:middle line:90%
Get some sun.

00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:36.130 align:middle line:10%
That's where the
charge, the recharge,

00:57:36.130 --> 00:57:39.940 align:middle line:10%
comes from so that we can
continue to withdraw from them

00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:41.620 align:middle line:10%
and not have it be
a head on battle,

00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:44.060 align:middle line:10%
because that's a
difficult one with them.

00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:45.820 align:middle line:10%
That's the one they know.

00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:48.490 align:middle line:10%
But when we withdraw, and we
win with heart and intelligence

00:57:48.490 --> 00:57:53.020 align:middle line:10%
and spirit and technology,
then that's pretty cool.

00:57:53.020 --> 00:57:56.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and it ups our
voltage on top of all of that.

00:57:56.230 --> 00:57:57.470 align:middle line:90%
You're absolutely right.

00:57:57.470 --> 00:57:59.780 align:middle line:90%
I could not have said it better.

00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:01.900 align:middle line:90%
And so on that, our time is up.

00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And I'll guide people
over to your website,

00:58:04.580 --> 00:58:06.580 align:middle line:84%
so they can start exploring
this if they want to

00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:07.496 align:middle line:90%
on a journey with you.

00:58:07.496 --> 00:58:10.330 align:middle line:84%
But I really
appreciate the number

00:58:10.330 --> 00:58:11.860 align:middle line:84%
of years and the
level of commitment

00:58:11.860 --> 00:58:14.170 align:middle line:84%
you've had to helping
all the rest of us

00:58:14.170 --> 00:58:16.690 align:middle line:84%
find ways that we don't
have to be afraid of what's

00:58:16.690 --> 00:58:17.560 align:middle line:90%
happened to us.

00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:20.650 align:middle line:84%
We can find our way out of it as
long as we keep our spirits up,

00:58:20.650 --> 00:58:21.610 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:58:21.610 --> 00:58:22.465 align:middle line:90%
