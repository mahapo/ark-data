00:00:19.157 --> 00:00:20.990 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: By
now, much of the world

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.660 align:middle line:10%
has heard about the phenomenal
archaeological site of Gobekli

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.460 align:middle line:10%
Tepe.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.770 align:middle line:10%
But did you know that
there was a sister site

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.460 align:middle line:10%
that our guest today,
Andrew Collins,

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.620 align:middle line:10%
feels may have been the seat of
the biblical rendering of Adam

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:33.420 align:middle line:10%
and Eve.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.640 align:middle line:10%
It's called Karahan Tepe,
located in Turkey as well, not

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.440 align:middle line:10%
that far away from Gobekli.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.347 align:middle line:10%
"Tepai," "Tepee," "Tepeh?"

00:00:41.347 --> 00:00:42.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW COLLINS:
"Tom-ah-to," tomato.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:43.847 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tomato, yes.

00:00:43.847 --> 00:00:46.470 align:middle line:84%
No one knows how to pronounce
it, except the Turkish people.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:47.370 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Andrew.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.620 align:middle line:84%
I have not been sitting
with you-- well, gosh,

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.860 align:middle line:84%
I think since we were in
London a number of years ago.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.008 align:middle line:84%
And what I thought
I'd do is just pick up

00:00:55.008 --> 00:00:56.550 align:middle line:84%
a little thread of
that conversation.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.800 align:middle line:84%
For anyone who wants to
go back into the archives,

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.730 align:middle line:84%
look into our
previous conversation,

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.510 align:middle line:84%
they'll see where we came or you
came from the story of Cygnus.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.300 align:middle line:84%
So we're just going to do
a brief sketch of Cygnus,

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.690 align:middle line:84%
and it's importance to this
story and then move into it.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.260 align:middle line:10%
>>COLLINS: Well, I mean,
Cygnus is a constellation.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.170 align:middle line:10%
And as a sky figure, it's
usually seen as a bird.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.660 align:middle line:10%
In the Near East and
Anatolia, modern day Turkey,

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.140 align:middle line:10%
it was a vulture.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.800 align:middle line:10%
In other parts of the world,
it was a swan or a goose.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.920 align:middle line:10%
Over here in the States, it was
generally the turkey, vulture,

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.570 align:middle line:10%
or the eagle, or a hawk.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.320 align:middle line:10%
And in other words,
it was the bird

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.990 align:middle line:10%
that was associated
with the human soul

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.170 align:middle line:10%
and the transmigration of the
soul in any part of the world.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.090 align:middle line:10%
And so Cygnus
represented not only

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.240 align:middle line:10%
that transmigration of
the soul, but the point

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.770 align:middle line:10%
of entry into the sky world.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why it became so
is because of its very specific

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.110 align:middle line:84%
placement on the Milky Way,
the edge of our own Milky Way

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.980 align:middle line:90%
galaxy that's around us.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's at a spot where the
Milky Way breaks into two

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.530 align:middle line:84%
due to this dark line that
goes through the middle, known

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.070 align:middle line:90%
as the Dark Rift.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.650 align:middle line:84%
The importance about this
is that this spot was seen

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.450 align:middle line:84%
as the point of entry into the
sky world, probably for 15,

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.200 align:middle line:90%
20,000 years.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And these ideas, it would seem,
were retained by the ancient

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.660 align:middle line:84%
peoples down to the time of
Karahan Tepi and Gobekli Tepe

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.090 align:middle line:84%
sometime around
11,500 years ago,

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.810 align:middle line:84%
which is why we see so many
images of vultures on the stones

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.770 align:middle line:84%
at these sites, because it
was their symbol of the soul,

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:55.300 align:middle line:84%
and of transmuting from a
base level into a pure state

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.690 align:middle line:90%
of being, basically.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.027 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's what
all of the ancients--

00:02:59.027 --> 00:03:00.860 align:middle line:84%
then we have to remember,
back in this time,

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.920 align:middle line:84%
there was very advanced
spiritual technology, as well as

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.830 align:middle line:90%
other technologies.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.190 align:middle line:84%
So they were bringing this
connection with the cosmos

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.800 align:middle line:90%
through.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And so that would show
up in the ancient sites

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:10.627 align:middle line:90%
and their orientation.

00:03:10.627 --> 00:03:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what the
book on Cygnus was a lot about,

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.792 align:middle line:90%
was that orientation.

00:03:15.792 --> 00:03:21.320 align:middle line:84%
So let's go to your discovery
of Karahan, because most of us

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.980 align:middle line:90%
didn't know anything about it.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.760 align:middle line:84%
We only heard of
Gobekli, and what

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.800 align:middle line:84%
you were looking for when
you went there, initially.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.600 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yeah.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.392 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When did you
first hear about it?

00:03:31.392 --> 00:03:32.820 align:middle line:90%
And so how did this come about?

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.500 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Well, I
was in Turkey in 2004.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.350 align:middle line:10%
It was just after the
publication of a book of mine,

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.980 align:middle line:10%
called From the Ashes of
Angels, which basically looked

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.710 align:middle line:10%
at the idea of all of
the mythical beings

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.870 align:middle line:10%
from the different
traditions of the Near East,

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.790 align:middle line:10%
from Sumerian, from Babylonian,
and Hebrew, with names,

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.370 align:middle line:10%
such as the Watchers, the
Nephilim, the Anunnaki.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.280 align:middle line:84%
And what I suggested
was that they

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.450 align:middle line:84%
were a memory of the prime
movers behind the foundation

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.820 align:middle line:84%
of civilization in
Southeast Turkey

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.510 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the last Ice Age.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.280 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
book basically said.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.540 align:middle line:84%
It was eventually
published in Turkey,

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.480 align:middle line:84%
and that allowed me to
go out there in 2004.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.620 align:middle line:84%
And whilst I was there,
I visited Gobekli Tepe

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.950 align:middle line:90%
for the first time.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.260 align:middle line:10%
And I was there, and I was
told about this other site that

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.800 align:middle line:10%
had just been discovered,
called Karahan.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.180 align:middle line:10%
And it was in the
remote Tektek Mountains,

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.660 align:middle line:10%
which is about 25 miles
away from Gobekli.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And I saw a photograph
of a T-shaped pillar,

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.410 align:middle line:84%
very similar to the
T-shaped pillars

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.650 align:middle line:84%
that you find in all of the
stone enclosures at Gobekli.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, this is clearly
part of the same culture.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.390 align:middle line:90%
I need to find this.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:54.570 align:middle line:84%
So just two days later, I was
scouring the Tektek Mountains

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.607 align:middle line:84%
with a driver and
an interpreter.

00:04:56.607 --> 00:04:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And nobody seemed to know
where the hell this place was.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No GPS
for it at that time.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.260 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: But eventually,
we did find it.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And we came to this farmhouse,
and this little boy came out.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.380 align:middle line:84%
An interpreter spoke
to him, and he just

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.030 align:middle line:84%
pointed towards this
hill towards the south.

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.380 align:middle line:90%
And we walked towards it.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.580 align:middle line:84%
And on the ground were a few
stone tools to start with.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.850 align:middle line:84%
But the closer we got
to it, the more and more

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.780 align:middle line:84%
of these stone tools
were everywhere.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And I'd seen something similar
on the approach to Gobekli.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.980 align:middle line:84%
So I knew that this was a
site as old as Gobekli Tepe.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.120 align:middle line:84%
And as we got
closer, we also saw,

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.765 align:middle line:84%
sticking out of the ground,
the heads of T-shaped pillars

00:05:34.765 --> 00:05:36.430 align:middle line:90%
just about visible.

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.710 align:middle line:84%
Plus, there were
fragments of what

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.280 align:middle line:84%
are known as porthole
windows, which

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:49.600 align:middle line:84%
are like these square or
oblong-carved fragments, which

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.050 align:middle line:84%
were entrances into
enclosures that have now gone.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.740 align:middle line:84%
And yet, the strange thing
is that these fragments

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.650 align:middle line:84%
look like they could have come
off of a medieval building.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.840 align:middle line:90%
They were so advanced.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.050 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
somewhere underneath here

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:09.590 align:middle line:84%
was a complex that was
similar to Gobekli Tepe.

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.210 align:middle line:84%
So I started calling it the
sister site of Gobekli Tepe.

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.320 align:middle line:90%
I started to write about it.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.190 align:middle line:84%
I visited it on
various occasions.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:22.100 align:middle line:84%
And the family that
lived in that farmhouse

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.210 align:middle line:90%
grew to love me as a person.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:25.010 align:middle line:90%
I would go there.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.950 align:middle line:84%
I researched every
single part of it.

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.930 align:middle line:84%
And then in 2018,
I heard that they

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.220 align:middle line:84%
were about to start
excavations there.

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.043 align:middle line:90%
And I wasn't--

00:06:36.043 --> 00:06:38.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Who was supposed
to start the excavations?

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:39.160 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: The excavations--

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was it by
the Turkish government?

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:41.350 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yeah.

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:46.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, but they'd been given
to the University of Istanbul

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:50.200 align:middle line:84%
under the leadership of
Nesmee Carroll, a very

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.800 align:middle line:90%
well-known archaeologist.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.580 align:middle line:84%
In the following year,
2019, excavations began.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.970 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, we weren't
able to go there because

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:03.310 align:middle line:84%
of the lockdowns, until 2021,
when they finally revealed

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:04.700 align:middle line:90%
what they'd found there.

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And when I saw the pictures,
I thought, oh my God.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.140 align:middle line:84%
It was virtually a city
that they'd now uncovered.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.140 align:middle line:84%
And the pictures of it
were just breathtaking.

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.410 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that I
just had to get out there

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:18.860 align:middle line:90%
as soon as possible.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.540 align:middle line:84%
But I was able to examine
some of the overhead images

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:23.840 align:middle line:90%
of the site.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And I started to
realize immediately

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.420 align:middle line:84%
that there were astronomical
alignments here.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.100 align:middle line:10%
And that was really
the beginning

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.860 align:middle line:10%
of the book, Katahan
Tepe, which is

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.350 align:middle line:10%
the one you were talking about.

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:39.467 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And one of the things
that strikes me is, here, you're

00:07:39.467 --> 00:07:41.050 align:middle line:10%
poking around these
mountains, and you

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:43.300 align:middle line:10%
come across a farmhouse
and a family, who

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.360 align:middle line:10%
are the only gatekeepers because
they're the only ones that

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.800 align:middle line:10%
know about it.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's so often the case on
these magnificent discoveries.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.160 align:middle line:84%
It's just, someone
is like, oh, yeah.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.180 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's over there,
if someone happens

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.320 align:middle line:90%
to pop by with some curiosity.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.337 align:middle line:90%
So here we are.

00:07:59.337 --> 00:08:00.920 align:middle line:84%
You've become friends
with the family.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:04.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you went
there, you were not

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:07.940 align:middle line:84%
greeted in an inviting
way at one point.

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.350 align:middle line:84%
There was military and
there were machine guns.

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:12.870 align:middle line:84%
So let's get into this because
this seems to be the case.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:15.852 align:middle line:84%
Everything special has
machine guns surrounding it.

00:08:15.852 --> 00:08:17.310 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Yeah,
I mean, it's true.

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:19.970 align:middle line:90%
This was a couple of years ago.

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:23.540 align:middle line:84%
The archaeologists had just
discovered a brand new enclosure

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:25.820 align:middle line:90%
on the very top of the hill.

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.470 align:middle line:84%
And clearly, this was going
to be of great importance.

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:31.640 align:middle line:84%
But what we didn't know at
the moment that we went up

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.770 align:middle line:84%
there and were
suddenly confronted

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:37.740 align:middle line:90%
by a guard in full military--

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:38.659 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:42.180 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: --dress,
holding this machine gun--

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:42.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:44.820 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: --and
saying, no photos.

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:46.280 align:middle line:90%
No photos.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.760 align:middle line:90%
And just repeating this.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.280 align:middle line:84%
And we're thinking,
what's going on here?

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:54.900 align:middle line:84%
What we didn't know is
that sitting within a box

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:58.860 align:middle line:84%
that they covered in wood, so
you couldn't see what was going

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:03.020 align:middle line:84%
on, was this huge
statue that was 7.5

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:05.680 align:middle line:90%
feet tall in a seated position.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.270 align:middle line:90%
It was actually on a bench.

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:10.570 align:middle line:84%
So if you stood
it up, as it were,

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:12.190 align:middle line:90%
it would be about 9 feet tall.

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:13.510 align:middle line:90%
It was a giant.

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And it was a figure,
which was, arguably,

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:22.570 align:middle line:84%
the oldest image of a human
anywhere in the world.

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And they just uncovered
it when myself

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:26.970 align:middle line:84%
and my colleague,
Hugh Newman, got up

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:29.290 align:middle line:90%
there and saw all of this.

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:31.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, obviously, we
saw the enclosure.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.580 align:middle line:84%
We didn't actually
take any photographs,

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:35.550 align:middle line:84%
but we went away
and drew what we

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:38.250 align:middle line:84%
saw because we realized
something incredible was

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:40.200 align:middle line:90%
going on here.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:44.820 align:middle line:84%
And I can understand why
they were trying to protect

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:45.990 align:middle line:90%
what they'd just discovered.

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:50.500 align:middle line:84%
Because, firstly, they have had
problems with treasure hunters.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, it's terrible
in that part of the world.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:53.550 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yeah.

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:57.760 align:middle line:84%
But the other reason, of course,
is the release of information.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:01.160 align:middle line:84%
The Turkish government,
the Turkish archaeologists

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.760 align:middle line:84%
want to be, in many
ways, the sole people

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:06.890 align:middle line:84%
that bring these stories
to the general public.

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:10.000 align:middle line:84%
But that night, I made
inquiries with a few contacts

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.640 align:middle line:84%
that I know in the
archaeological world in Turkey.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:17.380 align:middle line:84%
And they told us what
had actually been found.

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, at
this point, we're

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:23.590 align:middle line:84%
trying to imagine exactly what--
we're not even seeing pictures

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:25.210 align:middle line:90%
of it, remember.

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:27.980 align:middle line:84%
We had to wait until
a couple of weeks,

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.100 align:middle line:84%
and then finally,
it was released

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.120 align:middle line:90%
within the international media.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And we saw the statue
for the first time.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.260 align:middle line:90%
And it's extraordinary.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Explain to us
the features of the statue.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:42.250 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Well, the statue
has this huge head, much larger

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:44.290 align:middle line:90%
than a normal human head.

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:47.440 align:middle line:90%
It's got ears with holes in it.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:51.620 align:middle line:84%
But as you go lower down,
the hands of this gentleman,

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:55.280 align:middle line:84%
as it is, definitely a
gentleman, is touching or almost

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.938 align:middle line:90%
holding his phallus.

00:10:57.938 --> 00:10:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And we'll come on
to the significance

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.690 align:middle line:90%
of that in a moment.

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:02.760 align:middle line:84%
But, I mean,
everything was there.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:07.550 align:middle line:84%
This was one of the most
perfect images of a human

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:10.500 align:middle line:90%
from the prehistoric age.

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we knew that
this was 11,000 years old.

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:17.250 align:middle line:84%
And trying to
understand this, I knew,

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:20.300 align:middle line:84%
would occupy my
mind for many months

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:24.020 align:middle line:84%
ahead here, as we tried to
understand not only what

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:25.890 align:middle line:84%
the archaeologists
were saying about it,

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:27.890 align:middle line:90%
but how we could interpret it.

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing
that we know is

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.980 align:middle line:84%
that the memory of the prime
movers behind the creation

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:38.750 align:middle line:84%
of Gobekli Tepe and Karahan
Tepe are remembered in myth

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:40.500 align:middle line:90%
as the Anunnaki.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:43.160 align:middle line:84%
This is the term
that's used in Sumerian

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.200 align:middle line:90%
and Babylonian tradition.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.970 align:middle line:90%
And so who are the Anunnaki?

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:50.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, some of my
colleagues would

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:54.900 align:middle line:84%
like to see them, obviously,
as space beings coming down

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:59.040 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of thousands of years
ago and creating humanity to--

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But Sitchin put
them at 400,000 years ago.

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:02.105 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Of course.

00:12:02.105 --> 00:12:05.550 align:middle line:84%
But for me, having
read the Sumerian texts

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:08.710 align:middle line:84%
and the Babylonian texts,
it suggests something else.

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:12.550 align:middle line:84%
It suggests that these
gods, these mythical beings,

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:16.380 align:middle line:84%
were possibly flesh and
blood and were the founders

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:20.730 align:middle line:84%
of civilization, because all the
accounts talk about them giving

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:24.910 align:middle line:84%
us, mortal kind, the
rudiments of civilization,

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:32.500 align:middle line:84%
including animal husbandry,
agriculture, the first cities,

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:34.450 align:middle line:84%
they helped us build
the first cities.

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:38.280 align:middle line:84%
So they don't seem to
be space beings to me.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:42.570 align:middle line:84%
And even Klaus Schmidt, the
discoverer of Gobekli Tepe,

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:47.220 align:middle line:84%
in the book he wrote
under this name in 2012,

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.710 align:middle line:84%
he actually wrote in
there that the Anunnaki

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:52.390 align:middle line:84%
were, most certainly,
the memory of those

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:53.800 align:middle line:90%
that created Gobekli Tepe.

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.940 align:middle line:90%
And I think that he was correct.

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And I think that this statue
is our first true image

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:02.710 align:middle line:90%
of what Anunnaki looked like.

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:03.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: As flesh and blood.

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:05.180 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: As flesh and blood.

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:09.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because if you go
back into the various writings

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:11.830 align:middle line:84%
about Atlantis-- and,
of course, all we have

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:15.760 align:middle line:84%
are the famous ones pass
through Plato, and Critias,

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:16.780 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:18.140 align:middle line:90%
Most people have read those.

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:21.190 align:middle line:84%
But then we also
have an emerging body

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:23.920 align:middle line:84%
of work over the
centuries of people

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.770 align:middle line:84%
who can travel back in
time and have remembrances.

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:29.420 align:middle line:84%
Because every place we've
ever been stored in the aura.

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:32.030 align:middle line:84%
So it's natural we should
be able to start tapping in.

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And people of that
kind of stature

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:36.557 align:middle line:90%
were common in Atlantean times.

00:13:36.557 --> 00:13:37.640 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: That's correct.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:44.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so we can assume
if Atlantis supposedly sunk

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:49.700 align:middle line:84%
around 12,000 some years ago,
and now we're looking 100 years

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:51.660 align:middle line:90%
after that roughly, right?

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:52.658 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yeah.

00:13:52.658 --> 00:13:54.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It seems
like we're looking

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.870 align:middle line:84%
at beings who made
it off and were

00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:00.140 align:middle line:84%
able to help reseed
civilization, which

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.670 align:middle line:84%
became the basis of
civilization for the Sumerians.

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed you didn't
mention Egypt in there.

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:07.908 align:middle line:84%
This is a different
sect, different body.

00:14:07.908 --> 00:14:10.200 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: There's a direct
links between Gobekli Tepe.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:13.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even Klaus Schmidt,
the discoverer of Gobekli,

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:19.640 align:middle line:84%
he wrote a paper pointing
out the clear relationship

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:21.500 align:middle line:84%
between the stone
tools that were

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:24.170 align:middle line:84%
being used by the
people at Gobekli Tepe

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:30.230 align:middle line:84%
and those at a site within sight
of the Great Pyramid at a place

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:34.460 align:middle line:84%
called Helwan at the same time,
particularly a type of tool

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:36.150 align:middle line:90%
called the Helwan point.

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:42.470 align:middle line:84%
And he basically said that it's
quite clear that whoever founded

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:47.940 align:middle line:84%
Helwan either came from
the area of Gobekli Tepe

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:50.550 align:middle line:84%
or there was obviously
some, either,

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:53.075 align:middle line:84%
direct or indirect
trading going on.

00:14:53.075 --> 00:14:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And I find this incredibly
interesting because, obviously,

00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:00.610 align:middle line:84%
there are so many traditions
that suggest that the pyramids,

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:03.970 align:middle line:84%
the Sphinx have very early
foundations going back

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:04.770 align:middle line:90%
to 2,000--

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:06.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very early.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:07.760 align:middle line:90%
And even earlier.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:08.560 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yeah.

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.740 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, there
is almost certainly

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:14.580 align:middle line:84%
going to be a link between
the protoforms of what

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:18.840 align:middle line:84%
would eventually become those
pyramids and the Gobekli Tepe

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.260 align:middle line:90%
civilization.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.880 align:middle line:84%
And as I said,
the stone tools, I

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.240 align:middle line:84%
know that doesn't sound very
important to most people,

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.115 align:middle line:84%
but that's the thing
that tells us that there

00:15:27.115 --> 00:15:29.580 align:middle line:90%
was a direct link or--

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:31.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Of these cultures
existing simultaneously.

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:32.730 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yeah.

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:34.660 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
that the same ideas,

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:38.370 align:middle line:84%
the same cosmology, the
same idea of astronomy

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:41.730 align:middle line:84%
that could be found at
Gobekli Tepe and Karahan Tepe

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:45.420 align:middle line:84%
are also present in
Egypt at the same time,

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:48.790 align:middle line:84%
and that they will
then linger in Egypt

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:52.420 align:middle line:84%
and be behind the construction
of the Great Pyramid

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:55.510 align:middle line:84%
and, obviously,
the Sphinx as well.

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:58.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, going back
to Turkey in this region,

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:02.500 align:middle line:84%
so this is an incredibly
important region and discovery

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:08.860 align:middle line:84%
because it's the reseeding of
technological, intelligent life

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:11.260 align:middle line:90%
after the great deluge.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And so you have woven in the
Adam and Eve story to this.

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:21.120 align:middle line:84%
So that would have to
be post-deluge as well.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.900 align:middle line:84%
That particular
sect of humanity.

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.520 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.270 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Well, we're
talking, obviously,

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:29.920 align:middle line:84%
about the Book of Genesis, the
first book of the Old Testament

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:34.630 align:middle line:84%
and the stories that it
tells about Adam and Eve.

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And, obviously, the
deluge, I think,

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:40.210 align:middle line:84%
is a memory of what's known
as the Younger Dryas event,

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:46.530 align:middle line:84%
which is this 1,200-year window
in human history that we know

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:50.590 align:middle line:84%
there was a mini ice age during
that time, but it was triggered,

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:52.780 align:middle line:84%
the latest evidence
would suggest,

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:56.890 align:middle line:84%
by fragments of a comet
entering the Earth's atmosphere,

00:16:56.890 --> 00:17:01.440 align:middle line:84%
exploding virtually on impact
and almost setting alight

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.970 align:middle line:84%
a large part of the
northern hemisphere,

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:07.230 align:middle line:84%
creating a period of darkness,
lowering the temperature,

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:10.170 align:middle line:90%
and causing this ice age.

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:12.875 align:middle line:84%
And this was not something that
all happened in one day either.

00:17:12.875 --> 00:17:15.000 align:middle line:84%
It would seem as if there
were similar events going

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.510 align:middle line:90%
on for hundreds of years.

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:20.589 align:middle line:84%
It was a terrible time for
humanity to have lived.

00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:26.200 align:middle line:84%
And the end of this Younger
Dryas period is around 9,600 BC,

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:29.250 align:middle line:84%
which, interestingly enough, is
the same date that Plato tells

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:34.480 align:middle line:84%
us that, finally, the last
parts of Atlantis sunk.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.680 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: And that can
be explained as well.

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:42.850 align:middle line:84%
But that's when Gobekli Tepe
is founded, at that exact date,

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:44.470 align:middle line:90%
9,600 BC.

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:45.670 align:middle line:90%
It's not a coincidence.

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:46.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:51.320 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: And so firstly, yes,
that deluge, which, by the way,

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.540 align:middle line:84%
in other Hebrew
myths and legends,

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:56.630 align:middle line:84%
doesn't just talk
about a time of water,

00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:58.630 align:middle line:84%
floods, and Noah and
whatever, it also

00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:02.030 align:middle line:84%
says that, at the same time,
fire rained down from the sky.

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And that the floods
cleared away the fire.

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:06.070 align:middle line:90%
That's what it virtually says.

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:07.445 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
it was cinders.

00:18:07.445 --> 00:18:08.590 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yes, yeah.

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:11.210 align:middle line:84%
So all of this is
happening around that time.

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:14.860 align:middle line:10%
But let's talk about the Garden
of Eden, and Adam and Eve,

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:18.010 align:middle line:10%
and, of course, the
serpent, because we

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:21.350 align:middle line:10%
know that Eden itself
was a real place.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:24.320 align:middle line:10%
And although it seems to
have shifted around the map,

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:28.650 align:middle line:10%
the original Eden was in the
area of Southeastern and Eastern

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:29.450 align:middle line:10%
Turkey.

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:33.070 align:middle line:10%
And we know that because
it's said that, from there,

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:37.220 align:middle line:10%
the four rivers of
paradise took their rise.

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:39.100 align:middle line:10%
And two of those
rivers are easily

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:43.150 align:middle line:10%
identified as the
Euphrates and the Tigris.

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:47.030 align:middle line:10%
The other two can be
identified as the Oxus River

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:50.810 align:middle line:10%
that flows eastwards into the
Caspian Sea and the Greater Zab

00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:54.020 align:middle line:10%
River that's been recognized
as the fourth river of paradise

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:56.100 align:middle line:10%
for at least 2000 years.

00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:59.970 align:middle line:10%
And all of these rise
in Eastern Turkey.

00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:02.330 align:middle line:10%
So we've got the right area.

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:07.020 align:middle line:10%
And this area has the
memory that it is Eden.

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And the strongest
of these stories

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:12.180 align:middle line:84%
comes from Sanliurfa, which
is the very ancient city

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:14.240 align:middle line:90%
right by Gobekli Tepe.

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And the oldest name of
Sanliurfa was Adama,

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.820 align:middle line:90%
which means the place of Adam.

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And it was said that it was
here that God placed down

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:29.012 align:middle line:84%
the soul of Adam and made his
body from the local red Earth.

00:19:29.012 --> 00:19:31.220 align:middle line:84%
Because Adam just means red
Earth, basically, anyway.

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:32.595 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
genetic material.

00:19:32.595 --> 00:19:36.150 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: And that, obviously,
there was the garden there.

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:38.190 align:middle line:90%
Eve was created as well.

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And they all live happily,
until this serpent

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:43.980 align:middle line:84%
comes along and says,
eat of that tree there.

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:48.810 align:middle line:84%
So they do so and they realize
their innocence, they're naked,

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:50.610 align:middle line:84%
and God throws
them out, lest they

00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:54.790 align:middle line:84%
eat of the other tree, which is
a tree of life and live forever.

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:58.480 align:middle line:84%
So they're then thrown
out onto the local plain.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:02.490 align:middle line:10%
Now, this is the story that's
actually told to this day

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:04.330 align:middle line:10%
by the people of Sanliurfa.

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:07.450 align:middle line:10%
And they say that they went
on to the nearby Harran plain,

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:09.160 align:middle line:10%
and they started
tilling the land,

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:11.050 align:middle line:10%
but they didn't
know what to use.

00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And Eve opened her hand and
said, oh, what about using this.

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:17.910 align:middle line:84%
And it was a stalk of wheat that
she'd apparently brought out

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:20.020 align:middle line:90%
of paradise, of course.

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:22.620 align:middle line:90%
And so they till the land.

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:26.110 align:middle line:84%
And the first few years,
they get very little yield.

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:27.430 align:middle line:90%
But then a bull comes along.

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:30.280 align:middle line:84%
They realize they can use
this bull to plow the land.

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:33.190 align:middle line:84%
So they do that, and the yield
increases and they're all happy.

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:36.400 align:middle line:84%
And it said that thereafter,
and this is the local legend,

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.700 align:middle line:84%
that they kissed the
bull on the forehead

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:40.660 align:middle line:90%
every year to give thanks.

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:43.630 align:middle line:90%
You think, what is all this?

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:47.800 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, the bull simply
represents the land itself.

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:51.980 align:middle line:84%
In Anatolian tradition, to
this day, the land is a bull,

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:54.290 align:middle line:84%
and every time the bull
moves, you get earthquakes,

00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:57.140 align:middle line:84%
you get thunderstorms,
you get volcanoes.

00:20:57.140 --> 00:21:00.940 align:middle line:84%
OK, so it basically means
just kissing the land itself.

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:03.710 align:middle line:84%
But then, of course,
we've got two things.

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:04.520 align:middle line:90%
The fruit.

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:05.540 align:middle line:90%
What is this fruit?

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:08.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, we assume it's
this nice rosy red apple.

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:09.650 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no, no.

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:14.020 align:middle line:84%
The original word
means fruit or seed

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:17.480 align:middle line:84%
and can relate to
a seed of wheat.

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:22.660 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, the original
fruit was probably wheat.

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:25.360 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
invention of agriculture.

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And, of course,
that brings what's

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:30.578 align:middle line:84%
known as a sedentary lifestyle
or an urban lifestyle,

00:21:30.578 --> 00:21:32.620 align:middle line:84%
where everybody has got
to live in the same place

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:35.120 align:middle line:84%
and do the same things
day in, day out.

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.890 align:middle line:84%
So that's your
loss of innocence,

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:39.460 align:middle line:84%
really, from the hunter
gatherer lifestyle

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:41.030 align:middle line:90%
that had previously existed.

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:42.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where you have to read
the land and live day-to-day,

00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:43.805 align:middle line:90%
rely, on your instincts.

00:21:43.805 --> 00:21:45.770 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Get up at a
certain time every day.

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:48.200 align:middle line:84%
Your children are
going to do that.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.850 align:middle line:84%
So that's the end of
Paradise, ultimately.

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:53.010 align:middle line:90%
But then who was this serpent?

00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And the serpent, I think,
is a memory of the serpent

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:01.740 align:middle line:84%
that I believe that the people
of Karahan Tepe in particular

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:03.000 align:middle line:90%
were venerating.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.690 align:middle line:84%
And the question then becomes,
what was this serpent?

00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:09.770 align:middle line:84%
And the answer to
that is, I think

00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:11.550 align:middle line:90%
it was the Milky Way itself.

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:15.380 align:middle line:84%
The alignments at Karahan
are very specifically

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:19.370 align:middle line:84%
towards the Milky Way,
and in particular, an area

00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:21.570 align:middle line:84%
that we know as
the Galactic Bulge.

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:24.980 align:middle line:84%
This is a very bright
area, it was almost

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:27.840 align:middle line:84%
like a light bulb
in ancient times,

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:32.210 align:middle line:84%
that marks for us what we
know today through science

00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:35.420 align:middle line:84%
is the center of our
own Milky Way galaxy.

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:38.940 align:middle line:84%
But in the past, it would
seemed like the head of a snake,

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:40.423 align:middle line:84%
with the rest of
the snake being--

00:22:40.423 --> 00:22:41.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Trailing it.

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:44.370 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Yeah, trailing behind
it as the Milky Way itself.

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:47.700 align:middle line:84%
So these people were
focusing their minds

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:52.320 align:middle line:84%
on the head of what we might
describe as a cosmic serpent.

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And I think that they
were involved in practices

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.200 align:middle line:84%
there, where they
would quite literally

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:01.170 align:middle line:84%
go into altered states and
possibly even possession,

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:04.980 align:middle line:84%
where they would be
possessed by this snake

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:08.410 align:middle line:84%
and be able to give
pronouncements.

00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And with this would
come knowledge, wisdom,

00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:15.700 align:middle line:84%
technological understanding,
innovations, et cetera,

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:17.700 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, and
cosmological ideas

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:20.830 align:middle line:84%
or so-called ontological
ideas, like who are we?

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:21.760 align:middle line:90%
Where do we come from?

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:22.560 align:middle line:90%
What is out there?

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:23.410 align:middle line:90%
What is God?

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:25.590 align:middle line:84%
All of these, I
think, were questions

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:29.290 align:middle line:84%
that the people of Karahan Tepe
were asking for the first time.

00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:32.830 align:middle line:84%
This ultimately is
this loss of innocence.

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:35.070 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
this serpent, which

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:38.740 align:middle line:84%
is remembered as the snake
in the Garden of Eden,

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:41.680 align:middle line:84%
was a memory of
all this knowledge

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:44.510 align:middle line:84%
being given to these
people for the first time.

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:47.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how did
that become bastardized?

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: I think it
became bastardized purely

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:55.870 align:middle line:84%
across periods of time where
ideas changed into more Orthodox

00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:58.130 align:middle line:90%
religions in that region.

00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:00.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are
two cities that

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:04.007 align:middle line:84%
were very important to the
descendancy of all of what

00:24:04.007 --> 00:24:05.090 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about there.

00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:08.030 align:middle line:84%
One is Sanliurfa for
itself, which, as I said,

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:09.560 align:middle line:90%
was anciently Adama.

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:12.350 align:middle line:84%
It was also known as
Edessa in the Bible.

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:14.570 align:middle line:84%
But the other one was
a place called Harran.

00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:18.050 align:middle line:84%
Harran was the center of
what we call Hermetica.

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:20.080 align:middle line:84%
The Hermetic tradition,
the tradition

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:21.740 align:middle line:90%
of Hermes Trismegistus.

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:24.550 align:middle line:84%
And this was all this incredible
knowledge and wisdom that

00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:26.390 align:middle line:90%
supposedly came out of Egypt.

00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And some of it did, but
some of it was homegrown.

00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:33.010 align:middle line:84%
It was from the area of
Gobekli Tepe and Karahan Tepe.

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:36.557 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And inherited from
previous Atlanteans or whomever.

00:24:36.557 --> 00:24:37.640 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yes, of course.

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And within this
was this knowledge

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:42.343 align:middle line:90%
of god in the form of a serpent.

00:24:42.343 --> 00:24:44.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, how did
they come up with that?

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:45.843 align:middle line:84%
Is it still because
they were aligning

00:24:45.843 --> 00:24:47.152 align:middle line:90%
this bright force in the sky?

00:24:47.152 --> 00:24:47.985 align:middle line:90%
It was so powerful--

00:24:47.985 --> 00:24:49.030 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yeah.

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:49.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:49.780 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: It was.

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:50.863 align:middle line:90%
But it was more than that.

00:24:50.863 --> 00:24:54.000 align:middle line:84%
Because by now, they had
this incredible understanding

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.660 align:middle line:84%
of astronomy, and astrology,
and the importance

00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:02.050 align:middle line:84%
of the snake or the serpent, not
just to do with the Milky Way,

00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:06.060 align:middle line:84%
but also to do with the path of
the sun, the so-called ecliptic,

00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:09.020 align:middle line:84%
the 12 signs that it
passes through each year,

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:14.910 align:middle line:84%
and the movements of the moon,
and how that crisscrosses

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:20.310 align:middle line:84%
the path of the sun, and
creating positions or moments

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:22.840 align:middle line:90%
when eclipses can take place.

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:24.780 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
this cosmic serpent

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:27.640 align:middle line:84%
was seen as responsible
for all of these,

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:31.740 align:middle line:84%
and these ideas were
filtered through Harran

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:34.900 align:middle line:84%
and the people that lived there,
who were known as the Chaldeans,

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:39.300 align:middle line:84%
into Sumerian, into
Akkadian, into Babylonian,

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:41.290 align:middle line:90%
and Assyrian tradition.

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And these would be retained,
passed on to the Greeks,

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:47.730 align:middle line:84%
passed on, eventually, to
the Arabic peoples that

00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:51.540 align:middle line:84%
would inherit this area
eventually, and pass

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:55.270 align:middle line:84%
through very important
centers of learning,

00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:58.380 align:middle line:84%
like Aleppo, and
Damascus in Syria,

00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:00.730 align:middle line:90%
and obviously Baghdad in Iraq.

00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, it was from
there that all of these ideas

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:07.200 align:middle line:84%
eventually filter through
into medieval Europe

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.950 align:middle line:90%
at the time of the renaissance.

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:11.562 align:middle line:84%
But there's another
branch of activity

00:26:11.562 --> 00:26:13.020 align:middle line:84%
that's really
important, and that's

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:16.960 align:middle line:84%
Gnosticism, because Harran
was the center of Gnosticism.

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:20.460 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the very
sacred tradition that

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:24.460 align:middle line:84%
went hand in hand with the
early forms of Christianity.

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:30.922 align:middle line:84%
And in this, god was almost
like this invisible supreme sun.

00:26:30.922 --> 00:26:36.700 align:middle line:84%
And its son, S-O-N,
was the serpent itself.

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:39.910 align:middle line:84%
And this was seen
to have manufactured

00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:43.400 align:middle line:84%
the universe and the Earth
itself, the so-called Demiurge.

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And this particular serpent
was not just venerated

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:51.430 align:middle line:84%
by the Gnostics,
but it was also seen

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:54.370 align:middle line:84%
as the source of their knowledge
and wisdom, their gnosis

00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:55.550 align:middle line:90%
or the nous.

00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:58.900 align:middle line:84%
In other words, this
inspired intuitive knowledge

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:02.860 align:middle line:84%
that they could learn
directly from God himself

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:06.320 align:middle line:90%
via this cosmic serpent.

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think that these ideas
that were prevailing at the time

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:14.140 align:middle line:84%
of the early centuries of
Christianity are a memory

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:18.150 align:middle line:84%
of what was going on at Karahan
Tepe as much as 11,000 years

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:18.950 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:23.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the story about
the serpent being deceitful,

00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:26.560 align:middle line:84%
and a tempter, and, of course,
corrupting the female, and then

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:28.900 align:middle line:84%
the female side until
now, pretty much

00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:32.750 align:middle line:84%
the last couple thousand years
of sidelining of the feminine,

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:34.280 align:middle line:90%
that clearly wasn't a memory.

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:37.300 align:middle line:84%
There was some political agenda
that inserted itself in there

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:38.530 align:middle line:90%
and took over.

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:39.330 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yeah.

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:41.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, it's just in the
same way as the early years

00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:42.360 align:middle line:90%
of Christianity.

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:45.660 align:middle line:84%
We know that Mary Magdalene
played an incredible role--

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:46.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:48.980 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: --alongside Jesus.

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And then you have people like
Paul coming along and completely

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:57.660 align:middle line:84%
sidelining her and trying
to espouse her completely--

00:27:57.660 --> 00:27:58.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:01.950 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: --from the gospels
or from the other early texts.

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:04.610 align:middle line:84%
But now we're able to
recreate those texts

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:07.340 align:middle line:84%
and to show that
Mary Magdalene was

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:09.710 align:middle line:84%
an incredibly important
figure, possibly

00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:10.950 align:middle line:90%
the most important figure--

00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:11.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:13.530 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: --other than,
presumably, Jesus himself.

00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:14.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:18.380 align:middle line:84%
So we just had to get to that
because that's what we're still

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:20.280 align:middle line:90%
under the influence of, sadly.

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:23.000 align:middle line:84%
But humanity is just coming
out from under the influence

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.010 align:middle line:84%
after a couple thousand
years of that story.

00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:31.350 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
is you were able to--

00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:33.240 align:middle line:84%
and I want to talk
about Pillar 43.

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:35.240 align:middle line:84%
Looking at the site
itself, you were

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:38.470 align:middle line:84%
able to ascertain the
spiritual development

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:43.130 align:middle line:84%
of the passed on information
from Atlantis to this area.

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:44.390 align:middle line:90%
What level would that be?

00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:49.210 align:middle line:84%
Because by then, the Earth
had been ravaged enough

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:52.240 align:middle line:84%
that people were really blasted
back to the stone age's,

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:55.390 align:middle line:84%
loss of memory, just
trying to figure it out

00:28:55.390 --> 00:28:56.870 align:middle line:90%
from foraging all over again.

00:28:56.870 --> 00:29:00.010 align:middle line:84%
It was really quite primitive
after Atlantis went down,

00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:00.948 align:middle line:90%
very sadly.

00:29:00.948 --> 00:29:02.740 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Yeah, well,
I mean, Gobekli Tepe

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:05.810 align:middle line:84%
is probably somewhere that
most people will know about,

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:08.230 align:middle line:84%
and it's a whole series
of stone enclosures

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:09.620 align:middle line:90%
with these T-shaped pillars.

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:11.870 align:middle line:84%
Beautiful carved
art, as we know.

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:14.630 align:middle line:84%
But to me, when I
look at Gobekli Tepe,

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:18.160 align:middle line:84%
I see it as almost like
a Catholic cathedral,

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.530 align:middle line:84%
somewhere that's full
of chapels dedicated

00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:23.560 align:middle line:84%
to different saints, different
altars, the high altar,

00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:25.700 align:middle line:84%
the choir area, et
cetera, et cetera.

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:29.420 align:middle line:84%
Whereas Karahan Tepe is
somewhere much deeper,

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:32.560 align:middle line:84%
because here you
have these stone

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:35.060 align:middle line:84%
enclosures that actually
cut out of the bedrock.

00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:37.597 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one of which, known
as the pillar shrine--

00:29:37.597 --> 00:29:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That takes technology.

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:40.513 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: --that's
been dropped down.

00:29:40.513 --> 00:29:43.430 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's not only
technology, but a need or a

00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:46.670 align:middle line:84%
want to go deeper than
what has gone before.

00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:50.330 align:middle line:84%
Because I think Karahan is
an offshoot from Gobekli.

00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:52.880 align:middle line:84%
And I see it almost
like a Gnostic church

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.015 align:middle line:90%
more than a Catholic cathedral.

00:29:55.015 --> 00:29:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And you've got this pillar
shrine, where they've actually

00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:00.230 align:middle line:84%
dropped down from
the bedrock, created

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:06.110 align:middle line:84%
these 10 pillars that are
left out of the rock itself.

00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:08.580 align:middle line:84%
And we think there
was a roof on it.

00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:12.413 align:middle line:84%
And there was a wall at one end
with this tiny little porthole.

00:30:12.413 --> 00:30:14.330 align:middle line:84%
That's the only way that
people could actually

00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:16.730 align:middle line:90%
have got into this shrine.

00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:18.440 align:middle line:84%
So they've had to have
quite literally go

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:20.840 align:middle line:84%
in almost like a snake
and crawled through

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:23.700 align:middle line:84%
into this shrine, where
you've got these 10 pillars.

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And on the side wall, you've
got this huge human head,

00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:31.160 align:middle line:84%
three times the size
of a normal head,

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:34.365 align:middle line:84%
on the end of a long,
serpentine neck.

00:30:34.365 --> 00:30:36.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in all honesty, it looks
like something out of the film

00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:38.580 align:middle line:90%
Beetlejuice, in all honesty.

00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:40.080 align:middle line:84%
For those that have
seen it, they'll

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.410 align:middle line:90%
know what we're talking about.

00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And what does all
of this represent?

00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:47.820 align:middle line:84%
And to me, this is
part of this process

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:52.870 align:middle line:84%
of them wishing to communicate
with this cosmic serpent.

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:56.050 align:middle line:84%
And what's so interesting
is that this pillar shrine,

00:30:56.050 --> 00:31:01.552 align:middle line:84%
if you look at it closely, it is
actually the shape of a snake.

00:31:01.552 --> 00:31:03.510 align:middle line:84%
In other words, what they
would have been doing

00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:06.733 align:middle line:84%
is actually going inside
the head of a snake.

00:31:06.733 --> 00:31:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, why would
you want to do that?

00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:10.930 align:middle line:84%
Because you'd want
to be consumed by it,

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:13.140 align:middle line:84%
almost taken into
its DNA to become

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:18.460 align:middle line:84%
a part of this cosmic
version of itself,

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:20.470 align:middle line:84%
so that you could
learn this knowledge,

00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:25.410 align:middle line:84%
bring this wisdom back to the
community, which, quite clearly,

00:31:25.410 --> 00:31:28.870 align:middle line:84%
you could use for new
technologies, and innovation,

00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:32.020 align:middle line:84%
inspiration, intuition,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:35.380 align:middle line:84%
But going back to
where these ideas may

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:37.750 align:middle line:84%
have come from in
the first place.

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:42.170 align:middle line:84%
If you look at either
Karahan or Gobekli,

00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:46.840 align:middle line:84%
it's clear that they already
have a cosmology that's

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:50.110 align:middle line:84%
up and running, that's
probably been around

00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:51.530 align:middle line:90%
for many thousands of years.

00:31:51.530 --> 00:31:53.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you for why
we mentioned pillar 43.

00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:54.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:56.110 align:middle line:10%
>>COLLINS: And let's
talk about that

00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:58.270 align:middle line:10%
because, at Gobekli,
this is the most famous

00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:01.570 align:middle line:10%
of all of the carved
T pillars there.

00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:04.780 align:middle line:84%
You have a big
vulture in its center.

00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:06.910 align:middle line:84%
This represents not
just the soul bird,

00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:11.830 align:middle line:84%
but what is known as the
psychopomp, the soul carrier

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:13.700 align:middle line:90%
or the soul accompanier.

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:16.210 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it's that
which accompanies the soul

00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:18.410 align:middle line:84%
from this world into
the next or back again.

00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:22.010 align:middle line:84%
But above that, you
have these chevrons.

00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And these seem to
be represent water,

00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:28.760 align:middle line:84%
but they don't represent
a normal ocean.

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:31.910 align:middle line:84%
They represent what is
known as the cosmic ocean.

00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:33.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What are
these purses all about?

00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:35.473 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: I mean,
they're not purses.

00:32:35.473 --> 00:32:36.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:38.000 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: To start off with,
I don't think any of them

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:38.730 align:middle line:90%
are purses.

00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:39.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, no.

00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:40.500 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Well,
what they represent

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:45.840 align:middle line:84%
is the three different worlds,
the sky world, the middle world,

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:49.940 align:middle line:84%
and the lower world, sitting
within the cosmic ocean.

00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:54.710 align:middle line:84%
And what this whole device
is showing, the whole stone,

00:32:54.710 --> 00:33:00.590 align:middle line:84%
it's a teaching aid for
initiates, for trainee shamans

00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:02.990 align:middle line:84%
to show them what
happens when they

00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:05.750 align:middle line:84%
get into an altered state of
consciousness, what they will

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:10.610 align:middle line:84%
see, where they will go,
what map to the sky world,

00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:15.450 align:middle line:84%
because it's quite clear that
this is important to them.

00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:18.260 align:middle line:84%
But if that's the
case, then why is it

00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:20.340 align:middle line:84%
that we have similar
ideas within,

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:22.280 align:middle line:84%
let's say, Native
American tradition that

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:25.710 align:middle line:84%
talks about the cosmic ocean
and also the three worlds.

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:28.610 align:middle line:84%
It's there in
Siberia and Mongolia.

00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:32.240 align:middle line:84%
It's there within
Hindu tradition,

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:35.170 align:middle line:84%
where it's still important
as a site to this day.

00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:40.530 align:middle line:84%
It tells us that there must
have been a universal idea that

00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:44.550 align:middle line:84%
was there before the
Americas were broken away

00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:48.150 align:middle line:84%
from the Eurasian continent
at the end of the last ice

00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:51.870 align:middle line:84%
age, when Atlantis was
drowned and the waters

00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:57.160 align:middle line:84%
rose up to break that bridge
between Alaska and Siberia.

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:58.830 align:middle line:84%
So, in other words,
everything that's

00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:02.440 align:middle line:84%
happened in North America
and other parts of America,

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:06.780 align:middle line:84%
of course, happens in
isolation, in theory at least.

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:09.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you've
got all of these ideas.

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:13.550 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they must be
at least 12,000 years old.

00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And I think that my colleagues
and I would say that

00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:20.650 align:middle line:84%
we're probably talking about
traditions that could be 15

00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:23.103 align:middle line:84%
to 20,000 years old,
possibly even 40,

00:34:23.103 --> 00:34:25.270 align:middle line:84%
or some people have even
suggested 60,000 years old.

00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:26.937 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
there's nothing saying

00:34:26.937 --> 00:34:28.840 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't concurrent
with parts of Atlantis.

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:29.070 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yes.

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:30.929 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I think
the thing that people

00:34:30.929 --> 00:34:33.159 align:middle line:84%
don't think about,
especially because we're

00:34:33.159 --> 00:34:36.050 align:middle line:84%
trying to stay with physical
evidence in the dirt,

00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:39.219 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, is that when you
had these civilizations of very

00:34:39.219 --> 00:34:43.190 align:middle line:84%
high technology and advanced
technology, you had flight.

00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:45.850 align:middle line:84%
Things were moved
around, ideas and people

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:48.100 align:middle line:84%
could be moved around
the planet quite easily

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:49.840 align:middle line:90%
because there was flight.

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:52.060 align:middle line:84%
We weren't the only
beings here, which

00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:54.820 align:middle line:84%
would have been able to
universally distribute

00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:57.980 align:middle line:84%
these ideas, and practices,
and technologies, and such.

00:34:57.980 --> 00:34:59.373 align:middle line:90%
So that makes sense to me.

00:34:59.373 --> 00:35:00.790 align:middle line:84%
One other thing I
wanted to get to

00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:02.207 align:middle line:84%
is what you said
in the beginning.

00:35:02.207 --> 00:35:04.670 align:middle line:84%
This was a person of
large proportions.

00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:06.340 align:middle line:84%
And now we know
that those are being

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:08.090 align:middle line:90%
discovered all over the world.

00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:12.250 align:middle line:84%
And you have your own thoughts
on how these people were treated

00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:15.440 align:middle line:90%
and why we deferred to them.

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:16.240 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yeah.

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:20.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, the one thing
we know is that there

00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:23.620 align:middle line:84%
are hundreds and
thousands of reports

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:27.070 align:middle line:84%
of oversized human
individuals being

00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:29.080 align:middle line:84%
found in every
part of the world,

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:30.380 align:middle line:90%
certainly, in North America.

00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:30.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:32.160 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: I'd say, many
hundreds, if not thousands.

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:33.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:35.040 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: And so they exist.

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:36.090 align:middle line:90%
These bones were there.

00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:40.490 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, 99.9%
of all of these bones

00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:43.432 align:middle line:84%
have either been repatriated,
or lost, or stolen--

00:35:43.432 --> 00:35:44.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Stolen, yeah.

00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:46.230 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: --or
ignored, or whatever.

00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:48.000 align:middle line:84%
That's the problem
that we've got.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.190 align:middle line:90%
So we know that giants existed.

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:52.640 align:middle line:84%
We also know that,
in some areas,

00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:55.230 align:middle line:84%
that there were so many
giants, for instance,

00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:58.230 align:middle line:84%
the Kanawha Valley
in West Virginia,

00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:01.280 align:middle line:84%
where the Smithsonian
archaeologists at the end

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:03.630 align:middle line:84%
of the 19th century, the
beginning of the 20th century,

00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:07.730 align:middle line:84%
were finding so many of these
giants that they couldn't simply

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:11.730 align:middle line:84%
have existed through some
kind of genetic abnormality,

00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:13.890 align:middle line:84%
which we know
today as gigantism.

00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:16.920 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they were
a community of their own.

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:20.330 align:middle line:84%
So we know that there were
communities, societies

00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:21.660 align:middle line:90%
of giants in the past.

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:22.920 align:middle line:90%
So who were they?

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:27.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, my own research has
suggested that they are

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:31.650 align:middle line:84%
the descendants of the true
giants that existed on this

00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:33.660 align:middle line:84%
Earth, right the
way down, probably,

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:38.590 align:middle line:84%
to about 30 to 40,000 years ago
that we call the Denisovans.

00:36:38.590 --> 00:36:43.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, they are a distant cousin
of ours, like the Neanderthals.

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.090 align:middle line:84%
Although, the Neanderthals
were very small.

00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:46.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All their own
distinct genetic set, yeah.

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:48.538 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: But everything that
we know about the Denisovans

00:36:48.538 --> 00:36:52.920 align:middle line:84%
was, firstly, that they were
incredibly large, probably

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:56.610 align:middle line:84%
from a conservative point of
view, the size of the largest

00:36:56.610 --> 00:37:01.230 align:middle line:84%
WWE wrestler or an
American football player,

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:02.890 align:middle line:84%
but arguably even
bigger than that.

00:37:02.890 --> 00:37:04.860 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we're
talking 7 feet plus.

00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:05.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Plus, yeah.

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:09.640 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: And very stocky,
stout individuals as well.

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:12.400 align:middle line:84%
But also that they were
incredibly intelligent.

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:13.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:15.550 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: I mean, just
look up, for instance,

00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:17.740 align:middle line:90%
the Denisovan bracelet.

00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:20.460 align:middle line:84%
It's this beautiful
Greenstone bangle

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:22.822 align:middle line:84%
that was found in the
Denisova Cave in Siberia.

00:37:22.822 --> 00:37:25.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you write a
lot about this, by the way.

00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:28.180 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: I mean, this dates
to about 45 to 50,000 years.

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And not only does it look
like it's made on a lathe,

00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:35.050 align:middle line:84%
but there is a hole
pierced through it

00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:37.960 align:middle line:84%
that has been done by a drill
with a speed rate that's

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:41.750 align:middle line:84%
so fast that it's comparable
to a modern day drill.

00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And yet, it's 45 to
50,000 years old.

00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:48.880 align:middle line:84%
They also created the earliest
bone needles with eyes

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:51.140 align:middle line:90%
to sew, tailored clothing.

00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:54.760 align:middle line:84%
They may well have
ridden horses.

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And also, we know that these
were the earliest peoples that

00:37:57.910 --> 00:38:01.340 align:middle line:84%
took an interest in the movement
of the sun and the moon,

00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:05.605 align:middle line:84%
and started recording
down, through notations

00:38:05.605 --> 00:38:10.340 align:middle line:84%
on carved figurines, the
cycles of the sun and the moon.

00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And this would seem to be
almost like an obsessive art

00:38:14.350 --> 00:38:17.720 align:middle line:84%
on their part that develops
very, very quickly.

00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:20.170 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
reasons why we think

00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:24.310 align:middle line:84%
that it developed so quickly
is because the Denisovans

00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:29.490 align:middle line:84%
had an autistic mindset, a
mindset that comes with it,

00:38:29.490 --> 00:38:32.400 align:middle line:84%
obviously, what we call
savant-like qualities,

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:36.590 align:middle line:84%
in other words, the ability to
be able to learn incredibly fast

00:38:36.590 --> 00:38:40.080 align:middle line:84%
and to retain
intricate information,

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:45.200 align:middle line:84%
whether it be to do with
mathematics, art, and drawing,

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:47.510 align:middle line:90%
or obviously, music.

00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:49.520 align:middle line:84%
The Denisovans, for
instance, created

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:52.130 align:middle line:84%
what is arguably
the earliest musical

00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:56.720 align:middle line:84%
instruments in the world in the
form of a bone flute, or flute,

00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:59.750 align:middle line:84%
or pipe, or something,
which fragments have been

00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:01.650 align:middle line:90%
found in the Denisova Cave.

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:07.590 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was that our
own ancestors went to Siberia,

00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:09.030 align:middle line:90%
Mongolia, and China.

00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:11.940 align:middle line:84%
They encountered the Denisovans,
they interbred with them.

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And the legacy of the
Denisovans is then carried

00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:20.090 align:middle line:84%
into Southwest Asia and
eventually into Anatolia,

00:39:20.090 --> 00:39:23.100 align:middle line:84%
where, obviously, we have
Gobekli Tepe and Karahan Tepe.

00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:27.410 align:middle line:84%
So that statue that we talked
about earlier, 7.5 feet tall,

00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:31.060 align:middle line:84%
in some ways is a
memory of the Denisovans

00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:34.780 align:middle line:84%
and that descendancy,
that legacy that's

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:38.230 align:middle line:84%
coming all the way through
to the time of Gobekli

00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:39.500 align:middle line:90%
Tepe and Karahan Tepe.

00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And clearly, this must
have brought with it a lot

00:39:41.830 --> 00:39:47.820 align:middle line:84%
of ideas of technology,
innovation, cosmology, astronomy

00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:48.620 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:48.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:50.547 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: I mean,
this is the one thing

00:39:50.547 --> 00:39:56.420 align:middle line:84%
that the Anunnaki were said to
be knowledgeable on, astronomy.

00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:58.630 align:middle line:84%
Their original name
is Anunna, which

00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:01.300 align:middle line:84%
means of the sky or
the people of the sky.

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:02.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, again, you
could interpret that

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:04.320 align:middle line:84%
as meaning they
came from the sky.

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:05.120 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:06.578 align:middle line:84%
I think that it
relates to the fact

00:40:06.578 --> 00:40:09.940 align:middle line:84%
that they had this incredible
understanding of astronomy

00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:13.205 align:middle line:84%
and astrology, and it's
this that they bring in to--

00:40:13.205 --> 00:40:14.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, could
they've also bred

00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:16.400 align:middle line:90%
with flesh and blood people?

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:16.790 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Of course.

00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:18.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so what
we're looking at is hybrid.

00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:20.175 align:middle line:84%
We're all hybrids of
one kind or another.

00:40:20.175 --> 00:40:20.975 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: We are.

00:40:20.975 --> 00:40:22.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if we look
at these depictions

00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:27.980 align:middle line:84%
throughout the artworks in
the stone carvings in Egypt

00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:31.190 align:middle line:84%
and Sumeria, we see that
the rulers, and the kings,

00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:33.960 align:middle line:84%
and pharaohs are almost
always very large in stature.

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:36.680 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that was just
an expression of power

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:39.290 align:middle line:84%
the artists rendered
them, or did they still

00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:41.690 align:middle line:84%
have remnants of
these bloodlines that

00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:42.930 align:middle line:90%
had large stature?

00:40:42.930 --> 00:40:44.550 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Well, that's a
very interesting question,

00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:46.260 align:middle line:84%
and I think it's
probably a bit of both.

00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:49.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, firstly, yes, because
most people would never,

00:40:49.590 --> 00:40:51.690 align:middle line:90%
ever see the king.

00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:55.400 align:middle line:84%
So the idea that he might be
much taller than everybody else

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:58.640 align:middle line:84%
would instill a certain
amount of fear and awe

00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:01.520 align:middle line:84%
within the population
as a whole.

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:06.860 align:middle line:84%
But we know from individuals
like the heretic king Akhenaten,

00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:09.410 align:middle line:84%
who showed himself, and
his wife, Nefertiti,

00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:11.940 align:middle line:84%
and their children with
these extremely long heads,

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:12.740 align:middle line:90%
which I don't--

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:13.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they
were taller as well.

00:41:13.890 --> 00:41:14.810 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yeah, and taller.

00:41:14.810 --> 00:41:16.460 align:middle line:84%
That, quite clearly,
they're trying

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:18.720 align:middle line:90%
to express something else here.

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:24.800 align:middle line:84%
And what we know about the
ancestry of probably Nefertiti

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:27.970 align:middle line:84%
is that she came from the
area of Southeast Turkey,

00:41:27.970 --> 00:41:31.350 align:middle line:84%
the area of Gobekli Tepe,
where we know that they were

00:41:31.350 --> 00:41:36.810 align:middle line:84%
elongating heads as early
as 7,000 to 8,000 BC.

00:41:36.810 --> 00:41:39.463 align:middle line:84%
In other words, this was a
tradition that continued on.

00:41:39.463 --> 00:41:41.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it was based on
something organic initially.

00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:43.500 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Yes, it
was, because what

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:46.890 align:middle line:84%
we know about the early
deformation of heads

00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:49.530 align:middle line:84%
is that all they were
doing was accentuating

00:41:49.530 --> 00:41:52.927 align:middle line:84%
long heads that were
genetic in the first place.

00:41:52.927 --> 00:41:55.260 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they were
accentuating it, saying-- just

00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:58.840 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that everybody knew
who was the bosses, basically,

00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:02.250 align:middle line:84%
or who were the direct
ancestors of these people that

00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:05.042 align:middle line:90%
had the original long heads.

00:42:05.042 --> 00:42:07.042 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:42:07.042 --> 00:42:08.110 align:middle line:90%
This has flown.

00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:09.920 align:middle line:84%
We're literally just
about out of time.

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:12.420 align:middle line:84%
Any final thoughts, because we
haven't gotten to some of it,

00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:15.670 align:middle line:84%
that you'd like to share with
people regarding this site?

00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:18.840 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Well, I mean,
I encourage everybody

00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:22.122 align:middle line:84%
to go to southeastern
Turkey to see Gobekli Tepe.

00:42:22.122 --> 00:42:23.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they'd
be allowed in?

00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:24.245 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yes, yeah.

00:42:24.245 --> 00:42:24.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's OK now.

00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:25.620 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yeah.

00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:29.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can go there, but
what they're uncovering now

00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:32.000 align:middle line:84%
is not just simply
a couple of sites.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
a civilization--

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:35.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:38.050 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: --one which my
colleague Hugh Newman refers

00:42:38.050 --> 00:42:39.640 align:middle line:90%
to as a super civilization.

00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And this existed at the
end of the last ice age,

00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:48.700 align:middle line:84%
and very clearly was
the product of knowledge

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:52.330 align:middle line:84%
that had already been there for
many, many thousands of years,

00:42:52.330 --> 00:42:54.740 align:middle line:84%
if not tens of
thousands of years.

00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:59.210 align:middle line:10%
And it's from this that our
civilization comes from.

00:42:59.210 --> 00:43:02.270 align:middle line:10%
So if you want to go to
the cradle of civilization,

00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:03.920 align:middle line:10%
this is where you've got to go.

00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:07.180 align:middle line:10%
And I have to say,
obviously, we do do tours out

00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:09.670 align:middle line:10%
there twice a year
in May and September

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:13.490 align:middle line:10%
if people want to come on to
andrewcollins.com, my website,

00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:17.830 align:middle line:10%
all the details are there of
not only these tours, but also

00:43:17.830 --> 00:43:22.480 align:middle line:10%
the book Karahan Tepe, which
is Civilization of the Anunnaki

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:26.267 align:middle line:10%
and the Cosmic Origins
of the Serpent of Eden.

00:43:26.267 --> 00:43:27.350 align:middle line:10%
The publisher likes long--

00:43:27.350 --> 00:43:28.517 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: we didn't do the--

00:43:28.517 --> 00:43:29.620 align:middle line:10%
I didn't do the subtitles.

00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:31.740 align:middle line:10%
>>COLLINS: The publisher
likes very long titles.

00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:33.440 align:middle line:10%
It's something to
do with meta tags.

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:34.670 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I got it.

00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:36.420 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: But, yeah,
beyond that, I mean,

00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:39.710 align:middle line:84%
look, it's an incredibly
exciting time for us

00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:42.950 align:middle line:84%
to live because all of this
is being uncovered right now.

00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:43.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:44.150 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:47.240 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: So in other words, we
are learning about the origins--

00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:47.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're living
through this discovery.

00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:49.553 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: --of who we
are and where we come

00:43:49.553 --> 00:43:51.840 align:middle line:90%
from for the first time now.

00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:53.250 align:middle line:90%
And that's incredible.

00:43:53.250 --> 00:43:54.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is indeed.

00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:55.890 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:43:55.890 --> 00:43:57.520 align:middle line:84%
You flew all the
way from London.

00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:58.320 align:middle line:90%
Are you in London?

00:43:58.320 --> 00:43:58.640 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yeah.

00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:00.182 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: From
London, the last place

00:44:00.182 --> 00:44:03.420 align:middle line:84%
I saw you, to be with us today,
and I really appreciate it.

00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:04.530 align:middle line:90%
It's exciting work.

00:44:04.530 --> 00:44:05.490 align:middle line:90%
Good job.
