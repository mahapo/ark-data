[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:27.832 --> 00:00:30.090 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Few
things are held more tightly

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.050 align:middle line:10%
among the academic world
than our global histories.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.110 align:middle line:10%
For reasons of religion,
control, tenure, et cetera,

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.420 align:middle line:10%
this area of study
is sacrosanct, even

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.240 align:middle line:10%
in the face of clearly
conflicting evidence.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.730 align:middle line:84%
Carl Lehrburger has made
a decades long study

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.220 align:middle line:84%
of the true historical
nature of America,

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.320 align:middle line:84%
which is nothing like what
we've read in our history books.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.612 align:middle line:90%
I think that's fair to say.

00:00:50.612 --> 00:00:53.070 align:middle line:84%
This is going to be a fun ride
for people who have not been

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.600 align:middle line:90%
exposed to this information.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CARL LEHRBURGER: I'm very
excited to be here and talk

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:57.960 align:middle line:84%
about the new
history of America.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:58.585 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:00:58.585 --> 00:00:59.290 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.340 align:middle line:84%
And first of all, before
we go into the new history

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.940 align:middle line:84%
of America, let's go into
some of your personal history

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.736 align:middle line:84%
and how you came about taking
on such a massive body of work.

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:11.940 align:middle line:10%
>>LEHRBURGER: Well,
the short story

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.800 align:middle line:10%
is that I set out to discover
a new history of America.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.150 align:middle line:10%
From an early age, I've been
very interested in mysticism,

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.380 align:middle line:10%
esoteric works of the masters.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And so I've inclined to really
look deep into what goes on

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.000 align:middle line:90%
and why.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.210 align:middle line:84%
Later on in life, I
became very involved

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.960 align:middle line:84%
in technical endeavors,
developing renewable energy

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.880 align:middle line:84%
technologies, and
really applying

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.320 align:middle line:84%
scientific principles to
investigating and developing

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.860 align:middle line:90%
new technologies.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And it's with the technology
and scientific background

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.700 align:middle line:84%
that I've attempted to bring a
new history of America forward.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.275 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What first alerted
you that something was amiss?

00:02:00.275 --> 00:02:02.600 align:middle line:84%
Or our story wasn't
complete, anyway.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: It was 1986 and
I was living in a New England

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.260 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And I came across a
book entitled America BC

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.500 align:middle line:90%
by Dr. Barry Fell.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:20.150 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Fell was a
professor at Harvard

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.130 align:middle line:90%
in an area of microbiology.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.910 align:middle line:84%
But he, like many
diffusionist scholars

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.720 align:middle line:84%
who looked at discovering
a new history,

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.100 align:middle line:84%
was not trained as a historian
or as an epigrapher, somebody

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.070 align:middle line:90%
who looked at ancient languages.

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.410 align:middle line:84%
And so he was, in that
sense, kind of an amateur.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.580 align:middle line:84%
But his book "America BC"
revealed a whole new history

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.640 align:middle line:84%
of America that
challenged the notion

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.000 align:middle line:84%
that the Native Americans
solely came from the north

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.610 align:middle line:84%
across the land bridge
and that Columbus was

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.280 align:middle line:90%
the first explorer in America.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.170 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Fell described
a hemisphere that

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.260 align:middle line:84%
had both Transpacific
and Transtlantic

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.600 align:middle line:84%
explorers, colonists,
miners, coming to America

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.960 align:middle line:84%
for thousands of
years before Columbus,

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.450 align:middle line:84%
and cited hundreds of
examples throughout North

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.520 align:middle line:84%
America and the
Americas that document

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.660 align:middle line:90%
these foreign travelers.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, when I read
this, I was floored.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And like many diffusionist
researchers and scholars--

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.758 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I'm
going to have you

00:03:37.758 --> 00:03:39.132 align:middle line:90%
describe the word in a minute.

00:03:39.132 --> 00:03:43.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: Who began really
by reading Dr. Fell, that

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.890 align:middle line:90%
was my inspiration.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.980 align:middle line:90%
He wrote the book in 1976.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.070 align:middle line:90%
I first read it in 1986.

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And that was the beginning
of my explorations

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.550 align:middle line:90%
of a new history of America.

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us what
diffusionist means.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.260 align:middle line:90%
You've said it twice.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: Diffusionist as
opposed to independent theory

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:09.510 align:middle line:84%
or isolationism is a theory
that holds that culture comes

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.130 align:middle line:84%
from the outside as opposed to,
in the case of, for example,

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.010 align:middle line:84%
Native Americans,
everything was done

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.490 align:middle line:84%
in the context of
an isolated society.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:23.830 align:middle line:84%
So diffusionist
scholars, for example,

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.810 align:middle line:84%
would cite a symbol
like a swastika, used

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.040 align:middle line:84%
in some of the Native
American symbols,

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.320 align:middle line:84%
as coming from outside
America as opposed

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.380 align:middle line:84%
to the Native Americans
inventing the swastika.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.750 align:middle line:84%
So this has been the big
debate ever since Barry Fell of

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:50.860 align:middle line:84%
whether or not we have
pre-Columbian, Transpacific

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.530 align:middle line:84%
and Transatlantic travelers
coming to America.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.640 align:middle line:84%
The archaeo-priesthood,
that is the archaeologists

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.100 align:middle line:84%
and the archaeological
community,

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.050 align:middle line:84%
has fought diffusionism
for decades.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And this was one reason
to write the book.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.920 align:middle line:84%
With so many diffusionist
scholars, including Barry Fell,

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.580 align:middle line:84%
who wrote "America
BC," Gunnar Thompson,

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.130 align:middle line:84%
who wrote "America Discovery,"
and my two mentors,

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.350 align:middle line:84%
William McGlone
and Philip Leonard,

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.460 align:middle line:84%
who wrote "Ancient
American Inscriptions"--

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:30.030 align:middle line:84%
and I should say scores of other
academics and researchers--

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.200 align:middle line:84%
the paradigm that Columbus
discovered America has not been

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.220 align:middle line:90%
shattered.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.890 align:middle line:90%
So I had to do something.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:38.984 align:middle line:90%
And even though I--

00:05:38.984 --> 00:05:40.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And a wonderful
contribution it was.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.179 align:middle line:90%
I was fascinated.

00:05:42.179 --> 00:05:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to go into
Columbus' story in a minute.

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.080 align:middle line:84%
But let me ask you, why has
hackademia-- hackadamia, whoa--

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.230 align:middle line:84%
why has academia been
so resistant to notion

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:53.510 align:middle line:90%
of diffusionism.

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.220 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: Well, that's
a very good question.

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.190 align:middle line:90%
And it's not a simple answer.

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.790 align:middle line:84%
But I would say that's the short
answer is that academicians

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:07.830 align:middle line:84%
don't like to admit that
they were wrong, number one.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.380 align:middle line:84%
Number two, there is
a process in academia

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.660 align:middle line:84%
that you have to pass
through the gatekeepers

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:18.250 align:middle line:84%
to get that master's
degree, that PhD Degree,

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.770 align:middle line:90%
and the teaching certificates.

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And the gatekeepers
heretofore have really

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:30.780 align:middle line:84%
not allowed diffusionism as a
subject to be widely discussed

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.610 align:middle line:90%
or elaborated on.

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And this is really documented
by many, many scholars,

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.390 align:middle line:84%
but most notably I would
say Dr. Gunnar Thompson, who

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.930 align:middle line:84%
is one of really the
greatest diffusionist

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.685 align:middle line:84%
scholars of our day,
and I talk about him

00:06:46.685 --> 00:06:48.670 align:middle line:90%
quite a bit in our book.

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:53.260 align:middle line:84%
But he was not allowed
to publish his papers

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.250 align:middle line:84%
and has not been given tenure
at any university because

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:57.970 align:middle line:90%
of his diffusionist beliefs.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.230 align:middle line:90%
So we have the gatekeepers.

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:04.930 align:middle line:84%
We have the inability
or the not wanting

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:06.490 align:middle line:90%
to admit that one is wrong.

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:07.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But usually
it's admitting someone

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.050 align:middle line:90%
that preceded you was wrong.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.920 align:middle line:84%
That should be
cool enough, right?

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:11.655 align:middle line:90%
But no.

00:07:11.655 --> 00:07:15.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: It's been a
paradigm that hasn't been

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:18.490 align:middle line:90%
shattered for the mainstream.

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.620 align:middle line:90%
There's other aspects of it.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.220 align:middle line:84%
And it gets into your question
about Columbus and the Columbus

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:25.580 align:middle line:90%
mythology.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.990 align:middle line:84%
At the heart of
American history is

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:32.080 align:middle line:84%
the discovery of
America by Columbus

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.790 align:middle line:84%
and how great of a greater
discovery it was, and it

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:39.400 align:middle line:84%
led to an exceptional
country, often

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.950 align:middle line:84%
referred to as American
Exceptionalism,

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:48.350 align:middle line:84%
with Manifest Destiny and
certainly a Christian nation

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:52.380 align:middle line:84%
that we become, just as
Columbus has envisioned.

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:58.010 align:middle line:84%
So it's important
for that old history

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:02.330 align:middle line:84%
to uphold that notion that
Columbus discovered America,

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:06.535 align:middle line:84%
even though he was actually the
last explorer, not the first.

00:08:06.535 --> 00:08:08.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now we get
into this juicy part

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:09.620 align:middle line:90%
of the discussion.

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.286 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
spend some time on it

00:08:11.286 --> 00:08:14.760 align:middle line:84%
because I think it's important
before we start building

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:18.070 align:middle line:84%
a new vision of what our
history is to start tearing down

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:19.290 align:middle line:90%
the old, as you call it.

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:20.700 align:middle line:90%
Busting those myths.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:24.400 align:middle line:84%
So number one, who was
Christopher Columbus?

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.545 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a bit about
the man himself.

00:08:26.545 --> 00:08:31.015 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: Well, the
historical Christopher Columbus

00:08:31.015 --> 00:08:35.020 align:middle line:84%
is well known, that he,
along with his brother

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:40.830 align:middle line:90%
Bartholomew were map-makers.

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:45.240 align:middle line:84%
Columbus participated
in several voyages

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:53.120 align:middle line:84%
to explore North Africa, as
well as the coast of Europe.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:09:02.190 align:middle line:84%
But he had an opportunity
to uncover many maps that

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:07.510 align:middle line:84%
were left in the libraries
abandoned by the Muslims

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:09.030 align:middle line:90%
in Toledo, Spain.

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And these libraries were
left completely intact

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:21.232 align:middle line:84%
so that all of the literature,
the astronomy, the astrology,

00:09:21.232 --> 00:09:26.475 align:middle line:84%
the history, were
available for the West.

00:09:26.475 --> 00:09:29.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this was
knowledge that was produced

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:30.820 align:middle line:90%
over thousands of years.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.194 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER:
Thousands of years.

00:09:32.194 --> 00:09:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And the Arabs had
not only come up

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.060 align:middle line:84%
with much of the science and
the technology themselves,

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:42.100 align:middle line:84%
but had the benefit
of earlier cultures.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:45.340 align:middle line:84%
Well this, in many respects,
this information coming out

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:51.530 align:middle line:84%
of these libraries, really
spurned kind of a Renaissance

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:54.800 align:middle line:84%
and it brought Europe
of the Dark Ages

00:09:54.800 --> 00:10:02.320 align:middle line:84%
as this information began to
challenge the Dark Ages and all

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:08.905 align:middle line:84%
that went on with the idea, for
example, that the earth went

00:10:08.905 --> 00:10:09.530 align:middle line:90%
around the sun.

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:10.196 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:10.196 --> 00:10:12.462 align:middle line:90%
Or that the earth was flat.

00:10:12.462 --> 00:10:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: And we can talk
about that a little bit later.

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:17.840 align:middle line:84%
However, one thing
that we really

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:23.040 align:middle line:84%
don't find too much from these
Arab libraries was the maps.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And we know that they were there
because they were explorers.

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:30.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, as I've written in The
Secrets of Ancient America,

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:34.870 align:middle line:84%
I believe that Christopher
and Bartholomew Columbus

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:37.920 align:middle line:84%
had access to these
maps and became

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:43.050 align:middle line:84%
in possession of these maps and
through these era maps learned

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:45.650 align:middle line:90%
that there was a new world.

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:49.630 align:middle line:84%
They learned how to get
there via the trade winds.

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:51.540 align:middle line:84%
They learned how
long it would take.

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And probably had some notion
of what they would find there.

00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:03.560 align:middle line:84%
So it was not only that the
maps from the Arab libraries

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:08.030 align:middle line:84%
in Toledo that Columbus
had access, but also

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:12.780 align:middle line:84%
from his wife's side of
the family, he had access

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:20.050 align:middle line:84%
to some of the stories of the
great explorer Henry Sinclair,

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:27.090 align:middle line:84%
who set across from Scandinavia
to the New World and in 1100.

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And Felipa intermarried into
this Dresden Sinclair family

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:41.280 align:middle line:84%
and it's certainly likely
that Columbus had access to,

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:44.980 align:middle line:84%
if not just the stories of the
explorations of Henry Sinclair,

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:47.550 align:middle line:90%
but also potentially maps.

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:51.770 align:middle line:84%
So Columbus had access to
the information about the New

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:55.000 align:middle line:84%
World from both his
wife's side of the family

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.680 align:middle line:90%
and from their maps.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's quite
clear from what we

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.260 align:middle line:84%
do know about Columbus'
voyage that he knew

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.450 align:middle line:90%
exactly where he was going.

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:10.820 align:middle line:84%
The notion that he was
sailing to India or to China

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:15.240 align:middle line:84%
to meet the great Khan is
a complete fabrication.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:19.460 align:middle line:84%
He didn't have any gifts
to give to the Khan.

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:21.630 align:middle line:84%
He didn't have provisions
that would last

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:23.340 align:middle line:90%
any longer than it took him.

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:27.890 align:middle line:84%
And certainly if he was
really serious about meeting

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:32.100 align:middle line:84%
the great Khan, he would
not have claimed the land

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:37.160 align:middle line:84%
that he so-called discovered
for the King and Queen.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:41.740 align:middle line:84%
So the idea that he was
sailing to Asia I believe

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:42.960 align:middle line:90%
was a complete fabrication.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.510 align:middle line:84%
He knew exactly where was going
and how long it would take.

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:49.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's also some
evidence via his own shipping

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.160 align:middle line:90%
logs.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:54.300 align:middle line:84%
In terms and provisions
for the journeys and such,

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:57.290 align:middle line:84%
it seemed that he must have
had some kind of knowledge

00:12:57.290 --> 00:13:00.162 align:middle line:84%
as to how long it was going
to take because there were

00:13:00.162 --> 00:13:03.620 align:middle line:84%
the right amount of provisions
for that number of days

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:06.070 align:middle line:84%
and that many people
on board, as though it

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:07.364 align:middle line:90%
had been properly calculated.

00:13:07.364 --> 00:13:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: There's
little doubt about that.

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And he also brought with
him only little trinkets

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:13.710 align:middle line:90%
to give to the natives.

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:18.010 align:middle line:84%
He didn't bring any great
gifts to bring to any royalty.

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:21.680 align:middle line:84%
So it's quite clear that
he knew where he was going.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, I don't think
that even his journals that

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:31.350 align:middle line:84%
have come down to us
have been left unedited

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:36.000 align:middle line:84%
by the Church and
other people that

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.020 align:middle line:84%
wanted to hide the notion
that he knew where was coming

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:42.882 align:middle line:84%
and why he was coming
to the Americans.

00:13:42.882 --> 00:13:44.715 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When he did
come to the Americas,

00:13:44.715 --> 00:13:46.215 align:middle line:84%
once he did arrive--
well, there are

00:13:46.215 --> 00:13:47.930 align:middle line:84%
a few things in
that in terms of he

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:50.080 align:middle line:90%
initially landed and so forth.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.250 align:middle line:84%
There was some
political jostling

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:55.360 align:middle line:84%
around telling some of the
natives of a particular area,

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.540 align:middle line:90%
hey, you don't talk about this.

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.480 align:middle line:90%
This is the official version.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:01.710 align:middle line:84%
There was a highly
constructed story

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:03.230 align:middle line:90%
around this from the beginning.

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:05.580 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk a little
bit about his own behaviors

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:11.430 align:middle line:84%
and practices once he arrived,
with the Indian population,

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:14.185 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:14:14.185 --> 00:14:17.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: Once
Columbus arrived,

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:19.900 align:middle line:90%
his agenda became very clear.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:23.350 align:middle line:84%
And it was he was
out for riches.

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:25.920 align:middle line:90%
He was looking for gold.

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.380 align:middle line:84%
Not only did
Columbus have debts,

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:32.510 align:middle line:84%
but the monarchy's that had
funded him had great debts.

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:37.880 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that he used the
prospect of gold and riches

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:42.300 align:middle line:84%
to sell his voyages to the
King and Queen of Spain.

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:50.292 align:middle line:84%
So you could almost say that
it began about seeking gold

00:14:50.292 --> 00:14:51.500 align:middle line:90%
and treasures in the America.

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And exploiting
the native people

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:54.770 align:middle line:90%
to become his gold miners.

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:59.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: And that
became part of the narrative,

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:02.340 align:middle line:90%
because he needed the labor.

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And he also instigated an era
of slavery in the New World.

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:11.610 align:middle line:84%
Columbus was the first one
to really bring slavery

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:12.990 align:middle line:90%
into the New World.

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:17.070 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't work out very
well with the native populations

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:19.160 align:middle line:90%
of the Caribbean.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:24.050 align:middle line:84%
So ultimately, they began
importing African slaves.

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:29.040 align:middle line:84%
From the time Columbus arrived
in the Caribbean to the time

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:34.610 align:middle line:84%
that-- in a 50 year
period-- the population went

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:38.690 align:middle line:90%
from 100,000 natives to 200.

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:44.290 align:middle line:84%
So the real genocide in the
Americas began with Columbus.

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:47.370 align:middle line:84%
But the story of the
conquest of America

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:52.440 align:middle line:84%
really unfolds with Cortes
in Mexico and Pizarro

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:59.380 align:middle line:84%
in South America, continuing
the exploitation of the natives,

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:01.220 align:middle line:84%
the destruction
of native culture,

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:04.460 align:middle line:84%
and really the stealing of
the land and their riches.

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:06.210 align:middle line:84%
Columbus opened the
door, but it was

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:08.280 align:middle line:84%
Columbus and
Pizarro who finished

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:10.160 align:middle line:90%
the conquest for the Europeans.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:13.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So essentially,
as I've written the book,

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:15.820 align:middle line:84%
they would take the native
population, such as the very

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:20.860 align:middle line:84%
peaceful Arawak tribe
and they give them

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:22.959 align:middle line:84%
a certain quota
of gold that they

00:16:22.959 --> 00:16:25.250 align:middle line:84%
needed to mine, whichever
tribe they were dealing with,

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:27.666 align:middle line:84%
that they needed to mine during
a specific period of time.

00:16:27.666 --> 00:16:29.210 align:middle line:84%
And if they didn't
meet the quota,

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:31.840 align:middle line:84%
they would hunt them down
with dogs and kill them.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:35.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: It
was quite horrific.

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:38.361 align:middle line:84%
But it got worse for
the Native Americans.

00:16:38.361 --> 00:16:39.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, for the girls.

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:42.520 align:middle line:84%
And then let's talk
about some of the girls.

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:43.790 align:middle line:90%
What happened with them?

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:47.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: I think that
the Columbus narrative

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:51.390 align:middle line:84%
is that he landed
in the Americas that

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:53.790 align:middle line:90%
was inhabited by savages.

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And it was the notion
that the natives

00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:03.210 align:middle line:84%
were savages that really allowed
the Europeans to treat them

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:06.210 align:middle line:84%
as animals and treat them
as slaves and treat them

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:11.579 align:middle line:84%
as dogs, not realizing
that the Native Americans

00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:15.319 align:middle line:84%
of the Caribbean but also
of the rest of the New World

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:18.319 align:middle line:84%
had a very
sophisticated culture.

00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:23.099 align:middle line:84%
And in the case of Mexico and
other places, in many respects,

00:17:23.099 --> 00:17:26.490 align:middle line:84%
more sophisticated than
European culture of the time,

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:30.000 align:middle line:84%
certainly from the point of view
of the vastness of the cities,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.230 align:middle line:84%
the artwork that went
on, the astronomy.

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:37.610 align:middle line:84%
And so we have in America,
when Columbus arrives,

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:40.140 align:middle line:84%
a relatively advanced
civilization.

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:45.190 align:middle line:84%
But the storyline had
to be these were savages

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:48.160 align:middle line:84%
and it's not
stealing their land.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.920 align:middle line:84%
We're with the
benefit of the Church

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:54.230 align:middle line:84%
and with the benefit
of being saved,

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:57.770 align:middle line:84%
we are really
helping the natives.

00:17:57.770 --> 00:18:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And if they don't
toe the line and die,

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:05.010 align:middle line:84%
well, there's nothing lost
there because they're savages.

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:09.060 align:middle line:84%
So part of this dialogue
of being savages

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:14.480 align:middle line:84%
enabled the Europeans to come
in and be such exploiters.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:17.061 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there were
some tricky political nuances

00:18:17.061 --> 00:18:17.560 align:middle line:90%
in there.

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:20.800 align:middle line:84%
For example, in order to
have slave girls-- well,

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.050 align:middle line:84%
first they're trying to
baptize everyone and turn this

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:27.240 align:middle line:84%
into a Christian world, turn
the savages into Christians.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:30.470 align:middle line:84%
Now if they had
successfully done that,

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:35.460 align:middle line:84%
then technically a baptized girl
couldn't be used as a slave.

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:38.640 align:middle line:84%
So the nuance there is
he found an efficient way

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:39.610 align:middle line:90%
to deal with that.

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:41.660 align:middle line:84%
Don't baptize
those girls anymore

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:46.082 align:middle line:84%
so you can have your slaves
and propagate Christianity,

00:18:46.082 --> 00:18:48.290 align:middle line:84%
I guess through what was
left of the male population.

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:49.831 align:middle line:84%
I'm not quite sure
how they did that.

00:18:49.831 --> 00:18:54.175 align:middle line:84%
But these were kind of
nasty bits of trickery.

00:18:54.175 --> 00:19:02.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: The idea that
Queen Isabella would request

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:08.550 align:middle line:84%
that Columbus baptize
the females to keep them

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:13.100 align:middle line:84%
from being slaves is kind of
a crazy notion to begin with.

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:14.950 align:middle line:84%
But of course being
across the ocean

00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:18.720 align:middle line:84%
and with an agenda
of gold hunting,

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:22.300 align:middle line:84%
Columbus really didn't,
at that part of the story,

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:24.070 align:middle line:90%
didn't care so much about that.

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:25.840 align:middle line:84%
And that was important
because the mission

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:27.970 align:middle line:90%
was all about the gold.

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:32.600 align:middle line:84%
So it's very likely that
Columbus shared little

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:36.280 align:middle line:84%
of not only the knowledge
that he had of the New World

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:41.060 align:middle line:84%
but also of the politics that
took place in the New World

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:42.250 align:middle line:90%
once he was there.

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:48.850 align:middle line:84%
Because it becomes very clear
that it was all about gold

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:50.890 align:middle line:90%
and extracting the gold.

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And even the records
that have come down to us

00:19:55.100 --> 00:20:02.020 align:middle line:84%
show that monarchs didn't give
Columbus what he had bargained

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:03.290 align:middle line:90%
for, what they agreed to.

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
lawsuit by Columbus

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:09.890 align:middle line:84%
and his family to try to get
10% of everything that went back

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:12.620 align:middle line:90%
to Europe that was unsuccessful.

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:17.230 align:middle line:84%
But it reinforces the notion
that Columbus came not so much

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:19.460 align:middle line:90%
to discover a New World but to--

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:20.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:21.243 align:middle line:90%
In it for the booty.

00:20:21.243 --> 00:20:23.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: To come and
take the riches and plunder

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:25.830 align:middle line:84%
something that he
had little insight in

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:29.507 align:middle line:84%
from maps from the Arabs and
perhaps from his wife's family.

00:20:29.507 --> 00:20:30.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about that.

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:33.020 align:middle line:84%
So it must have been
fairly obvious to him

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:34.870 align:middle line:84%
before his voyage the
earth was not flat.

00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:36.203 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that phenomena.

00:20:36.203 --> 00:20:39.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: Well, the
idea that the earth is flat

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:41.830 align:middle line:90%
is really a recent notion.

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:44.007 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was surprised
to read this in your book.

00:20:44.007 --> 00:20:44.840 align:middle line:90%
Please explain this.

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:46.798 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: The last
couple of hundred years.

00:20:46.798 --> 00:20:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And from really the Greeks, we
know that the Earth was round.

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And certainly the Chinese
and the Arabs and navigators

00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:59.960 align:middle line:84%
appreciated that
the earth was round.

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:02.610 align:middle line:84%
But the idea of a flat
earth was really somewhat

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:04.370 align:middle line:90%
of an invention of recent.

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:05.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But why?

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:10.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: It was
a-- as you pointed out,

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:14.020 align:middle line:84%
there was politics involved with
different religious groups that

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:18.765 align:middle line:84%
were jockeying for the
ears of the population.

00:21:18.765 --> 00:21:23.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's as though it
would discourage exploration

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.152 align:middle line:84%
if you thought you were going to
fall off the edge of the earth

00:21:26.152 --> 00:21:27.360 align:middle line:90%
and keep people more insular.

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:28.818 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: That's
a good answer.

00:21:28.818 --> 00:21:31.210 align:middle line:90%
I don't really know.

00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:33.032 align:middle line:90%
In the 1800s, it did come about.

00:21:33.032 --> 00:21:33.740 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not sure.

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:35.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So anyway,
it's relatively recent.

00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:middle line:90%
That I can see.

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:40.320 align:middle line:84%
If you want to keep
a population put,

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.469 align:middle line:84%
just discourage them
from traveling by saying,

00:21:42.469 --> 00:21:45.010 align:middle line:84%
hey, you're going to fall off
into-- well, I don't know what.

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:45.660 align:middle line:90%
The cosmos.

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:46.720 align:middle line:90%
An abyss or something.

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:49.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: Well,
it was a recent myth,

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:54.587 align:middle line:84%
and it was contrary to the
science not only of the day,

00:21:54.587 --> 00:21:56.170 align:middle line:84%
but going back
thousands of years ago.

00:21:56.170 --> 00:22:03.180 align:middle line:84%
So whether or not Ferdinand
and Isabella knew about it,

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:04.370 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:07.510 align:middle line:84%
But nevertheless,
has kind of been

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:10.451 align:middle line:84%
rolled into the whole
Columbus mythology that it he

00:22:10.451 --> 00:22:12.135 align:middle line:90%
who helped demonstrate--

00:22:12.135 --> 00:22:13.426 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, what a brave man.

00:22:13.426 --> 00:22:15.843 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: And nothing could
be farther from the truth.

00:22:15.843 --> 00:22:17.384 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now there's
another letter.

00:22:17.384 --> 00:22:18.680 align:middle line:90%
I have this written down here.

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:21.800 align:middle line:84%
He also asserted in the
letter to Pope Alexander VI

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:25.900 align:middle line:84%
that Cuba was the
east coast of Asia

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:30.340 align:middle line:84%
and he made all the sailors
swear not to divulge anything

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:33.005 align:middle line:90%
different from that story.

00:22:33.005 --> 00:22:40.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: This all goes back
to the story line of Columbus,

00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:44.100 align:middle line:84%
the story line of the
Church, and that he

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:47.980 align:middle line:84%
knew where he was going and
his agenda was to get gold.

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:53.440 align:middle line:84%
So part of it was that he
had to keep his secrets.

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And to keep those
secrets, he had

00:22:55.710 --> 00:23:01.140 align:middle line:84%
to make his men swear that they
weren't going to disclose it

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:02.419 align:middle line:90%
to the powers that be.

00:23:02.419 --> 00:23:04.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we wonder why
our history is so distorted.

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:05.200 align:middle line:90%
What a mess.

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: Well,
it's a beginning.

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:07.758 align:middle line:90%
It's the beginning of a mess.

00:23:07.758 --> 00:23:09.300 align:middle line:90%
And it really only got worse.

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:11.020 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:13.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now
what else do we need

00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:15.870 align:middle line:90%
to put in there at this time.

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:18.680 align:middle line:84%
Here we have there was evidence
that the Phoenicians were

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:19.220 align:middle line:90%
in America.

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And we go back to Barry
Fells' "America BC."

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And he did piece together
bits of information

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.130 align:middle line:84%
through fragments of
languages that were left.

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:30.670 align:middle line:84%
So now let's kind of
jump out of Columbus

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:34.470 align:middle line:84%
and how would you segue into
these other deeper histories?

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:38.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: Well, you
know, modern historians might

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:43.840 align:middle line:84%
acknowledge that the Norse
people and the Vikings

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:46.890 align:middle line:84%
"might"-- and I put it
in quotation marks--

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:50.230 align:middle line:84%
have visited the
Americas before Columbus.

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:53.520 align:middle line:84%
But they really have
disputed the idea

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:59.440 align:middle line:84%
that the Celts of
Europe, the Indus Valley

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:03.120 align:middle line:84%
people from greater
Indus Valley, including

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:08.320 align:middle line:84%
India and Indo-Turkey,
and many other groups

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:09.760 align:middle line:90%
made it to America.

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:15.850 align:middle line:84%
But the story of foreign
travelers making it

00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:18.900 align:middle line:84%
to America, at least from
the point of view of my book,

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:23.150 align:middle line:84%
goes back to the copper
mining in Michigan,

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:28.300 align:middle line:84%
where we see very pure
copper, almost on the surface,

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:35.660 align:middle line:84%
at the peninsulas of Michigan
and in Lake Superior.

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And these open
mines were readily

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:42.160 align:middle line:84%
available for
extracting pure copper.

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's quite obvious
from the landscape

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:50.395 align:middle line:84%
that there are thousands if
not tens of thousands of hand

00:24:50.395 --> 00:24:53.750 align:middle line:84%
dug mines that
extracted this copper.

00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:56.730 align:middle line:84%
And many of the
diffusionist scholars

00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:59.200 align:middle line:84%
have argued and asserted
that this went on

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.750 align:middle line:84%
for many thousands
of years, going back

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:04.320 align:middle line:90%
at least 4,000 years.

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:07.460 align:middle line:84%
Now the copper mining
was a driving force

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:12.800 align:middle line:84%
for the merchants of the day,
which were the Phoenicians.

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And even before
the Phoenicians, we

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:18.100 align:middle line:84%
have the Greeks and the
Minoans that perhaps

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:19.440 align:middle line:90%
knew about the copper mining.

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:20.898 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us
just a little bit

00:25:20.898 --> 00:25:23.130 align:middle line:84%
about the Phoenicians
and their explorations

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:24.412 align:middle line:90%
and who these people were.

00:25:24.412 --> 00:25:25.870 align:middle line:10%
>>LEHRBURGER: Well,
the Phoenicians

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:34.920 align:middle line:10%
were a group that is supposed to
be from Canaanite origin, that

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:39.790 align:middle line:10%
is the landed that is now
Israel and Palestine and Syria.

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:45.160 align:middle line:84%
And then they moved into
the Mediterranean regions

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:47.240 align:middle line:90%
at least 3,000 years ago.

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And one of their central
strongholds was Carthage.

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And hence we have
the Carthaginians

00:25:57.330 --> 00:26:00.840 align:middle line:84%
is also another name
for the Phoenicians.

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:03.750 align:middle line:84%
But the Phoenicians,
because of their bases

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:05.790 align:middle line:90%
in the Mediterranean, expanded.

00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:09.210 align:middle line:84%
They became the navies
of the ancient world.

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:14.800 align:middle line:84%
So if you were a, say, a
Hebrew or perhaps an Egyptian,

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:17.360 align:middle line:84%
you would contract with
Phoenician merchants

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:20.960 align:middle line:84%
to come to America, as
opposed to perhaps having

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:22.094 align:middle line:90%
your own merchant marine.

00:26:22.094 --> 00:26:23.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there
were pretty developed

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:26.050 align:middle line:84%
in terms of their
sciences and all

00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:28.645 align:middle line:84%
of their navigational
skills and their equipment.

00:26:28.645 --> 00:26:33.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: Shipbuilding,
navigation, astronomy,

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:34.710 align:middle line:90%
and perhaps mining.

00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:36.840 align:middle line:90%
But most importantly, trade.

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:38.540 align:middle line:84%
It's unlikely that
the Phoenicians

00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:43.010 align:middle line:84%
revealed exactly how they
got here or their routes.

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:46.230 align:middle line:84%
But certainly they had
significant shipping lanes

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:49.540 align:middle line:90%
that came to the Americas.

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:53.230 align:middle line:84%
I would advocate for
copper in the beginning.

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:56.570 align:middle line:84%
But also to bring
colonists over here.

00:26:56.570 --> 00:26:59.630 align:middle line:90%
Also for furs and other metals.

00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:04.450 align:middle line:84%
Barry Fell notes that
there is evidence

00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:06.270 align:middle line:90%
that the Phoenicians were here.

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:11.030 align:middle line:84%
They left not only their
writing inscribed in stone--

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:17.540 align:middle line:84%
and we have artifacts that
Dr. Fell has interpreted

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:19.250 align:middle line:90%
to be of the Phoenicians.

00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And in one of these
inscriptions off of Maine,

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:25.910 align:middle line:84%
it actually says
this is a-- and it's

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:29.330 align:middle line:84%
right off the coast--
this is a terminus

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:31.900 align:middle line:90%
for Phoenician merchants.

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:34.647 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And are these two
tablets that were found--

00:27:34.647 --> 00:27:35.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LEHRBURGER: It's not a tablet.

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:40.120 align:middle line:84%
But it is a stone
inscription off of Maine.

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And the other
inscription is found

00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:47.880 align:middle line:84%
on a stone called
the Bourne Stone,

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:49.720 align:middle line:90%
from Bourne, Massachusetts.

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And in this
inscription, the writer

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:58.030 align:middle line:90%
is basically pulling a Columbus.

00:27:58.030 --> 00:28:02.580 align:middle line:84%
He's annexing the
land for his people.

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:06.380 align:middle line:84%
This land is annexed for
the name of Phoenicia.

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:09.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And these writings
were from roughly about 2,600

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:12.120 align:middle line:90%
to 2,800 years ago?

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:14.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: Probably closer
to the 3,000 years ago.

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:18.980 align:middle line:84%
They really go
back quite a ways.

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:24.180 align:middle line:84%
There are other artifacts
left by the Phoenicians

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:25.270 align:middle line:90%
in South America.

00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And we see from a collection
called the Crespi collection

00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:36.700 align:middle line:84%
that was put together
by a Father Carlo Crespi

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:43.210 align:middle line:84%
in Ecuador that had these
gold plates with Babylonian

00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:49.540 align:middle line:84%
and Syrian writing,
very similar to what

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:52.060 align:middle line:90%
you find in the old world.

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And this is just more evidence
that the Phoenicians as well as

00:28:57.350 --> 00:29:00.660 align:middle line:84%
well as other old world people
made it to the Americas.

00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:02.436 align:middle line:84%
They were looking
for gold and silver

00:29:02.436 --> 00:29:04.060 align:middle line:84%
and they were successful
in finding it.

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:04.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
copper, apparently.

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:06.083 align:middle line:90%
>>LEHRBURGER: And copper.

00:29:06.083 --> 00:29:08.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And in
Richard Dewhurst's book,

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.710 align:middle line:84%
I think it was-- it
could've been maybe also

00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:13.680 align:middle line:84%
some mentions in Forbidden
Archaeology by Michael Cremo,

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:17.740 align:middle line:84%
they talked about some of
these very sophisticated copper

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:22.010 align:middle line:84%
artifacts, sophisticated
jewelry, cups--

00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:24.130 align:middle line:84%
not that that was a great
idea over the long haul

00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:27.620 align:middle line:84%
to be drinking out of those in
lead, too-- but in any event,

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:31.750 align:middle line:84%
very sophisticated items
had been made out of these

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:34.040 align:middle line:84%
and these artifacts
have been found.

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:37.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: And it also
goes back to the notion

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:39.940 align:middle line:84%
that we look back
in history think

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:46.160 align:middle line:84%
that these were undeveloped
and kind of ignorant peoples.

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:49.800 align:middle line:84%
But the truth of the matter is
that these ancient voyagers,

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:54.530 align:middle line:84%
whether they were coming as
Celtic voyagers or definition

00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:57.550 align:middle line:84%
on Phoenician ships
or later day Romans,

00:29:57.550 --> 00:30:01.280 align:middle line:84%
they had much larger
and more sophisticated

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:03.010 align:middle line:90%
ships than Columbus had.

00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:07.150 align:middle line:84%
And they had probably
much better technology

00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:09.220 align:middle line:84%
in terms of their
navigation as well.

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:15.010 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't really talk
about the culture of the day.

00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:17.660 align:middle line:84%
So the idea that
these were primitives

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:19.530 align:middle line:84%
is really turned
on its head when

00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:23.560 align:middle line:84%
we go back and see that, by
the end of the Dark Ages,

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:26.380 align:middle line:84%
culture in Europe had
degraded and devolved

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:29.850 align:middle line:84%
so much that people,
for the most part,

00:30:29.850 --> 00:30:32.830 align:middle line:84%
had forgotten that there
was a New World here.

00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And we must remember
the power of the Church.

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:40.800 align:middle line:84%
They controlled all the printing
presses, all to writing,

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:42.150 align:middle line:90%
all the literature.

00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:50.050 align:middle line:84%
So the idea that there was this
grand conspiracy for ignorance

00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:55.450 align:middle line:84%
is understandable because of
the control that the Church had.

00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:57.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And I remember-- yes.

00:30:57.650 --> 00:31:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know the nature
of the culture exactly

00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:02.860 align:middle line:84%
and how they lived,
although some--

00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:06.840 align:middle line:84%
if you dig deeply enough-- you
can find some of the evidence

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:09.350 align:middle line:84%
for very sophisticated
types of homes

00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:11.210 align:middle line:84%
that existed under the
ground, some of them

00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:14.040 align:middle line:84%
even more mound-like in
nature, but sophisticated

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:15.190 align:middle line:90%
on the inside.

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And beings up in
the Michigan area

00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:19.880 align:middle line:84%
found, and Ohio
also-- I remember

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:23.120 align:middle line:84%
this one scene, this one
couple that was exhumed,

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:24.570 align:middle line:90%
and she was a queen.

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:27.860 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these people were
quite tall and, in addition,

00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:32.610 align:middle line:84%
just bedecked with these
beautiful, delicate work,

00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:35.436 align:middle line:84%
with thousands of
pearls on her body.

00:31:35.436 --> 00:31:37.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: You know,
what you talk about

00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:42.120 align:middle line:84%
reinforces a notion that
Gunnar Thompson writes

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:46.840 align:middle line:84%
about at length, which is
our multicultural history,

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:50.880 align:middle line:84%
that it wasn't just the white
guys coming with the cross

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:54.150 align:middle line:84%
to bring Christianity
to the New World,

00:31:54.150 --> 00:31:58.460 align:middle line:84%
but that we have a very diverse
multicultural history that

00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:02.440 align:middle line:84%
includes Mediterranean
people before Columbus,

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:07.140 align:middle line:84%
that includes the Celts
with expansive presence

00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:07.990 align:middle line:90%
in the Americas.

00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:10.660 align:middle line:84%
It includes Romans,
Hebrews from the Atlantic,

00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:12.780 align:middle line:90%
as well as Indus Valley people.

00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:16.120 align:middle line:84%
And this is part of our history
that has been covered up

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:22.870 align:middle line:84%
and why the Columbus myth
has to be challenged today

00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:26.000 align:middle line:84%
if we really are going
to have an ability

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.360 align:middle line:84%
to move into the future without
the baggage of the past.

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:32.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're going to
go into a lot of specifics

00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:35.054 align:middle line:84%
of evidence that has been found
validating what you just said.

00:32:35.054 --> 00:32:36.720 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted to just
bring something up.

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:40.110 align:middle line:84%
I was at the airport a few
days ago flying into work here,

00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:43.950 align:middle line:84%
and a man standing next
to me in line at Starbucks

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:45.070 align:middle line:90%
started a conversation.

00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:46.300 align:middle line:90%
Where are you headed?

00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:46.960 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:47.860 align:middle line:90%
Well, I do this.

00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:49.610 align:middle line:90%
And he said, what kind of show?

00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I have
this really interesting one,

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:55.600 align:middle line:84%
for example, coming up
on an alternative view

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:58.020 align:middle line:84%
of our American
history that predates

00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:02.150 align:middle line:84%
the Native American
story, even though it may

00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:03.450 align:middle line:90%
have been running concurrently.

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out he
said he was Lakota.

00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:10.010 align:middle line:84%
So he said I take
exception to that.

00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I think
there's room for these stories

00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:18.590 align:middle line:84%
to run concurrently and we ended
up in a very friendly dialogue

00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:20.760 align:middle line:84%
where he was going to
then look at your work.

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:22.620 align:middle line:84%
But the point being--
and he said, well,

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:27.230 align:middle line:84%
there's evidence my people have
been here for 15,000 years.

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:28.950 align:middle line:90%
I said quite possibly.

00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:30.540 align:middle line:84%
But there's evidence
others have been

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:34.240 align:middle line:84%
there may be equally that
long and even before that.

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And it was quite an affront
and challenge initially to him

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.420 align:middle line:90%
psychologically and emotionally.

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And this does bear speaking
about in the story.

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Because right now some of these
archaeological artifacts are

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.680 align:middle line:84%
on lands that cannot be touched
without permissions from

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:57.340 align:middle line:90%
the Native American cultures.

00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:59.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, how does all of
this interface with that?

00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:02.280 align:middle line:84%
Because they have their
own story to protect.

00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:07.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: Well, you know,
the Native American story is

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:11.409 align:middle line:84%
the essential to
my book, as well as

00:34:11.409 --> 00:34:13.570 align:middle line:90%
understanding our history.

00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:17.560 align:middle line:84%
However, we all, including
many of the Native Americans,

00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:21.159 align:middle line:84%
have to be open to a
new history of America.

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:27.370 align:middle line:84%
The idea that we can speak of
Native Americans generically

00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:31.505 align:middle line:84%
or as one group is a
myth in and of itself.

00:34:31.505 --> 00:34:32.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:36.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: And when I
talk about a new history,

00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:38.440 align:middle line:90%
we have to be very specific.

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And certainly there are Native
American tribes that go back,

00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:47.150 align:middle line:84%
their ancestors go back to
coming across the land bridge

00:34:47.150 --> 00:34:51.020 align:middle line:84%
as the archaeologists tell
us the natives got here.

00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:53.290 align:middle line:90%
And there's no doubt about that.

00:34:53.290 --> 00:34:56.969 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing-- what we're
writing about as diffusionists

00:34:56.969 --> 00:34:58.850 align:middle line:90%
that contradict that.

00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:02.510 align:middle line:84%
However, what we add to
the historical narrative

00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:05.870 align:middle line:84%
is that there was
cultural contact

00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:09.670 align:middle line:84%
from the Atlantic and cultural
contact from the Pacific.

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And in some tribes, this contact
is more notable than in others.

00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:21.480 align:middle line:84%
So you might have a
Native American tribe

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:27.440 align:middle line:84%
that really has no influence
from foreign sources.

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:31.470 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, you
have Native American tribes

00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:35.340 align:middle line:84%
that have remnants of old
world cultures in them,

00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:37.882 align:middle line:84%
whether they be
symbols or words--

00:35:37.882 --> 00:35:39.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like the
swastika, for example.

00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:40.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LEHRBURGER: And even DNA.

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:41.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A Hindu culture.

00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:42.044 align:middle line:90%
And DNA.

00:35:42.044 --> 00:35:42.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LEHRBURGER: And DNA.

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:48.700 align:middle line:84%
So this is very challenging for
some of the Native Americans.

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And I remember being in Santa
Fe and meeting a Zuni dancer.

00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And he was just all dressed
up with his feathers and just

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:05.520 align:middle line:90%
beautiful clothes.

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:06.720 align:middle line:90%
And we started talking.

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And I started talking
about the new history

00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:14.930 align:middle line:84%
by noting that one of
the books I had read,

00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:22.870 align:middle line:84%
"The Zuni Enigma," talked about
that many of the Zuni culture

00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:27.570 align:middle line:84%
had come from the
Indus Valley groups.

00:36:27.570 --> 00:36:31.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, this particular man
became extremely irate.

00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:34.475 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What evidence
did you point to?

00:36:34.475 --> 00:36:38.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: Well, "The
Zuni Enigma" really points

00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:42.790 align:middle line:84%
to a lot of evidence,
both linguistic evidence,

00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:45.720 align:middle line:84%
artistic evidence,
racial evidence.

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:46.650 align:middle line:90%
It's very suggestive--

00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:47.755 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: DNA?

00:36:47.755 --> 00:36:49.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: I don't
know if they did.

00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:52.280 align:middle line:90%
This was before the DNA.

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:55.620 align:middle line:84%
But it was a very-- it wasn't
just one thing or another

00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:58.490 align:middle line:84%
or one drawing showing
turtles or one-- no,

00:36:58.490 --> 00:37:01.430 align:middle line:84%
it was a significant
amount of evidence.

00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:05.890 align:middle line:84%
But he thought that they be
author had denigrated the tribe

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:09.360 align:middle line:84%
and that it was a
white person's lie

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:12.160 align:middle line:84%
about white washing
native culture.

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:16.790 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very sensitive
subject that diffusionists

00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:18.460 align:middle line:90%
have to address.

00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:23.650 align:middle line:84%
Not only the
archaeo-priesthood who

00:37:23.650 --> 00:37:28.470 align:middle line:84%
doesn't want us to talk about
the old world cultures that

00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:33.550 align:middle line:84%
came before Columbus, but also
the resentment of many tribes

00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:37.200 align:middle line:84%
that they feel that this is a
white washing of their history.

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:40.840 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, there
are Native American tribes

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:45.510 align:middle line:84%
that accept the notion
that their forefathers came

00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:47.450 align:middle line:90%
from across the ocean.

00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:48.300 align:middle line:90%
And there are--

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:48.955 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's part of the lore.

00:37:48.955 --> 00:37:50.663 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: It's
part of their stories.

00:37:50.663 --> 00:37:52.470 align:middle line:84%
It's part of their
own mythologies.

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And even the emergence in
mythology of the Navajo coming

00:37:58.690 --> 00:38:01.240 align:middle line:84%
out of the ground
from the underworld

00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:06.570 align:middle line:84%
is all very symbolic, as
the underworld is really

00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:09.070 align:middle line:84%
the other side of
the world, you know?

00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:11.090 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at
it in this context,

00:38:11.090 --> 00:38:13.670 align:middle line:84%
there's a mythological
tradition that

00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:15.420 align:middle line:84%
suggests, in some
of these tribes

00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:19.520 align:middle line:84%
and in some of these cultures,
that they came from afar.

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:25.410 align:middle line:84%
But another instance of the
central band of Cherokee

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:30.720 align:middle line:84%
have discovered
within their lore

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:33.770 align:middle line:84%
and within their tribal
traditions, a connection

00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:35.230 align:middle line:90%
to the Hebrews.

00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And they actually have a project
where they have gone and looked

00:38:40.610 --> 00:38:44.020 align:middle line:84%
at some of the language and some
of the customs that they have.

00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And there are other tribes
that still celebrate

00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:49.680 align:middle line:90%
some of the Jewish customs.

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:53.350 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a black
and white situation.

00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:55.590 align:middle line:84%
But as historians
and as Americans,

00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:59.570 align:middle line:84%
we need to get away from
the notion of they're all

00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:00.716 align:middle line:90%
Native America can be--

00:39:00.716 --> 00:39:01.635 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Brown people,
now there are white people,

00:39:01.635 --> 00:39:02.185 align:middle line:84%
and now we're all
mixed together.

00:39:02.185 --> 00:39:03.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LEHRBURGER: That's right.

00:39:03.310 --> 00:39:06.150 align:middle line:84%
That all the Native
Americans are together.

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:10.260 align:middle line:84%
When the English came to the
Americas and settled in New

00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:14.610 align:middle line:84%
England, many of the tribes,
including the Mi'kmaq tribes,

00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:17.620 align:middle line:84%
they were almost as
white as the Europeans.

00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:20.560 align:middle line:84%
So again, this is
consistent with the notion

00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:24.590 align:middle line:84%
that previous Celtic explores
and perhaps Welsh explorers

00:39:24.590 --> 00:39:27.870 align:middle line:84%
and Europeans had been
there and interbred

00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:29.260 align:middle line:90%
with the native populations.

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:33.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's go back to
the Bat Creek Stone, which was

00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:36.010 align:middle line:90%
written in Canaanite, right?

00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:37.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: Well,
let me go back

00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:42.070 align:middle line:84%
and say that there are
many artifacts that

00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:47.040 align:middle line:84%
have been found in the Americas
suggesting old world peoples

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:48.040 align:middle line:90%
were here.

00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:52.200 align:middle line:84%
But nearly every one of
them is controversial.

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:56.010 align:middle line:84%
And the controversy
because, number one,

00:39:56.010 --> 00:40:01.240 align:middle line:84%
they don't coincide
with the Columbus

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:02.580 align:middle line:90%
discovered America and--

00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:04.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No
official time lines.

00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:09.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: But also they're
controversial because there

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:14.560 align:middle line:84%
have been so many fakes
and hoaxes and relics that

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:17.590 align:middle line:84%
have been claimed to be old
world that are, in fact, not.

00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:19.570 align:middle line:84%
So for the
diffusionists scholars,

00:40:19.570 --> 00:40:23.590 align:middle line:84%
many have been misled, I
believe, by some of the hoaxes.

00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:28.110 align:middle line:84%
There was a period of time
in the American history

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:31.210 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning, perhaps
in the 1830s and '40s

00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:33.700 align:middle line:84%
and going right up
into the early 1900s,

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:35.920 align:middle line:90%
called the Golden Age of Hoaxes.

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:39.802 align:middle line:84%
And there were many,
many hoaxes perpetuated.

00:40:39.802 --> 00:40:40.426 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:40.426 --> 00:40:42.620 align:middle line:84%
A lot of flim-flam
men traveling around

00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:45.250 align:middle line:84%
in their little special
shows in their wagons.

00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:48.200 align:middle line:84%
So let's say that you've
done your due diligence.

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:50.770 align:middle line:84%
You and the others have
done their due diligence.

00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:52.810 align:middle line:84%
We know there's
always that chance.

00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:54.490 align:middle line:90%
So that is a blanket statement.

00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:57.620 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be showing a
lot of images of artifacts.

00:40:57.620 --> 00:40:59.720 align:middle line:84%
We'll assume that,
at this point,

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:02.259 align:middle line:84%
it appears they're
authentic, right?

00:41:02.259 --> 00:41:04.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: Well, you
have to be very specific.

00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:06.950 align:middle line:84%
Now you mentioned
the Bat Creek Stone.

00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:11.990 align:middle line:84%
It is relatively small
stone that was said to be

00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:17.430 align:middle line:84%
had been excavated by a
Smithsonian researcher

00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:20.330 align:middle line:84%
and uncovered in
one of the mounds,

00:41:20.330 --> 00:41:21.800 align:middle line:90%
at the very bottom of the mound.

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And it was first interpreted
to be Cherokee writing.

00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:30.310 align:middle line:84%
But subsequently after it was
published by the Smithsonian,

00:41:30.310 --> 00:41:33.200 align:middle line:84%
diffusionist scholars noted
that it was upside down

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:42.700 align:middle line:84%
and was actually a Canaanite or
an old world inscription that

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:49.320 align:middle line:84%
related to a proto Hebrew phrase
for Judah or a star for Judah.

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:55.560 align:middle line:84%
Now this is, I think, one of the
likely artifacts that is real.

00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:59.240 align:middle line:90%
We just don't know 100%.

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:05.260 align:middle line:84%
However, because it was
discovered by Smithsonian

00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:09.170 align:middle line:84%
researcher, it gives a
lot of credibility to it,

00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:11.220 align:middle line:90%
that it was a real artifact.

00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:15.070 align:middle line:84%
This is contrast with many
of the artifacts found

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:19.850 align:middle line:84%
in the Midwest and attributed
to being uncovered in mounds

00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:22.890 align:middle line:90%
that clearly are hoaxes.

00:42:22.890 --> 00:42:26.300 align:middle line:84%
There are, I would
say, at least thousands

00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:31.850 align:middle line:84%
of artifacts that
have been presented

00:42:31.850 --> 00:42:39.730 align:middle line:84%
as coming from Coptic Egyptians
found in the old world found

00:42:39.730 --> 00:42:40.750 align:middle line:90%
in the New World.

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:43.000 align:middle line:84%
But when looking--
and I cite some

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.020 align:middle line:84%
of these examples of
tablets that were made out

00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:52.346 align:middle line:84%
of copper-- that when the
metallurgical analysis was done

00:42:52.346 --> 00:42:53.720 align:middle line:84%
on these tablets,
they were found

00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:57.460 align:middle line:84%
to be of modern
smelting technology.

00:42:57.460 --> 00:43:02.300 align:middle line:84%
So we have to be so very careful
when we look at what it's often

00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:05.953 align:middle line:90%
claimed as real artifacts.

00:43:05.953 --> 00:43:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And this is why many of my
contemporaries and previous

00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:14.830 align:middle line:84%
researchers in the diffusionist
area have fallen short,

00:43:14.830 --> 00:43:18.930 align:middle line:84%
that the relics that they
present as being real,

00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:21.570 align:middle line:90%
you cannot say with 100%.

00:43:21.570 --> 00:43:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
happened to Barry Fell.

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:27.070 align:middle line:84%
If you make a little
mistake, they'll

00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:29.500 align:middle line:84%
throw the baby out
with the bath water

00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:32.450 align:middle line:84%
and forget all of the
great discoveries, all

00:43:32.450 --> 00:43:36.300 align:middle line:84%
the great interpretations
and epigraphy

00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:39.220 align:middle line:84%
that he put together, all
the historical narrative

00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:42.520 align:middle line:84%
that he came up with to
demonstrate a new history.

00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:45.340 align:middle line:84%
But because of
several mistakes, he

00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:49.990 align:middle line:84%
has lost credibility and anyone
associated with Barry Fell also

00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:52.447 align:middle line:84%
loses credibility in
scientific circles.

00:43:52.447 --> 00:43:54.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I bet academia isn't
held to the same standard

00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:55.780 align:middle line:90%
for all their mistakes.

00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:56.904 align:middle line:90%
>>LEHRBURGER: That's right.

00:43:56.904 --> 00:43:58.641 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
misrepresentations.

00:43:58.641 --> 00:44:01.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: And we're going
to come back to this point.

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:05.250 align:middle line:84%
But that's why I say about
a third of the book deals

00:44:05.250 --> 00:44:06.660 align:middle line:90%
with a rock art.

00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:10.255 align:middle line:84%
Because unlike many
of the artifacts that

00:44:10.255 --> 00:44:14.510 align:middle line:84%
have been attributed to this the
mound building people, the rock

00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:16.680 align:middle line:84%
art you can't kind of
walk away with it or you

00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:18.320 align:middle line:90%
can't smuggle in.

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:23.250 align:middle line:84%
So I made the case-- and I
considerate it the smoking gun

00:44:23.250 --> 00:44:27.970 align:middle line:84%
case-- 100% that we had Celts
traveling in the Americas

00:44:27.970 --> 00:44:30.920 align:middle line:84%
thousands of years
before Columbus, based

00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:34.980 align:middle line:84%
on their rock art and their
inscriptions that they left.

00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:38.190 align:middle line:84%
So it's an important
part of our history

00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:41.740 align:middle line:84%
that when we talk about the
credibility of these artifacts,

00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:43.810 align:middle line:84%
we have to have an
open mind and realize

00:44:43.810 --> 00:44:48.360 align:middle line:84%
that what has been presented
in the past as real artifacts

00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:53.040 align:middle line:84%
proving old world contact,
were, in fact, frauds.

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:57.942 align:middle line:84%
Having said that, there
are very good examples--

00:44:57.942 --> 00:44:58.525 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:58.525 --> 00:45:00.275 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get
to-- lot of stone--

00:45:00.275 --> 00:45:03.620 align:middle line:84%
but let's talk about some
tiny objects first-- coins.

00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:05.230 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of coins
have been found

00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:08.640 align:middle line:84%
from ancient cultures that
appear to be authentic coins.

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:12.960 align:middle line:10%
And in particular, this Roman
coin from the fifth century

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:16.004 align:middle line:10%
found buried under three
feet of dirt in Springfield.

00:45:16.004 --> 00:45:17.420 align:middle line:10%
>>LEHRBURGER: Well,
I think we can

00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:20.790 align:middle line:10%
say there were many
hundreds of ancient coins

00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:24.520 align:middle line:10%
that have been uncovered in
America, with a predominance

00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:27.330 align:middle line:10%
off the coast of
New England, kind

00:45:27.330 --> 00:45:28.950 align:middle line:10%
of washing up on the beaches.

00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:35.960 align:middle line:84%
And at the terminus of the
Mississippi down in Louisiana,

00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:37.750 align:middle line:84%
again, consistent
with the notion

00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:40.660 align:middle line:84%
that they would have been
shipwrecks and these coins

00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:41.740 align:middle line:90%
would have washed up.

00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:46.200 align:middle line:84%
But really from the
east of the Mississippi,

00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:49.430 align:middle line:84%
we find these coins
in tributaries.

00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:51.620 align:middle line:84%
Some of the coins have
been dug up by farmers

00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:53.170 align:middle line:90%
as they're plowing their fields.

00:45:53.170 --> 00:45:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting is when
you do find a group of coins,

00:45:58.370 --> 00:46:01.630 align:middle line:84%
it really gives you a sense
of the historical context.

00:46:01.630 --> 00:46:04.600 align:middle line:84%
So they're not all
from the same group.

00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:06.890 align:middle line:84%
They're not all from
the same time frame.

00:46:06.890 --> 00:46:10.380 align:middle line:84%
So there have been
several Hebrew coins that

00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:14.130 align:middle line:90%
have been found in Kentucky.

00:46:14.130 --> 00:46:15.560 align:middle line:90%
There have been Roman coins.

00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:20.920 align:middle line:84%
There have been just a--
Celtic and other old world

00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:22.580 align:middle line:90%
peoples have left their coins.

00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And these are, as a whole, I
think indicative of evidence.

00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:31.850 align:middle line:84%
But any given
coin, any one coin,

00:46:31.850 --> 00:46:35.130 align:middle line:84%
has the same problem
of the artifacts.

00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:38.830 align:middle line:84%
The archaeo-priesthood would
argue that it was planted

00:46:38.830 --> 00:46:41.210 align:middle line:84%
or it was faked or
somebody threw it out.

00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:43.669 align:middle line:84%
So any one coin is
less compelling.

00:46:43.669 --> 00:46:45.585 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But when you
have thousands of them.

00:46:45.585 --> 00:46:47.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: But when
you have so many of them,

00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:50.670 align:middle line:90%
it really makes the case.

00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:54.810 align:middle line:84%
As to the photograph in
my book showing the Roman

00:46:54.810 --> 00:47:00.450 align:middle line:84%
coin from Springfield, this
was witnessed by a group.

00:47:00.450 --> 00:47:04.930 align:middle line:84%
It was found by a farmer that
really had no agenda here.

00:47:04.930 --> 00:47:09.880 align:middle line:84%
And we have to remember that
much of the historical record

00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:13.975 align:middle line:84%
that we have comes not from the
professional archaeologists,

00:47:13.975 --> 00:47:16.700 align:middle line:84%
but it comes from the
amateur archaeologists,

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:21.150 align:middle line:84%
from the people-- the town
historical committees.

00:47:21.150 --> 00:47:23.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And farmers,
because they're digging.

00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:24.369 align:middle line:90%
>>LEHRBURGER: And the farmers.

00:47:24.369 --> 00:47:27.410 align:middle line:84%
So the coins are certainly
indicative that we

00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:31.140 align:middle line:84%
have many different old
world people's here,

00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:34.760 align:middle line:84%
but have not been given much
credibility as authentic

00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:37.061 align:middle line:84%
by the archaeo-priesthood
and archaeologists.

00:47:37.061 --> 00:47:39.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now let's go
to some of the big stuff.

00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:39.840 align:middle line:90%
New Hampshire.

00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:41.920 align:middle line:90%
The Ring of Stones.

00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:45.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: Well, the
story of The Ring of Stones

00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:50.420 align:middle line:90%
really goes back to the Celts.

00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And we see evidence that
the Celtic people inhabited

00:47:57.090 --> 00:48:04.640 align:middle line:84%
New England for at least
2,500 years ago and probably

00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:09.720 align:middle line:84%
initially were arriving in
the Americas for copper.

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:12.360 align:middle line:84%
But they, unlike
many other people

00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:16.060 align:middle line:84%
we find that visited America,
they decided to settle here.

00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:17.740 align:middle line:84%
And you could
almost say that what

00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:21.620 align:middle line:84%
we call New England was really
New Ireland in those days.

00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:27.300 align:middle line:84%
There was extensive communities,
ritual sites in Vermont,

00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:30.990 align:middle line:84%
in New Hampshire,
and in Massachusetts.

00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And we see this
culture expanding out,

00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:38.530 align:middle line:90%
seeking perhaps riches.

00:48:38.530 --> 00:48:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Seeking pathways
to the Mississippi.

00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:43.410 align:middle line:90%
Seeking gold.

00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:45.440 align:middle line:84%
But by following
the tributaries,

00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:48.470 align:middle line:84%
the expansion of
the Celtic people

00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:53.005 align:middle line:84%
ultimately led them into
Colorado, Kansas, and Oklahoma,

00:48:53.005 --> 00:48:55.130 align:middle line:84%
which is a great part of
the book that I talk about

00:48:55.130 --> 00:48:57.260 align:middle line:84%
and we'll be talking
about it a little later.

00:48:57.260 --> 00:49:00.190 align:middle line:84%
But the stronghold of the Celts
was probably a New England.

00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps the
most accessible site

00:49:05.090 --> 00:49:09.870 align:middle line:84%
that people can visit today is
called America's Stonehenge,

00:49:09.870 --> 00:49:14.360 align:middle line:84%
in southern New Hampshire,
near Lawrence, Massachusetts.

00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:23.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is a vast site
that has many markers noting

00:49:23.230 --> 00:49:25.959 align:middle line:84%
the most important calendrical
days of the ancients.

00:49:25.959 --> 00:49:27.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oriented
towards solstices.

00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:29.709 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: The
solstices, equinoxes--

00:49:29.709 --> 00:49:32.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Very similar to
their ones in the counterpart

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.090 align:middle line:90%
in the British Isles.

00:49:33.090 --> 00:49:34.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LEHRBURGER: Yes.

00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:37.090 align:middle line:90%
And this is a vast site.

00:49:37.090 --> 00:49:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately, it has been
preserved, although much of it

00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:48.400 align:middle line:84%
was mined for curb stones in
the late 1800s for Lowell,

00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:49.130 align:middle line:90%
Massachusetts.

00:49:49.130 --> 00:49:53.080 align:middle line:84%
But fortunately it has been
preserved by Mr. Goodwin

00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:54.950 align:middle line:90%
and Mr. Robert Stone.

00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And now the public can actually
go to America's Stonehenge

00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:01.510 align:middle line:84%
and visit the site,
see the monoliths,

00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:04.470 align:middle line:84%
see the stone chambers,
and in their little museum,

00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:06.990 align:middle line:84%
actually see some
Celtic writing.

00:50:06.990 --> 00:50:09.050 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is a major site.

00:50:09.050 --> 00:50:13.544 align:middle line:84%
The site of The Ring of
Stones in a New Hampshire--

00:50:13.544 --> 00:50:14.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You've been there.

00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:16.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LEHRBURGER: Yes, I have.

00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:21.980 align:middle line:84%
And I learned about it because
it's on the cover of a book

00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:24.020 align:middle line:90%
by Dickson Mabon.

00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And they put it on the
cover of their book

00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:30.760 align:middle line:84%
when they're talking about
some of the mysteries of New

00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:31.260 align:middle line:90%
England.

00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:33.290 align:middle line:84%
And I decided I
had to go see this.

00:50:33.290 --> 00:50:34.960 align:middle line:90%
This was amazing.

00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:40.290 align:middle line:84%
And what it is, the
covers shows what

00:50:40.290 --> 00:50:45.180 align:middle line:84%
appears to be large
monolith stone sticking out

00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:48.380 align:middle line:84%
in some kind of a
design that might

00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:50.630 align:middle line:90%
be for calendrical purposes.

00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:55.170 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't that easy to find,
but I was able to find it.

00:50:55.170 --> 00:51:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And approaching it, it
was a very misty day

00:51:00.090 --> 00:51:01.460 align:middle line:90%
and I was all by myself.

00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:06.210 align:middle line:84%
So the stage was set for
almost a mystical experience

00:51:06.210 --> 00:51:08.030 align:middle line:90%
as I approached the hill.

00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:10.820 align:middle line:84%
I was somewhat
surprised at how small

00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:14.230 align:middle line:84%
they were compared to what
it looked like in the book

00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:16.440 align:middle line:84%
or what I'd seen from
America's Stonehenge, which

00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:18.160 align:middle line:90%
was quite large.

00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:24.580 align:middle line:84%
But in the context of
sitting on top of this hill,

00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:30.250 align:middle line:84%
it appeared as though that
this was some type of a ritual

00:51:30.250 --> 00:51:32.970 align:middle line:84%
site, some type of
a calendar site,

00:51:32.970 --> 00:51:40.030 align:middle line:84%
and it was very awe inspiring to
see this type of conflagration

00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:42.810 align:middle line:84%
of rocks in sort of a
circle with remaining

00:51:42.810 --> 00:51:44.200 align:middle line:90%
monoliths on the ground.

00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And knowing that you're walking
on something very important

00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:53.720 align:middle line:84%
the ancients have left for
us, but not really knowing

00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:55.990 align:middle line:90%
what it is or who did it.

00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:59.340 align:middle line:84%
But I think that this was
part of the Celtic people's

00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:03.300 align:middle line:84%
expansion throughout New England
that eventually took them

00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:06.105 align:middle line:84%
into Colorado and Oklahoma by
following the river systems.

00:52:06.105 --> 00:52:08.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they would
have brought with them

00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:11.500 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual technologies
they were aware of, of being

00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:15.710 align:middle line:84%
able to locate these
geodetic lay lines and such,

00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:18.700 align:middle line:84%
that would have areas
that have presented

00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:22.850 align:middle line:84%
particular opportunity or
power or energy to work with,

00:52:22.850 --> 00:52:25.410 align:middle line:84%
which they generally did when
they put these stone circles

00:52:25.410 --> 00:52:27.730 align:middle line:84%
up, which is being made
very popular in the moment

00:52:27.730 --> 00:52:31.760 align:middle line:84%
by the Outlander series,
both the books and television

00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:34.800 align:middle line:84%
of a woman traveling through
time through a vortex in one

00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:36.340 align:middle line:90%
of these stone circles.

00:52:36.340 --> 00:52:36.950 align:middle line:90%
But it's good.

00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:39.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's Hollywood,
but it's excellent in terms

00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:42.240 align:middle line:84%
of just giving us
a little experience

00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:46.100 align:middle line:84%
of mystical potentials in
some of these ancient places.

00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:48.056 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: Well,
you get that feeling

00:52:48.056 --> 00:52:49.180 align:middle line:90%
when you go to these sites.

00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And there's something there
for the intuitive people

00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:53.582 align:middle line:90%
to really pick up on.

00:52:53.582 --> 00:52:55.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I've been
in some of them

00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:58.380 align:middle line:84%
and you can start flashing
back in time to what may have

00:52:58.380 --> 00:52:59.620 align:middle line:90%
been occurring at that time.

00:52:59.620 --> 00:53:01.502 align:middle line:90%
And it's rather easy to do.

00:53:01.502 --> 00:53:02.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: Now
many, many people

00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:06.240 align:middle line:84%
ask, well, how come the
Native Americans couldn't

00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:09.010 align:middle line:90%
have created these?

00:53:09.010 --> 00:53:12.100 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you believe
the Native Americans

00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:15.920 align:middle line:84%
created America's Stonehenge
in southern New Hampshire?

00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And one reason that I believe
these were Celtic in origin

00:53:22.270 --> 00:53:26.820 align:middle line:84%
is that we see the tracking
of the cross quarter

00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:30.530 align:middle line:84%
days in addition to the
equinoxes and solstices.

00:53:30.530 --> 00:53:34.030 align:middle line:84%
These are the four days that
fall between the equinox

00:53:34.030 --> 00:53:35.660 align:middle line:90%
and the solstice.

00:53:35.660 --> 00:53:36.245 align:middle line:90%
For example--

00:53:36.245 --> 00:53:37.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: At the midpoint.

00:53:37.530 --> 00:53:38.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LEHRBURGER: That's right.

00:53:38.830 --> 00:53:41.400 align:middle line:84%
So the February
cross quarter day

00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:44.570 align:middle line:84%
is Imbolc, which is a
celebration of the goddess

00:53:44.570 --> 00:53:45.690 align:middle line:90%
Bridgit.

00:53:45.690 --> 00:53:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And the May cross quarter
day is Beltane or Beltano,

00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:55.351 align:middle line:84%
which is a celebration
of the sun god Bel.

00:53:55.351 --> 00:53:58.490 align:middle line:84%
The Lughnasadh is the
August cross quarter

00:53:58.490 --> 00:53:59.760 align:middle line:90%
day, also celebrating a--

00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So these
are represented

00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:01.750 align:middle line:90%
in these stone circles?

00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:03.333 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: And
in the stone circles

00:54:03.333 --> 00:54:08.580 align:middle line:84%
of America's Stonehenge, we
see these monuments lined up so

00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:12.770 align:middle line:84%
that the Celts and other people
that perhaps where there could

00:54:12.770 --> 00:54:19.450 align:middle line:84%
tell when is Lughnasadh and when
is May Day, which is Beltano.

00:54:19.450 --> 00:54:23.996 align:middle line:84%
So it's rare that we see the
Native Americans marking off--

00:54:23.996 --> 00:54:25.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Theirs are
more normally all north,

00:54:25.870 --> 00:54:27.460 align:middle line:90%
west, east, south, right?

00:54:27.460 --> 00:54:29.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, north, south,
east, west orientation

00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:32.650 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of the medicine
circles of Americans, too.

00:54:32.650 --> 00:54:33.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LEHRBURGER: Yes.

00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And there are circles and
time keeping, especially

00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:44.320 align:middle line:84%
with equinoxes and solstices
at Native American sites,

00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:47.030 align:middle line:84%
but it's rare that you
find these cross quarter

00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:48.630 align:middle line:90%
days being noted or celebrated.

00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:52.510 align:middle line:84%
So in the case of America's
Stonehenge in southern New

00:54:52.510 --> 00:54:55.510 align:middle line:84%
Hampshire, we see these
monolithic markers

00:54:55.510 --> 00:54:56.720 align:middle line:90%
to mark these off.

00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And that, in addition to
some of the Celtic writing

00:54:59.830 --> 00:55:03.330 align:middle line:84%
that we find, are
indicative that it was not

00:55:03.330 --> 00:55:05.100 align:middle line:90%
Native Americans.

00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:08.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's go to the
Balanced Rocks of New England

00:55:08.050 --> 00:55:09.850 align:middle line:90%
and Colorado.

00:55:09.850 --> 00:55:12.890 align:middle line:84%
It's really pretty
wonderful imagery there.

00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:15.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: Well,
you have to understand

00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:18.770 align:middle line:84%
that the world to the
ancients, whether they

00:55:18.770 --> 00:55:24.850 align:middle line:84%
be Native Americans or
ancient travelers from abroad,

00:55:24.850 --> 00:55:27.300 align:middle line:84%
really saw the world
as a sacred place.

00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And they celebrated
the sacredness

00:55:30.650 --> 00:55:32.200 align:middle line:90%
in what they left for us.

00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:38.770 align:middle line:84%
So whether it was the Celts
or later day Native Americans,

00:55:38.770 --> 00:55:42.200 align:middle line:84%
you find these
perched rocks where

00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:47.340 align:middle line:84%
they were lifted up and
in some kind of a display

00:55:47.340 --> 00:55:49.320 align:middle line:90%
of a significance for them.

00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And we find many of
these in New England.

00:55:54.250 --> 00:55:57.584 align:middle line:84%
We believe most of them were
Celtic, but not necessarily,

00:55:57.584 --> 00:55:59.000 align:middle line:84%
because there's
really no evidence

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.460 align:middle line:84%
to say that the Native
Americans didn't or couldn't

00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:02.290 align:middle line:90%
have made them.

00:56:02.290 --> 00:56:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And we find the same in
Colorado and in Europe.

00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:11.010 align:middle line:84%
I would argue that the
ones in New England

00:56:11.010 --> 00:56:13.450 align:middle line:84%
are of Celtic origin because
they're so similar to what

00:56:13.450 --> 00:56:16.110 align:middle line:90%
we do find in Europe.

00:56:16.110 --> 00:56:19.470 align:middle line:84%
Much of what we find in the
Americas of the Celtic presence

00:56:19.470 --> 00:56:26.020 align:middle line:84%
are relatively small compared
to the megalithic and large

00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:28.790 align:middle line:84%
structures of, for example,
Newgrange in Ireland,

00:56:28.790 --> 00:56:33.790 align:middle line:90%
or Stonehenge in Europe.

00:56:33.790 --> 00:56:37.480 align:middle line:84%
So here we find
smaller representations

00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:43.910 align:middle line:84%
because we just didn't have
the significant bodies of work

00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:46.100 align:middle line:90%
and men to put these together.

00:56:46.100 --> 00:56:48.410 align:middle line:84%
So we find much smaller
representations,

00:56:48.410 --> 00:56:49.700 align:middle line:90%
much smaller circles.

00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:52.820 align:middle line:84%
But we do find these perched
rocks throughout New England.

00:56:52.820 --> 00:56:55.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing when
you come across them.

00:56:55.210 --> 00:56:56.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They seem
to defy gravity a bit.

00:56:56.960 --> 00:56:58.085 align:middle line:90%
>>LEHRBURGER: Yes, it does.

00:56:58.085 --> 00:56:59.989 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I have
only one more example

00:56:59.989 --> 00:57:01.280 align:middle line:90%
we're going to talk about here.

00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:04.847 align:middle line:84%
And we're barely through my
list from our first hour.

00:57:04.847 --> 00:57:05.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LEHRBURGER: Uh-oh.

00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:06.846 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, this is great.

00:57:06.846 --> 00:57:09.680 align:middle line:84%
I love it when there's
plenty more to talk about.

00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:15.610 align:middle line:84%
Crack Cave Grian, however that
is pronounced-- capital GR,

00:57:15.610 --> 00:57:19.160 align:middle line:84%
little ia, capital N,
the sun or sun goddess.

00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:20.807 align:middle line:90%
The significance of this.

00:57:20.807 --> 00:57:22.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: Well,
let's continue our story

00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:23.420 align:middle line:90%
with the Celts.

00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:27.880 align:middle line:84%
So we have the Celts, their
stronghold the New England

00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:33.050 align:middle line:84%
probably many hundreds
of years before Christ,

00:57:33.050 --> 00:57:36.640 align:middle line:84%
perhaps going back 1,000
years, expanding out

00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:43.130 align:middle line:84%
into this heartland of
America by my mostly

00:57:43.130 --> 00:57:45.610 align:middle line:84%
following the river
systems, finding their way

00:57:45.610 --> 00:57:47.190 align:middle line:90%
to the Mississippi.

00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And then to explore
the west, traveling up

00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:54.160 align:middle line:84%
the Arkansas River and down
the various tributaries

00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:58.650 align:middle line:84%
along the Arkansas, including
the Purgatory and the Cimarron.

00:57:58.650 --> 00:58:01.275 align:middle line:84%
People say, well, how did
the Celts get to Oklahoma?

00:58:01.275 --> 00:58:03.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, they followed
the river systems.

00:58:03.270 --> 00:58:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's how the ancients made
their way into the interior.

00:58:09.210 --> 00:58:16.330 align:middle line:84%
Bill McGlone, my mentor, dubbed
parts of eastern Colorado

00:58:16.330 --> 00:58:21.740 align:middle line:84%
and a little bit of Kansas and
Oklahoma as the Ogham Corridor.

00:58:21.740 --> 00:58:25.320 align:middle line:84%
Ogham is a writing
system used by the Celts

00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:30.230 align:middle line:84%
and found in Ireland
and in England.

00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:32.860 align:middle line:90%
But we also find American Ogham.

00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:36.440 align:middle line:10%
And some of the best
examples of Ogham,

00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:40.820 align:middle line:10%
often pronounced "om",
spelled O G H A M,

00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:46.890 align:middle line:10%
are found in the Colorado,
Oklahoma panhandle, and Kansas.

00:58:46.890 --> 00:58:52.760 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps the first site that
Bill McGlone and Phil Leonard

00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:56.262 align:middle line:10%
researched and described in
their book Ancient American

00:58:56.262 --> 00:58:59.900 align:middle line:10%
Inscriptions is
Crack Cave, which

00:58:59.900 --> 00:59:03.500 align:middle line:10%
is located on Comanche
national grasslands

00:59:03.500 --> 00:59:06.320 align:middle line:10%
in southeastern Colorado.

00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:11.540 align:middle line:84%
And it is located in a
park call Picture Canyon.

00:59:11.540 --> 00:59:15.190 align:middle line:84%
And throughout Picture Canyon,
there's all sorts of rock art.

00:59:15.190 --> 00:59:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And I would say a good part
of it, perhaps most of it,

00:59:18.850 --> 00:59:20.670 align:middle line:90%
is certainly Native American.

00:59:20.670 --> 00:59:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And we can surmise that
this canyon provided shelter

00:59:26.010 --> 00:59:30.460 align:middle line:84%
for many people, including
Native Americans and travelers

00:59:30.460 --> 00:59:32.080 align:middle line:90%
in the harsh winters.

00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:34.810 align:middle line:84%
So that this collective
rock art really

00:59:34.810 --> 00:59:38.570 align:middle line:84%
shows continuing
occupation of picture

00:59:38.570 --> 00:59:43.360 align:middle line:90%
canyon over many millennia.

00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:46.690 align:middle line:84%
When Roland Gillespie,
who is a NASA

00:59:46.690 --> 00:59:51.900 align:middle line:84%
scientist and a diffusionist
researcher, came to Colorado,

00:59:51.900 --> 00:59:55.560 align:middle line:84%
he asked a local
farmer if he knew

00:59:55.560 --> 00:59:59.450 align:middle line:84%
of any time keeping
glyphs or petroglyphs that

00:59:59.450 --> 01:00:01.240 align:middle line:90%
might represent time.

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:05.120 align:middle line:84%
And this farmer, this rancher
whose name was Ted Barker,

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:05.970 align:middle line:90%
said yes.

01:00:05.970 --> 01:00:09.980 align:middle line:84%
I remember seeing some
markings in a place

01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:11.690 align:middle line:90%
called Picture Canyon.

01:00:11.690 --> 01:00:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And he took up Roland
Gillespie, accompanied

01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:20.930 align:middle line:84%
by Bill McGlone and Phil
Leonard to this very narrow cave

01:00:20.930 --> 01:00:24.260 align:middle line:90%
in Colorado that faced due east.

01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And in this very
small cave, there

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:31.330 align:middle line:84%
is a wall that has pretty
significant markings

01:00:31.330 --> 01:00:37.410 align:middle line:84%
as well as other Ogham-like
writing throughout the cave.

01:00:37.410 --> 01:00:40.090 align:middle line:84%
When the explorers
first saw it, they

01:00:40.090 --> 01:00:43.550 align:middle line:84%
thought, hey, this might
be a solstice marker.

01:00:43.550 --> 01:00:45.460 align:middle line:84%
But nothing happened
during the solstice.

01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And then they determined
it was really lined up

01:00:47.790 --> 01:00:50.010 align:middle line:90%
to be an equinox marker.

01:00:50.010 --> 01:00:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, when
they arrived right

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:56.060 align:middle line:84%
before the equinox,
they could clearly

01:00:56.060 --> 01:00:59.180 align:middle line:84%
see that the sun rising
would come directly

01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:02.700 align:middle line:84%
into the very narrow
opening of the cave.

01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And on the equinox, the
light of the sunrise

01:01:08.690 --> 01:01:12.290 align:middle line:84%
would actually
grace the cave wall

01:01:12.290 --> 01:01:15.560 align:middle line:84%
where these petroglyphs
and writing were.

01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:20.390 align:middle line:84%
And Bill McGlone and Phil
Leonard, as epigraphers,

01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:25.950 align:middle line:84%
were able to read the Ogham
inscription inside the cave.

01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And the inscription reads, "the
sun strikes on the day of Bel."

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:34.830 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough,
only on the equinox

01:01:34.830 --> 01:01:38.240 align:middle line:84%
does the sun come into
this cave and strike

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:42.000 align:middle line:84%
the inscription where
it was indicated

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.980 align:middle line:90%
by the Celtic writing.

01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:47.590 align:middle line:84%
But it's really
even more precise,

01:01:47.590 --> 01:01:51.190 align:middle line:84%
because they have tick
marks so that anyone

01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:53.900 align:middle line:84%
who is familiar with
the construction

01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:57.800 align:middle line:84%
of this particular
calendar would

01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:00.790 align:middle line:84%
be able to tell that it's
three days before the equinox,

01:02:00.790 --> 01:02:02.370 align:middle line:90%
two days before the equinox.

01:02:02.370 --> 01:02:04.640 align:middle line:84%
This is the day
before the equinox.

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And on the day of
the equinox, you

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:12.220 align:middle line:84%
see the alignment perfectly
formed with the light cast

01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:13.864 align:middle line:84%
right where the
inscription reads.

01:02:13.864 --> 01:02:15.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's some
powerful evidence.

01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:17.529 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: The sun
strikes on the day of Bel.

01:02:17.529 --> 01:02:21.650 align:middle line:10%
So this was really one of the
most notable instances that

01:02:21.650 --> 01:02:26.805 align:middle line:10%
was first discovered that I
would say proved the Celts were

01:02:26.805 --> 01:02:31.190 align:middle line:10%
in Colorado and led to
other sites and discoveries

01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:34.790 align:middle line:10%
in the area that allowed
McGlone to suggest

01:02:34.790 --> 01:02:39.700 align:middle line:10%
that this was a Ogham Corridor
in the middle of North America.

01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:41.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it
gets even juicier.

01:02:41.790 --> 01:02:43.485 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what's
Anubis doing, right?

01:02:43.485 --> 01:02:44.680 align:middle line:90%
In another cave.

01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:48.650 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
continue this conversation

01:02:48.650 --> 01:02:50.175 align:middle line:84%
and we'll probably
speed it up a bit

01:02:50.175 --> 01:02:51.800 align:middle line:84%
just to get through
some more of these,

01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:53.466 align:middle line:84%
because we have so
many juicy bits left.

01:02:53.466 --> 01:02:55.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: It's a big
history of America, isn't it?

01:02:55.770 --> 01:02:56.526 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

01:02:56.526 --> 01:02:58.150 align:middle line:10%
We're going to pick
up the conversation

01:02:58.150 --> 01:03:01.370 align:middle line:10%
with Anubis Cave, the
Anubis Cave, which I just

01:03:01.370 --> 01:03:02.550 align:middle line:10%
find fascinating.

01:03:02.550 --> 01:03:05.040 align:middle line:10%
Also some of the
influences that are

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:07.990 align:middle line:10%
more Hebrew in nature,
Mesoamerican, and also

01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:08.880 align:middle line:10%
East Indian.

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:10.760 align:middle line:84%
So stay tuned for our
next conversation.

01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:14.210 align:middle line:84%
