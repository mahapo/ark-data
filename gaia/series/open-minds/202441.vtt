00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.630 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Orion isn't
just a dominant constellation

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:23.770 align:middle line:10%
in the night sky.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.990 align:middle line:10%
It's recognized by
most ancient cultures

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.270 align:middle line:10%
as the home of the gods
and, in some cases,

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.768 align:middle line:10%
as the origin of
civilization itself.

00:00:30.768 --> 00:00:32.560 align:middle line:10%
Drawing from his book,
"The Missing Lands,"

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.360 align:middle line:10%
Freddy Silva is
here to talk with us

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.810 align:middle line:10%
about some of the most ancient
and anomalous people on Earth.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And look at all of
the knowledge you've

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.980 align:middle line:84%
gained through the years,
all the research you've done,

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.798 align:middle line:84%
the amazing books
you've put out,

00:00:43.798 --> 00:00:46.090 align:middle line:84%
the whole journey through
the Templars, which I thought

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.207 align:middle line:84%
was just the most amazing
book on Templars ever.

00:00:48.207 --> 00:00:49.540 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY SILVA: Well, thank you.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.915 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: But
first of all, we're

00:00:50.915 --> 00:00:54.130 align:middle line:10%
going into this anomalous
and ancient civilization,

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.940 align:middle line:10%
and we brought this up before
going back to New Zealand.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And tell me the name of
the indigenous people

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.710 align:middle line:84%
there because I'll
mispronounce it.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.390 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: There'll be a test
on this, boys and girls.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.125 align:middle line:10%
The Waitaha, one of the
oldest people on Earth

00:01:08.125 --> 00:01:10.210 align:middle line:10%
that you've never
heard of, who also

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.520 align:middle line:10%
were interacting
with a group of gods

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.080 align:middle line:10%
around the time of the flood--

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.350 align:middle line:10%
so putting the story 12,000
years into the distant past

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.560 align:middle line:10%
in one stroke, they were
called the Urukehu, literally

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.600 align:middle line:10%
the redhead tall people.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.040 align:middle line:84%
And this was even
back in the time

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.570 align:middle line:84%
before they even
got to New Zealand.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.240 align:middle line:84%
They were still in the
Easter Islands at the time

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.380 align:middle line:90%
when they said--

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.980 align:middle line:84%
they were calling Easter Island
the lands and outer islands

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.570 align:middle line:84%
of Easter Island,
so this was a time

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.090 align:middle line:84%
when the sea level
was considerably lower

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.973 align:middle line:84%
during the Ice Age,
the Younger Dryas.

00:01:38.973 --> 00:01:40.390 align:middle line:84%
And they said that
they interacted

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.060 align:middle line:90%
with the group of traveling--

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.770 align:middle line:84%
I was about to say salesman,
but that's not quite right--

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.530 align:middle line:84%
a group of traveling gods
who moved across the Atlantic

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.310 align:middle line:84%
as easily as you and I go
shopping for groceries.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.005 align:middle line:84%
They had these massive
canoes, and they went from a--

00:01:55.005 --> 00:01:56.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: With
exotic propulsion.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.496 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: With exotic
propulsion called wind.

00:01:59.496 --> 00:02:01.630 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And they went from Kainga
Nuinui, this big land

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.800 align:middle line:84%
in the east which sank
during the global flood,

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.830 align:middle line:84%
and then they used to
alight on Easter Island.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And whenever the
Urukehu landed there,

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.200 align:middle line:84%
they would divulge
knowledge to the Waitaha.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
Waitaha said, you know,

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.128 align:middle line:90%
we learn our wisdom from them.

00:02:18.128 --> 00:02:19.670 align:middle line:84%
Every year they
would come here, they

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.128 align:middle line:84%
would dump a little
bit more wisdom

00:02:21.128 --> 00:02:23.810 align:middle line:84%
to these baskets of knowledge
that they called the Kete.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And each one of
them was directed

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.780 align:middle line:90%
into three different groups.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.280 align:middle line:84%
So you had the group
which was meant

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.180 align:middle line:84%
to have knowledge
for the leaders

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.830 align:middle line:90%
and thinkers of the tribe.

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.850 align:middle line:84%
Then you had the people who
did all the exceptional work

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.440 align:middle line:90%
in terms of putting it into--

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Architecture,
agriculture, all of that.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:40.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.420 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: And the third one
was the interesting people,

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.680 align:middle line:10%
the knowledge bearers
and the shaman people,

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.840 align:middle line:10%
and these three
baskets literally

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.010 align:middle line:10%
were in the mirror image of
the three belt stars of Orion,

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.370 align:middle line:10%
from which the Urukehu
allegedly were to come from.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.902 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they are said
to have mated with humans.

00:02:57.902 --> 00:02:58.735 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Absolutely.

00:02:58.735 --> 00:03:01.068 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so we're going
to get to that in a moment.

00:03:01.068 --> 00:03:03.490 align:middle line:84%
Now-- and we have a
picture that we'll show,

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.642 align:middle line:84%
which is interesting,
the one I showed you

00:03:05.642 --> 00:03:08.100 align:middle line:84%
a little bit earlier, which
you're already aware of, right?

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.460 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: In fact, even when the
first Europeans were appearing

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.170 align:middle line:84%
in the Pacific around
the 17th century,

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.780 align:middle line:84%
they were amazed by
how many blonde people

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.180 align:middle line:84%
and red-haired people there
were in the Pacific Islands.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And they were saying,
well, they were

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.960 align:middle line:84%
the ones who basically are
part of the lineage of the gods

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.880 align:middle line:84%
because they eventually
had to interact with humans

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.190 align:middle line:84%
because there weren't many of
them and there are more of us,

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.510 align:middle line:90%
so--

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.170 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.940 align:middle line:84%
OK, I could go into so many
tangential lines of thought

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:32.740 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:33.550 align:middle line:90%
I'll go into one.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.800 align:middle line:84%
OK, I remember
seeing images that

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.250 align:middle line:84%
from a person who shall not be
named because he was silenced,

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.057 align:middle line:90%
and this was a long time ago.

00:03:41.057 --> 00:03:42.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know
if he's still alive.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.250 align:middle line:84%
He was doing these his
slideshow of the strange

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.280 align:middle line:84%
places he excavated
in the southwest.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.030 align:middle line:84%
And in one of them, it showed
these cylindrical tubes,

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.040 align:middle line:84%
clay tubes, in the
ground in the southwest,

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.230 align:middle line:90%
very clean, cylindrical tubes.

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And it had these very
tall redheaded beings.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.675 align:middle line:84%
They had a shock of long red
hair and interesting clothing.

00:04:04.675 --> 00:04:05.980 align:middle line:90%
It didn't make any sense.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.563 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Yeah, there are, like,
gowns that go all the way down

00:04:08.563 --> 00:04:09.508 align:middle line:90%
to the ground.

00:04:09.508 --> 00:04:11.050 align:middle line:84%
That's how the Hopi
and the Zuni talk

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.872 align:middle line:90%
about the elders of the tribe.

00:04:12.872 --> 00:04:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And, again, this story
goes back 12,000 years--

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.069 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
he had images--

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.329 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Before the flood.

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:16.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --of them.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.202 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: And they're
actually painted

00:04:18.202 --> 00:04:20.829 align:middle line:10%
on the walls of the canyon
at Horseshoe Canyon in Utah.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.000 align:middle line:10%
That lovely Ghost Panel.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.960 align:middle line:10%
It's a terrible name for it.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:23.760 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.980 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: And there, you will
see the seven tall, elongated

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.040 align:middle line:10%
people with the H for the big
eyes, the charismatic leader.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.870 align:middle line:10%
And you see that
around the world.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.540 align:middle line:10%
They're always going around in
groups of seven craftspeople.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.610 align:middle line:84%
One was a woman, and she
carried all the wisdom

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.140 align:middle line:90%
of the entire group.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.660 align:middle line:84%
And there was the H, who was
always that charismatic person.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.290 align:middle line:84%
So it could be
Quetzalcoatl or Osiris.

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.285 align:middle line:84%
There'll be-- every culture
has these people among them.

00:04:47.285 --> 00:04:49.410 align:middle line:84%
So if you ever get a chance
to go traveling in Utah

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.352 align:middle line:84%
and fancy an eight hour hike
in 108 degrees temperature--

00:04:52.352 --> 00:04:53.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, no thank you.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.685 align:middle line:90%
I'll take your word for it.

00:04:54.685 --> 00:04:56.185 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I'll give
you the pictures.

00:04:56.185 --> 00:04:57.018 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:04:57.018 --> 00:04:58.180 align:middle line:90%
We'll take the pictures.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.620 align:middle line:90%
What's interesting here too--

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.210 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we've, in
the past, talked

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.550 align:middle line:84%
about the ones in missing
lands, the shining ones,

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.710 align:middle line:84%
the ones who are the
preservers of knowledge,

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.190 align:middle line:84%
who would help recede
population after disaster

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.358 align:middle line:84%
had struck, in this
case, a deluge, right,

00:05:11.358 --> 00:05:13.900 align:middle line:84%
and recede knowledge, help the
people get back on their feet,

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.530 align:middle line:84%
remember the practices that
were done proficiently once

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.140 align:middle line:90%
longtime past.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.330 align:middle line:84%
So going to it-- but before
we even go into all of that,

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.270 align:middle line:84%
let's go back to
Orion because when

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.550 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people listening
to this hear of Orion,

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.550 align:middle line:90%
they think Orion?

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.443 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
reptilians are from.

00:05:31.443 --> 00:05:33.360 align:middle line:84%
That's the first thing
that's going to come up

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.800 align:middle line:90%
in a lot of people's minds.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.980 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean
Orion advance beings

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.637 align:middle line:90%
help settle this place, right?

00:05:39.637 --> 00:05:41.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I know where
that comes from,

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.560 align:middle line:84%
and it's actually a
bit of a misnomer.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's get into it.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It's a
bit of a misnomer.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.662 align:middle line:84%
It's the fact that you
take things too literally.

00:05:46.662 --> 00:05:50.160 align:middle line:84%
The thing to understand
about ancient information

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.560 align:middle line:84%
is that a lot of it's
metaphorical and symbolic.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.600 align:middle line:84%
You have to understand
the metaphor.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of these people, a lot
of these gods from the flood,

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.580 align:middle line:90%
had a badge of office.

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.740 align:middle line:84%
They were called the
people of the serpent,

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.670 align:middle line:84%
and that happens in South
America, Central America,

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.950 align:middle line:84%
in Portugal, where I was born,
and also in the Middle East.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.920 align:middle line:84%
All the way, there's
a band of people.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.930 align:middle line:84%
And of course, through India,
the Naga people, the Nagi

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.760 align:middle line:84%
and consequently the Anunnagi
as they were called in India.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And I always wondered, well,
were they literally reptilians,

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:21.750 align:middle line:90%
or was this metaphoric?

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And the more I've asked ancient
people who are still around us,

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.910 align:middle line:84%
it actually was a metaphor
because the serpent,

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.940 align:middle line:84%
as you know, is a symbol of
the invisible currents that

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.707 align:middle line:84%
flow through the
universe and the Earth.

00:06:31.707 --> 00:06:33.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Flows of
consciousness even.

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:34.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Yes, and they
behave like serpents.

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:34.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:36.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Say if you're a master
of the natural laws, which

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.412 align:middle line:84%
the gods were, which
is what made you

00:06:38.412 --> 00:06:40.740 align:middle line:84%
a god-- it wasn't the fact
that there's a guy sitting

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.578 align:middle line:90%
on a throne with a white beard.

00:06:42.578 --> 00:06:43.620 align:middle line:90%
That's not what it meant.

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.020 align:middle line:84%
A god was any person,
any mortal being,

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.700 align:middle line:84%
that had control of
the laws of nature

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:51.330 align:middle line:84%
becomes a god because a
god is a force of nature.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the
euphemism that we use

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.110 align:middle line:84%
was a person of the
serpent because they

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:56.475 align:middle line:90%
had the serpent energy.

00:06:56.475 --> 00:06:58.350 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't mean that
they were reptilians.

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.350 align:middle line:84%
It means that they were
harnessed to the serpent

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:03.150 align:middle line:84%
energy, so they understood
the laws of physics

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:04.440 align:middle line:90%
and how to manipulate it.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.860 align:middle line:84%
So that was the
whole complexion.

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.800 align:middle line:84%
So in a matter of
speaking, yes, they

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.920 align:middle line:84%
were kind of reptilian coming
from Orion but not physically

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:12.720 align:middle line:90%
reptilians.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not that
type that are also

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.990 align:middle line:84%
referred to as having
come from Draco or Draco.

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:19.860 align:middle line:90%
However you say it.

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:20.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Draco.

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, from Draco,
which people have drawn,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.180 align:middle line:84%
and they've shared
their experiences with,

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.670 align:middle line:84%
which are the ones that we've
come to know as the reptilian

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:30.670 align:middle line:90%
species.

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:33.780 align:middle line:84%
But it's always
pegged back to Orion

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:36.030 align:middle line:84%
in almost every conversation
that the reptilians

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:37.020 align:middle line:90%
are from Orion.

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.240 align:middle line:90%
But, in fact, this isn't--

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:42.300 align:middle line:84%
the reptilians in physical
form that I'm talking about,

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.370 align:middle line:84%
would that be more
representative of having

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:45.470 align:middle line:90%
come from Dracos?

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:47.075 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It comes
from somewhere else.

00:07:47.075 --> 00:07:48.450 align:middle line:84%
It's a completely
different story

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:50.520 align:middle line:84%
altogether because the
people, these gods that

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.862 align:middle line:84%
came from Orion, were
represented in human form.

00:07:52.862 --> 00:07:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the euphemism that
I hear all the time is they

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.082 align:middle line:84%
were human-like but
not quite human.

00:07:58.082 --> 00:07:59.790 align:middle line:84%
And they were very
comfortable with them,

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:02.970 align:middle line:84%
whereas many cultures, including
people in North America.

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:09.220 align:middle line:84%
Like the Wichita of Oklahoma,
they say that after the flood,

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:11.850 align:middle line:84%
and there was few groups of
gods that were remaining,

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:16.140 align:middle line:84%
the children of the gods
beget children from the women

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:18.150 align:middle line:90%
with whom they intermarried.

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And the women died
during childbirth,

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:23.370 align:middle line:84%
and these were
the Nephila, which

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:25.197 align:middle line:90%
means the children of Orion.

00:08:25.197 --> 00:08:27.030 align:middle line:84%
And they're the ones
who were very deformed,

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:29.835 align:middle line:84%
and they're the ones that caused
all the problems in the world.

00:08:29.835 --> 00:08:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And it was because of
them that the flood was

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:33.100 align:middle line:90%
initiated in the first place.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.760 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, if that hadn't
happened, we'd be-- well,

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.669 align:middle line:84%
actually, we wouldn't be living
on the planet Earth right now.

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:40.980 align:middle line:84%
Planet Earth would
be governed by a race

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:42.840 align:middle line:90%
of red head tall people.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.450 align:middle line:84%
Actually, giant people
covered with red hair,

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:46.620 align:middle line:90%
which were giants.

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:48.120 align:middle line:84%
So that's where
it all comes from.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.175 align:middle line:84%
It's a very different
thing altogether.

00:08:50.175 --> 00:08:51.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But they're
are conflated--

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:52.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: But they're all--

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:52.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --today.

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:54.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --conflated
together because no one

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:57.810 align:middle line:84%
has the time, unless you're
me, a way of looking at things.

00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:58.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You
research all the time.

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:00.493 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Because you have
to take this thing apart

00:09:00.493 --> 00:09:02.340 align:middle line:84%
and don't look at it
from our point of view

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:03.810 align:middle line:84%
or from a researcher's
point of view.

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:04.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Go back and ask
the indigenous people

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:06.900 align:middle line:90%
what they mean.

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:07.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you take
the time to do it.

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:09.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And then sit back,
and that's what I like doing.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.080 align:middle line:84%
Let's hear what
they have to say,

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.840 align:middle line:84%
and what they have
to say is, no, you're

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:17.070 align:middle line:84%
confusing a symbol
with an actual reality.

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:20.007 align:middle line:84%
And the fact is that the
giants drove the humans crazy

00:09:20.007 --> 00:09:22.590 align:middle line:84%
and said, no, these people are
really quite unpleasant people.

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:27.010 align:middle line:84%
But the gods, the tall people,
they were very much like us.

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:29.240 align:middle line:84%
They're just much taller,
elongated heads, red hair,

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.910 align:middle line:84%
sometimes blonde with blue eyes,
but they were very comfortable

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:32.710 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:34.710 align:middle line:84%
So they're with the kind of
reptilian kind of people, which

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:37.127 align:middle line:84%
were very different, almost
like a genetic experiment that

00:09:37.127 --> 00:09:38.100 align:middle line:90%
went wrong.

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And then there were the gods
who were much more likeable.

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:42.990 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Hopi,
for one people,

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:44.953 align:middle line:84%
say that actually
without them, we never

00:09:44.953 --> 00:09:47.370 align:middle line:84%
would have made it to Arizona
and the southwest of America

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:50.130 align:middle line:84%
because they're the ones that
guided us from stepping stone

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:51.270 align:middle line:90%
to stepping stone.

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:53.880 align:middle line:84%
As the lands were
sinking into islands,

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.820 align:middle line:84%
we were managed by them, and
they actually refer to them

00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:00.090 align:middle line:84%
as lookers or watches, which
was the cross people that

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:03.570 align:middle line:84%
surrounded the main group
of gods called the Anu.

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:06.195 align:middle line:84%
And it was because of them that
we ended up where we are today,

00:10:06.195 --> 00:10:10.920 align:middle line:84%
and we honor their houses in the
place in the sky called Orion,

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.950 align:middle line:84%
specifically, the
belt stars always.

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:15.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's interesting.

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.610 align:middle line:84%
I've been researching
another person's work

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:19.230 align:middle line:84%
for another interview
who's looking

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:21.810 align:middle line:84%
at divine birth,
immaculate conception,

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:23.940 align:middle line:84%
and so forth beginning
with the watchers

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:27.090 align:middle line:84%
and talking about
how is it possible

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:30.690 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking about
inter-dimensional beings, gods

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:37.305 align:middle line:84%
in your term, that were
essentially using men as stand

00:10:37.305 --> 00:10:39.810 align:middle line:90%
ins, priests and royalty?

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:42.600 align:middle line:84%
This is what she's
proposing as a possibility.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.540 align:middle line:84%
Using the priests or the
royalty of the day as stand

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:50.520 align:middle line:84%
ins to imbue their energy
through into this sacred sexual

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:56.420 align:middle line:84%
experience to create the
human lineage of these larger,

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:58.838 align:middle line:90%
taller, statued gods.

00:10:58.838 --> 00:11:01.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I found something
that's very similar to that.

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:02.547 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
it would certainly

00:11:02.547 --> 00:11:04.610 align:middle line:84%
allow for the act
itself to happen

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:06.360 align:middle line:84%
and for the birth
to even happen.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how can it happen, a
giant and a 5' female or 4' 10"

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.160 align:middle line:90%
female?

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: It didn't end well--

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:12.680 align:middle line:90%
excuse me--

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:13.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so wouldn't
it have been crafted to--

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:14.633 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: --in any culture.

00:11:14.633 --> 00:11:16.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --having been
done another way ultimately?

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:18.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I think they
found a way around it,

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:20.390 align:middle line:84%
and the Egyptians still
give us a bit of a clue

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:23.210 align:middle line:84%
as to what was happening because
they talk about after the flood

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:26.182 align:middle line:84%
that there was a lineage of
half human, half divine people.

00:11:26.182 --> 00:11:27.890 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, they
survived because they

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:29.600 align:middle line:84%
talk about the
first, and I quote,

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.150 align:middle line:84%
the first pharaoh of
purely human bloodline

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:35.085 align:middle line:84%
taking up the throne in
3,000 BC, which was Menna,

00:11:35.085 --> 00:11:36.020 align:middle line:90%
and that's on record.

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:36.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:38.795 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So before that,
there was a half and half,

00:11:38.795 --> 00:11:40.200 align:middle line:90%
so they must have succeeded.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.000 align:middle line:90%
And there was a--

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that might
where this other story is kind

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:42.740 align:middle line:90%
coming in.

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:44.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: That's where' the story
comes in, and they were saying

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:45.930 align:middle line:90%
in order to--

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:48.273 align:middle line:84%
because most of the gods
also died during the flood.

00:11:48.273 --> 00:11:49.190 align:middle line:90%
Let's not forget that.

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:50.660 align:middle line:90%
They were in human form.

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:52.160 align:middle line:84%
They succumbed to
the same problems.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:52.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:53.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Just
because they were--

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:54.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These are
invisible forms.

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:55.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --they could
manipulate nature

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.950 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean they can get away
with what we get away with.

00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:00.020 align:middle line:84%
But a few volunteered
to stay behind

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.900 align:middle line:84%
to give humans the
accouterments of civilization.

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And there were few in
number, so they said, well,

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:07.760 align:middle line:84%
we can't keep interbreeding
because our speciality is

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.540 align:middle line:84%
literally in the blood,
that kind of blue blood.

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:11.720 align:middle line:90%
It is a special trait.

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.908 align:middle line:84%
That's what gave him
the ability to see far

00:12:13.908 --> 00:12:15.200 align:middle line:90%
without traveling as they said.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.075 align:middle line:84%
They could see on the
other side of the world

00:12:17.075 --> 00:12:18.830 align:middle line:84%
just like any good
psychic can do.

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:20.670 align:middle line:90%
They could move things at will.

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:22.612 align:middle line:84%
So in order to keep
that bloodline going,

00:12:22.612 --> 00:12:23.570 align:middle line:90%
they had to interbreed.

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:26.420 align:middle line:84%
That's not going to do too
well when you're in human form

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.700 align:middle line:84%
because the DNA
starts to degenerate.

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:30.830 align:middle line:84%
So there was some
experiments that were done.

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:33.200 align:middle line:84%
This is where the fallen
watchers kind of come in,

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.095 align:middle line:84%
that story of a small group of
watchers that said, actually,

00:12:36.095 --> 00:12:37.970 align:middle line:84%
we're not going to do
what you're telling us.

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:39.595 align:middle line:84%
We're going to defy
orders and hang out

00:12:39.595 --> 00:12:41.972 align:middle line:84%
with women because they are
cute down here on Earth.

00:12:41.972 --> 00:12:44.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what they were
like, where it came from.

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:45.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're talking
about more of the Urantia work

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:46.130 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:46.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:49.413 align:middle line:84%
And that's where it all kind
of went very, very wrong.

00:12:49.413 --> 00:12:50.830 align:middle line:84%
So I think they
learned from that.

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:53.322 align:middle line:84%
It was a process of constant
reworking and reworking.

00:12:53.322 --> 00:12:54.280 align:middle line:90%
But it got to a point--

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So both these
stories can be true and live

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:56.120 align:middle line:90%
alongside--

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:56.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Absolutely.

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.085 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --one another
as an evolutionary--

00:12:58.085 --> 00:13:00.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Yeah, they did
keep the bloodline going

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:04.840 align:middle line:84%
because obviously that's where
the kingly culture comes from.

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:07.470 align:middle line:84%
The dragon bloodline
of the Chinese,

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:08.750 align:middle line:90%
that's where it comes from.

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:10.167 align:middle line:84%
The Naga people
from India, that's

00:13:10.167 --> 00:13:12.417 align:middle line:84%
where it all goes back to,
and they were all connected

00:13:12.417 --> 00:13:13.730 align:middle line:90%
to the same group of people.

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And it eventually stems in
to Europe for the Merovingian

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:17.570 align:middle line:90%
bloodline.

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:20.450 align:middle line:84%
Now we're into historical
times obviously.

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:21.950 align:middle line:84%
And then it sets
off the whole clash

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:24.400 align:middle line:84%
with the church, which
is a whole other story,

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:25.070 align:middle line:84%
and then you get
the Carolingian.

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:26.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then you get the
movie "The Da Vinci Code."

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:28.040 align:middle line:84%
OK, there you go, and
that ties it all up.

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.665 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: There will
be as test on this.

00:13:29.665 --> 00:13:30.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS] OK.

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:33.350 align:middle line:84%
All right, so all
of that said so we

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:35.600 align:middle line:84%
could see who these
players actually are,

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:37.430 align:middle line:84%
and as we talked
about, they're the ones

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:38.930 align:middle line:84%
called the shining
ones in your book

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:42.290 align:middle line:84%
that are often referred to,
as once the native language is

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:44.990 align:middle line:84%
translated, to something
like the shining one

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:46.500 align:middle line:84%
who have come with
this knowledge.

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.320 align:middle line:90%
So now we're going to go to--

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:51.390 align:middle line:84%
I want to go to that
picture in a minute about--

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:52.190 align:middle line:90%
here it is.

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:54.470 align:middle line:84%
Physically interacted with
the tribe since her days

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:56.810 align:middle line:84%
on Easter Island, which
you already brought up.

00:13:56.810 --> 00:14:00.350 align:middle line:84%
And we have this image
here of these two

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:04.003 align:middle line:84%
people of much darker skin and
then this very pale offspring.

00:14:04.003 --> 00:14:04.920 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And it was
only photographed, what,

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:07.890 align:middle line:90%
140 years ago.

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:08.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:09.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: In New
Zealand, yeah, there's

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:10.815 align:middle line:84%
two-- these two
children of the gods.

00:14:10.815 --> 00:14:12.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Children of the gods.

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:12.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They're
not even Waitaha.

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:14.232 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And they
were known as that

00:14:14.232 --> 00:14:15.490 align:middle line:10%
in their tribe in that day.

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:16.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, absolutely.

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:16.940 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:19.523 align:middle line:84%
They were the offspring of the
gods because they intermarried,

00:14:19.523 --> 00:14:20.981 align:middle line:84%
and they intermarried
successfully.

00:14:20.981 --> 00:14:23.356 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, they're not even--
the people in the picture

00:14:23.356 --> 00:14:24.380 align:middle line:10%
are not even Waitaha.

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:27.680 align:middle line:10%
They're Ngati Hotu, another
culture in New Zealand.

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.870 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there's 15
tribes in New Zealand

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:32.203 align:middle line:84%
that all claim to have been
there before the Maori would

00:14:32.203 --> 00:14:34.160 align:middle line:90%
show up very late in the story.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.710 align:middle line:84%
It's a huge political
minefield, by the way, that I

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:38.760 align:middle line:90%
walked into when I put that in.

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:41.990 align:middle line:84%
But they were saying, yes,
these were the fairy people

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:44.240 align:middle line:84%
as they called them because
they were fair-skinned.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the
people like James Cook

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:49.032 align:middle line:84%
found when they
went to Fiji and all

00:14:49.032 --> 00:14:50.240 align:middle line:90%
the islands of the Polynesia.

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.880 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, we're
expecting dark-skinned people

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.630 align:middle line:84%
in Polynesian, and behold,
60% of the people in Tahiti

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:58.118 align:middle line:90%
were blonde and blue-eyed.

00:14:58.118 --> 00:14:59.160 align:middle line:90%
Where did that come from?

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.077 align:middle line:84%
So it frightened the
hell out of the Europeans

00:15:01.077 --> 00:15:03.740 align:middle line:84%
when they got there to find
these Scandinavian type looking

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:06.380 align:middle line:84%
people in the middle of
nowhere, but they still

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:07.530 align:middle line:90%
had those special powers.

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:08.330 align:middle line:90%
They would--

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:10.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Talk about the
special powers a little bit.

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:12.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It was literally to
do with the forces of nature

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:12.650 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:14.233 align:middle line:84%
These people had a
certain connection.

00:15:14.233 --> 00:15:16.492 align:middle line:84%
Again, it was in
the blood literally.

00:15:16.492 --> 00:15:17.700 align:middle line:90%
Their power was in the blood.

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:20.300 align:middle line:84%
It gave them a special
ability that you and I

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:23.480 align:middle line:84%
have to develop using
certain techniques.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:24.750 align:middle line:90%
But for them, it was natural.

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:26.240 align:middle line:90%
It was second nature.

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And they could
heal with a touch.

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:29.393 align:middle line:90%
They could see far.

00:15:29.393 --> 00:15:31.310 align:middle line:84%
They could channel very
easily between worlds,

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:33.650 align:middle line:84%
so their communication
channel was very clear.

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:36.950 align:middle line:84%
So they were held to be the
spirit leaders of each tribe,

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:39.110 align:middle line:84%
and they were given
dominion over the knowledge

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:41.720 align:middle line:84%
that they had acquired over
many thousands of years.

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And they were guarding
this information.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.670 align:middle line:84%
So for them, they were given
special status within the tribe

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:50.000 align:middle line:84%
because through them, the tribe
learned from the information

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.740 align:middle line:84%
that they were getting from the
gods, who are now not coming

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:53.860 align:middle line:90%
in physical form.

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:55.560 align:middle line:84%
They're now only
downloading information

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:58.080 align:middle line:84%
through the wisdom keeper
of the tribe because--

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.852 align:middle line:84%
and I asked us once in one
of my meditation-- actually.

00:16:00.852 --> 00:16:02.310 align:middle line:84%
It's a channeling
group in England.

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:04.537 align:middle line:84%
I said, what happened
to all of these gods?

00:16:04.537 --> 00:16:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well,
we stopped coming

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:09.540 align:middle line:84%
because we had to come in
physical form to be on Earth.

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:12.090 align:middle line:84%
We could take on physical
form whenever we wanted to,

00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:14.280 align:middle line:84%
and I've heard that many
times in many cultures

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:15.420 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:17.292 align:middle line:84%
And they said, from
now on, we just

00:16:17.292 --> 00:16:19.500 align:middle line:84%
communicate with a shaman
of the tribe or someone who

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.283 align:middle line:84%
is an open channel that
can receive the information

00:16:22.283 --> 00:16:23.200 align:middle line:90%
because you know what?

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.998 align:middle line:90%
Being in human form, it hurts.

00:16:24.998 --> 00:16:26.790 align:middle line:84%
And we're getting tired
of being crucified,

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:28.890 align:middle line:84%
and that was the exact
words that they used.

00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:29.155 align:middle line:90%
Incredible.

00:16:29.155 --> 00:16:30.072 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:16:30.072 --> 00:16:33.450 align:middle line:84%
You know, you and I did an
interview on some of this

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:36.120 align:middle line:84%
on my site, and I
recently-- someone went

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.700 align:middle line:84%
back and watched it, so it's
over a year old I think.

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And they said, so are
the shining ones still

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:44.670 align:middle line:90%
here on Earth today, right?

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:46.745 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I'd let
you field that answer.

00:16:46.745 --> 00:16:47.870 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't for me to answer.

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:49.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: In a matter
of speaking, yes.

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:50.670 align:middle line:90%
They're all around.

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:52.200 align:middle line:90%
They're all around.

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.540 align:middle line:84%
The going back to
my initial work

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:57.300 align:middle line:84%
with crop circles, that was the
first information we received.

00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:59.850 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I should say
my colleague received.

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:01.770 align:middle line:84%
She's an extraordinary
channeler who

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:04.829 align:middle line:84%
works with the police
to solve missing people,

00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:06.720 align:middle line:90%
and crimes, and all that stuff.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:10.470 align:middle line:84%
A huge percentage, high
percentage, of accuracy,

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:12.510 align:middle line:84%
and she inadvertently
vectors the information

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:14.640 align:middle line:84%
from this group called
the watchers who also say,

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:17.079 align:middle line:84%
well, we've been around
in your Earth's history

00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:20.192 align:middle line:84%
if you care look for your
indigenous peoples' records.

00:17:20.192 --> 00:17:21.900 align:middle line:84%
And they nicknamed us
the shining people,

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:25.349 align:middle line:84%
the shining ones, because
of the fact that when we're

00:17:25.349 --> 00:17:28.800 align:middle line:84%
in human form, we had to smear
this substance, this oil,

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.740 align:middle line:84%
on our skin, which gave
us a shining appearance.

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:33.645 align:middle line:84%
You know this from
the "Book of Enoch,"

00:17:33.645 --> 00:17:35.520 align:middle line:84%
who is-- that's not his
real name by the way.

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.620 align:middle line:90%
His real name is Enmed-Ur-Annu.

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:39.722 align:middle line:84%
He was one of the Anunnaki,
the original scribe.

00:17:39.722 --> 00:17:41.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That question's
coming up here.

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:41.760 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:42.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, good.

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:44.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm being psychic now.

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:45.497 align:middle line:84%
And he said, yeah,
the reason why

00:17:45.497 --> 00:17:47.580 align:middle line:84%
we're called the shining
people-- it's a nickname.

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:48.710 align:middle line:90%
It's an aphorism.

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:51.168 align:middle line:84%
It says, yeah, they're shiny
because they look like they're

00:17:51.168 --> 00:17:53.520 align:middle line:84%
glowing, but it also
defined their status

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.950 align:middle line:84%
as very advanced people
because shining is

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:57.300 align:middle line:90%
that euphemism for knowledge.

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:59.850 align:middle line:84%
When you have knowledge,
you had this glow about you.

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:01.680 align:middle line:84%
And they're saying,
we just decided

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.390 align:middle line:84%
that it hurts being
in physical form,

00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:06.000 align:middle line:84%
and now in order to give you
the information that you need

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.560 align:middle line:84%
to develop as humans
because you're

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.480 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of huge
changes right now,

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.340 align:middle line:84%
you really are-- you
can't get out of it.

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:15.270 align:middle line:84%
What you can do is emulate the
end result. It's going to--

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:16.428 align:middle line:90%
change is upon you.

00:18:16.428 --> 00:18:17.970 align:middle line:84%
It's how you handle
the change that's

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:21.028 align:middle line:84%
important because we had the
same problem too when we there.

00:18:21.028 --> 00:18:22.820 align:middle line:84%
It was called a big
flood, and we survived.

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:25.410 align:middle line:84%
So you-- you know, whatever
comes your way in the next 20

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:27.187 align:middle line:90%
years, you'll have the tools.

00:18:27.187 --> 00:18:28.770 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to
give it information

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:32.050 align:middle line:84%
through images, books,
people getting down,

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:35.790 align:middle line:84%
learning the right information,
and then you have to act on it.

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:37.320 align:middle line:84%
This is why I always
say to people,

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:40.362 align:middle line:84%
you know, I don't always
give credit to myself

00:18:40.362 --> 00:18:41.820 align:middle line:84%
for writing all
the books that I do

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:44.437 align:middle line:84%
because the information seems
to come from somewhere else.

00:18:44.437 --> 00:18:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder where
did that come from?

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:48.103 align:middle line:84%
That's a weird connection,
and I'll write it down.

00:18:48.103 --> 00:18:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'll research
it, and it's there.

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's
still happening.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.828 align:middle line:84%
So the shining ones
are still here.

00:18:53.828 --> 00:18:55.620 align:middle line:84%
And in the matter of
speaking, they're also

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:59.800 align:middle line:84%
making the crop circles, or they
used to make the crop circles.

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:03.040 align:middle line:84%
The phenomena is pretty much
gone for the last 15 years

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:03.840 align:middle line:90%
or so.

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.160 align:middle line:84%
We've got a lot of humans
involved in it now,

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:09.450 align:middle line:84%
but the original core, that's
how they communicated with us.

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And there's technological
information,

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:14.250 align:middle line:84%
which is also being put
into the heads of some

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:16.380 align:middle line:84%
of our scientists,
who have now--

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:18.300 align:middle line:90%
and I can say this on camera.

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:19.800 align:middle line:84%
There are three
groups of scientists

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:23.730 align:middle line:84%
in three countries that have now
built an anti-gravity device,

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:26.310 align:middle line:84%
and that's the channel
information that we got.

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:27.810 align:middle line:84%
We're going to give
you the workings

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:30.550 align:middle line:84%
to a device that defies
the illusion of gravity,

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:31.830 align:middle line:90%
the exact words.

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:33.665 align:middle line:84%
And these scientists
said, actually,

00:19:33.665 --> 00:19:35.790 align:middle line:84%
the picture on the front
cover of your book, if you

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:38.520 align:middle line:84%
built as a three dimensional
model, it defies gravity.

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:41.443 align:middle line:84%
We're just waiting for
the right political moment

00:19:41.443 --> 00:19:43.860 align:middle line:84%
to bring this out because
people that bring this stuff out

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:46.003 align:middle line:90%
tend to, well, die.

00:19:46.003 --> 00:19:48.420 align:middle line:84%
You know, like the guy that
invented the water-powered car

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:48.795 align:middle line:90%
in Seattle.

00:19:48.795 --> 00:19:49.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh my gosh.

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: He gets run
over by his own vehicle.

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:51.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh my gosh.

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:52.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: How does that happen?

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I--

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So, yeah,
you can see how

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:56.370 align:middle line:84%
the people-- just
because you're dead

00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:59.940 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean you can't be
useful, but in their language,

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:02.093 align:middle line:84%
death is a portal to
another dimension.

00:20:02.093 --> 00:20:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's brings
us back to Orion

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:05.940 align:middle line:84%
because in so many
cultures, Orion

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:07.770 align:middle line:84%
was the portal,
especially the belt stars,

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:10.680 align:middle line:84%
was the portal between
our world and the world

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:13.560 align:middle line:84%
of the gods virtually in
every culture in the world.

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't just a
metaphysical concept

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:18.840 align:middle line:84%
or a concept where your soul
travels to after you die,

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:21.780 align:middle line:84%
which is also true just
to make it more confusing.

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:24.090 align:middle line:84%
At one point, they said
there was a technique where

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:27.810 align:middle line:84%
you could go from this world
physically into the belt stars

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:31.060 align:middle line:84%
and from there, boom, into
all parts of the universe.

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:33.660 align:middle line:84%
So there is a definite
physical connection,

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:37.470 align:middle line:84%
and it was withdrawn at
one time within 2,000 years

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:38.538 align:middle line:90%
after the flood.

00:20:38.538 --> 00:20:40.080 align:middle line:84%
And the gods were
saying, well, we've

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:42.300 align:middle line:84%
reestablished
civilization on the Earth.

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:44.190 align:middle line:84%
We've given information
to groups of humans,

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:47.700 align:middle line:84%
and now we're going to
withdraw the ladder to heaven.

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And I suspect they wanted us to
basically be like them one day.

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:52.770 align:middle line:84%
They gave us the
information that we need,

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:54.613 align:middle line:84%
and now you figure
it out because we've

00:20:54.613 --> 00:20:55.530 align:middle line:90%
done the work for you.

00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:56.820 align:middle line:90%
Now you have to apply it.

00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:58.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
usually, as you say,

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:01.560 align:middle line:84%
distributed to those without--
that have those native

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.510 align:middle line:90%
abilities that can easily be--

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:05.100 align:middle line:90%
in fact, I'm flashing on this.

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:06.540 align:middle line:90%
OK, when we were in--

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:08.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to keep
flashing like you.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Boom.

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Boom, boom.

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:13.350 align:middle line:84%
When we were in Sardinia, when
we went into one of the nuraghe

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:16.030 align:middle line:84%
up north, that really
beautiful-- in Santu Antine,

00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:20.160 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was, Santu
Antine, we were in the nuraghe,

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:23.970 align:middle line:84%
and that was one, the kind of
beehive structure, where I had

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:25.500 align:middle line:90%
a chance to meditate inside.

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:27.960 align:middle line:84%
And what I saw were
these taller people

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:33.300 align:middle line:84%
that were training using it as
a training place for the more

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:35.370 align:middle line:90%
enlightened in the tribe.

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:38.700 align:middle line:84%
The local amongst that Sardinian
population of that day,

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:41.100 align:middle line:84%
they were bringing-- and it
was a male in this case--

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:44.160 align:middle line:84%
bringing him in and helping
him to have far vision,

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:46.590 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, and
training them so he would

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:49.330 align:middle line:84%
become the leader who could
connect with them at will then

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:50.130 align:middle line:90%
from--

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:50.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Absolutely

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:51.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --that point on.

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:54.570 align:middle line:84%
So in that sense when this lady
says are the shining ones still

00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:56.100 align:middle line:90%
here, these are--

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:56.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: They kind of are.

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --almost like the
emissaries of the shining ones.

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:00.090 align:middle line:84%
These are people that
have developed the skill

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:01.132 align:middle line:90%
and knowledge themselves.

00:22:01.132 --> 00:22:02.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:05.053 align:middle line:84%
And there's other
towns in Sardinia

00:22:05.053 --> 00:22:06.720 align:middle line:84%
which goes back to
the original research

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:10.880 align:middle line:84%
by Laurence Gardner, talked
about how the lord rings--

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:14.460 align:middle line:84%
oh, the ringed lords, who
were the lords of Anu,

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:18.960 align:middle line:84%
they used to congregate in
these towers, these ring towers.

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And we noticed in
Sardinia that they're not

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:24.150 align:middle line:84%
very good for places
for hiding from an army

00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:26.162 align:middle line:84%
because you can't fit
more than 10 people

00:22:26.162 --> 00:22:27.120 align:middle line:90%
inside these buildings.

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:27.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Maybe, yeah.

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:29.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So what are the other
1,000 people going to do?

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:30.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:32.238 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And then I found
the same thing in Scotland,

00:22:32.238 --> 00:22:34.390 align:middle line:84%
that we had the same
ring forts there.

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:37.150 align:middle line:84%
You can only house a small
group of people inside.

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:40.253 align:middle line:84%
They're not much use as a place
to hide from a massive army,

00:22:40.253 --> 00:22:41.670 align:middle line:84%
and besides, what
you have to do--

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:42.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that wouldn't
be the right profile if you're

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:43.800 align:middle line:90%
trying to hide anyway.

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:44.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:46.037 align:middle line:84%
And you could
basically be-- well,

00:22:46.037 --> 00:22:47.892 align:middle line:84%
you can be surrounded
for two weeks

00:22:47.892 --> 00:22:49.100 align:middle line:90%
and die of starvation anyway.

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:49.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:51.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It's not very useful,
and there were basically

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:54.000 align:middle line:84%
places of congregation
where you learn

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.850 align:middle line:84%
to tune in to a certain
rarefied environment.

00:22:56.850 --> 00:22:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And also in Sardinia,
a lot of those places

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:00.840 align:middle line:84%
were actually
related to the rising

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.810 align:middle line:84%
of Orion along the horizon
with strategic points

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:04.685 align:middle line:90%
on the landscape.

00:23:04.685 --> 00:23:06.060 align:middle line:84%
So there's that
connection again.

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:06.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:07.100 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:09.690 align:middle line:84%
There were, and we documented
that in our series on Sardinia.

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:10.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:11.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now let's just
take a detour for a moment

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:14.430 align:middle line:84%
before we get back to
these unusual people in New

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:17.700 align:middle line:90%
Zealand, anomalous tribe.

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:19.830 align:middle line:84%
Of the Anunnaki,
because, again, a lot

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:23.140 align:middle line:84%
of confusion around the Anunnaki
and where they came from.

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:24.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, god, yes.

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:26.220 align:middle line:90%
It's a minefield.

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:26.730 align:middle line:90%
Again, we tend to focus--

00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:27.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, god, yes.

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:28.605 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: --on the negative.

00:23:28.605 --> 00:23:30.560 align:middle line:84%
It's always the fallen
watchers, and that

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:32.270 align:middle line:84%
means that everybody
was bad people

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:34.050 align:middle line:90%
and did the human experiments.

00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:36.570 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, if you read the real
story, the original story,

00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:39.070 align:middle line:84%
there was a small group of these
watchers who were basically

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:39.870 align:middle line:90%
cross people.

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:41.850 align:middle line:90%
They're masters of certain arts.

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:44.520 align:middle line:84%
Each one was responsible for
knowing something intimately

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:45.720 align:middle line:90%
about the subject.

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:48.017 align:middle line:84%
And they decided to go,
sayonara, we're out of here.

00:23:48.017 --> 00:23:50.350 align:middle line:84%
We're going to hang out with
the humans despite the fact

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:51.450 align:middle line:90%
they were told not to.

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:53.380 align:middle line:84%
That created all
kinds of problems.

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:54.960 align:middle line:90%
That's not what we talk about.

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:57.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are you saying
that's the legacy we know of?

00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:59.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: That's the legacy that
we tend to focus on, whereas

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:03.150 align:middle line:84%
the rest of the story, the 80%
of the story is like, well,

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:07.830 align:middle line:84%
actually, we had the laws of
Anu, who were the hierarchy,

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:09.240 align:middle line:90%
who said that even--

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:10.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sons of
watchers so to speak.

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:11.775 align:middle line:90%
Sons or daughters.

00:24:11.775 --> 00:24:14.192 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: The watchers were the
nickname of the people that

00:24:14.192 --> 00:24:16.080 align:middle line:90%
surrounded the lords of Anu.

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.690 align:middle line:10%
So they had the hierarchy, and
they said even we know things

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:19.860 align:middle line:10%
that the watchers don't.

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:22.122 align:middle line:10%
So once the watchers really
know what they're doing--

00:24:22.122 --> 00:24:24.330 align:middle line:10%
and they know quite a lot,
but once they really know,

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:26.615 align:middle line:10%
then we teach them
something else that we know.

00:24:26.615 --> 00:24:28.740 align:middle line:10%
And even we don't know what
we-- everything those--

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:31.930 align:middle line:10%
because of the lord of Anu
itself knows everything.

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:34.980 align:middle line:84%
So basically, there's this
big hierarchy of people,

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:38.400 align:middle line:84%
and they were basically
in charge of figuring out

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.717 align:middle line:84%
all the accouterments of
knowledge around the world,

00:24:40.717 --> 00:24:42.300 align:middle line:84%
and they acquired
all the information.

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:44.970 align:middle line:84%
They would disseminate
that to different people

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:47.910 align:middle line:84%
at certain points in time,
and they would drip feed that.

00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And it was because of them
that all the ancient cultures

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:53.703 align:middle line:84%
hold these gods in
very, very high esteem.

00:24:53.703 --> 00:24:55.620 align:middle line:84%
So the center of any
culture from whether it's

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:58.680 align:middle line:84%
Hopi, or it's the Nagi
in India, or people

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:02.530 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of Fiji, or Tonga
in the middle of the Pacific,

00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:06.090 align:middle line:84%
they still hold their wisdom
keepers to be umbilical

00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:08.460 align:middle line:84%
cords to the gods
who are from Orion.

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:10.110 align:middle line:90%
It's always about the Anu.

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:12.480 align:middle line:84%
Always about their
association with Orion,

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.540 align:middle line:84%
and it's always the fact that
Orion forms a kind of hearth

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:17.795 align:middle line:84%
at the center of each
tribe because they said

00:25:17.795 --> 00:25:19.170 align:middle line:84%
without the
knowledge that we got

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:22.590 align:middle line:84%
from these intermediaries
from Orion, the gods,

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:25.270 align:middle line:84%
whether the Anunnaki, or
whatever you want to call them,

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:29.820 align:middle line:84%
or the watchers, the groups
that became who they are today,

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:33.510 align:middle line:84%
they would not have the social
structure that the hunter

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:36.150 align:middle line:84%
gatherers lacked back when the
time when they were interacting

00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:37.648 align:middle line:90%
physically with these people.

00:25:37.648 --> 00:25:39.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the story
becomes so interesting

00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:42.430 align:middle line:84%
because it's not just
a shamanic connection.

00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:46.290 align:middle line:84%
The Waitaha, the Hopi said,
no, it's a physical contact.

00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:48.163 align:middle line:84%
We had physical contact
with these people.

00:25:48.163 --> 00:25:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Our predecessors
actually spoke to them.

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:50.910 align:middle line:90%
They came over.

00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:52.090 align:middle line:90%
They sat with us.

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:54.010 align:middle line:84%
They took tea, had the
beer, had the massage.

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:55.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A little mead.

00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:57.427 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And then once in a
while-- yeah, mead especially.

00:25:57.427 --> 00:25:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And then they'd
dump their knowledge

00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:01.300 align:middle line:84%
into the baskets of
knowledge they call them.

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:03.560 align:middle line:84%
And each basket has a
specific type of knowledge,

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:07.190 align:middle line:84%
and that's how our
culture grows, and becomes

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:10.700 align:middle line:84%
more connected to the land, and
also to this social structure

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:13.670 align:middle line:84%
that makes things
united and elegant

00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:15.440 align:middle line:84%
rather than going
around like barbarians,

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:18.045 align:middle line:84%
which is what most people
were doing back in the day.

00:26:18.045 --> 00:26:19.670 align:middle line:84%
The South Americans
have the same story

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:23.610 align:middle line:84%
too before Viracocha and
his seven shining ones

00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:25.610 align:middle line:84%
because that's what they
called them down there.

00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:27.360 align:middle line:84%
You just have to know
Aymara as a language

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:29.270 align:middle line:84%
to understand what
they were called.

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:31.760 align:middle line:84%
They're called the
[AYMARA SPEECH]..

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.350 align:middle line:90%
And there'll be a test on this.

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And they said,
yeah, before that,

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:36.500 align:middle line:84%
we were wandering
around without clothing.

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:38.330 align:middle line:84%
We behaved no
better than animals.

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:39.130 align:middle line:90%
We lived in caves.

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:41.047 align:middle line:84%
We didn't even know how
to eat and grow crops.

00:26:41.047 --> 00:26:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly,
a flood comes along,

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:45.140 align:middle line:84%
Viracocha shows up with
his seven shining ones,

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:48.500 align:middle line:84%
and, boom, we have megalithic
building structure,

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:50.670 align:middle line:84%
architecture,
knowledge of the skies,

00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:52.305 align:middle line:84%
travel, animal
husbandry, agriculture,

00:26:52.305 --> 00:26:54.410 align:middle line:90%
and, hey, we got clothes.

00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:56.310 align:middle line:84%
So they were the
civilizing gods.

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:59.060 align:middle line:84%
So these are people who are
held in extremely high esteem.

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:02.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, OK, so let's
talk about some of the symbolism

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:04.070 align:middle line:84%
in some of the monuments
that were found

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:07.760 align:middle line:84%
in various places of the
world popping up seemingly

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:10.940 align:middle line:84%
unrelated places because
you were talking about some

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:16.190 align:middle line:84%
of the monuments dating back
to the Urukehu in New Zealand

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:20.250 align:middle line:84%
and also the Orion symbolism
at Gobekli Tepe, for example.

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:21.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Ah-ha.

00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:24.495 align:middle line:84%
New Zealand was fabulous
because no one knows anything

00:27:24.495 --> 00:27:25.870 align:middle line:84%
about the history
of New Zealand,

00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:28.250 align:middle line:84%
and then suddenly 20 years
ago, the Waitaha said,

00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:30.300 align:middle line:90%
it's time to put this on paper.

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And when I was there,
my first trip, someone

00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:34.980 align:middle line:84%
gives me a copy of their
knowledge of the book.

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:35.780 align:middle line:90%
And I went, wow.

00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:36.947 align:middle line:90%
How come no one's read this?

00:27:36.947 --> 00:27:37.950 align:middle line:90%
This is incredible.

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:41.945 align:middle line:84%
And six trips later and I
was looking at a place called

00:27:41.945 --> 00:27:43.170 align:middle line:90%
the birthplace of the gods.

00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:45.560 align:middle line:84%
Now who wouldn't want
to go to a place called

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:47.138 align:middle line:90%
the birthplace of the gods?

00:27:47.138 --> 00:27:49.430 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the most wondrous
places I've ever been to.

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:52.520 align:middle line:84%
Three sites made of
limestone outcrops.

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:54.350 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are very natural.

00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:57.180 align:middle line:84%
Any geologists will know this,
but when I went there, I said,

00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:00.590 align:middle line:84%
some of these look like they're
the eroded faces of things.

00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:02.522 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the
mauls, the maul marks

00:28:02.522 --> 00:28:05.105 align:middle line:84%
where people have been banging
away trying to shape something.

00:28:05.105 --> 00:28:07.430 align:middle line:84%
I said, no, these
are not erosions.

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:09.680 align:middle line:84%
These are actually
the eroded shapes

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:12.330 align:middle line:84%
of very definitive objects,
but how do I prove that?

00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:13.827 align:middle line:84%
Well, I read the
grandmother story

00:28:13.827 --> 00:28:15.410 align:middle line:84%
that followed from
that book, and they

00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:17.810 align:middle line:84%
said huge are the
monuments were carved

00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:19.060 align:middle line:90%
at the birthplace of the gods.

00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:19.860 align:middle line:90%
I went, thank you.

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:22.640 align:middle line:84%
Now I have a point of reference,
and I'm not making this up.

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:24.470 align:middle line:84%
And they're talking
about a canvas stone,

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:27.200 align:middle line:84%
so now I'm wondering how old
is the birthplace of the gods

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.188 align:middle line:84%
because back when they
were at Easter Island,

00:28:29.188 --> 00:28:31.730 align:middle line:84%
they were saying they used to
go from South America to Easter

00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:34.280 align:middle line:84%
Island to the birthplace
of the gods in New Zealand.

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:36.560 align:middle line:84%
I thought how long have
they been doing this

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.000 align:middle line:90%
because it's before the flood?

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.490 align:middle line:84%
So using the art of
archaeoastronomy,

00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:44.440 align:middle line:84%
which is where monuments are
memorializing specific dates,

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.220 align:middle line:90%
and this happens in Giza.

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:47.390 align:middle line:90%
It happens in Stonehenge.

00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:48.848 align:middle line:84%
All around the
world, the monuments

00:28:48.848 --> 00:28:51.320 align:middle line:84%
are always looking at a
specific moment in time.

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:53.630 align:middle line:84%
Now we have the technology
to backtrack the sky

00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:54.680 align:middle line:90%
to line things up.

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:57.350 align:middle line:84%
So eventually, I
found the monuments,

00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:59.270 align:middle line:84%
and this one looks
like a sundial

00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:02.103 align:middle line:84%
with a head carved on it
with a face and the nose

00:29:02.103 --> 00:29:03.020 align:middle line:90%
looking up at the sky.

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:04.700 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
that is not nature.

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:06.490 align:middle line:90%
That is man-made.

00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:10.130 align:middle line:84%
And I'd stand there, get a bead,
make a few general alignments,

00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:11.938 align:middle line:84%
and go, OK, let's
backtrack the sky.

00:29:11.938 --> 00:29:12.980 align:middle line:90%
Now what am I looking at?

00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:14.130 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:16.850 align:middle line:84%
So a bit more of
digging up of mythology,

00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:19.873 align:middle line:84%
the two prime constellations of
the Waitaha and Uru Kehu were

00:29:19.873 --> 00:29:22.040 align:middle line:84%
the Southern Cross obviously--
we're in the Southern

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:23.070 align:middle line:90%
hemisphere--

00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:23.870 align:middle line:90%
and Orion.

00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:24.670 align:middle line:90%
Surprise, surprise.

00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:26.420 align:middle line:84%
So I'm thinking
let's look at Orion.

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:28.730 align:middle line:84%
So I'm backtracking the sky,
and nothing's happening.

00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:31.513 align:middle line:84%
And we're getting to 9,000
BC, and I'm going, OK.

00:29:31.513 --> 00:29:33.430 align:middle line:84%
You got to have a lot
of patience in this job.

00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:35.710 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly,
in 10,000-- sorry--

00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:41.330 align:middle line:84%
12,400 BC on the spring
equinox, the first belt stars

00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:43.220 align:middle line:90%
appear right above that stone.

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:44.750 align:middle line:90%
I went, hey, that's pretty good.

00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:47.460 align:middle line:84%
That's right in the middle
of the three driest periods

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:49.520 align:middle line:84%
so in the middle of
the three cataclysms.

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:52.280 align:middle line:84%
But the next time that
the constellation first

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:55.790 align:middle line:84%
appears fully formed
as a full constellation

00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:58.280 align:middle line:84%
above that calendar
stone is exactly

00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:01.610 align:middle line:84%
on the spring
equinox at 10,400 BC.

00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:03.860 align:middle line:84%
And where have we
seen that before?

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:04.730 align:middle line:90%
Giza plateau.

00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:05.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:06.977 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: The same alignment
and the same date.

00:30:06.977 --> 00:30:08.570 align:middle line:84%
So now we've got
a connection here

00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:10.850 align:middle line:84%
because the other monuments
in New Zealand, which

00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:13.100 align:middle line:84%
is on the other side of the
valley, their main goddess

00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:15.650 align:middle line:84%
statue, at the same time that
that calendar stone is looking

00:30:15.650 --> 00:30:17.960 align:middle line:84%
at Orion, she's looking
at the southern cross

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.740 align:middle line:90%
exactly at the same time.

00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:22.850 align:middle line:84%
So it means that the
birthplace of the gods

00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:24.800 align:middle line:84%
is at least as old
as the Ice Age.

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:27.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's get
back to Gobekli Tepe

00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:29.260 align:middle line:84%
because there was
some symbolism there.

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:31.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Yeah, it's
funny how these things

00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:33.710 align:middle line:84%
overlap because now we're
talking about gods in Egypt.

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:35.320 align:middle line:84%
Are they separate
from everybody else?

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:36.737 align:middle line:84%
Turns out they're
not because when

00:30:36.737 --> 00:30:40.073 align:middle line:84%
you discuss the
physiognomy of the Urukehu,

00:30:40.073 --> 00:30:41.990 align:middle line:84%
you're also talking about
the same physiognomy

00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:46.130 align:middle line:84%
of the followers of Horus in
Egypt, the Akhu Shemsu Hor,

00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:48.110 align:middle line:84%
to put them in
their right thing.

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:50.600 align:middle line:84%
It means shining ones,
followers of Horus.

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:53.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, the same people are
also linked to Gobekli Tepe.

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:56.080 align:middle line:84%
We start off, for example,
with the famous pillar

00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:58.820 align:middle line:90%
43, which has vultures on it.

00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:01.900 align:middle line:10%
It has the three bags on it,
but there's another pillar there

00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:04.210 align:middle line:10%
that has a beautiful girdle.

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:06.610 align:middle line:84%
And it has a U
symbol with a belt,

00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:08.890 align:middle line:84%
and it has these H
symbols along the girdle.

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:11.065 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking as a graphic
designer by trade,

00:31:11.065 --> 00:31:12.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm looking at this symbol.

00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:13.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking that
looks suspiciously

00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:16.940 align:middle line:84%
like a symbolic version of
the constellation of Orion

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:18.880 align:middle line:84%
because it looks
like an H. Maybe.

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:22.040 align:middle line:84%
You can't really summarize one
or the other, but I thought,

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:22.970 align:middle line:90%
why not?

00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:24.550 align:middle line:84%
And then one day
when you're looking

00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:28.987 align:middle line:84%
at the natural view of
Gobekli Tepe to the southeast,

00:31:28.987 --> 00:31:30.820 align:middle line:84%
you're looking down to
the plain of Harranu,

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:33.730 align:middle line:90%
which is the plain of the Anu.

00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:37.330 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, in 10,400 BC on the
winter solstice, the first time

00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:40.120 align:middle line:84%
the belt of Orion rises
above the horizon,

00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:41.580 align:middle line:90%
flanked by three stones.

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:44.280 align:middle line:84%
You're thinking, my god,
this is an alignment here.

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And you also have the fact
that you have a connection

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:49.600 align:middle line:90%
between Gobekli Tepe and Giza.

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:53.040 align:middle line:10%
Now Giza, we have to understand,
is the place of Osiris

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:55.000 align:middle line:10%
or the plane of
Osiris, and he is

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.940 align:middle line:10%
associated with the
constellation Sahu, which

00:31:57.940 --> 00:31:59.710 align:middle line:10%
means Orion in Egyptian.

00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:03.010 align:middle line:10%
So Osiris is the embodiment
of the constellation

00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:05.320 align:middle line:10%
of Orion in the earthly form.

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:08.020 align:middle line:10%
And we now know, thanks
to Bauval and Gilbert,

00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:11.320 align:middle line:10%
that on the spring
equinox 10,400 BC,

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:14.200 align:middle line:10%
the pyramids match the
constellation of Orion.

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:18.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, Gobekli Tepe is not the
real name of this location.

00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:19.780 align:middle line:90%
The real name is Portasar.

00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:21.400 align:middle line:90%
You have to know your Armenian.

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:24.360 align:middle line:84%
So I asked some Armenian
friends what does Portasar mean?

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:25.910 align:middle line:90%
They said, well, port is easy.

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:27.220 align:middle line:90%
It means umbilical cord.

00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:28.410 align:middle line:90%
I thought, OK.

00:32:28.410 --> 00:32:30.020 align:middle line:90%
What does asar mean?

00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:30.820 align:middle line:90%
Silence.

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:32.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's got to
mean something.

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:33.070 align:middle line:90%
Said we don't know.

00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:34.450 align:middle line:90%
Never comes up in Armenian.

00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:35.950 align:middle line:90%
I said, you know what?

00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:37.240 align:middle line:90%
Because it's not Armenian.

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:38.050 align:middle line:90%
It's Egyptian.

00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:40.420 align:middle line:84%
It's the original
name of Osiris.

00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:42.250 align:middle line:90%
Osiris is a Greek name.

00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:43.600 align:middle line:90%
Asar is his real name.

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:45.250 align:middle line:90%
So it's Portasar.

00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:46.090 align:middle line:90%
Then you got--

00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:46.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Umbilical
cord to Osiris.

00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:47.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --umbilical
cord of Osiris.

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:49.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, my god,
Orion and Osiris.

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:51.400 align:middle line:90%
Why is it an umbilical cord?

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:53.980 align:middle line:84%
It's that moment where
you get a download

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:57.517 align:middle line:84%
from the management that shows
me the image of a lion going

00:32:57.517 --> 00:32:58.600 align:middle line:90%
through the free pyramids.

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, OK, I'll get
back to get my diagrams out,

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:04.570 align:middle line:84%
and archaeological
surveys, and Google Earth,

00:33:04.570 --> 00:33:07.690 align:middle line:84%
and draw a cord between the
corner of the small pyramid

00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:09.850 align:middle line:90%
of Giza and the large pyramid.

00:33:09.850 --> 00:33:11.980 align:middle line:90%
And guess where it ends up?

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:12.880 align:middle line:90%
Gobekli Tepe.

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.960 align:middle line:90%
So there's your umbilical cord.

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:16.540 align:middle line:84%
So we have these
places, which are

00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:20.650 align:middle line:84%
connected to the same star, the
same gods, the same god that

00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:23.110 align:middle line:84%
described the same
physiognomy, very tall,

00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:26.560 align:middle line:84%
elongated head, red
hair, and always dressed

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:27.760 align:middle line:90%
in very long gowns.

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:30.460 align:middle line:84%
And they're master astronomers,
and they're always associated

00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:31.630 align:middle line:90%
with the flood in mythology.

00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:35.620 align:middle line:84%
So Gobekli Tepe, Giza, and
the Urukehu of New Zealand,

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:38.035 align:middle line:84%
and now all one in the
same group of people.

00:33:38.035 --> 00:33:40.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The thread we
were pulling on in Sardinia

00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:44.350 align:middle line:84%
is that all may hail
from originally having

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:46.535 align:middle line:84%
been on the great
continent of Atlantis.

00:33:46.535 --> 00:33:48.708 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Yeah, and
there's also a connection

00:33:48.708 --> 00:33:50.500 align:middle line:84%
between that and the
Anu as well because it

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:54.100 align:middle line:84%
talks about the giants, the
tall people of Sardinia,

00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:56.500 align:middle line:84%
and some of the giant
offspring that came later.

00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:59.650 align:middle line:84%
And they're also redheaded, and
elongated skulls were there.

00:33:59.650 --> 00:34:02.050 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that the same
designs appeared there

00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:05.080 align:middle line:84%
as they did back in Armenia,
and the area around Armenia

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:05.920 align:middle line:90%
was where--

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:08.590 align:middle line:84%
the general consensus is
where one of the seven

00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:10.360 align:middle line:84%
places where the
Anu used to live.

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:12.130 align:middle line:84%
I figured that much
from my research.

00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:13.989 align:middle line:84%
There were seven
groups around the world

00:34:13.989 --> 00:34:15.520 align:middle line:90%
in islands that are now gone.

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:17.230 align:middle line:84%
So Armenia itself
would have formed

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:18.550 align:middle line:90%
a kind of island territory.

00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:21.670 align:middle line:84%
It separated from everybody
else because the levels

00:34:21.670 --> 00:34:23.980 align:middle line:84%
of the water around it were
much different back then,

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:26.199 align:middle line:84%
and those people,
eventually, after the flood

00:34:26.199 --> 00:34:29.650 align:middle line:84%
are forced around the
Black Sea around Bulgaria.

00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:31.780 align:middle line:84%
By then they called
it Tuatha De Danu.

00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:33.469 align:middle line:84%
The name keeps
changing and morphing.

00:34:33.469 --> 00:34:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, they sailed
south through the Mediterranean

00:34:36.670 --> 00:34:40.420 align:middle line:84%
through Malta where their
progeny also appear.

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:43.183 align:middle line:84%
And 10,000 elongated
skull people

00:34:43.183 --> 00:34:45.100 align:middle line:84%
buried there at one
point, and they eventually

00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:46.310 align:middle line:90%
end up in Sardinia.

00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:49.370 align:middle line:84%
So same mythology, the same
physiognomy, and from there,

00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:50.620 align:middle line:90%
they go to the Basque Country.

00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:53.175 align:middle line:84%
From there to islands, they
become Tuatha de Danann.

00:34:53.175 --> 00:34:54.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tuatha de Danann.

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And then their culture
and their knowledge base

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:00.445 align:middle line:84%
is then passed down to what
became known as druids.

00:35:00.445 --> 00:35:01.575 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:35:01.575 --> 00:35:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's the web or the
wise, and they were dressed

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:05.230 align:middle line:90%
in the same white tunics.

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:08.410 align:middle line:84%
So the druids essentially
are the latter day Anunnaki.

00:35:08.410 --> 00:35:10.945 align:middle line:84%
Not bad people at all
from what we understand.

00:35:10.945 --> 00:35:12.070 align:middle line:90%
And, yeah, the group split.

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:16.935 align:middle line:84%
They went north into Denmark
through the Danube, the Danu.

00:35:16.935 --> 00:35:18.310 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
name comes from.

00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And they eventually
create the physiognomy

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:22.980 align:middle line:84%
of the Nordic people, very tall,
light skinned, blonde hair.

00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:24.880 align:middle line:84%
And they would go around,
wrap around Orkney,

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:27.940 align:middle line:84%
which is where their story
picks up around 6,000 BC.

00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And then they
descend into Ireland.

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:32.230 align:middle line:84%
So in a matter of
speaking, the shining ones

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:36.880 align:middle line:84%
still were around in flesh and
blood until around 2,000 BC

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:38.755 align:middle line:84%
in islands before
they got kicked out

00:35:38.755 --> 00:35:39.880 align:middle line:90%
by another group of people.

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:42.302 align:middle line:84%
So it's all changed down
here on Earth, you know?

00:35:42.302 --> 00:35:44.760 align:middle line:84%
You get to stay for a little
while then someone else creeps

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:46.010 align:middle line:90%
in and takes information over.

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:47.225 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, takes charge.

00:35:47.225 --> 00:35:49.120 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the Maya view
of Orion is called

00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:50.378 align:middle line:90%
the hearth of the universe.

00:35:50.378 --> 00:35:52.670 align:middle line:84%
So now let's get into the
Maya and all of this as well.

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:54.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Oh, the Maya
is where things really

00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:56.780 align:middle line:84%
began to come together because
I was working on the assumption

00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:58.488 align:middle line:84%
that all these gods
and all these stories

00:35:58.488 --> 00:36:00.110 align:middle line:84%
were all separate,
but they're not.

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:02.130 align:middle line:84%
It turns out they're
all overlaid.

00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:05.210 align:middle line:84%
And in the Maya world,
you have so many overlaps

00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:06.332 align:middle line:90%
starting with Egypt.

00:36:06.332 --> 00:36:07.790 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Maya
world can be seen

00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:13.280 align:middle line:84%
as the mixture or the admixture
between Polynesia and the lands

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:14.150 align:middle line:90%
to the east.

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:16.310 align:middle line:84%
The two came together
on both coasts.

00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:19.100 align:middle line:84%
So here, you have the fact that
the Maya, to this very day,

00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:21.620 align:middle line:84%
consider the Orion
constellation as being

00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:23.550 align:middle line:90%
the hearth of the universe.

00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:26.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's formed by an
equilateral triangle that's

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:31.470 align:middle line:84%
formed between three stars,
the Alnilam, Saiph, and Rigel.

00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:33.158 align:middle line:90%
There'll be a test on me later.

00:36:33.158 --> 00:36:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And at the center
of this equilateral

00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:38.510 align:middle line:84%
triangle is M42,
the Crab Nebula.

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And they call that
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:41.800 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:43.790 align:middle line:84%
You've got to have a
throat thing to say this,

00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:45.200 align:middle line:90%
the [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:47.760 align:middle line:84%
Almost like Aku, which
means shining one.

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:50.060 align:middle line:84%
And they call it the
flame of the sky,

00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:53.130 align:middle line:84%
and they say this is the hearth
from where everything grows,

00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:55.430 align:middle line:84%
from where all culture
and the old universe

00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:58.190 align:middle line:84%
comes from, where our
civilization comes from.

00:36:58.190 --> 00:37:01.100 align:middle line:84%
What an incredible admission
to say that human civilization

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:03.860 align:middle line:84%
comes from this nebula
in the middle of Orion.

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:06.980 align:middle line:84%
And I heard that as well said
in the middle of the Pacific

00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:09.260 align:middle line:84%
as well, so the
two stories appear

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:11.150 align:middle line:90%
to coincide quite neatly.

00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:13.490 align:middle line:10%
Now the other contact
here is the fact

00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:16.807 align:middle line:10%
that their god in the flood,
Quetzalcoatl, one of three,

00:37:16.807 --> 00:37:18.140 align:middle line:10%
because we forget the other two.

00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:19.972 align:middle line:84%
We forget it's
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:37:19.972 --> 00:37:21.430 align:middle line:84%
There were three
boats that arrived

00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:23.460 align:middle line:84%
from a sinking land in the
middle of the Atlantic called

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:24.260 align:middle line:90%
Athol.

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:26.370 align:middle line:90%
They liked big words back then.

00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:28.520 align:middle line:84%
Quetzalcoatl's the
most well-known,

00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:31.550 align:middle line:84%
and he was always associated
with a very strong wind

00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:35.090 align:middle line:84%
during the deluge
called hurricane, which

00:37:35.090 --> 00:37:36.370 align:middle line:90%
is where we get the word from.

00:37:36.370 --> 00:37:37.453 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hurricane, yeah.

00:37:37.453 --> 00:37:40.010 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: And his
hometown was Teotihuacan,

00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:42.230 align:middle line:10%
which also is
three main pyramids

00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:45.800 align:middle line:10%
and the way of the soul is
also aligned to Orion's belt

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:48.653 align:middle line:10%
in 10,400 BC in the
winter solstice.

00:37:48.653 --> 00:37:49.820 align:middle line:90%
So you see how they overlap.

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:51.612 align:middle line:84%
Now that you have so
many cultural overlaps

00:37:51.612 --> 00:37:53.660 align:middle line:84%
over different
continents, now you

00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:56.330 align:middle line:84%
begin to realize that the
story is just not disseminated.

00:37:56.330 --> 00:37:59.330 align:middle line:84%
It's part of a long
world tradition.

00:37:59.330 --> 00:38:02.720 align:middle line:84%
These people were all connected
through the same school,

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:04.250 align:middle line:90%
and the same school--

00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:06.272 align:middle line:84%
you know, they survived
a terrible catastrophe.

00:38:06.272 --> 00:38:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And they're the ones that
basically went out on rafts

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:10.040 align:middle line:90%
and said, we'll survive.

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:13.040 align:middle line:84%
We'll stay behind to look
after the few human survivors.

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:16.580 align:middle line:84%
That's why we owe them a modicum
of gratitude for the culture

00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:19.503 align:middle line:84%
that we have today for
better or for worse.

00:38:19.503 --> 00:38:21.545 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't have what we
have today without them.

00:38:21.545 --> 00:38:22.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Indeed.

00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:25.370 align:middle line:84%
And the story continues
with the Hopi.

00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:27.167 align:middle line:84%
They speak of Orion as
the house of wisdom.

00:38:27.167 --> 00:38:28.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Absolutely.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, again, I'm
bringing all these examples up,

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:34.880 align:middle line:84%
and you've given
me this information

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:37.700 align:middle line:84%
and some of the other
people I've interviewed.

00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:41.540 align:middle line:84%
To get back to the
consistency of this story,

00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:44.360 align:middle line:84%
if we're looking at
Orion as the birthplace

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:50.000 align:middle line:84%
of some horrible controlling
entities, we're off base.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And so much of kind of
the new archaeology,

00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:58.490 align:middle line:84%
where people are doing
revisionist history,

00:38:58.490 --> 00:39:01.160 align:middle line:84%
really is skewed toward
the negative in that

00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:03.120 align:middle line:84%
sense, which is a
real shame I think.

00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:04.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It's that
gene in humanity.

00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:06.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it creates kind
of-- it's overlaying conspiracy

00:39:06.830 --> 00:39:07.723 align:middle line:90%
theory, really.

00:39:07.723 --> 00:39:08.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: It really is.

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:09.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does.

00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:09.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And it
goes back to what

00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:12.033 align:middle line:84%
I was saying that when
I started on this path,

00:39:12.033 --> 00:39:13.700 align:middle line:84%
I was also taking
things very literally.

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:17.540 align:middle line:84%
But once you develop a
sense of, well, wherewithal

00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:19.520 align:middle line:84%
and also experience,
you begin to realize

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:23.090 align:middle line:84%
that if you ask the
natives what they meant,

00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:24.530 align:middle line:90%
you get a much clearer answer.

00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well,
it's all symbolic.

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:29.030 align:middle line:84%
It's all metaphorical
because we don't just

00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:30.950 align:middle line:84%
hand you the information
because there

00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:32.242 align:middle line:90%
are good people and bad people.

00:39:32.242 --> 00:39:34.242 align:middle line:84%
And if you give information
to the wrong people,

00:39:34.242 --> 00:39:35.477 align:middle line:90%
they can use it against you.

00:39:35.477 --> 00:39:38.060 align:middle line:84%
So we speak in symbols, and you
have to understand the symbol.

00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of time,
it's the metaphor.

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:41.605 align:middle line:84%
You have to understand
the metaphor.

00:39:41.605 --> 00:39:43.730 align:middle line:84%
It's like we were talking
about earlier, the people

00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:45.320 align:middle line:84%
of the serpent, and
sometimes they're

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:47.960 align:middle line:84%
depicted in Middle
East with reptilian

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:49.520 align:middle line:90%
heads and a human body.

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:51.590 align:middle line:10%
But the same was true
of the Egyptian gods.

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:53.960 align:middle line:10%
There's a god of wisdom
with a head of an ibis

00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:55.257 align:middle line:10%
with the body of a person.

00:39:55.257 --> 00:39:57.590 align:middle line:10%
That does not mean that the
Egyptians were experimenting

00:39:57.590 --> 00:39:58.850 align:middle line:10%
mating birds with humans.

00:39:58.850 --> 00:40:01.768 align:middle line:10%
It just means that because
you had an illiterate society

00:40:01.768 --> 00:40:03.560 align:middle line:10%
and they said, well,
we want to communicate

00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:05.540 align:middle line:10%
with you the importance
of the god of wisdom.

00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:08.078 align:middle line:84%
Now a god of wisdom is
someone who is very elegant.

00:40:08.078 --> 00:40:10.120 align:middle line:84%
Now what do we see around
us that's very elegant?

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:13.640 align:middle line:84%
Ah, the ibis, look at the
way the ibis walks, straight

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:15.500 align:middle line:90%
with the head always up.

00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:17.150 align:middle line:84%
We'll put the head
of the ibis on top

00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:18.608 align:middle line:84%
of the head of the
body of the god,

00:40:18.608 --> 00:40:21.003 align:middle line:84%
and when you see that
image, you know that that

00:40:21.003 --> 00:40:21.920 align:middle line:90%
is the god the wisdom.

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And the hunter gatherers will
go, that makes a lot of sense,

00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:26.480 align:middle line:90%
and that's how they used it.

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And it goes back to the fact
that these reptilian head

00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:31.190 align:middle line:84%
people were the
people of the serpent.

00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And even the Hopi
had the same thing.

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:37.017 align:middle line:84%
In that canyon that I talked
about in the Horseshoe Canyon,

00:40:37.017 --> 00:40:38.600 align:middle line:84%
if you look at one
of the petroglyphs,

00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:41.170 align:middle line:84%
you see the serpent
symbolism down the arm.

00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:44.730 align:middle line:84%
Viracocha has the same serpent
on his shoulder as well.

00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:46.183 align:middle line:84%
They're the people
of the serpent,

00:40:46.183 --> 00:40:48.100 align:middle line:84%
but that doesn't mean
that they were reptiles.

00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:49.550 align:middle line:84%
It means that they
were connected

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:51.370 align:middle line:84%
to the forces of
nature, and that's

00:40:51.370 --> 00:40:53.300 align:middle line:84%
what the tribal people
will say as well.

00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:53.710 align:middle line:90%
Said, no.

00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:54.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
innate wisdom.

00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:54.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:56.668 align:middle line:84%
It's about the wisdom
that comes with it.

00:40:56.668 --> 00:40:58.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
is it in us that

00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:05.230 align:middle line:84%
is choosing to create almost
fairytale-like simple stories

00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:10.030 align:middle line:84%
about this negative race that
has come from Orion to dominate

00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:12.700 align:middle line:84%
humanity, and subjugate
us to their will,

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:14.800 align:middle line:84%
and they're showing up
in the banking industry

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:16.460 align:middle line:90%
here, and on and on?

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:19.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these are very
simple little stories.

00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:21.610 align:middle line:90%
There's no nuance in them.

00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:24.623 align:middle line:84%
They never reflect back to
anything truly historical,

00:41:24.623 --> 00:41:27.040 align:middle line:84%
and I mean, I think that's why
I admire your work so much.

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:29.772 align:middle line:84%
You do go talk to the
elders and the stories that

00:41:29.772 --> 00:41:30.730 align:middle line:90%
have been passed down--

00:41:30.730 --> 00:41:32.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Learn to pronounce
the words correctly.

00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:34.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --yes,
thousands of years.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.930 align:middle line:90%
From the horse's mouth, right?

00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:36.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Yeah, it's
very important.

00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:38.712 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so just in
this conversation today,

00:41:38.712 --> 00:41:41.050 align:middle line:84%
we see that it's
the same story that

00:41:41.050 --> 00:41:43.690 align:middle line:84%
keeps being reflected
back from around the world

00:41:43.690 --> 00:41:46.300 align:middle line:84%
of these beings that
came here, and seeded

00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:48.640 align:middle line:84%
knowledge, and stayed
through the deluge,

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:50.860 align:middle line:84%
and helped us
reseed civilization.

00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:52.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I mean, I'll
give you an example.

00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:55.245 align:middle line:84%
If we go to the archaeological
digs in Mesopotamia,

00:41:55.245 --> 00:41:57.370 align:middle line:84%
they've found that when
they got to the foundations

00:41:57.370 --> 00:42:00.520 align:middle line:84%
of the temples, there were these
little figures called Mezre,

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:03.360 align:middle line:84%
which means watchers, and
they were protective gods

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:06.640 align:middle line:84%
they held together the four
corners of the sacred precinct.

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:08.260 align:middle line:84%
Now if these are
the people that are

00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:10.480 align:middle line:84%
holding the sacred
building together,

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:11.690 align:middle line:90%
they can't be bad people.

00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:13.930 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, the place is
a congregation of evil.

00:42:13.930 --> 00:42:14.940 align:middle line:90%
And this is the library.

00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:16.690 align:middle line:84%
This is where people
got their information

00:42:16.690 --> 00:42:20.560 align:middle line:84%
because the temple was
the epitome of perfection,

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:23.110 align:middle line:84%
and the idea was that when
you went to the temple,

00:42:23.110 --> 00:42:24.820 align:middle line:90%
you drew on that perfection.

00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:27.868 align:middle line:84%
And you left the temple, and you
became as perfect as the temple

00:42:27.868 --> 00:42:30.160 align:middle line:84%
because the temple was a
mirror image of the perfection

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:31.163 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:42:31.163 --> 00:42:32.830 align:middle line:84%
The idea is to make
you a better person.

00:42:32.830 --> 00:42:35.250 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't sound
very nefarious to me.

00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing
with the Hopi as well.

00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:40.210 align:middle line:84%
They said, no, the lookers
are people who are helpers.

00:42:40.210 --> 00:42:42.220 align:middle line:84%
Without them, we wouldn't
have the knowledge

00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:43.360 align:middle line:90%
that we have today.

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:45.490 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't be sitting
around in a cave in November

00:42:45.490 --> 00:42:47.230 align:middle line:90%
every year for 16 days.

00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:49.060 align:middle line:84%
The moment that the
belt star of Orion

00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:51.310 align:middle line:84%
comes to the hole,
the wisdom keeper

00:42:51.310 --> 00:42:53.810 align:middle line:84%
starts talking about
Masis, which, by the way,

00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:55.843 align:middle line:84%
is the original name
for Mount Ararat--

00:42:55.843 --> 00:42:56.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:58.177 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --which
is another story.

00:42:58.177 --> 00:42:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And it talks about
a guy called Sahu

00:42:59.830 --> 00:43:03.430 align:middle line:84%
who was the intermediary
between Earth and Orion,

00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:05.440 align:middle line:84%
who also helped us
during the flood.

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:08.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, Sahu happens to be
the Egyptian word for Orion,

00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:11.980 align:middle line:84%
and he also did talk about a guy
called Anu Sinom, who was also

00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:15.250 align:middle line:84%
the gentleman that helped the
Hopi go from island to island

00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:17.500 align:middle line:84%
to get to the Native
American Southwest.

00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:18.820 align:middle line:90%
He said, he helped us.

00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:21.040 align:middle line:84%
He makes sure that when
you were to grow crops.

00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:22.390 align:middle line:84%
He told us about the
movement of the stars.

00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:23.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Same story
everywhere in the world.

00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:24.997 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: He helped
us, and this is

00:43:24.997 --> 00:43:28.060 align:middle line:84%
why we revere that
our predecessors held

00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:31.090 align:middle line:84%
Orion as a talisman
to which I asked,

00:43:31.090 --> 00:43:32.250 align:middle line:90%
who are your predecessors?

00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:34.610 align:middle line:90%
They said, the Hisatsinom.

00:43:34.610 --> 00:43:37.690 align:middle line:84%
It literally translates as
the very ancient people who

00:43:37.690 --> 00:43:39.760 align:middle line:90%
belonged to a man called Sinom.

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:41.260 align:middle line:90%
His name was Anu Sinom.

00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:42.500 align:middle line:90%
He was one of the Anunnaki.

00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:44.950 align:middle line:84%
So, again, a very
helpful person.

00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:48.280 align:middle line:84%
You and I know them very
well as the Anasazi,

00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:49.930 align:middle line:90%
or maybe it's the Annusazi.

00:43:49.930 --> 00:43:52.810 align:middle line:84%
I haven't found any
reference to connect the two,

00:43:52.810 --> 00:43:55.630 align:middle line:84%
but in Europe, ana
and Anu are basically

00:43:55.630 --> 00:43:57.077 align:middle line:90%
variants of the same word.

00:43:57.077 --> 00:43:58.910 align:middle line:84%
So there may be another
story there as well,

00:43:58.910 --> 00:44:00.160 align:middle line:90%
so that's how it goes.

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:01.660 align:middle line:84%
These people are
not afraid of them.

00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:02.990 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't sound like they were--

00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:03.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:04.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --had fear
instilled into them.

00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And I suspect that this negative
connotation with the serpent

00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:10.000 align:middle line:84%
really comes from the biblical
variation of the story

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.260 align:middle line:90%
where the serpent in Eden--

00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:12.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that was
co-opting of the story--

00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:13.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:14.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --self-imposed
gods, et cetera.

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:16.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I wonder if
that's where it goes back.

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:16.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I'm wondering too.

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:18.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Where the serpent
becomes a symbol of evil,

00:44:18.250 --> 00:44:20.012 align:middle line:84%
and then people
kind of follow that.

00:44:20.012 --> 00:44:21.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, yeah, you got to
read the original story.

00:44:21.970 --> 00:44:22.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's time to
set the record straight.

00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:24.125 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: The
serpent in the story

00:44:24.125 --> 00:44:26.132 align:middle line:84%
was actually a serpent
woman called Tabaeth.

00:44:26.132 --> 00:44:28.090 align:middle line:84%
She was the one that was
the keeper of the god.

00:44:28.090 --> 00:44:29.830 align:middle line:84%
She's one of the
people of the serpent,

00:44:29.830 --> 00:44:32.380 align:middle line:84%
so you're taking the
symbol and then turning

00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:34.010 align:middle line:90%
into a real thing, not the same.

00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:34.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:44:34.810 --> 00:44:36.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And the stories
go into light and dark.

00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:38.530 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's important
to do the research.

00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:39.520 align:middle line:90%
Got to get the whole--

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:40.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As I
said a moment ago,

00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:43.240 align:middle line:84%
set the record straight
because we can't go down

00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:44.388 align:middle line:90%
that old path anymore.

00:44:44.388 --> 00:44:45.805 align:middle line:84%
Now we have new
paths of delusion.

00:44:45.805 --> 00:44:47.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Hasn't done
us very well, has it?

00:44:47.230 --> 00:44:49.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, but we have
new paths of delusion.

00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:53.890 align:middle line:84%
But I have to say, just--
this is just off another path.

00:44:53.890 --> 00:44:56.500 align:middle line:84%
You were talking about
the Anasazi, right?

00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And so having lived in
the Southwest for a while,

00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:01.280 align:middle line:84%
I happened to end up in
this one particular place.

00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:05.080 align:middle line:84%
It was a ceremonial cave, and
there was this amazing being

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:06.793 align:middle line:84%
who had been there
throughout history,

00:45:06.793 --> 00:45:08.710 align:middle line:84%
throughout their history,
and was still there.

00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:09.680 align:middle line:90%
It was kind of sad.

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:10.480 align:middle line:90%
I walked in.

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And my friend and I, she
was also very intuitive,

00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:14.710 align:middle line:84%
we walked in, and
we felt like we're

00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:18.580 align:middle line:84%
walking into one of those
wormholes in a sci-fi film.

00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:22.040 align:middle line:84%
You could feel the resistance
in the field and just the

00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:22.840 align:middle line:90%
almost plasticity.

00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:24.298 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I know
what you're saying.

00:45:24.298 --> 00:45:26.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We walked through
it, and then this voice

00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:28.220 align:middle line:90%
started speaking to us.

00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that this
being has been there all along

00:45:31.450 --> 00:45:34.510 align:middle line:84%
after the departure, then the
subsequent other tribes that

00:45:34.510 --> 00:45:36.370 align:middle line:84%
had arrived there
and come and gone,

00:45:36.370 --> 00:45:38.830 align:middle line:84%
and now tourists,
and now guides that

00:45:38.830 --> 00:45:40.900 align:middle line:84%
are hanging out barking
orders all day long,

00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:44.020 align:middle line:84%
and yet this amazing
being still is there

00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:48.730 align:middle line:84%
for anyone who has the
ability to tune into him.

00:45:48.730 --> 00:45:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And you ask for help,
and help is given.

00:45:51.150 --> 00:45:53.898 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It's a bit like mutual
attraction between lovers

00:45:53.898 --> 00:45:55.190 align:middle line:90%
when they first see each other.

00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:56.980 align:middle line:84%
There's an energy
that you send out,

00:45:56.980 --> 00:45:59.770 align:middle line:84%
and the temples are
built for certain energy.

00:45:59.770 --> 00:46:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And you approach those temples
with a certain frequency,

00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:04.360 align:middle line:84%
a certain note, and
they react in code.

00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:07.470 align:middle line:84%
I get this with people in my
tours, Egypt specifically.

00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:09.250 align:middle line:84%
We get two hours
to be by ourselves

00:46:09.250 --> 00:46:10.450 align:middle line:90%
in the King's Chamber.

00:46:10.450 --> 00:46:12.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't tell people
anything because even

00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:13.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what's
going to happen.

00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:14.440 align:middle line:90%
It's always different.

00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:17.510 align:middle line:84%
You'd be amazed what comes out
of the woodwork so to speak.

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:20.017 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there was one time
in one of my groups where--

00:46:20.017 --> 00:46:21.850 align:middle line:84%
and some of the people
know about my history

00:46:21.850 --> 00:46:24.422 align:middle line:84%
with that building and what
I saw in there as well.

00:46:24.422 --> 00:46:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And I don't really sort of
make a big deal out of it.

00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:28.930 align:middle line:84%
It's, like, my personal
thing, but if anybody asks me,

00:46:28.930 --> 00:46:31.210 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell them that I saw
these people coming out

00:46:31.210 --> 00:46:35.080 align:middle line:84%
dressed just like they did
in the Horseshoe Canyon.

00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:38.590 align:middle line:84%
And they are basically-- they're
memories still in the building.

00:46:38.590 --> 00:46:40.995 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
didn't know this

00:46:40.995 --> 00:46:42.370 align:middle line:84%
when we're doing
this meditation,

00:46:42.370 --> 00:46:45.490 align:middle line:84%
and as I'm starting
to do this meditation,

00:46:45.490 --> 00:46:47.830 align:middle line:84%
I see these people coming
out of the stones dressed

00:46:47.830 --> 00:46:50.800 align:middle line:84%
in white, very tall, and they
got their arms out like this.

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking,
I hope no one is

00:46:52.330 --> 00:46:54.010 align:middle line:84%
feeling about falling
over and cracking

00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:55.052 align:middle line:90%
their heads on the floor.

00:46:55.052 --> 00:46:57.490 align:middle line:84%
That's going to hurt, and
I'll probably get sued.

00:46:57.490 --> 00:47:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, OK, I'll just let
it go, and you do this thing.

00:47:00.310 --> 00:47:01.810 align:middle line:84%
You just get led
where you're going.

00:47:01.810 --> 00:47:05.540 align:middle line:84%
And then afterwards at dinner,
I said, could anybody--

00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:07.410 align:middle line:84%
even if it really
sounds stupid--

00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:08.470 align:middle line:90%
because I like stupid.

00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:11.590 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes that's where
the great ideas start--

00:47:11.590 --> 00:47:13.840 align:middle line:84%
any impressions about
the King's Chamber?

00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:16.000 align:middle line:84%
And six people out of
that group said, you know,

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.350 align:middle line:84%
the moment that you began
saying, blah, blah, blah,

00:47:18.350 --> 00:47:21.490 align:middle line:84%
blah, someone came up
behind me, very tall,

00:47:21.490 --> 00:47:23.850 align:middle line:84%
almost dressed in a white
thing, and they had their arms

00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:24.650 align:middle line:90%
out like this.

00:47:24.650 --> 00:47:27.025 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like I could fall
back and I could trust them,

00:47:27.025 --> 00:47:28.810 align:middle line:90%
and then I left the body.

00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:30.130 align:middle line:90%
And I drew it on a napkin.

00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:32.890 align:middle line:84%
I said that's exactly
what happened.

00:47:32.890 --> 00:47:35.660 align:middle line:84%
So they're actually validating
what I experienced as well,

00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:37.600 align:middle line:90%
so you couldn't make this up.

00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:40.720 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, it's your frequency at
these places that connects you

00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:42.970 align:middle line:84%
to the wisdom keepers,
and it turns out

00:47:42.970 --> 00:47:45.430 align:middle line:84%
if I go back to the stories
of the Waitaha and the fact

00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:48.100 align:middle line:84%
that they had the three
baskets of knowledge,

00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:51.070 align:middle line:84%
which, by the way, the same
three baskets that appear

00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:53.410 align:middle line:90%
on pillar 43 at Gobekli Tepe.

00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:54.295 align:middle line:90%
So there's man bags.

00:47:54.295 --> 00:47:55.420 align:middle line:90%
That's what they represent.

00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:57.460 align:middle line:84%
They are the baskets
of knowledge.

00:47:57.460 --> 00:47:59.710 align:middle line:84%
Each one of those baskets
represents a different group

00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:02.530 align:middle line:84%
of people, and the one that
represents the Great Pyramid

00:48:02.530 --> 00:48:05.050 align:middle line:84%
in relationship to the
belt stars of Orion

00:48:05.050 --> 00:48:06.685 align:middle line:90%
is the wisdom keepers.

00:48:06.685 --> 00:48:07.810 align:middle line:90%
That's where it relates to.

00:48:07.810 --> 00:48:13.120 align:middle line:84%
I think it's Alnitak, the
star, the furthest one.

00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:14.950 align:middle line:84%
Could be wrong, but
that's the one that

00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:16.210 align:middle line:90%
relates to the wisdom keeping.

00:48:16.210 --> 00:48:18.840 align:middle line:84%
That's why people have those
experiences in that pyramid,

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:20.767 align:middle line:84%
and not the middle one,
and not the small one.

00:48:20.767 --> 00:48:22.600 align:middle line:84%
Although, I have to
admit, the small pyramid

00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:24.510 align:middle line:84%
is the more mysterious
of all of them,

00:48:24.510 --> 00:48:26.110 align:middle line:84%
the one that keeps
itself to itself.

00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:27.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To itself.

00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:30.160 align:middle line:90%
For another time, Freddy.

00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:32.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Back on schedule.

00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:33.977 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So as we
look at all of this

00:48:33.977 --> 00:48:36.310 align:middle line:84%
and try to pull ourselves
away because everyone watching

00:48:36.310 --> 00:48:38.140 align:middle line:84%
this has gone down
some conspiracy rabbit

00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:38.940 align:middle line:90%
hole or another.

00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:40.900 align:middle line:84%
I certainly have
done my share of it

00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:44.927 align:middle line:84%
and looking to blame someone for
things that haven't gone well,

00:48:44.927 --> 00:48:47.260 align:middle line:84%
and for what we're seeing
around us in the world instead

00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:49.360 align:middle line:84%
of looking at ourselves,
and our own projections

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:52.790 align:middle line:84%
buy ins and co-creation of the
world that we're living in.

00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:55.900 align:middle line:84%
And I really think it's time to
take back the story that there

00:48:55.900 --> 00:49:00.670 align:middle line:84%
have always been that part
that you see in these beings

00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:03.940 align:middle line:84%
that we see that
they have seeded

00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:05.890 align:middle line:90%
the knowledge to humanity from.

00:49:05.890 --> 00:49:07.850 align:middle line:84%
We have that in
ourselves as well.

00:49:07.850 --> 00:49:09.080 align:middle line:90%
It's just that it's covered.

00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:10.080 align:middle line:90%
It's lying more dormant.

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:10.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: That's the
point they were making.

00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:12.623 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the point
they're trying to do

00:49:12.623 --> 00:49:16.930 align:middle line:84%
is help us when they say
become gods like them is simply

00:49:16.930 --> 00:49:20.230 align:middle line:84%
to open up to our own true self
and our own true knowledge,

00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:21.730 align:middle line:84%
which is connected
to all as well.

00:49:21.730 --> 00:49:23.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Yeah, and I
believe that's the point.

00:49:23.890 --> 00:49:25.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, without
giving away the ending

00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:29.080 align:middle line:84%
of the book too much, that's
where I was going as well.

00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:31.120 align:middle line:84%
Why did the ladder to
heaven get withdrawn?

00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:34.210 align:middle line:84%
Why did they stop coming to
the Waitaha in New Zealand?

00:49:34.210 --> 00:49:35.785 align:middle line:84%
Why did they stop
coming to the Hopi?

00:49:35.785 --> 00:49:37.660 align:middle line:84%
Although, they still do
according to Clifford

00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:38.900 align:middle line:90%
Mahooty of the Zuni.

00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:41.690 align:middle line:84%
They still appear in their
sky ships once in a while.

00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:44.040 align:middle line:84%
But mostly, the
communication is subtle,

00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:46.750 align:middle line:84%
is done through the people
who are open in the tribe.

00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, just dawned on me
that the reason why they wanted

00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:52.060 align:middle line:84%
to just leave us with the
basics of information,

00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:54.370 align:middle line:84%
I think they wanted us to
go through this 10,000-year

00:49:54.370 --> 00:49:57.250 align:middle line:84%
experiment because we are
reaching the end of an age

00:49:57.250 --> 00:49:59.140 align:middle line:90%
according to many traditions.

00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:01.660 align:middle line:84%
It's because we have to
be the gods that we've all

00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:02.530 align:middle line:90%
been waiting for.

00:50:02.530 --> 00:50:04.080 align:middle line:84%
The Navajo have a
joke about this.

00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:04.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, they do.

00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:05.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: We're the
ones we're waiting for.

00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:06.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're the ones
we've been waiting for.

00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:06.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: And you know--

00:50:06.850 --> 00:50:07.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just wake up.

00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:09.537 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --because sometimes
we-- the ego gets in the way.

00:50:09.537 --> 00:50:11.260 align:middle line:84%
We go down the rabbit
hole of darkness.

00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:12.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We've been
conditioned through a lot--

00:50:12.550 --> 00:50:13.915 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Darth Vader
is kind of interesting.

00:50:13.915 --> 00:50:14.920 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:18.220 align:middle line:84%
Even Darth Vader comes back
to the light when he dies.

00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:20.440 align:middle line:90%
He is able to redeem himself.

00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:23.470 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is that we
have help all the time--

00:50:23.470 --> 00:50:25.240 align:middle line:84%
books, conferences,
videos, you name it.

00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:27.915 align:middle line:84%
It's all there,
shamanic communication.

00:50:27.915 --> 00:50:29.290 align:middle line:84%
I think the idea
was that they're

00:50:29.290 --> 00:50:32.380 align:middle line:84%
going to leave us alone to
figure it out for ourselves,

00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:35.360 align:middle line:84%
and at the end of this cycle,
we're going to make it.

00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:36.160 align:middle line:90%
I know we do.

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:37.540 align:middle line:90%
I see more positive things--

00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:37.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, me too.

00:50:37.810 --> 00:50:38.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --happening
around the world--

00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:38.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, absolutely.

00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:39.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: --that never--

00:50:39.690 --> 00:50:39.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:42.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --make the news
because, well, good news

00:50:42.130 --> 00:50:43.760 align:middle line:84%
never makes the news
because there's no conflict.

00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:45.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If it doesn't
bleed, it doesn't lead, right?

00:50:45.810 --> 00:50:46.765 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, I like that.

00:50:46.765 --> 00:50:47.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what it's called.

00:50:47.770 --> 00:50:48.978 align:middle line:90%
I'm from the newsroom, right?

00:50:48.978 --> 00:50:50.420 align:middle line:90%
If it bleeds, it leads.

00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:51.610 align:middle line:90%
That's the motto, right?

00:50:51.610 --> 00:50:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And if it doesn't
bleed, it doesn't lead.

00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And so, I mean, we
can place our energy

00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:58.900 align:middle line:84%
on all the
conspiracies, on what we

00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:02.470 align:middle line:84%
consider the Anunnaki as
these evil reptilian or not

00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:04.040 align:middle line:84%
beings that have
come to control us

00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:05.080 align:middle line:90%
and are still controlling us.

00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:06.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Which the old people
would all disagree with, so.

00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:08.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can go
on and on right down

00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:11.170 align:middle line:84%
to whatever we call
elites, and cabal,

00:51:11.170 --> 00:51:14.680 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, and
essentially concretize

00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:16.930 align:middle line:84%
that feeling and that
image that we're powerless

00:51:16.930 --> 00:51:19.210 align:middle line:84%
little people on
this planet, or we

00:51:19.210 --> 00:51:21.460 align:middle line:84%
can start actually educating
ourselves and finding out

00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:26.740 align:middle line:84%
grace, knowledge has always been
with us, in us, and among us

00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:29.800 align:middle line:84%
and start tapping back into
that and put our energies there

00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:32.170 align:middle line:84%
waking up to that knowledge
that's already within us.

00:51:32.170 --> 00:51:33.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Yeah, and
everything that you

00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:36.028 align:middle line:84%
read today is nothing new
from what they were writing

00:51:36.028 --> 00:51:38.380 align:middle line:90%
about in Egypt 8,000 years ago.

00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:40.790 align:middle line:84%
Now that we can access the
pyramid text and the building

00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:41.590 align:middle line:90%
text.

00:51:41.590 --> 00:51:44.048 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they've always
been greedy and corrupt people

00:51:44.048 --> 00:51:44.890 align:middle line:90%
among us and forces.

00:51:44.890 --> 00:51:45.710 align:middle line:90%
They're always there.

00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:48.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: That's why they make
it difficult for the information

00:51:48.010 --> 00:51:49.540 align:middle line:90%
to be just accessed like that--

00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:50.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:51:50.050 --> 00:51:51.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --because you've
got to go for the training.

00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:54.130 align:middle line:84%
You got to have integrity
and responsibility.

00:51:54.130 --> 00:51:56.770 align:middle line:84%
Once they figure that
out, that you've got that,

00:51:56.770 --> 00:51:59.050 align:middle line:84%
we'll give them another
piece of information

00:51:59.050 --> 00:52:00.700 align:middle line:90%
and let them grow a bit by bit.

00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:02.575 align:middle line:84%
And it even got to the
point where they said,

00:52:02.575 --> 00:52:04.330 align:middle line:84%
you know, after several
years of training,

00:52:04.330 --> 00:52:09.710 align:middle line:84%
you have the ability now to go
to Orion on a physical metal

00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:10.510 align:middle line:90%
throne.

00:52:10.510 --> 00:52:11.310 align:middle line:84%
They call it
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:52:11.310 --> 00:52:12.940 align:middle line:84%
I hope I'm pronouncing
this right.

00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:16.360 align:middle line:84%
And the [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],,
kind of a vessel that connects

00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:19.300 align:middle line:84%
you through the Milky Way
to the belt stars of Orion.

00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And they said, and this
is in the pyramid texts,

00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:23.622 align:middle line:84%
you could go there, and
sit on this metal throne,

00:52:23.622 --> 00:52:27.100 align:middle line:84%
and actually go and end up being
in Orion, the land of the gods.

00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:28.540 align:middle line:90%
And once in a while--

00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:30.410 align:middle line:84%
and I've heard this
in several cultures

00:52:30.410 --> 00:52:32.590 align:middle line:84%
now that every once in
a while, the gods would

00:52:32.590 --> 00:52:35.680 align:middle line:84%
send a lucky human with
them to the belt stars

00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:38.500 align:middle line:84%
to look at that world and say,
hey, this is what we've done.

00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:41.675 align:middle line:84%
Now go back and tell
the hunter gatherers

00:52:41.675 --> 00:52:43.050 align:middle line:84%
that you can do
better than this.

00:52:43.050 --> 00:52:44.508 align:middle line:84%
And one person
would always go back

00:52:44.508 --> 00:52:46.460 align:middle line:90%
with their eyes illuminated.

00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:48.130 align:middle line:84%
Like, you won't
believe what I've just

00:52:48.130 --> 00:52:49.227 align:middle line:90%
seen that is possible.

00:52:49.227 --> 00:52:50.810 align:middle line:84%
We're the ones we've
been waiting for.

00:52:50.810 --> 00:52:52.570 align:middle line:84%
We have the
potential to do this,

00:52:52.570 --> 00:52:54.890 align:middle line:84%
and they will become the
wisdom keepers of the tribe.

00:52:54.890 --> 00:52:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And slowly, you see these
groves of civilization

00:52:57.490 --> 00:53:00.265 align:middle line:84%
appearing in hot spots
spontaneously around the world.

00:53:00.265 --> 00:53:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And of course, after a
while, it falls apart,

00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:04.450 align:middle line:84%
and then it gets
reconstituted because that's

00:53:04.450 --> 00:53:05.860 align:middle line:90%
what happens here on Earth.

00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:08.620 align:middle line:84%
It's order and chaos
and order and chaos,

00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:10.330 align:middle line:84%
which brings us
back to the present.

00:53:10.330 --> 00:53:13.090 align:middle line:84%
If you think there's a lot
of chaos happening right now,

00:53:13.090 --> 00:53:15.340 align:middle line:84%
think of the
potential of the jump

00:53:15.340 --> 00:53:16.810 align:middle line:90%
to a greater level of order.

00:53:16.810 --> 00:53:19.180 align:middle line:84%
Any physicist that will hear
this will understand this.

00:53:19.180 --> 00:53:19.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Always chaos first.

00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:21.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They'll
say chaos and order,

00:53:21.460 --> 00:53:24.240 align:middle line:84%
but the greater amount
of chaos, the greater--

00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:24.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The greater
amount of order.

00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:26.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --the
potential jump to order.

00:53:26.050 --> 00:53:26.925 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:53:26.925 --> 00:53:29.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: The potential that
we're sitting on is huge.

00:53:29.170 --> 00:53:30.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I totally
agree with you.

00:53:30.190 --> 00:53:31.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So this
is why religion was

00:53:31.690 --> 00:53:34.720 align:middle line:84%
invented to prevent us from
being the gods who we really

00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:35.560 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:38.590 align:middle line:84%
Even Jesus said, no, the
temple is here, not out there.

00:53:38.590 --> 00:53:39.470 align:middle line:90%
God is not out there.

00:53:39.470 --> 00:53:40.390 align:middle line:90%
God's in here.

00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:41.590 align:middle line:90%
You can do this.

00:53:41.590 --> 00:53:42.910 align:middle line:90%
We're very powerful people.

00:53:42.910 --> 00:53:44.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We are, indeed.

00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:46.970 align:middle line:84%
We're on the same page on
this, and I think right now

00:53:46.970 --> 00:53:50.320 align:middle line:84%
the minefield is to get around
the pretenders, and charlatans,

00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:54.842 align:middle line:84%
and people that simply wish to
be elevated in their own minds

00:53:54.842 --> 00:53:55.800 align:middle line:90%
and elevated by others.

00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:56.883 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: And at lunchtime.

00:53:56.883 --> 00:53:58.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
and at lunchtime.

00:53:58.450 --> 00:54:00.110 align:middle line:90%
We need to get away from this.

00:54:00.110 --> 00:54:02.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: As Obi Wan said,
if you strike me down,

00:54:02.110 --> 00:54:04.360 align:middle line:84%
I'll become more powerful than
you could possibly imagine.

00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:05.830 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because you're
over at the other side.

00:54:05.830 --> 00:54:06.670 align:middle line:90%
You're not dead.

00:54:06.670 --> 00:54:09.430 align:middle line:84%
You're just in a different form,
and you're issuing information

00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:10.360 align:middle line:90%
to the people here.

00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:11.693 align:middle line:90%
And you're going, OK, thank you.

00:54:11.693 --> 00:54:12.620 align:middle line:90%
I'll write that down.

00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:14.770 align:middle line:84%
I'll write a book, and,
hey, people are now

00:54:14.770 --> 00:54:15.845 align:middle line:90%
learning the information.

00:54:15.845 --> 00:54:16.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:17.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: That's how it works.

00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:17.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does.

00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:19.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: It's like a joke.

00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:19.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:22.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: People get hurt,
but it's a big play.

00:54:22.330 --> 00:54:23.740 align:middle line:90%
Shakespeare had it right.

00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:24.820 align:middle line:90%
All the world's a stage.

00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:26.680 align:middle line:90%
He was absolutely right.

00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:28.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know, I
woke up not long ago.

00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:30.400 align:middle line:84%
I guess it was two or three
months ago, and I thought,

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:33.180 align:middle line:84%
you know, I'm so sick of hearing
about this pyramid of power,

00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:35.560 align:middle line:84%
about the elite at the top
and the poor little minions

00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:36.440 align:middle line:90%
at the bottom.

00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:37.982 align:middle line:10%
So what I did was
I flipped it, and I

00:54:37.982 --> 00:54:39.910 align:middle line:10%
had a graphic artist flip it.

00:54:39.910 --> 00:54:43.390 align:middle line:10%
And the people that have seen
it resonate so deeply with it

00:54:43.390 --> 00:54:45.300 align:middle line:10%
because it is truthful.

00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:47.650 align:middle line:84%
It's showing humanity
in the spectrum

00:54:47.650 --> 00:54:49.810 align:middle line:84%
of our talents, skills,
loves, and desires,

00:54:49.810 --> 00:54:52.380 align:middle line:90%
and connection with one another.

00:54:52.380 --> 00:54:53.870 align:middle line:90%
There are 7 billion of us.

00:54:53.870 --> 00:54:56.740 align:middle line:84%
We're at the top of the pyramid,
and it's an inverted pyramid.

00:54:56.740 --> 00:54:59.030 align:middle line:84%
The chubby part's
here, and at the very,

00:54:59.030 --> 00:55:01.870 align:middle line:84%
very bottom are the
sad little dark figures

00:55:01.870 --> 00:55:04.230 align:middle line:84%
of the elite standing around
a table signing a document.

00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:05.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: If you bang
on the top long enough,

00:55:05.620 --> 00:55:06.610 align:middle line:90%
the bottom will just crumble.

00:55:06.610 --> 00:55:07.902 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It will just crumble.

00:55:07.902 --> 00:55:09.247 align:middle line:90%
So invert the pyramid.

00:55:09.247 --> 00:55:10.330 align:middle line:90%
That's what I have to say.

00:55:10.330 --> 00:55:10.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Yeah, it's
all an illusion.

00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:12.690 align:middle line:84%
You just have to
flip the idea around.

00:55:12.690 --> 00:55:14.470 align:middle line:84%
And, again, one of
the biggest teachings

00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:17.500 align:middle line:84%
that I found in all of these
wisdom teachings, that, again,

00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:20.470 align:middle line:84%
lead back to Orion and
their spirit houses,

00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:23.610 align:middle line:84%
was the fact that it depends
what you're focusing on.

00:55:23.610 --> 00:55:25.490 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that
you're a physical form.

00:55:25.490 --> 00:55:25.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's all there is.

00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:27.675 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And so are
they where they are.

00:55:27.675 --> 00:55:29.980 align:middle line:84%
It's just that they're in a
different vibration to us.

00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:31.630 align:middle line:90%
They're as physical as we are.

00:55:31.630 --> 00:55:34.368 align:middle line:84%
And when you die, you're just
going into the room next door.

00:55:34.368 --> 00:55:35.410 align:middle line:90%
That's what they call it.

00:55:35.410 --> 00:55:36.340 align:middle line:90%
You're going to room next door.

00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:37.298 align:middle line:90%
You're not really dead.

00:55:37.298 --> 00:55:38.380 align:middle line:90%
You're just morphing.

00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:40.180 align:middle line:84%
The point is don't
focus on the negative.

00:55:40.180 --> 00:55:43.652 align:middle line:84%
Don't focus on fear, and
don't hold onto attachments.

00:55:43.652 --> 00:55:45.610 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean you have
to be a robot in life.

00:55:45.610 --> 00:55:47.980 align:middle line:84%
You can still love, and
eat, and drive nice cars,

00:55:47.980 --> 00:55:49.748 align:middle line:84%
and all of that, and
have as much alcohol,

00:55:49.748 --> 00:55:51.790 align:middle line:84%
and all the good things
that come with the Earth,

00:55:51.790 --> 00:55:53.560 align:middle line:90%
but don't overindulge.

00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:55.060 align:middle line:84%
Don't over associate
because that's

00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:56.575 align:middle line:90%
where the trapping comes in.

00:55:56.575 --> 00:55:59.200 align:middle line:84%
Once you get too over associated
with the physical-- and that's

00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:01.510 align:middle line:84%
what happened with the
small group of watchers.

00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:03.760 align:middle line:84%
They said, hey, that tastes
good, and that looks good.

00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:05.052 align:middle line:90%
I think I'll have more of that.

00:56:05.052 --> 00:56:06.550 align:middle line:90%
Boom, now you're trapped.

00:56:06.550 --> 00:56:08.080 align:middle line:84%
You want more of
that, and that's

00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:11.260 align:middle line:84%
what seduces you into
the physical world.

00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:14.040 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing wrong per
se, but it can't go anywhere.

00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:16.645 align:middle line:84%
It is a finite level
of development.

00:56:16.645 --> 00:56:18.520 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, if
you see that everything

00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:21.680 align:middle line:84%
is energy and everything is
interconnected, you're free.

00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:23.260 align:middle line:84%
So if someone came
up to me and said,

00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:25.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to shoot you through
the head, I'd go, fine.

00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:27.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to be
in the room next door.

00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:29.118 align:middle line:84%
I can make your life very
uncomfortable for you

00:56:29.118 --> 00:56:31.870 align:middle line:84%
if I really wanted to,
or I could make you--

00:56:31.870 --> 00:56:32.953 align:middle line:90%
wrap you in lots of light.

00:56:32.953 --> 00:56:35.037 align:middle line:84%
And I could drive you crazy
because that's the one

00:56:35.037 --> 00:56:36.250 align:middle line:90%
thing you really can't stand.

00:56:36.250 --> 00:56:37.875 align:middle line:84%
But paradoxically,
that's the one thing

00:56:37.875 --> 00:56:40.220 align:middle line:84%
they need to evolve as
well, so the whole thing

00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:41.350 align:middle line:90%
is a co-operative thing.

00:56:41.350 --> 00:56:42.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It really
is, and we're--

00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:44.697 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: If you see it that
way, it's much easier to live.

00:56:44.697 --> 00:56:47.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, we're in
amazing times of opportunity,

00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:48.820 align:middle line:90%
and I like what you said.

00:56:48.820 --> 00:56:49.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: And we chose it.

00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:50.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We chose.

00:56:50.110 --> 00:56:51.790 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we all chose
to incarnate right now.

00:56:51.790 --> 00:56:52.470 align:middle line:90%
People forget.

00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:52.930 align:middle line:90%
Wait a minute.

00:56:52.930 --> 00:56:55.000 align:middle line:84%
I chose to be here in
this play right now.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.250 align:middle line:84%
But I like what you said
earlier, is the greater

00:56:57.250 --> 00:56:58.630 align:middle line:84%
the chaos, the
greater the order,

00:56:58.630 --> 00:57:01.730 align:middle line:84%
and I would add to it, the
greater the chaos in this case,

00:57:01.730 --> 00:57:03.980 align:middle line:84%
even the higher order
comes out of it.

00:57:03.980 --> 00:57:05.440 align:middle line:84%
So this is our
opportunity to let

00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:07.930 align:middle line:90%
go of all the garbage thinking.

00:57:07.930 --> 00:57:09.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:10.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Power to the people.

00:57:10.330 --> 00:57:11.525 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:57:11.525 --> 00:57:12.400 align:middle line:90%
The people in India--

00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:13.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Power to the
highest part of the people.

00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:13.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: --knew it as well.

00:57:13.870 --> 00:57:16.420 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, if you look at the Indian
ages and how they progressed,

00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:17.720 align:middle line:90%
they're all coming true.

00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:19.960 align:middle line:84%
So if they've come true
so far, read about what

00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:21.370 align:middle line:90%
the next age is going to be.

00:57:21.370 --> 00:57:22.930 align:middle line:90%
The potential is right there.

00:57:22.930 --> 00:57:25.010 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't need 50% of
the population to get it.

00:57:25.010 --> 00:57:27.730 align:middle line:84%
It needs a tiny fraction
of the population.

00:57:27.730 --> 00:57:30.550 align:middle line:84%
Like the Maharishi
project where 1%

00:57:30.550 --> 00:57:33.550 align:middle line:84%
of a group of people of the
entire population of Washington

00:57:33.550 --> 00:57:35.830 align:middle line:90%
DC altered the crime rate--

00:57:35.830 --> 00:57:36.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:37.430 align:middle line:90%
I remember.

00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:40.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --in the most
crime-ridden time of the year.

00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:42.250 align:middle line:84%
So if 1% of people
can do that, think

00:57:42.250 --> 00:57:45.097 align:middle line:84%
of what would happen, say,
if an incoming projectile is

00:57:45.097 --> 00:57:46.180 align:middle line:90%
heading towards the Earth?

00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:48.970 align:middle line:84%
Focus on that, move it out of
the way because you know what?

00:57:48.970 --> 00:57:52.150 align:middle line:84%
The people of Orion did the
same thing 12,000 years ago

00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:54.890 align:middle line:84%
when projectiles were
coming this way as well.

00:57:54.890 --> 00:57:56.440 align:middle line:84%
But this time,
they had to get rid

00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:59.450 align:middle line:84%
of the crazy people that were
running people into the ground,

00:57:59.450 --> 00:58:01.810 align:middle line:84%
or I should say running
the humans into the ground.

00:58:01.810 --> 00:58:04.810 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, humans would
never rose to the challenge.

00:58:04.810 --> 00:58:06.570 align:middle line:90%
Sound like good people to me.

00:58:06.570 --> 00:58:08.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: On that note,
we're out of time.

00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:09.610 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Freddy.

00:58:09.610 --> 00:58:10.630 align:middle line:90%
We'll see you next time.

00:58:10.630 --> 00:58:13.450 align:middle line:84%
I know you're pulling some
threads around Armenia

00:58:13.450 --> 00:58:16.000 align:middle line:84%
and its connections
all the way up north.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:19.307 align:middle line:10%
This is turning-- and the
Armenian language is revealing

00:58:19.307 --> 00:58:20.265 align:middle line:10%
some very interesting--

00:58:20.265 --> 00:58:21.615 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: Yes, I just have
to read the Armenian--

00:58:21.615 --> 00:58:21.920 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: --historical--

00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:23.650 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: --but since we're
not flying very much anyway,

00:58:23.650 --> 00:58:24.880 align:middle line:10%
I've got all the
time in the world.

00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:25.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:26.828 align:middle line:84%
That's your new thing,
studying Armenian.

00:58:26.828 --> 00:58:29.210 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for doing that
on behalf of all of us.

00:58:29.210 --> 00:58:31.630 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, Freddy, thank
you so much for joining us.

00:58:31.630 --> 00:58:32.810 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: We'll have
subtitles next time.

00:58:32.810 --> 00:58:33.610 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:58:33.610 --> 00:58:35.420 align:middle line:10%
Oh, god, he'll be
speaking Armenian.

00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:36.220 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:58:36.220 --> 00:58:38.620 align:middle line:84%
You can find Freddy's
books at major booksellers,

00:58:38.620 --> 00:58:41.530 align:middle line:84%
including "The Missing Lands,"
which is a wonderful book.

00:58:41.530 --> 00:58:44.350 align:middle line:10%
You can also watch our Sardinia
series and my other interviews

00:58:44.350 --> 00:58:45.673 align:middle line:10%
with Freddy here on Gaia.

00:58:45.673 --> 00:58:47.590 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:58:47.590 --> 00:58:49.060 align:middle line:10%
