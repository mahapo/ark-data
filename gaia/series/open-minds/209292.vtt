>>REGINA MEREDITH: You have
a very magical kind of life

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.020 align:middle line:84%
because you're tapped into these
other realms of elementals,

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.297 align:middle line:90%
trolls, and gnomes, and dwarves.

>>SALICROW: I'm a psychic.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.420 align:middle line:84%
I can see things,
predict things,

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.460 align:middle line:90%
but I also talk to the dead.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.620 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes when people
are hearing voices,

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.730 align:middle line:90%
they really are.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.830 align:middle line:84%
I think elemental beings
want to be perceived by us.

>>REGINA: They
have things to say.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.460 align:middle line:84%
They want to
communicate with you

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.407 align:middle line:84%
and speak with you, if you
can get over your own doubt.

00:00:35.407 --> 00:00:37.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: One of the
reasons why a lot of people

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.650 align:middle line:84%
don't have experiences
is because we always

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.270 align:middle line:84%
have our face in a
phone, because we

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.530 align:middle line:90%
don't want to feel awkward.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.890 align:middle line:84%
But we're actually missing
out on this huge experience

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:46.970 align:middle line:90%
we could be having.

>>REGINA: We all watched
with magical eyes as kids

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.380 align:middle line:10%
when we saw films like "Snow
White and the Seven Dwarves,"

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.730 align:middle line:10%
or "Lord of the Rings."

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.370 align:middle line:84%
We wanted to know these
special creatures.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.040 align:middle line:84%
According to Salicrow we can,
but we need to use new eyes.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.840 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.173 align:middle line:90%
It's wonderful to have you here.

I'm really happy to
be here and spend

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.770 align:middle line:84%
some time in this

very magical kind of life

that you bring with
you to Boulder,

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.600 align:middle line:84%
because you're tapped into these
other realms of elementals.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
though is you're

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.210 align:middle line:90%
a very stable human being.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.440 align:middle line:90%
You're a mom.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.750 align:middle line:90%
You've been married for decades.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.650 align:middle line:84%
I heard that you were
head of the school board,

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:36.880 align:middle line:90%
or PTA or something?

>>SALICROW: I was on a
school board for nine years.

>>REGINA: You were a school
board for nine years?

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.167 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: And I was on a
regional school board as well.

00:01:42.167 --> 00:01:43.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.080 align:middle line:84%
And all the while, everyone
knew you were a pagan that

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.860 align:middle line:90%
practiced white witchcraft.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:49.660 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:50.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yes.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.540 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yes.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:52.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Where do you live?

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: I live in
Newark, Vermont, which is

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.570 align:middle line:90%
part of the Northeast Kingdom.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.610 align:middle line:84%
So I live about 40
minutes from Canada.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:58.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.480 align:middle line:84%
So I just wanted to lay
that out because you

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.510 align:middle line:84%
have managed to carve a place
for yourself where people just

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:05.530 align:middle line:90%
accept you as you are.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And this is a big
thing for human beings.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.520 align:middle line:84%
So many people have
these interests

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.058 align:middle line:84%
and these capabilities,
and they're

00:02:11.058 --> 00:02:13.600 align:middle line:84%
spending their lives hiding it
from their family and friends.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.700 align:middle line:84%
So you're a
wonderful poster girl

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.570 align:middle line:90%
for not hiding who you are.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.170 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, let's talk
about your name, how you

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.210 align:middle line:90%
came about your name, Salicrow.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.010 align:middle line:90%
Your sister is Sandycrow.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.780 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
your family and how

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.490 align:middle line:84%
you came about coming into
contact with these realms.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:29.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: OK.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.790 align:middle line:10%
So I am born into a family
with spiritual gifts.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.340 align:middle line:10%
My great grandmother
was my first teacher,

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.250 align:middle line:10%
and her father was
an Irish traveler.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.320 align:middle line:90%
And her mother was Blackfoot.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.440 align:middle line:10%
So most of her teachings
would now kind of

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.830 align:middle line:10%
fall into the category
described as Granny witching

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.380 align:middle line:10%
or Appalachian witchcraft.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.730 align:middle line:84%
It's more like folk
magic and very practical,

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:55.810 align:middle line:90%
and down to earth.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.730 align:middle line:84%
And my grandmother was a person
that everybody called Gram.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And people came to
see her regularly.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.980 align:middle line:84%
So my sister and I were
being taught about our gifts

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.780 align:middle line:84%
from the time that we
were really little.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.500 align:middle line:84%
My first real memories are about
from the age of three or four.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.338 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so what
did she start with?

00:03:16.338 --> 00:03:18.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there has to
be a mentoring process

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.660 align:middle line:90%
for a three-year-old, right?

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: So in my case,
I didn't realize this

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.920 align:middle line:84%
until later when I had a large
spiritual opening of my own,

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.280 align:middle line:84%
my grandmother was told
when my mother was pregnant

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.970 align:middle line:84%
with me, that I was going to be
a medium because I'm a psychic.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.230 align:middle line:84%
I can see things that are
unseen, and predict things.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.300 align:middle line:90%
But I also talk to the dead.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.990 align:middle line:90%
That's my primary job.

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.030 align:middle line:84%
So I was trained from
a very young age.

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.620 align:middle line:90%
I call it the parlor arts.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.300 align:middle line:84%
Like I was the one
who sat at the table

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.910 align:middle line:84%
and played card games
that were developing my--

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.710 align:middle line:84%
I thought she was
letting me win.

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.110 align:middle line:84%
Because I was just
really good at it.

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And I got to sit
in sometimes when

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.730 align:middle line:84%
people would come by because
I was well-behaved and quiet.

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And my sister was a
little wilder than me.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.400 align:middle line:84%
She was usually sent outside
to find something in the lawn

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.480 align:middle line:90%
that she could eat.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, OK.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: So my sister
is a magical herbalist,

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.279 align:middle line:84%
and she definitely
is more into--

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:21.850 align:middle line:84%
we both work in the same field,
but mine, as she would say,

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.500 align:middle line:84%
is more presentable
at a kitchen table.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What a
magical upbringing.

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.420 align:middle line:90%
Lucky you.

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:29.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: Yeah,
very fortunate.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, because
when you think about it,

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.000 align:middle line:84%
how many kids and how many
human beings are carrying this

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.710 align:middle line:84%
within them, they
just don't have anyone

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.240 align:middle line:84%
giving them permission,
or showing them the way.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Right.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.457 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
had all of that.

00:04:40.457 --> 00:04:43.150 align:middle line:84%
You had it laid out for
you, with no resistance.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.740 align:middle line:90%
And that's fabulous.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.940 align:middle line:84%
So at what age did you begin
to notice that you were maybe

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.860 align:middle line:84%
seeing things, or hearing
things that other people didn't?

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: I don't
think I realized

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.960 align:middle line:84%
that other people didn't have
those experiences until I

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.100 align:middle line:90%
was much older.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.780 align:middle line:84%
But I do remember
being in school

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.600 align:middle line:84%
when teachers would talk
about imaginary friends.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.040 align:middle line:84%
And I just assumed she was
talking about other people, not

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.840 align:middle line:90%
me.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.690 align:middle line:84%
Because in my house,
if I saw something,

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.960 align:middle line:84%
my sister also saw it, or
my grandmother would say,

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.130 align:middle line:90%
what are you looking at?

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.300 align:middle line:90%
Because she saw it too.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.270 align:middle line:90%
So there was--

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.120 align:middle line:84%
I think I was probably just
about a teenager when I really

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.400 align:middle line:84%
started to realize that I had
the ability to perceive things

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.750 align:middle line:90%
that other people couldn't.

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.570 align:middle line:84%
Until then, I just thought
that this must be normal.

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:32.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.150 align:middle line:90%
So tell us about your name.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.470 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned that in
the beginning, yours

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:36.520 align:middle line:90%
and your sister's names.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.820 align:middle line:84%
Because you've condensed it
to a solo name, Sandycrow.

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:40.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Right.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.960 align:middle line:84%
So they're more spiritual names
than they are anything else,

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.430 align:middle line:84%
and Crow is very sacred to the
Blackfoot part of our family,

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:49.730 align:middle line:90%
is where that comes from.

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.210 align:middle line:84%
So I actually have
another sister

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.050 align:middle line:84%
who, while she doesn't really
follow the spiritual path,

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:00.528 align:middle line:84%
she also still has like Crow
tattoos, and my father was--

00:06:00.528 --> 00:06:02.070 align:middle line:84%
one of his nicknames
that we gave him

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.200 align:middle line:84%
was one-eyed Richard
the Crow, because he

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.430 align:middle line:90%
lost his eye in Vietnam.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.470 align:middle line:90%
So he was also a Crow.

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:11.100 align:middle line:84%
So the Crow part is
that, and we're actually

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.390 align:middle line:90%
known that way though.

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:13.265 align:middle line:90%
Even though most of--

00:06:13.265 --> 00:06:14.807 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Kind of
as the Crow family.

00:06:14.807 --> 00:06:16.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: The Crow
sisters, my sister and I are.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.417 align:middle line:84%
And for a while, people
thought that my husband and I

00:06:19.417 --> 00:06:20.250 align:middle line:90%
had gotten divorced.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:21.930 align:middle line:84%
We could be standing next
to each other and like,

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:22.740 align:middle line:90%
and we're like, no.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:23.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm just--

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:24.060 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.120 align:middle line:84%
Because they had
to be like, well,

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.460 align:middle line:90%
why aren't you using this name?

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:27.630 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, because--

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:31.140 align:middle line:84%
his last name is a French name,
which nobody could pronounce.

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.613 align:middle line:84%
So I just started using my
spiritual name in my work.

00:06:33.613 --> 00:06:35.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How do you
pronounce his name?

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: It's Tetreault.
It's T-E-T-R-E-A-U-L-T.

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:39.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:40.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: But
everybody's like--

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That could
come out a lot of ways.

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: It's not really
a good business plan.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, no.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.255 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:06:45.255 --> 00:06:46.060 align:middle line:90%
Salicrow works.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:46.860 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.850 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the elemental
world, and all of the beings

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:51.870 align:middle line:90%
in the elemental world.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:52.810 align:middle line:90%
We'll start with that.

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And when you started
communicating with them.

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And one thing you
say is, we have

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.690 align:middle line:84%
to let go of our perception
of what they look like,

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:04.020 align:middle line:84%
sound like, personalities
and all that,

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.850 align:middle line:90%
and allow it to be shown to us.

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:06.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yes.

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:11.910 align:middle line:84%
I've always had the ability
to perceive nature spirits.

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:16.020 align:middle line:84%
I didn't necessarily
have a pursuit of it.

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:20.730 align:middle line:84%
Like, the working with the
dead came easier for me.

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:23.620 align:middle line:84%
And I describe it
like, shifting a dial.

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:24.420 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:25.650 align:middle line:90%
Like changing a channel.

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:30.850 align:middle line:84%
That when you have developed
the ability in one area,

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:33.420 align:middle line:84%
it's really easy
to then just kind

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:38.657 align:middle line:84%
of vibrational shift into the
other area to perceive that.

00:07:38.657 --> 00:07:40.740 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I tell
people is that you really

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:45.810 align:middle line:84%
want to use a wide
angle vision when you're

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.030 align:middle line:90%
working in the outside world.

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:51.660 align:middle line:84%
And take words like
maybe, kind of,

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.640 align:middle line:84%
and think so out
of your vocabulary

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.220 align:middle line:84%
because often, people have
experiences all the time.

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:58.740 align:middle line:84%
They'll be like, "I
thought I saw something."

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, well, why
don't you say the same thing,

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.720 align:middle line:90%
but take "thought" out of it?

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And then they're like,
"I saw something."

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.670 align:middle line:84%
And they almost always can
feel that that's the truth.

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:10.500 align:middle line:84%
So the easiest thing
I would tell people

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.380 align:middle line:84%
is, learning to get
out of your own way.

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And we spend so much of our
time coming up with reasons

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:17.700 align:middle line:90%
why something isn't something.

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:22.770 align:middle line:84%
If we took even a fraction of
that time to make something,

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:26.400 align:middle line:84%
why is something, then we'd
all be seeing these things.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely
that is within all of us.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And there's probably
rarely a human being

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.409 align:middle line:84%
that isn't seeing
someone walk by out

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:36.820 align:middle line:90%
of the corner of their eye.

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.159 align:middle line:84%
Or something that's
not physically present,

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:42.220 align:middle line:84%
but they could swear they
just saw someone walking by.

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:44.210 align:middle line:90%
That's an example of it.

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And how do you
expand out when you

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:49.300 align:middle line:84%
see things happening, or
something moving before you

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:52.570 align:middle line:84%
but it looks really almost
like a shadow of something?

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:54.310 align:middle line:84%
Talk about that,
because that's common.

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:58.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: It is common, and my
explanation of it is that what

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:01.030 align:middle line:84%
I've learned, which I learned
primarily most things--

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:03.100 align:middle line:84%
I actually had a major
spiritual opening

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:08.198 align:middle line:84%
when I was 30, where I was
being taught by spirits.

00:09:08.198 --> 00:09:09.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We're going to talk--

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:09.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yes.

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Go ahead and
talk about that now,

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:12.430 align:middle line:84%
and then you can
get to the point--

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:12.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: OK, I just want to--

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:13.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --I was making.

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:14.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: --about
that to say--

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:14.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Do.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: --I was taught
a lot of ground rules then.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:21.460 align:middle line:84%
I was taught a lot
of ways to perceive.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:24.573 align:middle line:84%
It was a really
tremendous experience.

00:09:24.573 --> 00:09:25.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us
the whole thing.

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:26.810 align:middle line:90%
I know it happened.

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:30.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: So I have always had
the ability to communicate with

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:31.630 align:middle line:90%
spirits, but it wasn't--

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:34.690 align:middle line:84%
I was working as a
psychic reading cards,

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:37.060 align:middle line:84%
and telling people about
their life and their future.

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:39.220 align:middle line:84%
I was a Reiki master in
six schools of Reiki.

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.140 align:middle line:84%
I had done a lot
of study already.

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And I would have spirits
where I'd see them,

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:48.070 align:middle line:84%
and I would have
some in experience.

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And then I had this
experience where

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:54.530 align:middle line:84%
it was so loud that if it
was a different situation,

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:56.710 align:middle line:84%
I might have been
taken to a hospital.

00:09:56.710 --> 00:10:01.870 align:middle line:84%
I really describe it as being
scrubbed with a Brillo pad

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:03.340 align:middle line:90%
and sprayed with a fire hose.

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:06.160 align:middle line:84%
Like everything in my life
was turned inside out.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.310 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, my
ability to perceive spirits

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:11.140 align:middle line:90%
went through the roof.

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:16.070 align:middle line:84%
It went from like, 10 to
100 in a period of days.

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And this intense experience
lasted for months.

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:23.710 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly enough, I was
like begging for the volume

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:24.560 align:middle line:90%
to be turned down.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.360 align:middle line:90%
Like, literally.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.770 align:middle line:84%
Like, please, just
can I have a vacation?

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:28.300 align:middle line:90%
Could you turn the volume down?

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And when they did, I
found I didn't like it.

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:34.180 align:middle line:84%
And that was part
of the lesson too,

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:37.100 align:middle line:84%
was that I had to actually
choose it on my own.

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:38.860 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
flood your gates

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:41.050 align:middle line:84%
and show you what
you're capable of,

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:44.118 align:middle line:84%
and then we're going to
back off a little bit.

00:10:44.118 --> 00:10:45.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you choose.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.285 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: And you choose.

00:10:46.285 --> 00:10:49.180 align:middle line:84%
And I definitely chose
that I wanted to go back

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:50.750 align:middle line:90%
into the deeper water.

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:53.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what was the
sound you were hearing?

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:56.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: I was actually
hearing voices very clearly.

00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:00.910 align:middle line:84%
It started with a spirit,
that his name is Adam.

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And he was my youngest
sister's best friend,

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.330 align:middle line:90%
and I knew him through that.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And my youngest sister
and I aren't a lot alike.

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:09.400 align:middle line:84%
So there's an age
difference, and the fact

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.650 align:middle line:84%
that I always loved him was
kind of strange, because I

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:12.733 align:middle line:90%
didn't know him that well.

00:11:12.733 --> 00:11:15.603 align:middle line:84%
But when he died, he
showed up at my house,

00:11:15.603 --> 00:11:17.020 align:middle line:84%
and I was like,
at first I thought

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:20.830 align:middle line:84%
it was like, to communicate
that he was OK to my sister.

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And then he started
telling me these--

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:26.800 align:middle line:84%
it really was a plan that
we had had before birth.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:30.280 align:middle line:84%
And because he was somebody
that I could trust,

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:33.380 align:middle line:84%
I could get information to
find out if I was accurate.

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:34.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:35.350 align:middle line:90%
Like a partner.

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:35.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yes.

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:36.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In this.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: I was able
to call my sister.

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:40.270 align:middle line:84%
So if a spirit was
somebody that was like,

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:42.710 align:middle line:84%
my own loved one I
might have thought,

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:45.160 align:middle line:84%
well I'm just imagining
that because I want that.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.620 align:middle line:84%
But because this was
different, I was-- finally

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:49.180 align:middle line:84%
called my sister
and I was like, look

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:51.013 align:middle line:84%
I mean he was telling
me about conversations

00:11:51.013 --> 00:11:54.280 align:middle line:84%
they had in a diner, and
these really random things.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't hesitate
at all to think

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.590 align:middle line:84%
that I was having-- like she
was like, no, that's true.

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:00.640 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.350 align:middle line:90%
So that was really helpful.

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:06.700 align:middle line:84%
That kept me above the water
of feeling like I was crazy.

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:07.643 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:07.643 --> 00:12:10.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: But I definitely
was having Kundalini openings

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.560 align:middle line:90%
on a daily basis.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:16.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my husband came home one
day and all of our belongings

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.090 align:middle line:84%
were packed in the middle of
our house, because I was like,

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:21.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't need these
earthly things anymore.

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:22.970 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:24.400 align:middle line:90%
So luckily, I came back down.

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.760 align:middle line:84%
But my husband's also a
very, very solid person who

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.860 align:middle line:90%
never once thought I was crazy.

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:32.530 align:middle line:84%
Never once-- like he knew I
was going through something.

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:34.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He knew it was
an initiation of sorts.

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:35.410 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yes.

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:36.945 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now
back to my question.

00:12:36.945 --> 00:12:37.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yes.

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:39.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So after you
became more discerning--

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:39.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yup.

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:43.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And more open, tell
us, as an average person that

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.828 align:middle line:84%
sees shadows and
things running around,

00:12:45.828 --> 00:12:48.370 align:middle line:84%
you might think you're seeing
a little doggy running through,

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:51.430 align:middle line:84%
or a person walking
by, what are we seeing?

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:54.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: Chances are
you are seeing something.

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:57.160 align:middle line:90%
What happens is people have--

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.870 align:middle line:84%
most people will say,
I saw something out

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:01.400 align:middle line:84%
of the corner of my eye, and I
turned to look and it was gone.

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.775 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why is because
you then looked through it.

00:13:03.775 --> 00:13:06.520 align:middle line:84%
Spirit is perceived best--
whether it is spirit

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.100 align:middle line:90%
of the dead, elemental spirits--

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Soft focus.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: Soft
focus, because I

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.900 align:middle line:84%
describe it kind of
like those colored

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:17.530 align:middle line:84%
folders that people put their
reports in, that are clear.

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And we all exist in
this clear folder.

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:21.525 align:middle line:90%
And we can see very clearly.

00:13:21.525 --> 00:13:22.900 align:middle line:84%
Some of us are
colorblind though.

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And we can't see into the
red folder, the blue folder,

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:26.290 align:middle line:90%
or the green folder.

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:28.123 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a good
way to put it though

00:13:28.123 --> 00:13:31.032 align:middle line:84%
because you're piercing third
dimensional vision is literally

00:13:31.032 --> 00:13:32.865 align:middle line:84%
looking right through
that other dimension--

00:13:32.865 --> 00:13:33.698 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Exactly.

00:13:33.698 --> 00:13:36.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that in soft
focus can form itself.

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:37.110 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yes.

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:39.152 align:middle line:84%
So I tell people like if
you do see something out

00:13:39.152 --> 00:13:42.540 align:middle line:84%
of the corner of your
eye, don't turn to look.

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:45.630 align:middle line:84%
Just stay and allow
yourself to perceive.

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:50.380 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I find that-- because
I do live in a rural state,

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:53.970 align:middle line:84%
there are a lot of men and
women who have hunted before.

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:56.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's an easy way
for me to describe it to,

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.820 align:middle line:84%
if we are looking at
an animal or a person

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:02.970 align:middle line:84%
with our forward facing
predatorial eyes,

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:03.940 align:middle line:90%
they can see it.

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.300 align:middle line:84%
We can feel it, if somebody is
looking at us across the room.

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:07.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:10.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: But if we don't
want to know how somebody know

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.000 align:middle line:84%
we're looking at
them, our best bet

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.860 align:middle line:84%
is also to use our
peripheral vision,

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:16.890 align:middle line:84%
because then there's not that
feeling that comes through it.

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:19.740 align:middle line:84%
So you can take that
same skill that you

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:23.850 align:middle line:84%
might have used to look
at the person who you find

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:28.530 align:middle line:84%
interesting, or hunting, or
any kind of way that you could

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:31.500 align:middle line:84%
use it, and turn that into a
way to perceive spirits better.

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:32.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, wonderful.

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:38.280 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's talk about
specific types of elementals.

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:39.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: OK.

00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:42.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because right now,
the world that we're living in,

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:47.430 align:middle line:84%
I think, is so complex and so
draining for so many people

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:50.620 align:middle line:84%
that we're going more
and more into fantasy.

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:51.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yes.

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:53.587 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that fantasy
world is actually dipping

00:14:53.587 --> 00:14:55.240 align:middle line:90%
into a reality elsewhere.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.382 align:middle line:90%
So talk about that.

00:14:56.382 --> 00:14:58.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: Well, first of
all, the reality elsewhere

00:14:58.590 --> 00:14:59.530 align:middle line:90%
has always been there.

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:01.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:03.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: I think that
we've gone through times where

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:05.220 align:middle line:84%
we were more open
to it, and times

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:06.690 align:middle line:90%
that we're more closed to it.

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:09.500 align:middle line:84%
We're coming back into a
time that's more open to it.

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.250 align:middle line:84%
I also think that one
of the things that's

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:12.840 align:middle line:84%
different about this
time is I think,

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:15.592 align:middle line:84%
elemental beings want
to be perceived by us.

00:15:15.592 --> 00:15:16.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tell us about that.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:17.600 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:20.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: We are living in
a crisis point in our planet,

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:23.550 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of the reason why you
even form these relationships

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:25.810 align:middle line:84%
is to make some kind
of change there.

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:26.610 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:30.483 align:middle line:84%
Like environmental
responsibility, stewardship.

00:15:30.483 --> 00:15:33.150 align:middle line:84%
There's things that those beings
can do for you, but a lot of it

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:36.480 align:middle line:84%
is learning how to be
part of the natural world.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:39.117 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Drawing our attention
back to our beautiful host.

00:15:39.117 --> 00:15:39.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Exactly.

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:40.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:43.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: And so, I
feel like there really

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:48.840 align:middle line:84%
is an influx of experiences
with people with nature spirits.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:52.020 align:middle line:84%
Even people who are like
catching pictures on film,

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:55.230 align:middle line:84%
and you know, I say
selfies that they're

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:56.760 align:middle line:84%
coming forward and
doing-- there's

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:59.280 align:middle line:84%
different types of
beings, just like there's

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:00.780 align:middle line:90%
different elements.

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And I like to look at it that
they have different realms.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:06.520 align:middle line:84%
So just like we live
in a physical realm

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:10.650 align:middle line:84%
and our beloved dead live
in a different realm.

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:12.480 align:middle line:84%
Fire spirits live
in a different realm

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.330 align:middle line:84%
than water spirits and earth
spirits and air spirits.

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:18.210 align:middle line:84%
And the astral realm
is kind of like where

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:19.440 align:middle line:90%
we perceive everything.

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:22.410 align:middle line:84%
All of us have the ability to
perceive there, or to learn.

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:25.285 align:middle line:84%
They're probably easier
than any other place.

00:16:25.285 --> 00:16:26.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're
talking off-camera,

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:28.743 align:middle line:84%
and you said, these
realms don't necessarily

00:16:28.743 --> 00:16:30.230 align:middle line:90%
do business with one another.

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk about
that in a little bit.

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:32.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Right.

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:33.977 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Some of
them have preferences.

00:16:33.977 --> 00:16:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And would prefer to stay
with their own kind.

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:36.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yes.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:37.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:41.820 align:middle line:84%
So you say seclusion is also an
important element in developing

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:43.620 align:middle line:90%
this connection with nature.

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:45.910 align:middle line:90%
Having some time alone.

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:46.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yes.

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:48.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about that
for a moment because that's

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.820 align:middle line:84%
another thing people are
challenged by right now.

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:51.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yeah.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.540 align:middle line:84%
I think that the seclusion
that we went through

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:59.460 align:middle line:84%
with the pandemic really
brought a lot of people

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:03.510 align:middle line:84%
into realizing that they
needed nature as their healer.

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:06.329 align:middle line:84%
So there was definitely
an influx of it

00:17:06.329 --> 00:17:08.069 align:middle line:90%
during that time period.

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:11.579 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like
we are becoming--

00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:13.710 align:middle line:84%
I think we're going through
a psychic evolution.

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:15.220 align:middle line:90%
I talk about that a lot.

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:17.040 align:middle line:84%
So I've been a psychic
for many years,

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.170 align:middle line:84%
and just watching the amount
of people who are changing.

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:22.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think that when
they spend time in nature,

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:25.410 align:middle line:84%
they're more likely to
have that experience.

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:28.030 align:middle line:84%
They're more likely--
you do have to be quiet.

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:29.160 align:middle line:90%
You have to still yourself.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:32.640 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons why a lot of
people don't have experiences

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.890 align:middle line:84%
is because we always
have our face in a phone.

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:35.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:39.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: We always-- have
we can't sit on a park bench

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:43.180 align:middle line:84%
by ourself and experience
nature without--

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:43.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:46.063 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: Because we
don't want to feel awkward.

00:17:46.063 --> 00:17:49.530 align:middle line:84%
But we're actually missing
out on this huge experience

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:51.480 align:middle line:90%
we could be having.

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So one of
the groups of beings

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.660 align:middle line:84%
that you say you
have a particularly

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:56.760 align:middle line:84%
strong relationship
are the jinn,

00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:00.300 align:middle line:84%
often known as genies
in the western world,

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:01.965 align:middle line:84%
in the eastern
world, known as jinn.

00:18:01.965 --> 00:18:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times, when
you read about jinn,

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.720 align:middle line:84%
you think, whoa, those
beings are troublemakers.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.550 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
what jinn actually are.

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:12.640 align:middle line:84%
How you would describe them,
and how you work with them.

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:15.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: So first of all,
I have had relationships

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:16.050 align:middle line:90%
with jinn.

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:18.270 align:middle line:84%
I have a very
specific relationship

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:21.660 align:middle line:84%
with jinn, which
is that I am very

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:23.590 align:middle line:84%
cautious in my
relationship with jinn.

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:24.390 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:27.083 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well every book I've
read would indicate caution.

00:18:27.083 --> 00:18:28.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: Well,
the big part is,

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.860 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that
they are evil beings.

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:35.570 align:middle line:84%
I think that they
are precise beings.

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:37.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So explain
that a little more.

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:42.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: So if you
say, "Welcome to my home,"

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:45.300 align:middle line:84%
you've just now told them
that your home is their home.

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:46.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh OK.

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:46.630 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:47.490 align:middle line:90%
So be specific.

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:51.005 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: Yeah, like jinn are
mentioned in the Quran a lot.

00:18:51.005 --> 00:18:53.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, yeah, those
Middle Eastern readings.

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:53.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yes.

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And my daughter's good friends
with a Pakistani woman.

00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:59.043 align:middle line:84%
And when my daughter
was talking about jinn,

00:18:59.043 --> 00:19:00.085 align:middle line:90%
she was like, "Oh my God.

00:19:00.085 --> 00:19:01.210 align:middle line:90%
We don't talk about that."

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:01.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:03.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: And my
daughter was like, OK,

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:07.590 align:middle line:84%
but it was really because
of this, you really

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:09.300 align:middle line:84%
have to interact
with them like you're

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:10.800 align:middle line:90%
interacting with a lawyer.

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.320 align:middle line:84%
Like, if you're saying,
you're doing something,

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:15.070 align:middle line:90%
that's a signed contract.

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:17.790 align:middle line:84%
So in my interactions, when
I have worked with them,

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:21.060 align:middle line:84%
I literally go in and
I say, I start with,

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:24.060 align:middle line:84%
"In no shape, way,
or form am I entering

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:26.710 align:middle line:90%
into a agreement with you.

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:28.680 align:middle line:84%
I am telling you
what I'm working on,

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:31.050 align:middle line:84%
and if this is something
you want to work on,

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:33.180 align:middle line:90%
we can collaborate together."

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:36.090 align:middle line:84%
And I always do it in
a sacred space setting.

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:38.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Are they ubiquitous?

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:40.560 align:middle line:84%
Is jinn everywhere or just
certain parts of the world?

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:41.563 align:middle line:90%
Certain types of land?

00:19:41.563 --> 00:19:43.230 align:middle line:84%
Certain types of
families or bloodlines?

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:45.105 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: Definitely
certain types of lands

00:19:45.105 --> 00:19:47.070 align:middle line:84%
are going to be more
likely, and also families

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:48.960 align:middle line:84%
do count because
we have a tendency

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:51.330 align:middle line:84%
to bring our otherworldly
beings with us

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:54.120 align:middle line:90%
when we have settled areas.

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:57.510 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
Appalachian area is

00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:00.930 align:middle line:84%
filled with Scotch-Irish
magic, and it also

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:03.180 align:middle line:84%
has a lot of the
same fairy lore.

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:04.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:06.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: You're
going to experience jinn

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:08.970 align:middle line:84%
more often living in
a desert environment

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:12.660 align:middle line:84%
than you are-- my environment,
my experience with a jinn

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:15.850 align:middle line:84%
is a personal one, that
has been through lifetimes.

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:21.030 align:middle line:84%
So my area of living in
a green, forested area

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:23.660 align:middle line:84%
would not be someplace that
they would choose to come.

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:24.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:26.140 align:middle line:84%
So what is your
specific relationship?

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:27.670 align:middle line:90%
What do you do together?

00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:29.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: I don't really
do that much with them.

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:31.320 align:middle line:90%
So I think that might be--

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:33.210 align:middle line:90%
maybe I have worked with them.

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:34.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, you have.

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:36.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: I have worked
with them when I need to.

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:39.190 align:middle line:84%
They are very good at
getting things done.

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:41.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: That's a
good way, like they

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:42.540 align:middle line:90%
can be used in healing.

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:45.270 align:middle line:84%
Any kind of creature can
be used-- a creature,

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:47.070 align:middle line:84%
I hate to use that
word-- any kind of being

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:49.470 align:middle line:90%
can be used in healing.

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:53.790 align:middle line:84%
Jinn have a tendency
to inspire, so they're

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:55.620 align:middle line:90%
really good for artists.

00:20:55.620 --> 00:21:00.090 align:middle line:84%
They're really good for people
who are very intellectual.

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:03.120 align:middle line:10%
They're really good for
learning magic and dance.

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:06.510 align:middle line:10%
And I have actually
met Sufis who

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:10.740 align:middle line:10%
have had bonded
relationships with jinn,

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:14.100 align:middle line:10%
in a form of improving
their artistic ability,

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:18.690 align:middle line:10%
or their ability in entering
dance or trance meditation

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:20.610 align:middle line:10%
through the whirling dervish.

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:25.110 align:middle line:84%
My experience has been
more of a negotiator.

00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:28.020 align:middle line:84%
Like, I have worked with
them in other lifetimes,

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:30.540 align:middle line:84%
and because of that, I've
been able to help people

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:34.210 align:middle line:84%
when they've made poor
choices in their communication

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:35.010 align:middle line:90%
with jinn.

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:37.710 align:middle line:84%
Kind of like, going as the
representative, going like,

00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:39.180 align:middle line:90%
let's clear some things up here.

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:40.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm a mediator.

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:41.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Between those realms.

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:41.370 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:42.170 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:44.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: I consider myself
a mediator, in general.

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:46.800 align:middle line:84%
A lot of my work
is being a bridge.

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:47.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:49.980 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about a name
that is ubiquitous,

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:52.470 align:middle line:84%
that everybody loves and
admires, and that's Merlin.

00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:52.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yes.

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:54.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about Merlin energy,

00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:57.483 align:middle line:84%
and let's talk about
caves for a moment.

00:21:57.483 --> 00:21:58.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: So I love caves.

00:21:58.650 --> 00:21:59.708 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I do, too.

00:21:59.708 --> 00:22:00.750 align:middle line:90%
So much happens in there.

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:03.333 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: And I have been to
Merlin's cave a couple of times

00:22:03.333 --> 00:22:06.570 align:middle line:84%
in Tintagel, which
is really powerful.

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:10.080 align:middle line:84%
I actually have a photograph
from the last time

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.010 align:middle line:90%
I was there that--

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:13.890 align:middle line:84%
I do a lot of vocal
toning, and sacred singing.

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:15.720 align:middle line:84%
And I was singing
in Merlin's cave

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:17.730 align:middle line:84%
with a group of people
on a pilgrimage,

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:20.890 align:middle line:84%
and I was standing there
with my arms out like this,

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:22.440 align:middle line:84%
and this guy was on
the trip with me,

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:25.710 align:middle line:84%
took a series of pictures,
where you could watch

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:28.730 align:middle line:84%
this purple light moving
closer and closer to me,

00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:31.800 align:middle line:84%
and finally, was just in
the middle of my chest.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.290 align:middle line:84%
So Merlin energy--
well, first of all,

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:37.030 align:middle line:90%
Merlin is probably an amalgam.

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:37.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:41.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: You know, of a
lot of magical practitioners,

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:46.260 align:middle line:84%
druids, and that
energy is very much, I

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:52.380 align:middle line:84%
would say woven into druidry,
which is based on a view

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:56.160 align:middle line:84%
that nature is
sacred and sentient.

00:22:56.160 --> 00:23:00.960 align:middle line:84%
And people can be druids without
it being Christian or pagan.

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:03.400 align:middle line:84%
There can be whatever religion
you want to bring into it.

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:07.230 align:middle line:84%
So I believe Merlin energy
is that kind of like tapping

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:11.340 align:middle line:84%
into the understanding that
everything is sentient,

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:14.285 align:middle line:84%
everything works
better through--

00:23:14.285 --> 00:23:16.410 align:middle line:84%
I say everything works
better through collaboration

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:17.760 align:middle line:90%
than force.

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.410 align:middle line:84%
Like, I would
rather work with you

00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:23.370 align:middle line:84%
if you ask me to work with you,
than if you put me in some box

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:24.870 align:middle line:84%
and told me, I had
to work with you.

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:25.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:26.510 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:28.930 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about caves then.

00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:30.820 align:middle line:84%
Expand into that
a little bit more.

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:32.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: So caves
have always been

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:37.680 align:middle line:84%
used as places where we can go
and enter deep into ourself,

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.480 align:middle line:90%
into our own personal cave.

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And while they're
closed in, they usually

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:46.980 align:middle line:84%
have pretty interesting
acoustics one way or another.

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:50.240 align:middle line:84%
They hold shadows amazingly,
and you're surrounded

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:51.920 align:middle line:90%
by the element of earth.

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:56.120 align:middle line:84%
So you're really grounded inside
of a cave, which sounds strange

00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:58.412 align:middle line:84%
that people can have such
amazing spiritual experiences

00:23:58.412 --> 00:23:59.212 align:middle line:90%
there--

00:23:59.212 --> 00:24:00.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I do.

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:00.635 align:middle line:90%
I love caves.

00:24:00.635 --> 00:24:00.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Right.

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:03.650 align:middle line:84%
But I think the reason you can
is because it is so grounded.

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:06.630 align:middle line:84%
You also feel like
you're when you said--

00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:07.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're in the earth.

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: Yes,
you're in the Earth.

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:10.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:13.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: And they're
really good for releasing.

00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:18.230 align:middle line:84%
They're good for any kind of
deep dive into consciousness.

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:21.410 align:middle line:84%
My sister and I have
used a local cave

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:24.625 align:middle line:84%
in the White Mountains
for healing with people.

00:24:24.625 --> 00:24:26.750 align:middle line:84%
This one has like this
little opening on top of it,

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:27.710 align:middle line:90%
and it's a small cave.

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And we've had people
in there while we

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:31.700 align:middle line:84%
were singing and
drumming on top of it,

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:36.680 align:middle line:84%
and just let the beings work
with them inside of that space

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:37.710 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:41.792 align:middle line:84%
We've had people go there for
themselves, for pilgrimage.

00:24:41.792 --> 00:24:44.000 align:middle line:84%
Like, you're going to go
spend the night in this cave

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:44.800 align:middle line:90%
by yourself.

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.422 align:middle line:84%
And this cave is
small, you're not

00:24:46.422 --> 00:24:47.630 align:middle line:90%
going to be like, "Oh my God.

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:48.920 align:middle line:84%
There was something
else living in here."

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:51.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: I think
that it allows

00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:58.560 align:middle line:84%
us to connect with our
personal highest consciousness.

00:24:58.560 --> 00:24:59.360 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:00.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well it's
blocking out all

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:02.270 align:middle line:84%
of the external
artificial signals.

00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:02.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Exactly.

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:04.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You don't have
any of that happening

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:05.167 align:middle line:90%
when you're in a cave.

00:25:05.167 --> 00:25:06.960 align:middle line:84%
You're surrounded
by Mother Earth.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:07.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yes.

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:11.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All natural
signals, other natural beings

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:12.170 align:middle line:90%
are there with you.

00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:13.400 align:middle line:90%
It's so beautiful.

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm with you.

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:17.990 align:middle line:84%
I highly encourage people to
find a special cave somewhere

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:19.490 align:middle line:90%
and visit it on a regular basis.

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:20.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yes.

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:22.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: If possible.

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:26.270 align:middle line:84%
Three years ago now,
with Gaia, we took a crew

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:29.660 align:middle line:84%
and went to Sardinia, and
found this series of caves

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.850 align:middle line:84%
that a local woman
told us about.

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:33.530 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't-- it's not
in any tour book.

00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:34.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Cool.

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:38.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it was a series
of female initiation caves.

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:39.920 align:middle line:90%
There were four of them.

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:43.070 align:middle line:84%
You went-- started as a
young girl at one end,

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:45.840 align:middle line:84%
and it went all the way through,
till you hit the final cave,

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.300 align:middle line:90%
which was the birthing cave.

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:48.467 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: That is awesome.

00:25:48.467 --> 00:25:51.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it was absolutely
stunning in its energy.

00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:53.960 align:middle line:84%
Freddy Silva was there
with me, and just--

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.503 align:middle line:84%
he couldn't get
enough of the energy.

00:25:55.503 --> 00:25:57.170 align:middle line:84%
We're like, "Get out,
we want to try it.

00:25:57.170 --> 00:25:58.560 align:middle line:90%
We're the females here."

00:25:58.560 --> 00:25:59.360 align:middle line:90%
Get out.

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:00.125 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: No boys, go.

00:26:00.125 --> 00:26:00.440 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:01.815 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Anyway,
it was amazing.

00:26:01.815 --> 00:26:04.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: It's definitely
a place where you're talking

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:05.630 align:middle line:90%
about can--

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:07.730 align:middle line:84%
because your senses
are being shut down

00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:09.920 align:middle line:84%
from the outside world,
that you can go deeper

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:13.250 align:middle line:90%
into your ability to perceive.

00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:15.230 align:middle line:84%
I visited Iceland
and I tell people

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:17.870 align:middle line:84%
that if you can't have
a spiritual experience

00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:20.090 align:middle line:84%
and see other beings in
Iceland, you're not going to.

00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:20.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:22.318 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: Because--
and I think part of it is

00:26:22.318 --> 00:26:24.043 align:middle line:84%
because there isn't
a lot of living--

00:26:24.043 --> 00:26:26.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean there's moss and
stuff, but there's not trees

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:27.010 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:28.910 align:middle line:84%
There's horses and
sheep, but there's not

00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:30.553 align:middle line:84%
like a plethora of
animals or people.

00:26:30.553 --> 00:26:31.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
just a blank slate.

00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:34.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: So when
you're seeing something

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:35.910 align:middle line:90%
it really stands out to you.

00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:37.740 align:middle line:84%
So it's pretty
phenomenal in that way.

00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And I caves have
that similar feel.

00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:42.200 align:middle line:84%
There also-- Iceland is also
a big, old chunk of rock.

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:42.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:43.330 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about rock and let's
talk about earth elementals,

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:50.600 align:middle line:84%
and the types of beings
we're talking about--

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:53.910 align:middle line:84%
trolls, and gnomes, and
dwarves, and so forth.

00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going to tell
you a little story that

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:58.550 align:middle line:84%
happened just recently
that might help others.

00:26:58.550 --> 00:26:59.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: All right.

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:04.310 align:middle line:84%
So I think the earth elementals
are probably the most separated

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:07.970 align:middle line:84%
of all the elemental
beings in what I've

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:12.000 align:middle line:84%
experienced in my own, and
by talking and reading.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's more
that we can differentiate

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:17.880 align:middle line:84%
between them more, because
they are the most humanoid.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:18.680 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And I put them in categories of
the grumpy and the not grumpy.

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:22.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:24.110 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:29.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: So gnomes, elves,
those beings, Huldufólk,

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:30.530 align:middle line:90%
which are--

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:33.350 align:middle line:84%
we have a lot of-- there's so
many different kinds of beings

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:35.510 align:middle line:84%
that it's really hard
because different terrains,

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:37.640 align:middle line:90%
different areas have their own.

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:38.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm still learning.

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:40.290 align:middle line:90%
There is like, the language.

00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:43.620 align:middle line:84%
So gnomes cover
really the friendlier,

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:45.230 align:middle line:90%
more what we would see.

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:49.700 align:middle line:84%
They like to live in lush
areas that are usually green,

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:54.050 align:middle line:84%
or mossy, or plush
in some kind of way.

00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:56.480 align:middle line:84%
They like the sweet
things of life.

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:58.400 align:middle line:84%
Trolls fall into a
different category that

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:00.530 align:middle line:90%
also have beings like giants.

00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:07.580 align:middle line:84%
And they don't like contact
from the human world very much.

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:09.770 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the
easy ways, like,

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:12.080 align:middle line:84%
if you're sensitive to
feeling when you're stepping

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:15.110 align:middle line:84%
into a thin space, an easy way
to determine whether it is more

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:18.140 align:middle line:84%
of a gnome-type space with
the elves, and the Huldufólk,

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:21.560 align:middle line:84%
and the gnomes, or whether it's
more of a troll-type space is,

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:22.940 align:middle line:90%
what does the area look like?

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:26.330 align:middle line:84%
If it looks kind of
pretty and enchanting,

00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:28.030 align:middle line:90%
that's probably gnomes.

00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:28.830 align:middle line:90%
If--

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:30.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If it's
rocky and foreboding?

00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:35.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: Debris-- no, trolls
will also use things like,

00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:37.760 align:middle line:84%
they'll be spiderwebs
growing over the entrances

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:40.275 align:middle line:84%
to their caves, they'll
be like, maybe--

00:28:40.275 --> 00:28:41.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Uninviting.

00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:41.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yes.

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:42.550 align:middle line:90%
It's uninviting.

00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:43.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:46.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: And some people
will actually find that--

00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:47.950 align:middle line:84%
if they're sensitive,
that when they

00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:51.250 align:middle line:84%
go to enter a place like
that, they actually feel fear.

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:53.890 align:middle line:84%
There's not that there's really
something horrible there,

00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:56.930 align:middle line:84%
but they're being told
they're not welcome.

00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:58.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's the
casting of some bad vibes.

00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:01.570 align:middle line:84%
So the story I was going to
share, because it happened

00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:04.310 align:middle line:90%
recently, is I love gnomes.

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:05.110 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:06.460 align:middle line:90%
Now, gnomes are everywhere.

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:08.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you go in
any shop, any store,

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.600 align:middle line:84%
you're going to find
a gnome something.

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:12.850 align:middle line:84%
Which is interesting
in and of itself,

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:15.070 align:middle line:84%
that is taken on
in the mass psyche.

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:17.350 align:middle line:84%
But I have loved
them for a while.

00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:19.840 align:middle line:84%
so I have them around
at Christmastime,

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:21.880 align:middle line:84%
little knitted ones,
and things, and I

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:23.890 align:middle line:84%
kept one out, and
started playing with it

00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:24.950 align:middle line:90%
just for Instagram.

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:25.750 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:28.330 align:middle line:90%
And I would assign--

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:31.150 align:middle line:84%
as Harry said this,
about this, and I

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:33.970 align:middle line:84%
thought it's kind of interesting
because it's not the way

00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:35.500 align:middle line:90%
my mind normally works.

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:38.290 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't occur to
me until very recently

00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:41.290 align:middle line:84%
that the things that I was
coming up with-- because I also

00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:43.990 align:middle line:84%
speak with people who have
deceased and so forth,

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:48.380 align:middle line:84%
that I was actually listening
to someone from that realm.

00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:50.470 align:middle line:90%
And that my little stuffed--

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:51.790 align:middle line:90%
Harry, the little gnome--

00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:55.780 align:middle line:84%
was a surrogate, because
I don't see them.

00:29:55.780 --> 00:30:00.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't see-- some people see
a whole being in full regalia,

00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:02.090 align:middle line:84%
dressed up, standing
right in front of them.

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:03.350 align:middle line:90%
I don't see that way.

00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:05.890 align:middle line:84%
I see with my eyes closed,
then they'll come into view.

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:10.000 align:middle line:84%
And so I want to interface more
with the elemental kingdom,

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.090 align:middle line:84%
not just deceased
people, and my guides.

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:14.960 align:middle line:84%
But I just wanted to
know what it felt like.

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:16.940 align:middle line:84%
It occurred to me that's
what was going on.

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought, let me just
talk to him now through Harry.

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And just say, because I had this
deep love, also for this being,

00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:27.400 align:middle line:84%
and I understood him and I found
him funny, and I thought, wow,

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:30.430 align:middle line:84%
this is turning into some
kind of aspect of self

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:31.520 align:middle line:90%
that's strange.

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:32.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Right.

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:33.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And an alter self.

00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:36.940 align:middle line:84%
So he started telling
me, no, we're here,

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:41.860 align:middle line:84%
and we love living on your land
because it has a lot of granite

00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:44.680 align:middle line:84%
and we love the
piezoelectric energy here.

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:47.830 align:middle line:84%
But they told me something else
I wanted to share with you.

00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:49.360 align:middle line:84%
We went on about
that, and I looked

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:52.000 align:middle line:84%
it up sure enough granite has
a lot of piezoelectric energy,

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.400 align:middle line:84%
and they said it was
very enlivening for them.

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:57.770 align:middle line:84%
But, they also said
we'll be with you when

00:30:57.770 --> 00:31:02.500 align:middle line:84%
you go to Ireland as well
because the human species has

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:06.170 align:middle line:84%
been through so much tragedy,
and cataclysm, and loss

00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:06.970 align:middle line:90%
of memory.

00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:09.110 align:middle line:84%
We've been alongside
you all along.

00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:11.380 align:middle line:84%
And what we'll do with
you when you're there is--

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:15.100 align:middle line:84%
I can see into things and read
what's happened in the past

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:16.490 align:middle line:84%
on a piece of
land, to an extent.

00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:17.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Right.

00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:19.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They said, we
can fill in gaps for you

00:31:19.290 --> 00:31:21.710 align:middle line:84%
because where human
memory has been lost,

00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:24.550 align:middle line:84%
we have a continuous
memory alongside you

00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:26.930 align:middle line:84%
that we can share in
those gaps with you.

00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:27.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Right.

00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:28.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Does that make sense?

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:29.593 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: It does.

00:31:29.593 --> 00:31:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And I also have been informed
multiple times that they

00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:36.020 align:middle line:90%
travel ley lines very easily.

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:36.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:39.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: So, when you're
saying like well how did they

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:40.330 align:middle line:90%
get here?

00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:43.930 align:middle line:84%
Because as a child you might
be like, OK, so these came over

00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:45.035 align:middle line:90%
with our ancestors.

00:31:45.035 --> 00:31:46.660 align:middle line:84%
So did they ride on
the boat with them?

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:47.500 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, no.

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:49.600 align:middle line:90%
It's more like a calling.

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And that the ley lines are
really like energetic highways.

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:56.410 align:middle line:84%
We can use them ourselves
to astrally project easier.

00:31:56.410 --> 00:31:58.737 align:middle line:84%
Like, if we're saying,
like, I want to focus--

00:31:58.737 --> 00:32:00.320 align:middle line:84%
it's easier if you've
been to a place.

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:05.200 align:middle line:84%
So if this being has already
been in Ireland, then it has--

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.660 align:middle line:84%
like, it's kind of like
the destination is already

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:08.590 align:middle line:90%
in the MapQuest.

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:09.310 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:10.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:11.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: So it
does make sense.

00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:12.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they said there'll
be beings there that will

00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:14.320 align:middle line:90%
be chatting with you as well.

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yes.

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:16.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
what struck me,

00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:19.630 align:middle line:84%
though was the amazing
companionship of having

00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:21.760 align:middle line:84%
unbroken memory, where
ours has been broken,

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:22.330 align:middle line:90%
where there have been--

00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:23.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Right.

00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:25.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --massive periods
of time of destruction.

00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:27.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: I have
a spirit that I

00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:29.890 align:middle line:84%
refer to as Thomas,
who's more of a,

00:32:29.890 --> 00:32:31.990 align:middle line:84%
I would refer to him
as like an elven being.

00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:34.100 align:middle line:90%
He's more slender and tall.

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:37.270 align:middle line:84%
And he had been part of
my life for many years

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:39.850 align:middle line:84%
where I was just seeing him,
because they have the ability

00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:43.090 align:middle line:90%
to turn two-dimensional.

00:32:43.090 --> 00:32:44.590 align:middle line:84%
So that's why
sometimes we will--

00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:46.007 align:middle line:84%
if we're looking
for them, they'll

00:32:46.007 --> 00:32:49.570 align:middle line:84%
disappear, too because I
started having these games where

00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:52.880 align:middle line:84%
they would like run across the
field, and I'd be like, what?

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:54.100 align:middle line:90%
And then they disappear.

00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:56.017 align:middle line:84%
Well, I started realizing
that all I had to do

00:32:56.017 --> 00:32:58.115 align:middle line:84%
was, kind of like shift,
and then I'm out of here.

00:32:58.115 --> 00:32:58.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:01.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: And when Thomas
finally introduced himself

00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:02.950 align:middle line:84%
to me, one of the
things he said was

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:05.450 align:middle line:84%
that he had worked with
my family for generations.

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:06.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:08.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: And that
he had worked with--

00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:10.780 align:middle line:84%
so I call him Thomas,
that's not his real name,

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:13.330 align:middle line:84%
but my Irish
traveler family name

00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:16.900 align:middle line:84%
was Thomas, and that
was the family that he--

00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:18.610 align:middle line:84%
like my great
grandmother's family,

00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:22.850 align:middle line:84%
her father, both my great
grandmother's father and mother

00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:23.650 align:middle line:90%
had gifts.

00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:26.320 align:middle line:90%
So while I have other--

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:29.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm mostly Irish, but that's
my line, I call my line,

00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:32.860 align:middle line:84%
because that's where my
spiritual gifts come through.

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:36.910 align:middle line:84%
But that is a way that they
do attach to family lines.

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:39.730 align:middle line:84%
They will sometimes be
dormant because they're

00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:41.770 align:middle line:84%
waiting for somebody
that's sensitive enough

00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:43.160 align:middle line:90%
to be able to perceive them.

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:43.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:46.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, and I was so
happy to understand

00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:49.660 align:middle line:84%
that it was a larger
story than my imagination

00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:51.162 align:middle line:90%
and my stuffed little gnome.

00:33:51.162 --> 00:33:52.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Absolutely.

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:53.703 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
friend I'm traveling

00:33:53.703 --> 00:33:54.800 align:middle line:90%
with is also very psychic.

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:55.600 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Nice.

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:58.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we both tune in
and we can journey together,

00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:01.400 align:middle line:84%
and to now bring the world
of elementals with us,

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:02.920 align:middle line:90%
we're really excited.

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:05.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: And also be
still, like we talked about

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:08.020 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning, because I had
an experience with a Huldufólk

00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:09.070 align:middle line:90%
in Iceland.

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:12.159 align:middle line:84%
I had gone there purposely
to do spiritual work

00:34:12.159 --> 00:34:17.500 align:middle line:84%
and there is a city just outside
Reykjavik called Hafnarfjordur.

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:18.940 align:middle line:90%
There's an elf garden there.

00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:21.400 align:middle line:84%
You can get maps
of different places

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:25.179 align:middle line:84%
around the city where
elemental beings have temples.

00:34:25.179 --> 00:34:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And I was staying
on Thingvallavatn,

00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:31.330 align:middle line:84%
which is a glacial
lake that comes off

00:34:31.330 --> 00:34:34.100 align:middle line:90%
of Thingvellir, the great rift.

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:37.639 align:middle line:84%
And the people who had
it, their grandparents

00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:38.750 align:middle line:90%
had been spiritualists.

00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:40.310 align:middle line:84%
So it was one of
the only places that

00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:42.810 align:middle line:84%
actually had a small clumping
of trees like a grove.

00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:43.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Uh-huh.

00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:45.679 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: And they had a
fairy mound that they had built.

00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:48.096 align:middle line:84%
So I went and I laid in it,
and then one day-- and I mean,

00:34:48.096 --> 00:34:49.429 align:middle line:90%
it's like 50 degrees in August.

00:34:49.429 --> 00:34:53.360 align:middle line:84%
But I'm out there, I'm laying,
and one of the Huldufólk,

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:56.570 align:middle line:84%
what they look like, they're
like four-year-old children,

00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:59.635 align:middle line:84%
came over and was just
looking down at me,

00:34:59.635 --> 00:35:01.760 align:middle line:84%
checking me out because
sometimes that's all it is.

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:02.843 align:middle line:90%
It's just an introduction.

00:35:02.843 --> 00:35:04.310 align:middle line:90%
It's like, Oh, hey.

00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:05.450 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing here?

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:08.030 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, we can definitely--
it's in that stillness,

00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:10.280 align:middle line:84%
because I was just like, I'm
just going to go lay here

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:12.080 align:middle line:90%
and see what happens when I do.

00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, we
get the best things.

00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:15.378 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Those must
be the ones depicted

00:35:15.378 --> 00:35:17.030 align:middle line:90%
in the books "Fairyopolis."

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Probably.

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:18.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The Huldufólk,
because they look like children.

00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:19.573 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: They do.

00:35:19.573 --> 00:35:22.528 align:middle line:84%
They're very-- they look like
three, four-year-old children.

00:35:22.528 --> 00:35:23.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:25.040 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I love that book.

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:27.493 align:middle line:84%
I've given it to so many
people, "Fairyopolis."

00:35:27.493 --> 00:35:29.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: I haven't
heard of that one.

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:30.438 align:middle line:90%
So I'll have to check it out.

00:35:30.438 --> 00:35:31.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Can buy it on Amazon.

00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:32.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: OK.

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:34.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Very nicely
illustrated from many decades

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:37.900 align:middle line:84%
ago, but it has little pop outs
and things from the fairies

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:38.700 align:middle line:90%
and letters.

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:40.880 align:middle line:84%
It's the most enchanting
book for children,

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:43.650 align:middle line:84%
and enchanted adults I
have ever encountered.

00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:44.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Nice.

00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:44.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So that would--

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:47.502 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: It sounds like it
might be a little more accurate

00:35:47.502 --> 00:35:50.777 align:middle line:84%
too because we have a lot of
the movie stylized version

00:35:50.777 --> 00:35:52.610 align:middle line:84%
of elemental beings,
and that's not really--

00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:53.568 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, this is--

00:35:53.568 --> 00:35:57.210 align:middle line:84%
this is quite a long time
ago from a garden in England.

00:35:57.210 --> 00:35:58.010 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:58.010 --> 00:36:01.130 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things you
write about, you say glamour

00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:03.140 align:middle line:84%
is one of the easiest
forms of magic.

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:05.010 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about glamour.

00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:06.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: OK.

00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:08.360 align:middle line:84%
Glamour is placing
your intention

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:10.340 align:middle line:90%
where you want it to be.

00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:14.030 align:middle line:84%
That's the simplest
way of describing it.

00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:16.190 align:middle line:84%
You use glamour, you
put on a different face

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:18.110 align:middle line:84%
as soon as you get in
front of the camera.

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:20.780 align:middle line:84%
When it comes on, some
part of your energy,

00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:22.460 align:middle line:84%
whether you're
feeling good or not,

00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:24.860 align:middle line:84%
knows that you have to present
yourself in a certain way

00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:26.075 align:middle line:90%
and you project--

00:36:26.075 --> 00:36:26.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:27.230 align:middle line:90%
It's unconscious.

00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:28.790 align:middle line:84%
It just-- I've done
it my whole life.

00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:32.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: Actors, politicians,
they use it all the time.

00:36:32.610 --> 00:36:33.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:35.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: We can
consciously learn to use that

00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:38.372 align:middle line:84%
and we can use it
through triggers--

00:36:38.372 --> 00:36:40.580 align:middle line:84%
because glamour isn't always
just about looking good.

00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:42.830 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's about
hiding, sometimes

00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:44.840 align:middle line:84%
it's about looking
bigger than you are

00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:46.400 align:middle line:90%
because you feel threatened.

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:49.552 align:middle line:84%
I once used glamour
to become invisible,

00:36:49.552 --> 00:36:51.260 align:middle line:84%
which is very difficult
for me, because I

00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:52.760 align:middle line:90%
have a very big personality.

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:53.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:55.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: So I was standing
on the edge of the road,

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:57.230 align:middle line:90%
and I live in a very rural town.

00:36:57.230 --> 00:37:01.190 align:middle line:84%
I was picking blueberries
and there was a mist.

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And there is a lot of
bicyclists where I live,

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:05.180 align:middle line:84%
so there were a couple
of bicyclists coming down

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:05.730 align:middle line:90%
the road.

00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:07.610 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, I'm
going to stand right

00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:08.930 align:middle line:84%
on the edge of the road,
and they're not even

00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:10.070 align:middle line:90%
going to see me.

00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And I use wide angle
vision, and I stood there

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:16.010 align:middle line:84%
and with glamour, I
put my concentration

00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:21.140 align:middle line:84%
on becoming one with
the dew or with the bike

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:23.250 align:middle line:84%
so that it was
reflecting off of me.

00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:24.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:26.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: And I could
have reached out my hand

00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:28.050 align:middle line:84%
and pushed them over
when they went by,

00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:31.350 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't even notice
that I was standing there.

00:37:31.350 --> 00:37:32.150 align:middle line:90%
You know--

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:35.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's called a
glamour, casting a glamour.

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:35.990 align:middle line:90%
I do that.

00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:38.570 align:middle line:84%
When I want to be invisible,
and people will bump into me.

00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:38.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Right.

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:40.335 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And not
for any reason,

00:37:40.335 --> 00:37:42.737 align:middle line:84%
it's just that I don't feel
extroverted on any level.

00:37:42.737 --> 00:37:43.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Exactly.

00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:45.862 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I just want to
be in my own little space.

00:37:45.862 --> 00:37:47.400 align:middle line:90%
And people don't see me.

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:50.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: I've taught classes
for years in aura manipulation.

00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:52.513 align:middle line:84%
So teaching people using
dowsing rods of like,

00:37:52.513 --> 00:37:54.680 align:middle line:84%
OK, first we're going to
walk up with a dowsing rod.

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:56.727 align:middle line:84%
We're going to see where
your aura resting is.

00:37:56.727 --> 00:37:58.310 align:middle line:84%
And then, I'm going
to tell you that I

00:37:58.310 --> 00:38:01.250 align:middle line:84%
want you to think
about being small,

00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:05.090 align:middle line:84%
and maybe that means that you're
going to imagine that you're

00:38:05.090 --> 00:38:07.190 align:middle line:90%
inside of a little tiny box.

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And then when I walk
up with a dowsing rod,

00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:12.003 align:middle line:84%
chances are I can get
right up on top of you.

00:38:12.003 --> 00:38:12.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:14.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: And what I
actually teach them too

00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:16.190 align:middle line:84%
is that if you
really are afraid,

00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:18.500 align:middle line:84%
that is absolutely not
what you want to do.

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:20.660 align:middle line:84%
Because you're allowing
somebody to get that

00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:22.820 align:middle line:84%
close to you before
you feel them.

00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:24.770 align:middle line:84%
My dad was a Marine,
so I have a lot

00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:27.170 align:middle line:84%
of practical use of
psychic abilities

00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:30.300 align:middle line:84%
too, because he did
like recon work.

00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:33.950 align:middle line:84%
So like, I understand
being able to feel somebody

00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:35.640 align:middle line:90%
before they're coming in.

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:37.250 align:middle line:90%
I also have--

00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:39.275 align:middle line:90%
I've owned a bar before.

00:38:39.275 --> 00:38:41.150 align:middle line:84%
The only time I ever
had to break up a fight.

00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:42.775 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh wait,
talk about entities.

00:38:42.775 --> 00:38:44.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yeah, exactly.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.030 align:middle line:84%
But I use glamour then
because like, we never

00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:48.530 align:middle line:84%
had fights because it was like
a college bar that had bands.

00:38:48.530 --> 00:38:49.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:54.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: And we had one fight
happened and I just went over

00:38:54.110 --> 00:38:56.960 align:middle line:84%
and I used my voice, but
I also expand in my aura

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:58.440 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And I remember-- I mean,
I'm not that big of a woman,

00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:03.890 align:middle line:84%
and having like one of the guys
who is a regular who didn't

00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:05.882 align:middle line:84%
start the fight,
he was like, "I was

00:39:05.882 --> 00:39:07.340 align:middle line:84%
afraid you were
going to punch me."

00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:07.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:09.842 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: I was like,
and that scared you?

00:39:09.842 --> 00:39:11.300 align:middle line:84%
Like that was an
interesting thing.

00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:13.997 align:middle line:84%
Like I had become larger
than life and it made it--

00:39:13.997 --> 00:39:15.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Your energy had.

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:15.410 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:39:15.410 --> 00:39:16.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yes, exactly.

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:18.822 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're all doing
that unconsciously all the time

00:39:18.822 --> 00:39:22.140 align:middle line:84%
for whatever the necessary
moment is to do that.

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:23.930 align:middle line:90%
So that's within our--

00:39:23.930 --> 00:39:27.180 align:middle line:84%
that's almost a shift in how
we choose to project ourselves.

00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:27.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Right.

00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or how we
choose to contract.

00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:31.295 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: I think that
water is the easiest

00:39:31.295 --> 00:39:35.120 align:middle line:84%
element to work with for that,
because water is reflective.

00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:39.190 align:middle line:84%
So it already gives off,
like illusion really easily.

00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And water is not just in
an actual glass of water

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:47.740 align:middle line:84%
it's also if somebody
wears glasses,

00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:51.220 align:middle line:84%
or any reflective surfaces,
because like mirrors are

00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:56.800 align:middle line:84%
jewelry, like in my book, I
talk a lot about how we can do

00:39:56.800 --> 00:40:00.280 align:middle line:84%
protective work, or we
can do glamour work,

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:03.520 align:middle line:84%
and focus it on a
particular thing.

00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:05.890 align:middle line:84%
Like, I've had people
focus on their glasses,

00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:07.390 align:middle line:84%
when they want to
be more confident

00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:12.205 align:middle line:84%
or when they want to
maybe attract a partner.

00:40:12.205 --> 00:40:14.080 align:middle line:84%
OK, well you don't wear
jewelry all the time,

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:15.680 align:middle line:84%
but you wear your
glasses every day.

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:18.070 align:middle line:84%
So let's do some
work around what you

00:40:18.070 --> 00:40:23.800 align:middle line:84%
want to reflect out of those
glasses when somebody sees you.

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:26.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about--

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:29.170 align:middle line:84%
a moment ago what struck
me in what you were saying

00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:32.920 align:middle line:84%
is that it's not really magical
how we work with these beings.

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:37.150 align:middle line:84%
It is by our intention, by our
desire, and by our request.

00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And so whether we
know the being's name,

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:42.010 align:middle line:84%
whether we know
what type of entity,

00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:44.710 align:middle line:84%
I think it's almost
an assumption

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:47.980 align:middle line:84%
that we're surrounded by
all kinds of collectives

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:49.810 align:middle line:90%
of entities all the time.

00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:51.550 align:middle line:90%
And humans can ask for help.

00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:53.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: Yes we're on
a very layered planet.

00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:54.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very layered planet.

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:57.880 align:middle line:84%
And so we don't have to
have magical abilities to be

00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:59.980 align:middle line:84%
able to call upon
these various beings.

00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:02.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: I think the
word magic is misunderstood.

00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:04.450 align:middle line:84%
I think magic is
science that hasn't yet

00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:08.230 align:middle line:84%
been explained, because when
I was younger, telling people

00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:10.720 align:middle line:84%
I did psychic readings
seemed magical.

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:13.720 align:middle line:84%
Now when even trying, like
if you look in a book,

00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:15.890 align:middle line:84%
technically talking
to dead people

00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:19.390 align:middle line:84%
and looking into somebody's
future past is magic.

00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:21.998 align:middle line:84%
But we've also gotten to a
point where science can say,

00:41:21.998 --> 00:41:23.290 align:middle line:90%
we know something is happening.

00:41:23.290 --> 00:41:23.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:25.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: We know
something is happening.

00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of
the stories I love

00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:29.320 align:middle line:84%
to tell that is an example
of how science has come.

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:32.770 align:middle line:84%
One of my friends taught
abnormal psychology for years,

00:41:32.770 --> 00:41:36.640 align:middle line:84%
and he used me as an example
because he would say, sometimes

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:39.950 align:middle line:84%
when people are hearing
voices they really are.

00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:41.950 align:middle line:84%
But there was a time
period where somebody would

00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:44.170 align:middle line:90%
have thought that was magic.

00:41:44.170 --> 00:41:46.300 align:middle line:84%
So I think that that's
the part that we have to--

00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:47.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with that.

00:41:47.350 --> 00:41:48.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: --rearrange.

00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:50.650 align:middle line:84%
That magic is science that
hasn't yet been proven.

00:41:50.650 --> 00:41:53.500 align:middle line:90%
It has a cause and effect.

00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:55.093 align:middle line:90%
There is something that happens.

00:41:55.093 --> 00:41:57.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a phenomena
that simply exists.

00:41:57.010 --> 00:41:58.300 align:middle line:90%
You can use it or not use it.

00:41:58.300 --> 00:41:58.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Right.

00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:01.155 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I think this is
a good point you talk about

00:42:01.155 --> 00:42:02.650 align:middle line:90%
in talking to the deceased.

00:42:02.650 --> 00:42:05.320 align:middle line:84%
One thing that is so, I
think, accessible and easy

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:09.970 align:middle line:84%
about talking to the deceased
is that they have things to say.

00:42:09.970 --> 00:42:11.840 align:middle line:84%
They want to
communicate with you

00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:13.450 align:middle line:84%
and speak with
you if you can get

00:42:13.450 --> 00:42:17.140 align:middle line:84%
over your own doubt in yourself
about what's being told.

00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And if you've done
it enough times,

00:42:19.090 --> 00:42:21.220 align:middle line:84%
the wonderful thing is
you can keep practicing.

00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:24.070 align:middle line:84%
You get validation, and
over time you realize,

00:42:24.070 --> 00:42:26.020 align:middle line:84%
Ah I actually heard
them correctly

00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:29.810 align:middle line:84%
because that fact was validated
by a third party, for example.

00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:30.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Right.

00:42:30.610 --> 00:42:33.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is one
way to get our sea legs, just

00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:35.440 align:middle line:84%
like with myself
in my little gnome,

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:37.630 align:middle line:84%
through my little
surrogate, Harry.

00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:40.780 align:middle line:84%
So anything-- we're coming
toward the end of our time.

00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:44.980 align:middle line:84%
Anything you want to impart
on that journey for people,

00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:48.850 align:middle line:84%
where do they begin getting
their sense of confidence

00:42:48.850 --> 00:42:51.910 align:middle line:84%
and validation that
they are communicating?

00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:53.378 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Recording things.

00:42:53.378 --> 00:42:55.420 align:middle line:84%
I tell people a lot,
especially through the book,

00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:56.907 align:middle line:90%
I talk about a book of shadows.

00:42:56.907 --> 00:42:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And a book of shadows is
different from a journal,

00:42:58.990 --> 00:43:01.060 align:middle line:84%
because you're not writing
in it like a diary.

00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:04.590 align:middle line:84%
You're writing in it more like
a college notebook, where you're

00:43:04.590 --> 00:43:06.340 align:middle line:84%
writing down structural
things that you've

00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:07.840 align:middle line:90%
had for experiences.

00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:11.890 align:middle line:84%
You're leaving space to go back
and reflect on it, because when

00:43:11.890 --> 00:43:13.390 align:middle line:84%
I meet with people
and they're like,

00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:14.650 align:middle line:90%
"Sometimes I know things."

00:43:14.650 --> 00:43:16.465 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, "Really, how often?"

00:43:16.465 --> 00:43:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And they're like,
"I don't know."

00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:18.760 align:middle line:84%
I was like, "Give
me some examples."

00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:19.540 align:middle line:84%
And they're like,
"I don't know."

00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:21.250 align:middle line:84%
It's like if you
started recording it,

00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:22.958 align:middle line:90%
you'd start seeing how often--

00:43:22.958 --> 00:43:24.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Often it's happening.

00:43:24.250 --> 00:43:24.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: --it's happening.

00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:25.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good idea, yes.

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:27.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: And you'd be
able to go off of that.

00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:28.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:43:28.810 --> 00:43:31.480 align:middle line:84%
We didn't talk about undines,
the water elementals.

00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:32.980 align:middle line:84%
Really quickly, we
all take showers.

00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:34.780 align:middle line:10%
We all take baths,
we all love water--

00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:36.190 align:middle line:10%
most everybody loves water.

00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:40.090 align:middle line:10%
Anything special that we need to
in interacting with an undine?

00:43:40.090 --> 00:43:41.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SALICROW: I
personally love water.

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:45.880 align:middle line:84%
I tell people, collect water
from springs, from lakes,

00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:49.180 align:middle line:84%
take just a little bit of it,
add it to your bath water.

00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:52.370 align:middle line:84%
Because water shares its
information with each other.

00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:55.210 align:middle line:10%
So you might say the water
coming out of your tap

00:43:55.210 --> 00:43:57.730 align:middle line:10%
has run through straight
pipes, which doesn't make

00:43:57.730 --> 00:43:59.710 align:middle line:10%
it as structured, if you will.

00:43:59.710 --> 00:44:02.050 align:middle line:10%
But once we can take
something like water

00:44:02.050 --> 00:44:04.930 align:middle line:10%
from a sacred well, water
from a lake, a river,

00:44:04.930 --> 00:44:07.390 align:middle line:10%
we open up an
opportunity for us to be

00:44:07.390 --> 00:44:10.420 align:middle line:10%
able to communicate with
those beings in the safety

00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:12.730 align:middle line:10%
of our own home, instead
of feeling weird about it,

00:44:12.730 --> 00:44:15.700 align:middle line:10%
sitting on the side of a
lake, or in a dangerous area.

00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:17.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Excellent idea.

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:19.330 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much Salicrow.

00:44:19.330 --> 00:44:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for being
so normal and grounded,

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:24.070 align:middle line:90%
and magical at the same time.

00:44:24.070 --> 00:44:26.110 align:middle line:84%
Gives people a sense
of safety with at all.

00:44:26.110 --> 00:44:26.410 align:middle line:90%
>>SALICROW: Yes.

00:44:26.410 --> 00:44:27.550 align:middle line:90%
