00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.840 align:middle line:10%
well, people are talking about
how crazy it is and chaotic.

To me, that's all
part of the conditions

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.460 align:middle line:84%
that we've called forth that
the Earth is going through.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And we as humans are
here on the planet,

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.720 align:middle line:84%
incarnating at this time to
usher through as good humans

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.070 align:middle line:90%

>>REGINA: I agree.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And this is a particularly
important point

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.320 align:middle line:84%
that comes up now and
then in interviews.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.633 align:middle line:84%
The Earth is going through
her own frequency shifts.

00:02:22.633 --> 00:02:25.300 align:middle line:84%
Some people think, oh, no, we're
already in the fifth dimension.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.200 align:middle line:84%
No, not physically, we
are not, or we would

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.610 align:middle line:90%
have blown apart at the seams.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.070 align:middle line:84%
You don't go from material
to non-material in a couple

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.780 align:middle line:90%
of decades or even millennia.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.030 align:middle line:84%
So this third going into
fourth dimensional Earth

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.830 align:middle line:90%
is lifting her frequencies.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.490 align:middle line:84%
And the cosmos is
calling for it.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.660 align:middle line:84%
The sun, the great central
sun is calling for this.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.080 align:middle line:90%
We are going along for the ride.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk about
what happens when--

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.760 align:middle line:84%
we know this even when
other people around us

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.080 align:middle line:90%
shift their frequency.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: That's right.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
struggles that happen.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.882 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
what happens when

00:02:58.882 --> 00:03:01.870 align:middle line:84%
she moves her frequencies up
and we're living somewhere else.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:02.880 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: Right.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.960 align:middle line:84%
As the Earth frequencies go
up, we have to match that.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting, because
in shamanism the Earth frequency

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.230 align:middle line:84%
was stable for a long time, and
that's how we did our drumming.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
I've ever told that.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:15.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, yeah, tell us.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:16.535 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: Yeah.

00:03:16.535 --> 00:03:20.640 align:middle line:84%
But I learned how to
drum at the rate of seven

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.070 align:middle line:84%
megahertz per second,
because that was

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.380 align:middle line:90%
the Earth's kind of frequency.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And that brought us
all in alignment,

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.115 align:middle line:84%
and we sort of
reconnected to our core.

00:03:31.115 --> 00:03:36.060 align:middle line:84%
The Earth beat is kind of like
the first beat that we hear,

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.880 align:middle line:84%
only it's in our mother's
heartbeat, you know?

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And so when you can
simulate that with a drum,

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.650 align:middle line:84%
it takes you back into this very
altered state of knowingness.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:48.450 align:middle line:90%
And so that's--

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In harmony
with the Earth.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.763 align:middle line:84%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: In harmony
with the Earth, harmony

00:03:51.763 --> 00:03:54.340 align:middle line:84%
with all life and
everything that exists.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.310 align:middle line:84%
But the Earth's frequencies
are changing so fast.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.580 align:middle line:84%
There's no way that
you could drum [LAUGHS]

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.680 align:middle line:90%
at those types of levels.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.610 align:middle line:84%
But we have to bring
our frequencies up

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.720 align:middle line:84%
or we feel like we're bombarded,
and it feels like chaos.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.610 align:middle line:90%
It can feel like madness.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.620 align:middle line:90%
It can feel like destruction.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.450 align:middle line:90%
It can feel hopeless.

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.060 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're just--
you're in this place of,

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.410 align:middle line:90%
what in the world is going on?

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.920 align:middle line:84%
But with doing particular
practices-- and that's

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:25.730 align:middle line:90%
what I'm all about.

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing the healings
and doing the practices.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.460 align:middle line:84%
You want to keep bringing
up that frequency

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.500 align:middle line:84%
so that you're in
harmony with it.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.810 align:middle line:84%

that you're talking about,

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.650 align:middle line:90%

>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.720 align:middle line:84%
And that is an aspect
and a dimension of Earth

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.010 align:middle line:90%
and a dimension of us.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.260 align:middle line:84%
But where we live
in this terra firma,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.650 align:middle line:90%
that's not fifth dimensional.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:47.450 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: No.

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And people are getting
confused over that message.

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And I've clarified that
with other channelers

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.580 align:middle line:84%
that say, yes, that is
not your physical Earth,

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.190 align:middle line:84%
but that's where your
being is attempting

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.100 align:middle line:84%
to resonate in your own

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.960 align:middle line:84%

that resonance continues,

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.570 align:middle line:84%
then the physical
world will shift.

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.000 align:middle line:90%
And we talked about that before.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.265 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, we did.

00:05:09.265 --> 00:05:10.580 align:middle line:90%
And we're talking about this.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.110 align:middle line:90%
This is what's coming to mind.

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.260 align:middle line:90%

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And something happens and
cracks in their lives.

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And normally, the
way that story goes

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.230 align:middle line:84%
is something happens
where they either

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.140 align:middle line:84%
find their heart,
their compassion, how

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.450 align:middle line:84%
important other
people are to them,

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:39.470 align:middle line:84%
and the material part
just starts dropping away

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.000 align:middle line:90%
in terms of importance.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And isn't that what's
happening right now?

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:48.350 align:middle line:84%
As a materialistic species,
we've explored that to the max.

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And the Earth
rising, I think it's

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.020 align:middle line:84%
kind of indicating to us the
material structures around us

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.107 align:middle line:90%
must transform and change.

00:05:56.107 --> 00:05:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And that includes our own,
and our own attachments

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.570 align:middle line:90%
to these things.

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.910 align:middle line:84%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: It
does, absolutely.

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:05.060 align:middle line:84%
But I like to look at
things without the need

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.830 align:middle line:90%
for catastrophe, you know?

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, we don't
have to catastrophize it.

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:09.830 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ENGELS-SMITH:
How can you do it?

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.350 align:middle line:84%

favorite story about a shaman.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.200 align:middle line:84%
And I can hear my students
laughing right now,

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.130 align:middle line:84%
because I tell this
story all the time.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:20.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.210 align:middle line:84%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: They
know it as well as I do.

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.330 align:middle line:90%
But this is a true story.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:30.400 align:middle line:84%
It took place in Machu
Picchu down in Peru.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.340 align:middle line:90%
And there was fires down there.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.980 align:middle line:84%
They were out of control,
and it's a sacred site,

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:37.790 align:middle line:84%
and the site was
being threatened.

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.360 align:middle line:84%
So the council that
runs Machu Picchu

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.550 align:middle line:84%
called in shamans to
put out the fire, which

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.335 align:middle line:84%
is one of my favorite
parts of the story.

00:06:44.335 --> 00:06:44.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:45.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.725 align:middle line:84%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: You
know, it's shamans.

00:06:46.725 --> 00:06:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And so the shamans
arrived, and they

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:50.260 align:middle line:90%
started doing what shamans do.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.420 align:middle line:84%
You go out, you
drum, you sing, you

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.370 align:middle line:84%
connect with the elements, and
all those different things.

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:57.190 align:middle line:84%
But this one
particular shaman, she

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:00.370 align:middle line:84%
wanted to have a
little hut made.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:02.230 align:middle line:90%
In Lakota, we call it a wickiup.

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:05.612 align:middle line:84%
It's like a private little
sweat lodge that's dark,

00:07:05.612 --> 00:07:06.820 align:middle line:90%
and you go in there and pray.

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:10.360 align:middle line:84%
So she went in there, and she
prayed for a day and a half,

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.920 align:middle line:90%
and the fires went out.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.420 align:middle line:90%
And everybody knew it was her.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.070 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't what the
other ones were doing.

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And they said,
how'd you do that?

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.280 align:middle line:90%
How'd you put out the fires?

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I found where I
was out of alignment in myself.

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And when I righted that, the
external world then changed.

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:31.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:32.400 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: Profound.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is profound.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:35.075 align:middle line:84%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: And
that's what I mean.

00:07:35.075 --> 00:07:37.140 align:middle line:90%
It's not about looking out here.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.730 align:middle line:84%
It's like, what are you
doing on the inside?

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:40.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:42.070 align:middle line:90%
It's all connected.

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:44.310 align:middle line:84%
The Earth's emotional
and mental bodies

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:47.160 align:middle line:84%
are connected with our
emotional and mental bodies,

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.580 align:middle line:84%
and we're connected with one
another the more each one of us

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.620 align:middle line:90%
can come into alignment.

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:55.537 align:middle line:84%
And we have the courage to let
go of what has to be let go of.

00:07:55.537 --> 00:07:56.370 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: Yes.

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:57.953 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
we are going to have

00:07:57.953 --> 00:08:00.360 align:middle line:84%
to let go of some elements
of who we thought we were

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.470 align:middle line:90%
and what life was about.

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:01.800 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: Mm-hmm.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.620 align:middle line:90%
And to change.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:03.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:04.950 align:middle line:84%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: People want
everything to be different,

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:07.322 align:middle line:84%
but they're not willing
to change themselves.

00:08:07.322 --> 00:08:08.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is huge.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.613 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: Yeah, it's huge.

00:08:09.613 --> 00:08:13.630 align:middle line:90%
And that's to me the ticket.

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:16.550 align:middle line:84%
It's like, if you want
things to be different,

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:18.770 align:middle line:84%
how are you going
to be different?

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:21.550 align:middle line:84%
And if you just keep
asking that question--

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:26.230 align:middle line:84%
and it's really about
your connection to spirit.

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:29.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in the
simplest terms, it's

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:33.700 align:middle line:84%
that whole connection
to your inner self,

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:37.179 align:middle line:84%
your inner dimensional self
and your spiritual self

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:40.270 align:middle line:84%
and how you are connected
to everything else.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.122 align:middle line:84%
And we can give lip
service to this.

00:08:42.122 --> 00:08:43.539 align:middle line:84%
Like you said, you
can read books.

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:44.780 align:middle line:90%
You can watch movies.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:45.740 align:middle line:90%
But it's the practice.

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:46.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:48.640 align:middle line:84%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: It's
the practice of,

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:52.330 align:middle line:90%
how are you changing inside?

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And then that is
going to be reflected

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:57.700 align:middle line:84%
to the outside reality
in what you see

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.080 align:middle line:90%
and what you're going through.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.997 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this requires
not just courage, but humility.

00:09:01.997 --> 00:09:03.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: Oh,
a lot of humility.

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And a lot of people--

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:09.400 align:middle line:84%
the ego does not want
to have to humble itself

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.340 align:middle line:84%
in order to make these
changes that are necessary.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:16.180 align:middle line:84%
But I think if we all understand
everyone's in the same boat.

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:19.810 align:middle line:84%
We are all being tasked
with raising our frequencies

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:22.360 align:middle line:90%
to go into harmony with Earth.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And if we understand
that, all of us

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:25.810 align:middle line:84%
are going to have
to say, sh, OK.

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:27.440 align:middle line:84%
This isn't working
for me anymore.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.640 align:middle line:90%
We all have to do it.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.805 align:middle line:84%
And it's not a shameful
thing to have to change.

00:09:31.805 --> 00:09:33.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: It's
a wonderful thing.

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:34.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:37.090 align:middle line:84%
But if some people feel like,
I'm not going to admit it.

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:38.230 align:middle line:90%
[GRUMBLING] You know?

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:40.200 align:middle line:90%
We can't do that anymore.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.600 align:middle line:90%
That time has passed.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.380 align:middle line:84%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: Yeah, it's
morphing and changing.

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:47.800 align:middle line:84%
Nature is always doing it,
and you can look to nature

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:52.600 align:middle line:84%
and really feel connected to
the environment, because that's

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.690 align:middle line:84%
where we need to stay
very connected to.

00:09:55.690 --> 00:10:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And if we look at the things
that morph and change--

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:01.810 align:middle line:90%
which is constant.

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:03.190 align:middle line:90%
What is the saying?

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:04.930 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that's
constant is change?

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:05.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:05.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: [LAUGHS]

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:06.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:07.280 align:middle line:90%
It is change.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.080 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.880 align:middle line:84%
And as the Earth is
continuing to change,

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.530 align:middle line:84%
the best we can
do for ourselves--

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:12.970 align:middle line:84%
and this comes up
in almost every

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:15.370 align:middle line:84%
show I do now-- to be in
touch with the nature,

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:19.540 align:middle line:84%
to be in touch with the sky, the
sun, the trees, the moon, all

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:23.110 align:middle line:84%
of it, because that is our
most direct path to staying

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:25.690 align:middle line:84%
in harmony with the
Earth is to be with her,

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:28.870 align:middle line:84%
and the wisdom that comes
from her and the calm.

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:30.425 align:middle line:84%
The calm that comes
from her as well.

00:10:30.425 --> 00:10:31.300 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: Yeah.

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:33.250 align:middle line:84%
You were talking
about the ego earlier,

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:39.300 align:middle line:84%
and the way that I kind of
view going for a walk in nature

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:40.920 align:middle line:84%
and you just feel
so much better,

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.690 align:middle line:84%
it's because you're
surrounded with things

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:43.800 align:middle line:90%
that don't have any ego.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:44.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.570 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:48.780 align:middle line:90%
You're so right on that.

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:52.260 align:middle line:84%
Maybe sometimes best
just to walk alone too so

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.520 align:middle line:84%
at least you only have
to deal with yours.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.610 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things you
were told by your guides

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:58.710 align:middle line:84%
is that this is the
fork in the road.

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:00.000 align:middle line:90%
We have come there.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And I've been calling it a
bifurcation of consciousness.

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:04.680 align:middle line:90%
And we've arrived.

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:05.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: We've arrived.

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:06.050 align:middle line:90%
We're there.

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:08.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so let's talk
about what they told you

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.390 align:middle line:90%
and what the options are.

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:11.307 align:middle line:84%
And I think most people
will be able to relate

00:11:11.307 --> 00:11:12.510 align:middle line:90%
very strongly with this.

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:15.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: You either go
into the madness or the chaos

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:19.185 align:middle line:84%
and live it and worry about
it and be anxious about it--

00:11:19.185 --> 00:11:20.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Refuse to change.

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:21.990 align:middle line:84%
>>ENGELS-SMITH:
Refuse to change.

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:25.740 align:middle line:90%
Or you say, OK, I'm here.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:27.325 align:middle line:90%
I say yes.

00:11:27.325 --> 00:11:28.950 align:middle line:84%
If you want to use
the word surrender--

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:30.270 align:middle line:90%
not everybody likes that word.

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:31.590 align:middle line:90%
I happen to like it.

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:34.500 align:middle line:84%
But you know, I am
available to this.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:35.940 align:middle line:90%
And you start learning.

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:38.370 align:middle line:84%
You start learning
how to be connected.

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And there are so many
wonderful options out there

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:45.300 align:middle line:84%
in the world today to do that
that I think in shamanism

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:47.020 align:middle line:90%
at least, it's experiential.

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:49.270 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you're
learning from a book

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:50.730 align:middle line:90%
or you're learning from videos.

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:53.550 align:middle line:84%
You're doing it
through activities.

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:57.225 align:middle line:84%
You learn who your helpers
are, who your guides are.

00:11:57.225 --> 00:11:58.920 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
if you want to go

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:03.030 align:middle line:84%
the angelic route or the
deity route or whatever,

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:06.210 align:middle line:84%
but you start
building relationships

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:09.020 align:middle line:84%
with these beings,
with the Earth beings,

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:11.175 align:middle line:90%
with the spirits of the land.

00:12:11.175 --> 00:12:15.690 align:middle line:84%
All of these different things,
whatever that road is for you.

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:17.430 align:middle line:84%
But you have to
start a practice.

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:22.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we are spiritual
beings, and we need

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:23.760 align:middle line:90%
to have a spiritual practice.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.575 align:middle line:84%
And that means you're
working with spirit.

00:12:25.575 --> 00:12:25.950 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:26.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:27.210 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And another point
that you make is

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:33.600 align:middle line:84%
that we're not intended to
go through this as loners.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.660 align:middle line:84%
The time of the
competitive loner, really

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:40.020 align:middle line:84%
the patriarchal era,
is drawing to a close.

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:43.450 align:middle line:84%
And we're not here to
compete with one another.

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:45.360 align:middle line:90%
We're here to all rise together.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And so what does
that mean to you,

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:51.090 align:middle line:84%
and how do you work that with
your students, your family,

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:53.525 align:middle line:84%
and your friends in
terms of helping one

00:12:53.525 --> 00:12:54.900 align:middle line:84%
another go through
this together?

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And you can-- any
stories you have

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.950 align:middle line:84%
or examples of people
who've really had to let go

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:01.500 align:middle line:84%
and had very surprising
things happen

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:04.810 align:middle line:84%
that they've turned into gold in
their own spirit, please share.

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:06.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: [LAUGHS] Sure.

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:13.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, to me, my life has been
doing ceremony for the last 30

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.320 align:middle line:84%
years, working with the spirits
and having all different kinds

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:21.100 align:middle line:90%
of transformations take place.

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.610 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like one of
the most important things

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:26.160 align:middle line:84%
is like you were saying,
the non-competitive,

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.610 align:middle line:84%
and that people
learn that we have

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:32.430 align:middle line:84%
to work in unity
and collaboration

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:34.090 align:middle line:90%
and support and love.

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And when you do those
types of things,

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:40.110 align:middle line:84%
the spirits call it-- you become
masters of loving kindness.

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:46.440 align:middle line:84%
And that just automatically
raises your energy.

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:50.500 align:middle line:84%
Competition and loving kindness
are completely different

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:51.300 align:middle line:90%
fields.

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:52.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Opposite fields.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:52.955 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: Yeah.

00:13:52.955 --> 00:13:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And so just even saying
the word can kind of like--

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:59.550 align:middle line:84%
oh, I'm going to be
in my loving kindness

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:05.490 align:middle line:84%
today is this completely
different energy altogether.

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:06.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, for
myself, I found--

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:09.660 align:middle line:90%
I realized this.

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:10.830 align:middle line:90%
I guess I was in my 20s.

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:12.960 align:middle line:84%
I thought, whenever
I was feeling blue,

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.940 align:middle line:84%
like something wasn't
happening that I thought

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:17.610 align:middle line:84%
was going to happen or
I was waiting too long

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:19.590 align:middle line:84%
for a job to come
through or something--

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:21.660 align:middle line:84%
because the world
of TV is cruel.

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:23.070 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of waiting.

00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:25.080 align:middle line:90%
And just that anxiety.

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.480 align:middle line:84%
Where's my next
paycheck coming from?

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.220 align:middle line:84%
I always thought,
well, if I can just

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:32.618 align:middle line:84%
do something nice for someone,
I would shift my focus

00:14:32.618 --> 00:14:33.660 align:middle line:90%
and think, what can I do?

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:34.590 align:middle line:90%
Who can I call?

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:36.780 align:middle line:84%
Just offer something
nice into the world.

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:40.030 align:middle line:84%
A kind-- bake a cake,
whatever, for someone else.

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:41.260 align:middle line:90%
And that would always--

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:42.060 align:middle line:90%
psh.

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:43.800 align:middle line:84%
That totally flipped
the energy for me.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.030 align:middle line:90%
It always has.

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:45.905 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: Yeah.

00:14:45.905 --> 00:14:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And as you're saying
that, it can sound really

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:54.330 align:middle line:84%
Pollyanna or trite, but there's
such a deep level to it,

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:58.410 align:middle line:84%
because if it's coming
from you authentically--

00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:00.930 align:middle line:84%
and again, it's this
connection that I

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:04.500 align:middle line:90%
think that is so important.

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:08.860 align:middle line:84%
I was adopted into a Lakota
family about 28 years ago,

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:12.750 align:middle line:84%
and one of the things that
I learned very early on

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:15.540 align:middle line:84%
is a belief that they
hold that you're actually

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:19.025 align:middle line:90%
born with 405 helping spirits.

00:15:19.025 --> 00:15:20.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh,
that's interesting.

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:24.120 align:middle line:84%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: [LAUGHS] Now,
that's not a literal number,

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:29.400 align:middle line:84%
but it's a number
of huge quantity.

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And like you said, we're
not here to do it alone.

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:36.240 align:middle line:84%
Like, these spirits
are assigned to you.

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.080 align:middle line:84%
Like, you are their
mission, you know?

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:38.880 align:middle line:90%
You're born.

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:41.580 align:middle line:90%
This little soul comes in.

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.500 align:middle line:90%
You are their mission.

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:46.120 align:middle line:84%
But you have to learn
how to dialogue.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:48.690 align:middle line:84%
You have to learn how
to connect with them.

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:52.110 align:middle line:84%
You have to learn to trust
them and them trust you.

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And you have to include
them in your life.

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that,
you'll find that everything

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:02.790 align:middle line:90%
starts to shift.

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:06.420 align:middle line:84%
Your responses are
different to things.

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:09.420 align:middle line:90%
Triggers go away.

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:12.270 align:middle line:84%
A whole-- a piece
sets in, a wholeness

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:15.120 align:middle line:84%
sets in, because
there's this trust that

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.980 align:middle line:90%
is innate to the soul.

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:20.490 align:middle line:84%
It's innate to our
soul's existence.

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:23.580 align:middle line:90%
Trust, joy, love, unconditional.

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:25.620 align:middle line:90%
That's all at our core.

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:28.830 align:middle line:84%
And when we can make
these relationships that

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:31.950 align:middle line:90%
feel that way, we thrive.

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter what
the outside world is doing,

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:38.670 align:middle line:90%
because you're set in yourself.

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And the more people that can do
that, that outside world will

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:44.403 align:middle line:90%
change into the dimension.

00:16:44.403 --> 00:16:45.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The fire goes out.

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:46.500 align:middle line:84%
>>ENGELS-SMITH:
The fire goes out.

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:47.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Like with the shaman.

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:48.495 align:middle line:84%
>>ENGELS-SMITH:
The fire goes out.

00:16:48.495 --> 00:16:49.295 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:49.295 --> 00:16:52.785 align:middle line:84%
And you brought up a point
that I usually don't talk about

00:16:52.785 --> 00:16:53.730 align:middle line:90%
in these interviews.

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:55.200 align:middle line:90%
Only in my private life.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And that has more to
do with the uniqueness

00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:58.740 align:middle line:90%
of the human species.

00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:01.650 align:middle line:84%
Not every species in
the cosmos has guides.

00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:05.862 align:middle line:84%
They don't all have guides
because it's more of a--

00:17:05.862 --> 00:17:08.099 align:middle line:90%
a species that is more--

00:17:08.099 --> 00:17:08.910 align:middle line:90%
how do I say this?

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:10.980 align:middle line:84%
Spirit and the body
have developed together

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:14.730 align:middle line:84%
from the beginning, so there's
not that amnesia through trauma

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:17.470 align:middle line:84%
that we've gone through
again and again and again.

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And I think that poses us a
unique opportunity, but also

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.010 align:middle line:90%
a unique challenge.

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:26.520 align:middle line:84%
Because of all the
trauma, most of us

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:29.037 align:middle line:84%
have been cut off from direct
communication with our soul.

00:17:29.037 --> 00:17:30.870 align:middle line:84%
And this is what you're
trying to bring back

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:31.715 align:middle line:90%
through your work.

00:17:31.715 --> 00:17:33.090 align:middle line:84%
You're helping
people bring back.

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:33.450 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: That's right.

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:35.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And not to feel
like there's something

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:36.420 align:middle line:90%
wrong with us.

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:38.850 align:middle line:84%
We are a unique species
in the universe.

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And trauma-- and
also, I would go

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:44.550 align:middle line:84%
so far as to say even
having been taken advantage

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:48.480 align:middle line:84%
of by other realms at times has
kept us disconnected from self

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:50.790 align:middle line:90%
to the extent we need guides.

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they're here
and why they're assigned to us.

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:54.540 align:middle line:90%
We need them.

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's silly to
not call on them

00:17:56.820 --> 00:18:00.257 align:middle line:84%
when we have this amnesia
of who we are going on.

00:18:00.257 --> 00:18:01.465 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: That's right.

00:18:01.465 --> 00:18:02.320 align:middle line:90%
The forgetting.

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:03.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:04.050 align:middle line:90%
The forgetting.

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:06.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: And
you know, I really

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:11.610 align:middle line:84%
see humans as an advanced
species in the universe.

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:20.520 align:middle line:84%
We're dealing with emotions,
spirituality, mental clarity,

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:22.380 align:middle line:90%
in our physicality.

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:25.220 align:middle line:84%
Not other species really
deal with all that.

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:26.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And free will.

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:26.970 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: And free will.

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:28.270 align:middle line:90%
That's the ticket.

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:29.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:30.720 align:middle line:84%
The spirits call
it sacred choice.

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.910 align:middle line:90%
You have your sacred choice.

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:36.870 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to give you
all of these sets of things

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:42.000 align:middle line:84%
to try to balance out and then
take away your remembering

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.070 align:middle line:90%
and give you free will.

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:45.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's a lot.

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:46.290 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: That is a lot.

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:50.140 align:middle line:84%
But it's calculus instead of
math, or instead of arithmetic.

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:51.015 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:18:51.015 --> 00:18:52.682 align:middle line:84%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: It's
a high-level thing.

00:18:52.682 --> 00:18:56.370 align:middle line:84%
And so yes, those guides are
here to help us through it.

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:59.910 align:middle line:84%
Because as the creator
beings that we are,

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:02.050 align:middle line:90%
we're creating the outcomes.

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:08.768 align:middle line:84%
And so all of life is dependent
on what we're doing there,

00:19:08.768 --> 00:19:09.810 align:middle line:90%
as far as that creation--

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:10.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:11.760 align:middle line:90%
That's particularly interesting.

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:14.430 align:middle line:84%
When you take this unique
species called human beings--

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:16.230 align:middle line:90%
unique, unique species--

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:18.180 align:middle line:84%
that is trying to bring
all this together,

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:22.140 align:middle line:84%
that has an incredibly
refined part of ourselves,

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:24.750 align:middle line:84%
a part that at one
time could create

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:27.060 align:middle line:84%
at the speed of thought
that's now slowed down

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:29.200 align:middle line:90%
into this dimension.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:33.420 align:middle line:84%
So here you have us, all of our
uniqueness, all of our beliefs,

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:37.410 align:middle line:84%
this collective subconscious
constantly influencing us,

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:38.790 align:middle line:90%
and we're creating.

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:41.880 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] It's like we're
behind the wheel of that car.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we're not
creating very responsibly.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:45.960 align:middle line:90%
But we're creating.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: Yeah, we're
creating out of emotion.

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.070 align:middle line:84%
And see, all those different
examples you just gave,

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:51.270 align:middle line:90%
they're not emotional.

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:52.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:56.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: And the
emotion is the element of love,

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.670 align:middle line:84%
and that's why it's
advanced, because now they've

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:01.980 align:middle line:90%
thrown in emotion.

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:04.860 align:middle line:90%
And you have to deal with that.

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:07.230 align:middle line:90%
But I think it's exciting.

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I get jazzed with
what we're capable of doing.

00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:18.530 align:middle line:84%
And not that the state of the
world can't be sad at times,

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:22.340 align:middle line:84%
but I just feel like there's
such a bigger picture.

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And I'm always seeing things
from a bigger picture.

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:26.630 align:middle line:90%
And I've learned how to do that.

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:29.840 align:middle line:84%
There's actually levels
in the awareness scale

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:31.640 align:middle line:90%
that you can function on.

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And I move out into
different states of awareness

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:39.720 align:middle line:84%
and look at a different
issue that way.

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:43.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's fascinating in
how they blend into--

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:45.500 align:middle line:84%
it's all working for
the greater good.

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:51.705 align:middle line:84%
It's all working for the
evolution of humanity.

00:20:51.705 --> 00:20:52.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:54.800 align:middle line:84%
I think that would
be-- if all of us

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:57.200 align:middle line:84%
can keep that in mind,
this might be painful,

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:59.330 align:middle line:84%
but it's all looking
to advance us.

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:00.440 align:middle line:90%
The Earth is advancing.

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:02.480 align:middle line:90%
The cosmos is advancing.

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.100 align:middle line:90%
So it is for our advancement.

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for just reminding
everyone, just do that.

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:10.080 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes when I feel
like I'm not really--

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:13.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm a little too emotional
and too close to something,

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:15.890 align:middle line:90%
what I do is I'm a bird.

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:17.840 align:middle line:90%
I turn myself into an eagle.

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And then I fly
above the situation

00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:24.050 align:middle line:84%
and I watch back on myself and
the others involved in the play

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:25.670 align:middle line:90%
and see what we're each doing.

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:27.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's a wonderful
place to come from,

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:32.330 align:middle line:84%
because you can dispassionately
see all of the emotions

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:36.650 align:middle line:84%
and the objectives
and the agendas

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:39.350 align:middle line:84%
and everything else playing
out dispassionately.

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:41.730 align:middle line:84%
And then you come back in
your body with that knowledge.

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:44.118 align:middle line:84%
So I find a bird's eye
view is very helpful.

00:21:44.118 --> 00:21:46.160 align:middle line:84%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: Yes, that's
a great way to do it.

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:46.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:49.320 align:middle line:84%
That's just one little-- but
you have your other techniques.

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:51.110 align:middle line:84%
One of them is you
create this super self.

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:53.970 align:middle line:84%
And you have-- and I've
listened to your meditations,

00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:57.380 align:middle line:84%
and so one of them is you
help guide people through this

00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:02.450 align:middle line:84%
by helping them understand
that incredibly unique, divine,

00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:07.130 align:middle line:84%
refined, highly developed
spiritual aspect of self,

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:09.327 align:middle line:84%
and move the rest
of you into it.

00:22:09.327 --> 00:22:10.910 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
what you're trying

00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:13.430 align:middle line:84%
to do in these meditations
and in your work

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:16.420 align:middle line:90%
with this super self avatar.

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:17.540 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: Avatar.

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:20.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, very much that,
that I believe that most

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:23.900 align:middle line:90%
of your soul-- and I work--

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:25.520 align:middle line:90%
I consider myself a soul doctor.

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.440 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] You know,
we have doctors

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:29.450 align:middle line:84%
for everything
else but the soul,

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:31.715 align:middle line:84%
and that's the most
important part of of you.

00:22:31.715 --> 00:22:32.882 align:middle line:90%
It's the part that lives on.

00:22:32.882 --> 00:22:35.173 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In some places,
they call them witch doctors.

00:22:35.173 --> 00:22:36.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ENGELS-SMITH:
Well, there you go.

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:37.700 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:38.500 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:39.710 align:middle line:90%
Whatever the case, you know?

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And the soul is really
just slightly in you.

00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:48.770 align:middle line:84%
A tiny percentage of it is
actually animating your body.

00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And I like to think of it
almost like a giant triangle

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:53.300 align:middle line:90%
over the top of your head.

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:56.450 align:middle line:84%
And the apex of that
triangle is setting down

00:22:56.450 --> 00:23:00.770 align:middle line:84%
into your pineal gland, and it's
kind of animating your body.

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:05.570 align:middle line:10%
But the rest of you is
out in its gloriousness,

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:11.790 align:middle line:10%
unwounded and without all the
confines of physical reality

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:14.280 align:middle line:10%
and the wounds and all
the different stuff,

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:20.400 align:middle line:10%
that you can go and experience
and feel your vastness

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:24.150 align:middle line:10%
like the size of the sky
where there's galaxies

00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:25.980 align:middle line:10%
and stars between yourselves.

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:27.450 align:middle line:90%
You're just really vast.

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:30.900 align:middle line:84%
And when you're in that
state of well-being,

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:33.190 align:middle line:90%
your vibration is very high.

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And when you're in that
state of high vibration,

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:40.130 align:middle line:84%
you can attract to yourself
things very quickly.

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:42.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's the difference
from somebody that instantly

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:44.750 align:middle line:84%
manifests and
somebody that doesn't.

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:47.460 align:middle line:84%
It's the state of
vibration that they're in.

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And so when you can
bring your vibration up

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:51.980 align:middle line:84%
into these really
high levels and have

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:54.080 align:middle line:84%
that awareness of
your super self,

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:56.420 align:middle line:84%
then you can call
to you from what

00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:59.570 align:middle line:84%
I call the fields of all
possible possibilities,

00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:01.610 align:middle line:84%
and bring those things
into your heart.

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:04.830 align:middle line:84%
And then bring them
down into your body,

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:07.310 align:middle line:84%
which then theoretically,
you've actually

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:10.580 align:middle line:84%
shifted into a different
version of yourself just then.

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:14.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's a practice that
if it's done regularly--

00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:16.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You do
the 21-day rule?

00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:16.630 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: Yeah, I do.

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:17.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
your practice, right?

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:17.780 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: Yeah.

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:20.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To do the same
meditation for 21 days,

00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:21.292 align:middle line:90%
continue reinforcing that.

00:24:21.292 --> 00:24:22.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: Mm-hmm.

00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:23.610 align:middle line:90%
And I do it with my students.

00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:25.130 align:middle line:90%
And then we get together.

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:26.480 align:middle line:90%
Like, I'll do it with a class.

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:28.700 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll get
together afterwards,

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:31.550 align:middle line:84%
and the feedback that I
get is just off the charts.

00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:32.528 align:middle line:90%
It's just--

00:24:32.528 --> 00:24:34.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it's a very
refined place to go and be.

00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:35.870 align:middle line:90%
And that's enough.

00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:37.572 align:middle line:84%
21 days is plenty
to instantiate that.

00:24:37.572 --> 00:24:38.530 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: Mm-hmm.

00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:39.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:41.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, they say it's 21 days
to break a habit, you know?

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:43.035 align:middle line:84%
And so what you're
actually doing

00:24:43.035 --> 00:24:46.580 align:middle line:84%
is you're in instilling a
new habit of seeing yourself

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:47.880 align:middle line:90%
in a different perspective.

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:48.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.555 align:middle line:84%
And so that's a big part
of what you work on.

00:24:50.555 --> 00:24:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And you have that
available on audiotapes.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.007 align:middle line:90%
I mean, well, downloads now.

00:24:55.007 --> 00:24:56.090 align:middle line:90%
I guess they're downloads.

00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:58.260 align:middle line:84%
They're recordings
people can download.

00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:00.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: Yeah if
people go to my website,

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:01.410 align:middle line:90%
they can get it, you know?

00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:02.210 align:middle line:90%
And it's free.

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:03.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:03.960 align:middle line:90%
no, they're wonderful.

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:04.850 align:middle line:90%
They're wonderful.

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:05.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:08.180 align:middle line:84%
That was fun to play with
them, and I really enjoyed it.

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And came out feeling very floaty
and wonderful and peaceful

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:12.450 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:15.300 align:middle line:84%
So I want to talk about-- these
are a couple specific things

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:16.100 align:middle line:90%
that happened.

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:17.240 align:middle line:90%
Now, these are stories.

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:21.290 align:middle line:84%
You were in Egypt and
you said Pyramid of 11th.

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:22.490 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:24.200 align:middle line:84%
And all this stuff
started happening.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:27.560 align:middle line:84%
This other woman and Edgar
Cayce comes into the story.

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:30.230 align:middle line:84%
Tell us what happened there and
why that was important for you.

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:32.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: Well,
this was back in 1998.

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.080 align:middle line:90%
So it was right--

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:37.010 align:middle line:84%
I was new, relatively
new by maybe five or six

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:38.690 align:middle line:90%
years of doing my practice.

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And we went over there, and the
Pyramid of 11s is its nickname.

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:47.375 align:middle line:84%
I don't actually remember
the name of the pyramid

00:25:47.375 --> 00:25:48.175 align:middle line:90%
that we were in.

00:25:48.175 --> 00:25:49.910 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:52.570 align:middle line:84%
But we went in to
do this ceremony.

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:56.260 align:middle line:84%
And this woman
just started going

00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:59.590 align:middle line:90%
into this really strange sound.

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:00.415 align:middle line:90%
It was like this--

00:26:00.415 --> 00:26:02.890 align:middle line:84%
[CLICKING] [MUTTERING]
you know, just like--

00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:06.010 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't toning and
it wasn't singing.

00:26:06.010 --> 00:26:10.300 align:middle line:84%
It was just this strange
coding, it sounded like.

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:15.190 align:middle line:84%
And so we did this
journey, and we

00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:19.510 align:middle line:84%
were journeying to the
other side of the North Star

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:23.255 align:middle line:84%
where the pyramid
was pointing towards.

00:26:23.255 --> 00:26:24.880 align:middle line:84%
And when we got over
on the other side,

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:27.190 align:middle line:84%
everybody had their
own experiences.

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And mine is the one that really
shaped me in my shamanic work.

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:35.540 align:middle line:84%
And the ceremony
took a long time.

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:38.800 align:middle line:84%
We came back and
we were all spent.

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:42.610 align:middle line:84%
So the decision was made that
we would go back to our rooms

00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:47.360 align:middle line:84%
and then reconvene
at around 7 o'clock.

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:50.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, this one woman,
she went for a walk,

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:52.730 align:middle line:84%
and she ended up
into a bookstore.

00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:53.812 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:26:53.812 --> 00:26:56.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The one who had had
these sounds coming from her?

00:26:56.270 --> 00:26:57.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: No,
a different woman.

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:58.130 align:middle line:90%
A different woman.

00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And this book falls off
the shelf and opens off--

00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:04.250 align:middle line:90%
opens up.

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:08.090 align:middle line:84%
And it was talking
about in April of 1998,

00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:13.850 align:middle line:84%
which is when we were there,
that the third portal will open

00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:18.740 align:middle line:84%
out of a series of three
portals that will allow humans

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:22.550 align:middle line:84%
to have access to things
that they've never had access

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:24.140 align:middle line:90%
to before.

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:26.848 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Fascinating that was
at that time you were there.

00:27:26.848 --> 00:27:28.640 align:middle line:84%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: And
that was an Edgar Cayce

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:31.560 align:middle line:90%
book that fell off the wall.

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And the woman that
did the coding

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:37.310 align:middle line:84%
had been to the other two
portals that they mentioned.

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:39.170 align:middle line:90%
She had just flown in from them.

00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:42.120 align:middle line:84%
One was in "Bahini" I
think is how you say it.

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:43.520 align:middle line:90%
It's in the Caribbean.

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.537 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, the
Bimini Islands?

00:27:45.537 --> 00:27:46.370 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: Yes.

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:47.170 align:middle line:90%
Bimini.

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:49.520 align:middle line:84%
Bimini And the other
one was in the Yucatan.

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:52.880 align:middle line:84%
And she had literally-- she
just joined our group out

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:55.880 align:middle line:84%
of the blue, and
she was just flying

00:27:55.880 --> 00:28:01.340 align:middle line:84%
from these different places and
had that same coding experience

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:03.300 align:middle line:90%
at those other two places.

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:04.940 align:middle line:84%
And so this was
the third portal.

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:06.773 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What did this
come to mean to you,

00:28:06.773 --> 00:28:08.300 align:middle line:90%
these portals being open.

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:10.040 align:middle line:90%
How did you understand that?

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And also, if you care to
share, what happened to you

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:13.940 align:middle line:90%
that really changed your life?

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:14.930 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: Yeah.

00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:16.550 align:middle line:90%
Well-- [SHUDDER].

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:18.110 align:middle line:90%
Well, there were so many things.

00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:19.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's hard
to pinpoint it.

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:23.750 align:middle line:84%
But what the spirits were
saying is all the answers--

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:26.730 align:middle line:84%
all the answers are
available to you,

00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:28.940 align:middle line:84%
but you're not asking
the right questions.

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And you're very much
stuck in paradigms

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:33.720 align:middle line:90%
of what you think has happened.

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And again, we're getting
a lot of Egyptologists

00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:38.720 align:middle line:90%
talking to us at the time.

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:39.560 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] You know?

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:40.670 align:middle line:90%
They're going [GROAN].

00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:41.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:42.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:43.670 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: And--

00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:45.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's some
flaws in that story.

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:46.433 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: Yes.

00:28:46.433 --> 00:28:52.530 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, it took
a while for me

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:55.810 align:middle line:84%
to get a handle on what had
happened because it was so big.

00:28:55.810 --> 00:28:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And I kept trying to get
back over on the other side

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:00.225 align:middle line:90%
of the portal, but I couldn't.

00:29:00.225 --> 00:29:02.460 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't seem to do that.

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:05.340 align:middle line:84%
But randomly, I
would end up there.

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:07.960 align:middle line:84%
And so anyway, it moves
into a different story.

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:08.760 align:middle line:90%
Can I tell you?

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:09.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, do.

00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:12.840 align:middle line:84%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: So I
put on this thing called

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:14.980 align:middle line:90%
a vision quest every year.

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:17.900 align:middle line:90%
In fact, we've done 36 of them.

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And I have these
questers out there.

00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:24.030 align:middle line:84%
And I always journey
in the morning,

00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:27.360 align:middle line:84%
asking how I can
help them the best.

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:29.520 align:middle line:84%
Because almost anybody
that's going on a vision

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:34.230 align:middle line:84%
quest is interested in
connecting more solidly, more

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:40.020 align:middle line:84%
definitively to some
kind of other power.

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm in this
journey, and the next thing

00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:47.190 align:middle line:84%
I know, I'm being
catapulted into the future

00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:50.040 align:middle line:84%
and I'm working with
the descendants.

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:52.530 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, oh, wow.

00:29:52.530 --> 00:29:55.110 align:middle line:84%
You're doing these
ceremonies the same way.

00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:57.420 align:middle line:90%
And they said, well, not really.

00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:58.950 align:middle line:90%
Take a closer look.

00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:02.640 align:middle line:84%
And what I realized was
sitting with us in the circle

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.860 align:middle line:90%
were all these gods.

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the name of
the class that I have now

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:09.060 align:middle line:84%
is called Sitting in
Circle with the Gods.

00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:12.700 align:middle line:84%
You know, but there
were all these gods.

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:15.160 align:middle line:84%
And they said, one of
the reasons that humans

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:20.890 align:middle line:84%
feel so disconnected is because
they have lost the connection

00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:23.800 align:middle line:90%
with the gods of their land.

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:28.510 align:middle line:84%
That there's gods there
that have been danced to

00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:32.290 align:middle line:84%
and asked questions
for thousands of years.

00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:35.740 align:middle line:84%
And now all of a sudden
in this new world of ours,

00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:36.805 align:middle line:90%
we don't do it anymore.

00:30:36.805 --> 00:30:37.605 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, no.

00:30:37.605 --> 00:30:39.535 align:middle line:84%
You get your answers
from CNN or Fox

00:30:39.535 --> 00:30:42.190 align:middle line:84%
whatever your flavor
of reference is.

00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:42.990 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:43.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:44.875 align:middle line:84%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: And
then we're feeling,

00:30:44.875 --> 00:30:47.410 align:middle line:84%
why am I feeling so
disconnected, you know?

00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:51.010 align:middle line:90%
So I told this to the group.

00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:53.980 align:middle line:84%
And there just wasn't
a dry eye in the group.

00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:56.470 align:middle line:84%
And you know, everybody's
heart was so open.

00:30:56.470 --> 00:31:02.240 align:middle line:84%
So we had this beautiful
view of Mount Hood.

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:04.070 align:middle line:90%
I live in Oregon.

00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And this beautiful
view of Mount Hood.

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:12.920 align:middle line:84%
So we decided that we would
make offerings and say

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:15.620 align:middle line:84%
to the mountain, I want
to hear you, because--

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:19.640 align:middle line:84%
oh, the spirits said
in the Northwest,

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:21.440 align:middle line:90%
it's the god of the mountains.

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure it's that
way here in Boulder too.

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:26.500 align:middle line:90%
It's god of the mountains.

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:29.700 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, we just did these
beautiful offerings to them.

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And that ceremony
went on for hours.

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:36.630 align:middle line:84%
And people just stepped
up with these things

00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:38.610 align:middle line:84%
that they had made
from the forest.

00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:41.280 align:middle line:90%
And you know, I want to connect.

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:43.290 align:middle line:90%
I want to connect.

00:31:43.290 --> 00:31:46.290 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, it was
gorgeous in itself.

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:48.180 align:middle line:90%
That was in August.

00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:51.690 align:middle line:84%
Then in September,
I went to Tibet.

00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:53.880 align:middle line:84%
And most of the time
I wasn't with it.

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:55.620 align:middle line:90%
And this is prior to--

00:31:55.620 --> 00:32:00.420 align:middle line:84%
this is 2005, so I don't even
know if there was cell phone--

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:01.298 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:32:01.298 --> 00:32:03.090 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, there was
not the communication

00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:04.080 align:middle line:90%
that we have today.

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:05.850 align:middle line:84%
We were finally
in this one place

00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:07.590 align:middle line:90%
that we turned the news on.

00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:09.150 align:middle line:84%
There was actually
a TV, you know?

00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:11.070 align:middle line:90%
And they had TV in the lobby.

00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And we turned the
news on, and it

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:17.790 align:middle line:84%
said that Mount St.
Helen had erupted again.

00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:20.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, she originally
erupted in the '80s,

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:26.070 align:middle line:84%
but this eruption made
international news.

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:28.650 align:middle line:90%
And so I was like, oh my god.

00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And so I went in
to do a journey,

00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:35.790 align:middle line:84%
and they said, we heard
you, and we are talking.

00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And it is a shaman's dream
to have an active volcano

00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:42.760 align:middle line:90%
that you can speak with.

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.050 align:middle line:90%
This is the mother talking.

00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:44.852 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, wow.

00:32:44.852 --> 00:32:48.480 align:middle line:84%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: [LAUGHS] And
so that just really changed

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:49.280 align:middle line:90%
my life.

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:53.680 align:middle line:84%
I started doing
journeys to this volcano

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:58.060 align:middle line:84%
daily and developing all
different kinds of coursework

00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:03.010 align:middle line:84%
around it in how to use the
information that the spirits

00:33:03.010 --> 00:33:05.950 align:middle line:84%
are giving us to change
our lives and to help us,

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:08.620 align:middle line:84%
because they're
constantly trying to help

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:10.090 align:middle line:90%
us have better existences.

00:33:10.090 --> 00:33:13.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, they never stop
trying to get our attention.

00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:15.590 align:middle line:10%
We're just not listening
a lot of the time.

00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:18.850 align:middle line:84%
That's the issue, because
we're so distracted and busy.

00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:22.150 align:middle line:84%
So I want to also ask
about this other--

00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:25.060 align:middle line:84%
this is another great
story about where

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:28.180 align:middle line:84%
you have other beings, other
entities that are interfering

00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:30.620 align:middle line:84%
with you, and curses that
have been put on each other,

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:31.420 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And right now, a lot of people
are feeling cursed kind of.

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:35.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: Oh, I'm
sure that that's true.

00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:35.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:36.560 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: [LAUGHS]

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:40.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But before we go into
this story about a child with

00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.870 align:middle line:90%
night terrors--

00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:42.050 align:middle line:90%
I love this story--

00:33:42.050 --> 00:33:45.700 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about hands-on
how you would assist someone

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:47.800 align:middle line:84%
in learning to go
into relationship

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:50.685 align:middle line:84%
with the gods of their native
land, wherever they are?

00:33:50.685 --> 00:33:52.060 align:middle line:84%
Including if you're
in the middle

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:53.530 align:middle line:90%
of a city, an urban area.

00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:54.520 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: Yeah.

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:57.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, to me, being a
shamanic practitioner

00:33:57.910 --> 00:34:01.030 align:middle line:84%
and practicing shamanism, the
most important thing to do

00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:03.800 align:middle line:84%
is learn how to
dialogue, how to connect.

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And in shamanism, we
do it through a thing

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:07.090 align:middle line:90%
called journeying.

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:10.330 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I like
journeying so much

00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:12.940 align:middle line:84%
is because it
immediately moves you

00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:14.770 align:middle line:84%
into your right side
of your brain, which

00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:17.350 align:middle line:84%
is where all of this
is taking place,

00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:21.340 align:middle line:84%
where the spirits are alive
and well and you can see them.

00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:25.960 align:middle line:84%
I call it-- it's where you're
clairs are, your clairaudient,

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:29.110 align:middle line:84%
clairsentient,
clairvoyant, you know--

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:31.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I have to say,
I physically feel that.

00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:35.679 align:middle line:84%
If I'm talking to guides,
I feel it trickling down

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:38.679 align:middle line:84%
through literally the right side
of my brain and head and face

00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:39.710 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:40.687 align:middle line:90%
It's quite literal.

00:34:40.687 --> 00:34:42.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: And
that's that active side.

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:44.199 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a
lot of things that

00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:49.239 align:middle line:84%
will stimulate that, meditation
being very big on it.

00:34:49.239 --> 00:34:51.460 align:middle line:84%
But it's hard to
learn how to meditate.

00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:55.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've been a meditator
since I was in my teens,

00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:58.750 align:middle line:84%
and it takes years and
years and years of practice.

00:34:58.750 --> 00:35:01.480 align:middle line:84%
Where journeying, you
can learn in a weekend

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:03.730 align:middle line:84%
and you can be pretty good
at it, because it's active.

00:35:03.730 --> 00:35:05.110 align:middle line:90%
It's an active brain.

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:07.600 align:middle line:84%
Instead of turning
off the brain,

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:10.300 align:middle line:84%
you're just moving over
into the right side

00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:12.675 align:middle line:84%
and you're activating that
part, and so it's much easier.

00:35:12.675 --> 00:35:14.258 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So just
briefly, what do you

00:35:14.258 --> 00:35:16.330 align:middle line:84%
mean by journeying in
the context you use it?

00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:17.530 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: Sure.

00:35:17.530 --> 00:35:19.750 align:middle line:84%
Journeying is going
into an altered state

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:21.880 align:middle line:84%
which is, again,
that altered state is

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:23.740 align:middle line:90%
moving into this shifting.

00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:25.990 align:middle line:90%
And it's done by closing--

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:28.030 align:middle line:84%
you're blindfolding
yourself actually,

00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:29.860 align:middle line:84%
because light
actually stimulates

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:31.630 align:middle line:90%
the left side of the brain.

00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:34.990 align:middle line:84%
But closing your eyes and
blindfolding yourself,

00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:39.190 align:middle line:84%
and then using the drum
as a sonic instrument,

00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:42.460 align:middle line:84%
or rattles that
will reconnect you

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:45.910 align:middle line:84%
to that original imprint, that
DNA that we were talking about,

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:47.680 align:middle line:90%
the heartbeat of the Earth.

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:50.430 align:middle line:84%
And you move into
an altered state.

00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:52.990 align:middle line:84%
And you go in with a
very clear intention.

00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:56.150 align:middle line:84%
Like, what do you
want to find out?

00:35:56.150 --> 00:36:01.690 align:middle line:84%
And it starts appearing to you
in either any of those senses

00:36:01.690 --> 00:36:03.580 align:middle line:84%
that we talked
about, those clairs.

00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:07.390 align:middle line:84%
It might not be visual
like on a visual screen,

00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:10.525 align:middle line:84%
but that knowingness,
which is claircognitive

00:36:10.525 --> 00:36:11.800 align:middle line:90%
will come through.

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:12.830 align:middle line:90%
That's journeying.

00:36:12.830 --> 00:36:16.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what about
for people who are--

00:36:16.330 --> 00:36:19.670 align:middle line:84%
they're alone somewhere in the
world but they want to do this?

00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:22.450 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
sacred types of drumming

00:36:22.450 --> 00:36:24.260 align:middle line:90%
recordings that are out there.

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:26.740 align:middle line:84%
So you can-- would
you recommend people

00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:29.285 align:middle line:84%
do that or get their own drum
and just do their own thing?

00:36:29.285 --> 00:36:30.160 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: Both.

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:32.480 align:middle line:84%
Some people really like
to drum for themselves.

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:37.000 align:middle line:84%
And it does have a very
soothing, altering feel to it.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.175 align:middle line:90%
And/or getting any of those CDs.

00:36:39.175 --> 00:36:40.175 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there's so many.

00:36:40.175 --> 00:36:40.975 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So many.

00:36:40.975 --> 00:36:42.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ENGELS-SMITH:
--free on YouTube now.

00:36:42.970 --> 00:36:44.620 align:middle line:90%
You can just pull them up.

00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:46.150 align:middle line:84%
The thing that's
important, though,

00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:48.340 align:middle line:84%
is it's not real
rhythmic, that it's

00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:52.900 align:middle line:84%
kind of a monotone type
of thing in the drumming.

00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:54.850 align:middle line:90%
And you can do it anywhere.

00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:58.060 align:middle line:84%
Or people will say, well,
I don't want to use a drum.

00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:01.900 align:middle line:84%
That's OK, but try it first,
because you can look up

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:05.170 align:middle line:84%
studies of drumming
with people that

00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:09.200 align:middle line:84%
are hooked up to instruments
to do their brain measurement.

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:10.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: EEG.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:10.420 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: Mm-hmm.

00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:11.220 align:middle line:90%
EEG.

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And it just takes it off
the charts in the altering,

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:17.130 align:middle line:84%
much more than
meditation even can.

00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:19.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It make sense, because
you are going into a trance

00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:20.230 align:middle line:90%
very quickly.

00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:20.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: Mm-hmm.

00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:20.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:22.210 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: Yeah.

00:37:22.210 --> 00:37:24.940 align:middle line:84%
And there's, like I said,
several YouTube things

00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:27.890 align:middle line:84%
that actually show this,
and it's very convincing.

00:37:27.890 --> 00:37:28.690 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, use a drum.

00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:28.930 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:29.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, good.

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:30.940 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't matter
where you are,

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:32.710 align:middle line:84%
that you don't have to
even go to a workshop,

00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:33.710 align:middle line:90%
although they're lovely.

00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:34.820 align:middle line:90%
You can start today.

00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:35.620 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:38.668 align:middle line:84%
So I want to get to the
notion that it's not just us.

00:37:38.668 --> 00:37:40.210 align:middle line:84%
Other things are
interfering with us.

00:37:40.210 --> 00:37:43.160 align:middle line:84%
There are people that are not
wishing us well sometimes.

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:45.200 align:middle line:84%
And talk about the child
with night terrors.

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:45.470 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: [LAUGHS]

00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:46.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's such
an interesting story,

00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:47.420 align:middle line:90%
the whole thing.

00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:48.337 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: It is.

00:37:48.337 --> 00:37:49.850 align:middle line:90%
It is a very interesting story.

00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And again, this story happened
pretty early on in my career.

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And I hadn't learned
about curses yet.

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:05.200 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't had any coursework
in that type of thing.

00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And a woman brought
her child to me

00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:10.620 align:middle line:90%
that was having night terrors.

00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And they were very
almost vicious, you know?

00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:16.710 align:middle line:84%
People that have
night terrors are

00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:20.430 align:middle line:84%
very different from a nightmare
in that you can't wake them up.

00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:22.800 align:middle line:84%
And they sound like
they're being tortured

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:26.070 align:middle line:90%
or there's growling often.

00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And the more you shake them
and try to wake them up,

00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:31.650 align:middle line:84%
the deeper they go
into the terror.

00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:35.430 align:middle line:84%
So it's counterproductive
of trying to help them

00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:37.420 align:middle line:90%
in the classical way.

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:40.290 align:middle line:84%
And so anyway, she
brought the child in.

00:38:40.290 --> 00:38:43.410 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I'll
give it a try, you know?

00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And I was going to do a soul
retrieval, which is what

00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:48.150 align:middle line:90%
I did most of my practice with.

00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:51.390 align:middle line:84%
But I got into this
journey, and it was really

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:57.690 align:middle line:84%
kind of stereotypical in that
there was this little African

00:38:57.690 --> 00:39:00.618 align:middle line:90%
pygmy person standing there.

00:39:00.618 --> 00:39:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And he had a spear
in his hand and he

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:04.650 align:middle line:84%
had grass pompoms
around his wrist

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:06.423 align:middle line:90%
and his ankle, a grass skirt.

00:39:06.423 --> 00:39:08.340 align:middle line:84%
You know, he's like
[HIGH-PITCHED GIBBERISH]..

00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:10.980 align:middle line:84%
He's just screaming at me
in some kind of gibberish,

00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:11.220 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:12.095 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, whoa.

00:39:12.095 --> 00:39:13.800 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And my spirit
helpers were saying

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:21.690 align:middle line:84%
that this child had a curse
on him from another lifetime,

00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:24.420 align:middle line:84%
and the way it's showing
up in this lifetime then

00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:26.940 align:middle line:90%
is through the night terrors.

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And they said, you have
to break the curse.

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:31.380 align:middle line:84%
I said, [LAUGHS] I don't
know how to do that.

00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:34.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They didn't train us
for that back in med school.

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:36.300 align:middle line:84%
>>ENGELS-SMITH:
[LAUGHS] Exactly.

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:39.585 align:middle line:84%
And so they said, just
follow my directions

00:39:39.585 --> 00:39:42.070 align:middle line:90%
and we'll do it for you.

00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:43.200 align:middle line:90%
So I did.

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:46.170 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing I
knew, the little guy

00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:49.860 align:middle line:84%
became very deflated,
almost like a balloon

00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:52.560 align:middle line:84%
that lost its air,
dropped his spear,

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:54.020 align:middle line:90%
and just kind of sulked off.

00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:54.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The little pygmy.

00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:56.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: Yeah,
the little pygmy.

00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:58.980 align:middle line:84%
So I came back and
finished the soul retrieval

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:03.270 align:middle line:84%
and doing the other things, and
told the woman and the child,

00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:05.350 align:middle line:90%
let me know how it goes.

00:40:05.350 --> 00:40:06.150 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:07.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You didn't
tell the parent

00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:08.520 align:middle line:90%
about the pygmy, did you?

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:09.000 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: I told her.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:09.420 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I told her.

00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:09.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, you did?

00:40:09.610 --> 00:40:10.650 align:middle line:90%
So she knew what was going on?

00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:10.960 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: Yeah.

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:11.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: She was OK with that?

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:11.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: Yeah.

00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:14.610 align:middle line:84%
I just said there was a curse
from a different lifetime.

00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:17.070 align:middle line:84%
And I don't remember
the details back then.

00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:19.350 align:middle line:90%
Now I do everything aloud.

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:20.770 align:middle line:90%
This was a long time ago.

00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:23.870 align:middle line:90%
So anyway, they left my office.

00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:27.110 align:middle line:84%
And I go in and I clean
everything with sage.

00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'm cleaning my little area
and my tools and everything

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:31.670 align:middle line:90%
that I use.

00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing I hear
is this, boom, boom, boom.

00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And I ran out into
the dining room,

00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:43.820 align:middle line:84%
and this African mask had
literally jumped off the wall

00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:47.550 align:middle line:84%
and slid on the wood floors
underneath the dining room

00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:48.350 align:middle line:90%
table.

00:40:48.350 --> 00:40:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it's
black with grass hair.

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:53.330 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:53.330 --> 00:40:54.310 align:middle line:90%
And it's a mask--

00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:58.700 align:middle line:84%
it's the first piece of
artifact that I had collected.

00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:01.310 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of
tribal artifacts.

00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:04.640 align:middle line:84%
And I was 22 when I
got it just randomly.

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at it
and I said, so what

00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:10.250 align:middle line:90%
do you know about curses?

00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And I took him into my office,
and I journeyed with him.

00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:15.830 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you
know, you were really

00:41:15.830 --> 00:41:20.270 align:middle line:84%
in a very precarious
situation, but I'm here,

00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:22.130 align:middle line:90%
and I'll be an ally to you.

00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And when I show up,
you'll know that it's

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:27.480 align:middle line:90%
a curse you're working with.

00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'll make you
invisible, because you

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:34.290 align:middle line:84%
don't want to be seen in
that realm by the cursors.

00:41:34.290 --> 00:41:35.990 align:middle line:90%
And so I was like, OK.

00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:37.340 align:middle line:90%
So I guess this is--

00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:39.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get some
training here, you know?

00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:39.890 align:middle line:90%
On how to do this.

00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:40.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There's your sign.

00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:42.630 align:middle line:84%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: Yeah,
there's my sign.

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:48.500 align:middle line:84%
So then I went in and I turned
on the TV to watch Oprah back

00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:49.910 align:middle line:90%
in the days when she was on.

00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:51.675 align:middle line:90%
And what's the topic?

00:41:51.675 --> 00:41:52.475 align:middle line:90%
Night terrors.

00:41:52.475 --> 00:41:54.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]
There's your other sign.

00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:55.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ENGELS-SMITH:
Yeah, my other sign.

00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And how there is
no cure for them.

00:41:59.030 --> 00:42:04.130 align:middle line:84%
They give you drugs that
are just anti-hallucinogens,

00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:08.050 align:middle line:84%
and they just kind
of flatline people.

00:42:08.050 --> 00:42:14.240 align:middle line:84%
And the parents were on
there, spouses, psychiatrists,

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:17.330 align:middle line:84%
and they were just talking
about how they have no--

00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:19.590 align:middle line:84%
they don't know
what causes them.

00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:25.900 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, here I have been
given this beautiful experience

00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:28.802 align:middle line:90%
to say, I know how to help this.

00:42:28.802 --> 00:42:30.010 align:middle line:90%
You know, I know how to help.

00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:32.470 align:middle line:84%
And I can train
people how to do this.

00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:33.387 align:middle line:90%
And this is an answer.

00:42:33.387 --> 00:42:34.187 align:middle line:90%
Like, [GASP].

00:42:34.187 --> 00:42:36.460 align:middle line:84%
I said, I can envision
myself calling up the studio.

00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:37.280 align:middle line:90%
Oh, hey, Oprah?

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:38.270 align:middle line:90%
I just got some information.

00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:38.610 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:39.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:40.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, no.

00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:41.365 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's fascinating.

00:42:41.365 --> 00:42:43.210 align:middle line:84%
Did you ultimately
end up teaching this?

00:42:43.210 --> 00:42:43.600 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: Oh, yeah.

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:45.183 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did other
people come to you

00:42:45.183 --> 00:42:47.870 align:middle line:84%
with these situations
where family members had

00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:48.670 align:middle line:90%
night terrors?

00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:49.503 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: Yes.

00:42:49.503 --> 00:42:51.895 align:middle line:84%
And all of them,
as far as I know,

00:42:51.895 --> 00:42:55.340 align:middle line:84%
have been cured
of them from that.

00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:58.210 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I have a
Curse Unraveling class

00:42:58.210 --> 00:42:59.110 align:middle line:90%
in a couple weeks.

00:42:59.110 --> 00:42:59.395 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:42:59.395 --> 00:43:00.395 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, wonderful.

00:43:00.395 --> 00:43:01.213 align:middle line:90%
Glad to hear that.

00:43:01.213 --> 00:43:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And I assume that comes
up every now and then.

00:43:03.130 --> 00:43:04.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: It
does, but you have

00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:05.300 align:middle line:84%
to have training
to get in there.

00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:06.220 align:middle line:84%
You have to know
what you're doing.

00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:06.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:08.200 align:middle line:84%
They have to have been
through some other things.

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:08.500 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: Yeah.

00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:10.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So Jan, we're
about out of time.

00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:12.010 align:middle line:90%
So any final thoughts?

00:43:12.010 --> 00:43:15.250 align:middle line:84%
We have so much
we can talk about.

00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:16.945 align:middle line:84%
Final thoughts of
anything we have not

00:43:16.945 --> 00:43:18.820 align:middle line:84%
squeezed into our
conversation that you think

00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:21.930 align:middle line:84%
is really important for
people to know right now.

00:43:21.930 --> 00:43:24.160 align:middle line:84%
>>ENGELS-SMITH:
Well, final thoughts.

00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:28.060 align:middle line:10%
I think that there's
a saying that says--

00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:29.470 align:middle line:10%
there's two sayings.

00:43:29.470 --> 00:43:32.710 align:middle line:84%
The darkest hour is
just before dawn.

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:36.940 align:middle line:10%
And the other one is that
you can't solve a problem

00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:39.700 align:middle line:10%
at the level of the problem.

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:42.100 align:middle line:84%
The solution has got to
be at a different level.

00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And to me, what
that is saying is

00:43:44.110 --> 00:43:48.160 align:middle line:84%
you have to be at a higher
vibration to look at things

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:50.350 align:middle line:84%
and to feel them
and to understand

00:43:50.350 --> 00:43:55.690 align:middle line:84%
them to be able to find a
solution that actually merits

00:43:55.690 --> 00:44:00.600 align:middle line:84%
the types of changes
that we ultimately want.

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:05.250 align:middle line:84%
And for myself, I have
this incessant need

00:44:05.250 --> 00:44:08.250 align:middle line:90%
to help people be well.

00:44:08.250 --> 00:44:12.700 align:middle line:84%
I just think that life is to
be enjoyed and to be happy

00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:17.970 align:middle line:84%
and to not have to be
burdened with the things that

00:44:17.970 --> 00:44:19.410 align:middle line:90%
are burdening us.

00:44:19.410 --> 00:44:24.170 align:middle line:84%
There's healings
and possibilities

00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:26.810 align:middle line:90%
available to people.

00:44:26.810 --> 00:44:29.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But we need to
come to rely on each other.

00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:31.310 align:middle line:84%
Let each other in
a little bit more.

00:44:31.310 --> 00:44:33.740 align:middle line:84%
Help each other a
little bit more.

00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:36.340 align:middle line:84%
Practice loving
kindness and not be

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:38.840 align:middle line:84%
afraid to let go the parts of
us that aren't working anymore

00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:39.170 align:middle line:90%
for us.

00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:40.190 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: Absolutely.

00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:40.700 align:middle line:90%
That's the--

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:41.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Coming full circle.

00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:42.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: Yeah, that's
the medicine of the north.

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:43.340 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:45.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Medicine of the
north, letting go, OK.

00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:46.370 align:middle line:90%
That's a big one.

00:44:46.370 --> 00:44:47.490 align:middle line:90%
Let that north wind blow.

00:44:47.490 --> 00:44:48.740 align:middle line:90%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: Yeah, exactly.

00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:50.670 align:middle line:84%

so much for joining us.

I know everybody's always
soothed by your messages.

00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:54.500 align:middle line:84%
It was really lovely
having you here again.

00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:56.382 align:middle line:84%
>>ENGELS-SMITH: Oh,
thank you, Regina.

00:44:56.382 --> 00:44:59.030 align:middle line:84%
I just think that
what you are doing

00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:02.660 align:middle line:84%
is just outstanding,

of refuge for a lot of people

00:45:06.110 --> 00:45:06.590 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:45:06.590 --> 00:45:06.900 align:middle line:90%

00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:07.400 align:middle line:90%
It is.
