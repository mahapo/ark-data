00:00:28.124 --> 00:00:29.540 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Perhaps no word

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.190 align:middle line:10%
strikes more fear into a
person than the word cancer.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.020 align:middle line:10%
It's understandable when you
consider that its origins have

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.310 align:middle line:10%
largely remained a
mystery and no two cancers

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.070 align:middle line:10%
seem to respond predictably
to the same common therapies

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.950 align:middle line:10%
available.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.270 align:middle line:90%
But that story may be changing.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.020 align:middle line:84%
Travis Christofferson's book,
"Tripping Over the Truth,"

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.820 align:middle line:84%
lays out a very clear history of
cancer research and the return

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.130 align:middle line:84%
of the theory that was buried
under the rush to radiate

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.650 align:middle line:84%
and poison first and
ask questions later.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.810 align:middle line:84%
The travesty of the cancer
game is the toxicity

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.269 align:middle line:84%
so many people
have been through.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:09.040 align:middle line:84%
And if reading your book is
an indication, some of this

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.670 align:middle line:90%
could have been avoided.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.760 align:middle line:84%
Almost all of it could
have been avoided,

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.770 align:middle line:84%
had some of the
truth been embraced

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.160 align:middle line:84%
a long time ago in the
research through the years.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And first of all, I want to
find out how you ended up

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.270 align:middle line:90%
writing this superb book.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.360 align:middle line:84%
How did you end up
down this rabbit hole?

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.610 align:middle line:90%
>>TRAVIS CHRISTOFFERSON: Yeah.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.300 align:middle line:84%
For me, it was really a
collision of I guess probably

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.710 align:middle line:90%
obsessive curiosity.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.690 align:middle line:10%
And I was in grad school and I
was working on a cancer theory

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:34.570 align:middle line:10%
class.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.680 align:middle line:10%
And prior to that I'd
been taught like everybody

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.090 align:middle line:10%
about the somatic
mutation theory of cancer,

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.490 align:middle line:10%
the prevailing theory at
the time, which is cancer

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.760 align:middle line:10%
is caused by a sequential
series of mutations.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And I stumbled onto this book
called "Cancer is a Metabolic

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.010 align:middle line:90%
Disease" by Tom Seyfried.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.920 align:middle line:84%
And I looked through it and was
just floored by the content.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.960 align:middle line:84%
It was just this remarkable
book with this just plethora

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.170 align:middle line:84%
of evidence backing this sort
of nontraditional alternative

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.850 align:middle line:84%
theory of cancer that
its origin is metabolic.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.930 align:middle line:84%
So I was so taken aback by
it I flew out and saw Tom

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.259 align:middle line:84%
and had compiled a
list of questions.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.600 align:middle line:84%
And we sat and talked
for about six hours.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.100 align:middle line:84%
And I came back and really
dove into the material

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.990 align:middle line:90%
because it was so intriguing.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And then around that
same time, a book

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.046 align:middle line:84%
called "The Emperor of All
Maladies" had come out,

00:02:20.046 --> 00:02:22.170 align:middle line:84%
a Pulitzer Prize winning
New York Times bestseller.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What's it called,
"The Emperor of All Maladies?"

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:25.648 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Yeah.

00:02:25.648 --> 00:02:27.560 align:middle line:90%
I think it came out in 2012.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And really it was the first
comprehensive history of cancer

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.800 align:middle line:84%
that-- this hadn't
been written before,

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.780 align:middle line:84%
this sweeping history of
our tenure with cancer,

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.860 align:middle line:84%
starting from the
very beginning.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.962 align:middle line:84%
And so it was told from
a gene centric view that

00:02:43.962 --> 00:02:46.420 align:middle line:84%
sort of marched through the
history and got to where we are

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.020 align:middle line:84%
today with the somatic
mutation theory.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And so the challenge to me was
this was such a beautiful story

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.150 align:middle line:84%
that goes way back
to a guy named

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.060 align:middle line:84%
Otto Warburg, who first proposed
this theory in the '20s.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And then it was
brush under the table

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.320 align:middle line:84%
while the somatic
mutation theory took hold

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.370 align:middle line:84%
and now it's made
this resurgence.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And so the challenge to
me was to write the story

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.520 align:middle line:84%
from a historical context
because I think it was

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.746 align:middle line:90%
a story that need to be told.

00:03:11.746 --> 00:03:12.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I think so.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's important
for naysayers, people

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:21.430 align:middle line:84%
who are-- maybe justifiably
so-- living in such fear

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.120 align:middle line:84%
that you have to
look toward anyone

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.570 align:middle line:84%
that appears to be in authority,
which often means a white coat.

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're looking
there and say if you really

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.530 align:middle line:84%
want to start expanding
your research,

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.960 align:middle line:84%
maybe someone in your family has
cancer, you just need to know.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.040 align:middle line:84%
I like the fact
that you have laid

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.170 align:middle line:90%
the historical perspective.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And as you say,
you're not the first

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.660 align:middle line:84%
but you've done it
in a beautiful way.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.456 align:middle line:84%
The historical
perspective-- and we

00:03:47.456 --> 00:03:48.830 align:middle line:84%
have a mutual
friend named Sandy,

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.130 align:middle line:84%
who turned me on to your
work, said, oh, Regina, you're

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.930 align:middle line:90%
going to love it.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.576 align:middle line:90%
It reads like a thriller.

00:03:53.576 --> 00:03:57.410 align:middle line:84%
It's a page turner
on cancer, really?

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.340 align:middle line:84%
But that is an ode to
your writing style,

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.500 align:middle line:90%
which is really quite nice.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.040 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is
once you understand

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.490 align:middle line:84%
how we came about
these belief systems

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.553 align:middle line:84%
and what the evidence
in the day for it

00:04:08.553 --> 00:04:13.010 align:middle line:84%
was, it makes some sense of why
they went certain directions.

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.910 align:middle line:84%
So I thought we might
begin more or less

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.700 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning, the beginning
of your story in the 1700s

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.910 align:middle line:90%
with Percival Potts in London.

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to take
people through the book.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:26.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Sure.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.720 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, everything we know
about cancer, the history to me

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.660 align:middle line:84%
is remarkable because
it's not a linear line.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.640 align:middle line:84%
There's just these punctuations
where we skip from one thing

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:38.590 align:middle line:90%
to the next.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And when you look
back in retrospect,

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.780 align:middle line:84%
you see where we
have made mistakes.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And if you could go back
to the days of the Greeks,

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.590 align:middle line:84%
we'd be talking right
now that cancer for sure

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.460 align:middle line:84%
was caused by an
abundance of black bile

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.050 align:middle line:84%
and we'd be dead sure
that was the cause.

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.690 align:middle line:84%
But now we know, of
course, that seems silly.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.000 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, the very beginning
one of the first sort

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.140 align:middle line:84%
of landmark
understanding of cancer

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.450 align:middle line:84%
was a surgeon
named Percival Pott

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:11.300 align:middle line:84%
in London, who noticed that this
condition that affected what

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.590 align:middle line:84%
was the chimney sweeps at
the time, these children,

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.400 align:middle line:84%
these boys that
climbed into chimneys

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.360 align:middle line:84%
and swept out the ash during
the Industrial Revolution.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.770 align:middle line:84%
It was a horrible job,
probably the worst job anybody

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:22.570 align:middle line:90%
could have.

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's very sad
reading about it in your book,

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.430 align:middle line:90%
how these kids lived.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:26.430 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Right.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.740 align:middle line:84%
It was a horrific time and
they were indentured servants.

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.560 align:middle line:84%
I think the infant
mortality rate was 50%.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.239 align:middle line:84%
Longevity, disease-- almost
everybody had tuberculosis.

00:05:35.239 --> 00:05:37.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And these little
kids are seven, eight, nine,

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:38.170 align:middle line:90%
10 years old.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:39.169 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Right.

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:43.080 align:middle line:84%
And so they would climb up in
the chimneys and sweep them out

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.789 align:middle line:84%
and they started getting
this like scrotal warts

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:47.080 align:middle line:90%
and nobody knew what they were.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
they didn't bathe,

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.120 align:middle line:84%
they didn't have
access to bathing.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.120 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Right.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And so they chalked them up
to a syphilis-like thing.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, Pott noticed
there's no way

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.730 align:middle line:84%
that a venereal disease would
distribute itself evenly

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.110 align:middle line:90%
across this group of occupation.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
seven-year-olds.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.164 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Right.

00:06:04.164 --> 00:06:05.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They didn't
mention that part.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:07.788 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Like
a contagious virus thing

00:06:07.788 --> 00:06:08.590 align:middle line:90%
that can spread.

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:13.090 align:middle line:84%
So he assigned it to
the first carcinogen.

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:16.030 align:middle line:84%
It was the first documented
case that the ash

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.610 align:middle line:84%
could be a carcinogen and
cause and neoplastic growth

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:20.700 align:middle line:90%
of cancer.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And so that was really an
amazing leap intellectually

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.630 align:middle line:84%
because now we tied cancer
to the external environment.

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:29.350 align:middle line:84%
Lurking around us
were these agents

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:32.790 align:middle line:84%
that could possibly come in and
cause this neoplastic growth.

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And we knew from
another German scientist

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.457 align:middle line:84%
that cancer was just
pathological cell

00:06:39.457 --> 00:06:40.290 align:middle line:90%
growth at that time.

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:42.011 align:middle line:90%
It was growth out of control.

00:06:42.011 --> 00:06:43.510 align:middle line:84%
So this was the
first moment that it

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:44.740 align:middle line:90%
was tied to the environment.

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.190 align:middle line:84%
And now I think
we're at, if you look

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:51.810 align:middle line:84%
at the NCI's website, 300
or 400 known carcinogens

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:52.960 align:middle line:90%
in our environment.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.767 align:middle line:84%
So they're lurking
around us everywhere.

00:06:55.767 --> 00:06:56.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All right.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.740 align:middle line:90%
Let's just back up a tad.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.829 align:middle line:84%
I said I wanted to dive
into the historical part,

00:07:00.829 --> 00:07:02.870 align:middle line:84%
but first let's lay a
little more foundation then

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.110 align:middle line:84%
we're going to move back
into the history of it.

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And you mentioned earlier
the somatic mutation theory.

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:13.560 align:middle line:84%
Explain what that is for
everybody so they understand

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.072 align:middle line:90%
the model we're stuck in.

00:07:15.072 --> 00:07:16.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Sure.

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:20.080 align:middle line:84%
So the schematic mutation theory
is still the prevailing theory,

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.200 align:middle line:84%
it's still overwhelming
consensus theory.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And what it states
is that cancer

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:27.900 align:middle line:84%
is caused by a progressive
series of mutations

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.430 align:middle line:90%
to key oncogenes.

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And so the genes that control
the cell cycle, right,

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.980 align:middle line:84%
tumor suppressor genes or
driver genes, a certain series

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:39.810 align:middle line:84%
will come in and sort of
rewire the cellular circuitry

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:41.880 align:middle line:84%
towards uncontrolled
growth, the six hallmark

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.040 align:middle line:90%
features of cancer.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.420 align:middle line:84%
So it states that cancer is
driven by physical mutations

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.480 align:middle line:90%
to DNA.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:50.970 align:middle line:90%
That's the prevailing theory.

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:53.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that has
been for how long now?

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.626 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: The somatic
mutation theory really

00:07:55.626 --> 00:07:58.620 align:middle line:84%
got locked down by a series
of experiments in 1976.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:07:59.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:00.420 align:middle line:90%
So 40 years.

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:06.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's also when our modes
and modalities of healing

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:10.980 align:middle line:84%
occurred, too, roughly--
the rise of chemotherapy

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:12.349 align:middle line:90%
and radiation and so forth.

00:08:12.349 --> 00:08:14.390 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to get
into the history of chemo.

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:15.970 align:middle line:90%
That was fascinating, too.

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:16.770 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:19.450 align:middle line:84%
So going forward
just a little bit,

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:24.960 align:middle line:84%
you say that this particular
model of understanding

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.190 align:middle line:84%
and the various therapies
we have available

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:30.060 align:middle line:84%
is really more centered
on shrinking tumors,

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:32.990 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily on
ridding the body

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:35.370 align:middle line:90%
of the source of the disease.

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:37.429 align:middle line:84%
And that's really kind
of been the fatal flaw

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:38.692 align:middle line:90%
in cancer therapy, right?

00:08:38.692 --> 00:08:39.650 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Yeah.

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:44.240 align:middle line:84%
That really came
around-- the FDA,

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:47.370 align:middle line:84%
I think, got into-- during
the Clinton administration,

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:50.610 align:middle line:84%
they were accused
of not doing enough.

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:53.910 align:middle line:84%
So instead of saying, we need
to prolong survival, the FDA

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:59.030 align:middle line:84%
kind of ratcheted back the
necessary markers for drug

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:01.980 align:middle line:84%
approval and said you
just need tumor shrinkage.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And so now, of course,
they're criticized

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:06.150 align:middle line:84%
that that was
probably not the best

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.880 align:middle line:84%
way to go because now we
get drugs that shrink tumors

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.790 align:middle line:84%
but don't confer any survival
and come at terrible costs

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:15.420 align:middle line:84%
financially and
side effects wise.

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:19.920 align:middle line:84%
So you feel for their position
originally why they did it,

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.360 align:middle line:84%
but it's sort of come full
circle that it's probably

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.760 align:middle line:90%
not the way to go.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.410 align:middle line:84%
But the original
chemotherapies that

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:30.740 align:middle line:84%
came about, they
came during a time

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:32.860 align:middle line:84%
when the understanding of
cancer was what's called

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.900 align:middle line:90%
the single cell hypothesis.

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And what that was
is the idea was

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:39.560 align:middle line:84%
that we had to kill a cancer
down to the last single cell,

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.742 align:middle line:84%
and if you didn't get
that last single cell then

00:09:41.742 --> 00:09:44.200 align:middle line:84%
it would probably reignite and
you'd have recurrence and be

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.910 align:middle line:90%
back where you started from.

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:47.700 align:middle line:84%
So under that
paradigm of thought,

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:52.090 align:middle line:84%
that's when the NCI really
pushed chemotherapy hard

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:55.350 align:middle line:84%
in the '70s and it was a
much more liberal time.

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:59.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean the FDA was not-- they
just allowed these guys kind of

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.540 align:middle line:90%
to go for it.

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And so again, they did
fell a handful of cancers--

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:07.360 align:middle line:84%
testicular, some childhood
leukemias, Hodgkin's disease--

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.820 align:middle line:84%
but they pushed and pushed and
pushed chemotherapy as hard

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:12.750 align:middle line:84%
as they could because of
this single cell hypothesis.

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And then in the late '70s,
early '80s, they went too far

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:20.180 align:middle line:84%
and they tried to attack the
hard cancers like lung, breast,

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:20.980 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:24.520 align:middle line:84%
And we're almost killing
the patients and not--

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.312 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: By using
carpet bombing the body.

00:10:26.312 --> 00:10:27.311 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Right.

00:10:27.311 --> 00:10:28.730 align:middle line:84%
And doing all that
and not getting

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:32.590 align:middle line:84%
any really meaningful
increase in survival.

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:35.702 align:middle line:84%
So then they had to step back
and rethink how they did.

00:10:35.702 --> 00:10:38.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I think it said
in the beginning of your book

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.690 align:middle line:84%
that the survival
rates of cancer today

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:42.860 align:middle line:84%
are very similar to what
they were in the 1950s.

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:43.240 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Yeah.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:43.520 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Before all of this.

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:45.670 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Right.

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:46.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:48.862 align:middle line:84%
That's the biggest statistic
that's seared in my mind.

00:10:48.862 --> 00:10:50.320 align:middle line:84%
The statistics are
everywhere-- one

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:54.620 align:middle line:84%
in three women will be
diagnosed, one in two men.

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:57.520 align:middle line:84%
I think over 600,000
Americans will die this year.

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.810 align:middle line:84%
But the biggest one
is the death rate

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:01.734 align:middle line:90%
has not changed much since 1950.

00:11:01.734 --> 00:11:03.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In spite
of all of this.

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:04.775 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: In
spite of all this.

00:11:04.775 --> 00:11:07.790 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why my book,
sort of the underlying theme

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:12.582 align:middle line:84%
was, OK, we're guided by
what we know of cancer.

00:11:12.582 --> 00:11:14.290 align:middle line:84%
The therapies we're
developing are guided

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:16.600 align:middle line:90%
by how we perceive the disease.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.640 align:middle line:84%
And so as we perceive
the diseases,

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:22.030 align:middle line:84%
the cause from
mutations, we transition

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:24.420 align:middle line:84%
to the era of targeted
medicine in the '80s.

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And so we've tried to target
these mutational derivatives

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.600 align:middle line:84%
of oncogenes and
really, really, it's

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:35.020 align:middle line:84%
been a terrible outcome--
very, very little success.

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:38.720 align:middle line:84%
And this is not beyond my book,
this is coming from everybody.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.710 align:middle line:84%
We need to rethink
targeted therapies.

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:44.380 align:middle line:84%
They may have a place in
some certain scenarios,

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:48.290 align:middle line:84%
but this idea of a single
agent therapy to cure cancer

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:49.430 align:middle line:90%
is scrapped.

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:49.522 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:49.522 --> 00:11:51.190 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't yet
doesn't make any sense

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:55.700 align:middle line:84%
once your book starts
revealing the nature

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:59.470 align:middle line:84%
of the metabolic
cause for cancer.

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:03.660 align:middle line:84%
So now let's continue on and
I'm going to toss names out

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:05.290 align:middle line:84%
and you can tell us
their contribution,

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:07.280 align:middle line:84%
because I'm going
somewhat sequentially--

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.000 align:middle line:84%
although in the book, like you
say, this isn't a linear story.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.240 align:middle line:84%
So we're now down to
David Paul Huntsman,

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:17.130 align:middle line:84%
and he was using dyes
to color the cells.

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:20.090 align:middle line:84%
And what was the discovery--
and give us the time frame

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:21.615 align:middle line:84%
and what came out
of that discovery.

00:12:21.615 --> 00:12:22.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: OK.

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:27.100 align:middle line:84%
You have David-- that was
I want to say late 1800s.

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:31.570 align:middle line:84%
And a guy named Fleming had
developed a blue dye that

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:33.120 align:middle line:90%
would stain DNA.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And you can see these leaps
in our understanding of cancer

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:38.140 align:middle line:90%
come lockstep with technology.

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:41.000 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden, we could
visualize he called them

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.100 align:middle line:90%
chromosomes for colored bodies.

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And we could visualize
chromosomes, and so

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:45.731 align:middle line:90%
David Paul--

00:12:45.731 --> 00:12:47.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
of the microscopy?

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:47.900 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Right.

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:48.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, advances.

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:49.060 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Yeah.

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.060 align:middle line:84%
He'd stain them and then
look under a microscope

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:52.180 align:middle line:90%
and see the DNA.

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And he was the first one to
apply this dye to cancer cells.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And what he noticed
was they were

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:02.470 align:middle line:84%
a mess-- they were disjointed,
broken, recombined, duplicated.

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And so born from that was
this theory that, well, OK,

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:11.240 align:middle line:84%
maybe cancer is a product
of chromosomal dysfunction,

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:14.120 align:middle line:84%
of breakage, of
chromosomal chaos.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.120 align:middle line:84%
And that was really
the first step

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:19.480 align:middle line:84%
towards the somatic
mutation theory.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.542 align:middle line:84%
From there it was a chicken that
revealed a viral connection.

00:13:23.542 --> 00:13:24.500 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Yeah.

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:25.120 align:middle line:90%
So this is non-linear.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:25.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Chicken tumors.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:26.300 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Right.

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:28.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We said this isn't yet
here because these things were

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:29.500 align:middle line:90%
kind of happening all over.

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:30.500 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Right.

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:32.860 align:middle line:84%
So that was Peyton Rouse,
an American scientist.

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:33.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:37.250 align:middle line:84%
So hop across an
ocean and Peyton Rous,

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:41.530 align:middle line:84%
a wonderful American
scientist, found chickens that

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:43.010 align:middle line:90%
had a viral cause of cancer.

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:45.940 align:middle line:84%
He could take some
exudate from the tumors

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:48.100 align:middle line:84%
and transfer it to
another chicken.

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:51.352 align:middle line:84%
So this was the first known
viral cause of cancer.

00:13:51.352 --> 00:13:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, the
New York Times headlines is,

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:56.250 align:middle line:90%
is cancer an infectious disease?

00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:58.880 align:middle line:84%
Because it went against
everything we knew at the time.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:03.720 align:middle line:84%
And so that spawned the viral
theory of cancer, which really

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:10.640 align:middle line:84%
held on until 1976, when
a series of experiments--

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:13.720 align:middle line:84%
ironically proven with
the Rous sarcoma virus--

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:16.600 align:middle line:84%
they proved the somatic
mutation theory of cancer.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:20.340 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, his viral theory was
always sort of floating around,

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:23.050 align:middle line:84%
never could be proven,
never could be disproven.

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:24.810 align:middle line:84%
The government
undertook huge efforts

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:29.700 align:middle line:84%
to find viruses in humans and
found I think only one or two.

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And so it never disappeared,
but it was never proven.

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, it was
disproven all at once.

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:37.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And at what
point did the Human Genome

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:40.822 align:middle line:84%
Project come into all of this to
start tracking this thing down?

00:14:40.822 --> 00:14:41.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Yeah.

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:46.476 align:middle line:84%
So once the somatic mutation
theory was locked down,

00:14:46.476 --> 00:14:49.230 align:middle line:84%
a clear goal from
that point on was

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:51.590 align:middle line:84%
to find all the mutations
that caused cancer.

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And once sequencing technology
advanced to the point

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:57.630 align:middle line:84%
where we could sequence DNA
very cheaply and efficiently,

00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:59.630 align:middle line:84%
a project was proposed
called the Cancer Genome

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:02.417 align:middle line:84%
Atlas to sequence all
the DNA in cancer cells.

00:15:02.417 --> 00:15:04.250 align:middle line:84%
And the Human Genome
Project you've probably

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:07.880 align:middle line:84%
heard of to sequence just
our DNA yet of humans, this

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:11.650 align:middle line:84%
was 10,000 times that effort
to sequence that many genomes.

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And that began in
2006, and that's really

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:18.650 align:middle line:84%
where the confusion
began because when

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:21.770 align:middle line:84%
you dive into the data that
came out of that, what was seen

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:23.730 align:middle line:90%
was not what was expected.

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:27.460 align:middle line:84%
Back when the somatic mutation
theory became entrenched,

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:30.340 align:middle line:84%
the idea was that it was a
sequential series of mutations

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:32.820 align:middle line:84%
that would sort of
define each cancer.

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:34.460 align:middle line:84%
And when they'd
sequence genomes,

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:37.090 align:middle line:84%
they didn't find
that exact series.

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:39.990 align:middle line:84%
What struck everybody was
this degree of heterogeneity.

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:42.980 align:middle line:84%
So if you sequence tumors
from different people,

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:44.920 align:middle line:84%
there's just a huge
degree of randomness

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:46.720 align:middle line:90%
from one patient to the next.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.835 align:middle line:84%
So it's very difficult to
assign cause and effect,

00:15:49.835 --> 00:15:51.710 align:middle line:84%
and this caught everybody
off guard, the guys

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:55.410 align:middle line:84%
at the very top of the
sequencing effort and so forth.

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:58.930 align:middle line:84%
And so that's when Tom Seyfried
and all these other scientists

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:01.870 align:middle line:84%
sort of stepped in, entered
this cloud of chaos,

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:04.620 align:middle line:84%
and espoused these
alternative theories.

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:05.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:12.480 align:middle line:84%
So let's go back to Otto Warburg
and his life and his work

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.300 align:middle line:84%
and what he brought forth
and what kind of resistance

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:17.930 align:middle line:84%
came at that time and how
he went about his discovery.

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:18.240 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Yeah.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.040 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:23.190 align:middle line:84%
So at that time,
this was the 1920s,

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:27.950 align:middle line:84%
and so the viral theory
was still floating around,

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:30.550 align:middle line:90%
Hansmann's chaotic chromosomes.

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:32.610 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knew quite
what cancer was.

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And so Otto Warburg was a
brilliant German scientist,

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:37.350 align:middle line:90%
Nobel Prize winner.

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:38.890 align:middle line:84%
He was nominated
for the Nobel Prize

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:40.760 align:middle line:90%
on three separate occasions.

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:43.870 align:middle line:84%
But he always wanted cancer
to be as hallmark discovery.

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And so when he finally turned
his attention to cancer,

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:48.900 align:middle line:84%
he noticed a
striking abnormality

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:51.620 align:middle line:84%
that cancer cells are
overproducing lactic acid

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:54.215 align:middle line:84%
in the presence of oxygen and
there's no reason that cells

00:16:54.215 --> 00:16:55.090 align:middle line:90%
should be doing that.

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:57.366 align:middle line:84%
Normal cells almost
never do that.

00:16:57.366 --> 00:16:59.240 align:middle line:84%
And the question is,
why are they doing that?

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And so he later on in his
career, about the '50s,

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.569 align:middle line:84%
decided that the
reason is because

00:17:04.569 --> 00:17:07.700 align:middle line:84%
the respiratory apparatus
of the cell is damaged,

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.410 align:middle line:84%
and today we know
that's the mitochondria.

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And so his theory
was there's damage

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:14.869 align:middle line:84%
to the cell's ability
to generate energy

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:16.670 align:middle line:90%
with oxygen aerobically.

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:20.109 align:middle line:84%
The cell then transitions to
anaerobic energy generation

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:22.869 align:middle line:84%
and that is the prime
cause of cancer.

00:17:22.869 --> 00:17:24.839 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's a
buildup of lactic acid?

00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:26.180 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Right.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:29.150 align:middle line:84%
That's the side effect of
that mode of energy generation

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:31.470 align:middle line:90%
is lactic acid.

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:35.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so what did he do
in terms of any kind of trials

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:36.810 align:middle line:90%
of the day and such?

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:39.080 align:middle line:84%
Was he was able
to prove this out

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.840 align:middle line:84%
in any way in working
with his patients,

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:42.800 align:middle line:84%
or did he even understand
what the antidote

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:43.800 align:middle line:90%
would be at the time?

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Yeah.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:48.240 align:middle line:84%
He was a very hard
core just scientist,

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.380 align:middle line:90%
so he had no patients.

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He didn't work
in collusion with any--

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:53.504 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: No, I
don't I don't think he did.

00:17:53.504 --> 00:17:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
he really-- as far

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:59.570 align:middle line:84%
as treatments that he proposed
were mostly preventative, which

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:02.150 align:middle line:84%
was stay away from
carcinogens, which is obvious,

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:05.220 align:middle line:84%
and maintain the respiratory
apparatus of the cell, which

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:09.460 align:middle line:84%
he said mostly through B
vitamins and things like that.

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:14.200 align:middle line:84%
But his contribution was
just purely scientific.

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.800 align:middle line:84%
And he, in the beginning
of the 20th century,

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.850 align:middle line:84%
because of the force
of his reputation--

00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:22.590 align:middle line:84%
he was widely regarded as the
world's foremost biochemist--

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:24.440 align:middle line:84%
his theory carried
a lot of weight.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.030 align:middle line:84%
But then as the century
wore on, it became--

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:28.444 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He was marginalized.

00:18:28.444 --> 00:18:30.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Well, his
theory was marginalized.

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:34.560 align:middle line:84%
The rest of his
contribution was celebrated.

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:37.070 align:middle line:84%
But people sort of
snickered in the corner

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:40.610 align:middle line:84%
about his crazy kind of
crackpot theory of cancer.

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:41.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:42.160 align:middle line:90%
That was a shame.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.380 align:middle line:84%
It took a long time to recover
that and get to the point

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:45.060 align:middle line:90%
where there are right now.

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:46.180 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: And there
are some other reasons

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:47.730 align:middle line:90%
for that have come up.

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:50.120 align:middle line:84%
My research for the
book, Otto Warburg

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:53.350 align:middle line:84%
stayed in Germany
during the war and so

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:55.775 align:middle line:90%
many people didn't like that.

00:18:55.775 --> 00:18:57.150 align:middle line:84%
They thought he
should have fled.

00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:59.860 align:middle line:90%
And he was Hitler's oncologist.

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:02.660 align:middle line:84%
So many believe there was sort
of this conspiratorial, almost

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:05.202 align:middle line:84%
systematic effort
to discredit him.

00:19:05.202 --> 00:19:07.660 align:middle line:84%
It could have been conscious,
could have been subconscious,

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:10.380 align:middle line:84%
but that was a feeling a
lot of scientists around--

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:11.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:12.930 align:middle line:84%
So it was more
political in nature.

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:13.929 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Right.

00:19:13.929 --> 00:19:14.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:15.760 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:18.950 align:middle line:90%
So now we come to Harold Varmus.

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:20.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Yeah, right.

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:20.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:22.020 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
his contribution.

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:22.895 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: OK.

00:19:22.895 --> 00:19:26.960 align:middle line:84%
So Harold Varmus and
Michael Bishop, they really

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:31.310 align:middle line:84%
did the experiments that proved
the somatic mutation theory.

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:33.370 align:middle line:84%
I shouldn't say proved,
but it looked like--

00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It looked
like it proved.

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:35.698 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON:
And what they did

00:19:35.698 --> 00:19:38.550 align:middle line:84%
was they experimented
with the Rous sarcoma

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:40.844 align:middle line:90%
virus, which has four genes.

00:19:40.844 --> 00:19:42.260 align:middle line:84%
And at that time,
they knew-- this

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:46.160 align:middle line:84%
was 1974-- they knew that
viruses inserted their genomes

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.860 align:middle line:90%
into the DNA of normal cells.

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And so their question is, how
is that virus transforming

00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:53.840 align:middle line:84%
a normal cell into
a cancerous cell?

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:57.052 align:middle line:84%
And they isolate it down
to a single gene, right.

00:19:57.052 --> 00:19:59.010 align:middle line:84%
It was one of those single
genes that was doing

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:00.756 align:middle line:90%
the cancer causing ability.

00:20:00.756 --> 00:20:02.130 align:middle line:84%
And then they
looked at that gene

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:04.380 align:middle line:84%
and realized it was
just a distorted

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:07.000 align:middle line:84%
version of a gene we already
had that's responsible--

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
critical, right?

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:09.690 align:middle line:90%
This was a critical discovery.

00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:10.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Right.

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:12.840 align:middle line:84%
And it looked like that
gene was responsible

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:18.850 align:middle line:84%
for a kinase enzyme, it's
a communication protein.

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:21.310 align:middle line:84%
So when it goes awry, it
shouts the instructions

00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:23.120 align:middle line:84%
for the cell to
divide over and over

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:27.170 align:middle line:84%
and over because it's
distorted by a few mutations.

00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And so all of a
sudden, it's like,

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:31.120 align:middle line:84%
now this makes all the
sense in the world.

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.650 align:middle line:84%
Carcinogens come in
and they damage DNA

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:36.930 align:middle line:84%
and they distort the DNA
to produce protein products

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:40.640 align:middle line:84%
that mess with the cell cycle,
just like the Rous sarcoma

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:42.560 align:middle line:90%
virus is doing on its own.

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:44.600 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden,
Rous' virus was

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:48.000 align:middle line:84%
subverted into the
somatic mutation theory.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.440 align:middle line:90%
And nobody saw that coming.

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:52.540 align:middle line:84%
Rous himself was
like, I can't believe

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:55.690 align:middle line:90%
nature's deck of trick cards.

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:57.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, because
it's part of us.

00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.102 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Right.

00:20:59.102 --> 00:21:00.560 align:middle line:84%
And so then it was
off and running,

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:03.360 align:middle line:84%
and nobody really-- they won
the Nobel Prize, nobody really

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:04.910 align:middle line:90%
looked back at that point.

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:06.590 align:middle line:90%
Everybody was just convinced.

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And you really look at
the history at the time,

00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:12.240 align:middle line:84%
DNA was discovered in '55,
so all eyes turn to DNA.

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:16.330 align:middle line:84%
It was such a compelling
and pervasive moment

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:19.350 align:middle line:84%
in molecular biology,
this understanding of what

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:22.380 align:middle line:84%
the thread of life does
and the fact that it's

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:23.430 align:middle line:90%
connected to cancer.

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:28.410 align:middle line:84%
You could see how everybody was
just so taken by this theory.

00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:29.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And understandably.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:30.480 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:37.630 align:middle line:84%
So now, before we rush into the
origins of chemotherapy-- which

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:40.010 align:middle line:84%
is just a messy,
fascinating story

00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:42.962 align:middle line:84%
itself-- is there anything
else by way of the buildup

00:21:42.962 --> 00:21:44.890 align:middle line:84%
that we haven't
touched on in terms

00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:46.930 align:middle line:84%
of the discoveries
of various players

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:48.910 align:middle line:90%
to kind of get us to this point?

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:49.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Those
are the big three.

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:50.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Those
are the big three.

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:50.730 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Yeah.

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:52.930 align:middle line:84%
Those are the big three
competing theories

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:55.960 align:middle line:84%
and you did a good
job of summarizing it.

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:02.100 align:middle line:84%
So now let's talk
about mustard gas.

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:05.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON:
Yeah, pleasant.

00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:09.410 align:middle line:84%
The advent of chemotherapy
was an accident

00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:10.730 align:middle line:90%
during World War II.

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:15.390 align:middle line:84%
It was in Italy and the Germans
bombed-- what had happened

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:19.600 align:middle line:84%
was the Allies and the Axis
were stockpiling mustard gas.

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:21.270 align:middle line:84%
There was a war
treaty to not do it,

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:23.364 align:middle line:84%
but each side was doing
it because they suspected

00:22:23.364 --> 00:22:24.530 align:middle line:90%
the other side was doing it.

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:25.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So that's covert.

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:25.830 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Sure.

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:26.630 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:30.940 align:middle line:84%
So we had a ship with I can't
remember the exact number,

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:34.340 align:middle line:84%
but it was an unreal amount
of mustard gas inside of it.

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:36.450 align:middle line:84%
The Germans bombed the
harbor, the Italian harbor

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:38.590 align:middle line:90%
where our Navy was.

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:41.735 align:middle line:84%
They bombed that ship and
it spilled into the harbor

00:22:41.735 --> 00:22:43.860 align:middle line:84%
at the same time all these
sailors were jumping in.

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:44.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Gooey, icky.

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:45.010 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Yeah.

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:46.150 align:middle line:90%
Thousands of sailors--

00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:47.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Garlicky-smelling.

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:47.970 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Yeah.

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:48.770 align:middle line:90%
Terrible stuff.

00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:52.047 align:middle line:84%
They jumped in and were
covered in mustard gas.

00:22:52.047 --> 00:22:53.380 align:middle line:90%
And so it was a horrific scene--

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:55.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But they didn't know
it because this didn't exist.

00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:56.469 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Right.

00:22:56.469 --> 00:22:58.630 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knew this, just
the very high command.

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:01.220 align:middle line:84%
So they all come out and
they're burning and blistering

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:02.730 align:middle line:84%
and no one knew
what was going on.

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:05.080 align:middle line:84%
So the high command ordered
a doctor from the States

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:07.260 align:middle line:90%
to fly over and treat them.

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And he immediately
suspected mustard gas

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:11.590 align:middle line:84%
and started treating
them for mustard gas.

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And during the
aftermath of this,

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:16.580 align:middle line:84%
they brought back samples to
the United States to Yale,

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:18.080 align:middle line:84%
and what they noticed
in the samples

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:20.860 align:middle line:84%
was a depletion
of lymphoid cells.

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:23.700 align:middle line:84%
So somehow, the mustard
gas was depleting

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:27.470 align:middle line:84%
the human body of lymphoid,
the immune system cells.

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:32.389 align:middle line:84%
And so at that time,
during the early '40s,

00:23:32.389 --> 00:23:34.430 align:middle line:84%
there was only two treatments
for cancer, surgery

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:35.500 align:middle line:90%
and radiation.

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And so the dream scenario
was this chemotherapy,

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:41.480 align:middle line:84%
something you could inject that
would go system-wide and find

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:43.400 align:middle line:90%
cancer wherever it was.

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:47.500 align:middle line:84%
So these two doctors had
this crazy idea-- well,

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:50.460 align:middle line:84%
maybe it was crazy, maybe it
wasn't-- to inject mustard gas

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:52.390 align:middle line:90%
as a chemotherapy agent.

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:53.940 align:middle line:90%
And so that's how it started.

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:55.350 align:middle line:84%
And you'd inject
patients with it

00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:58.470 align:middle line:84%
and you'd get these kind
of flickering remissions

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:00.750 align:middle line:84%
and then the cancer would
typically come back.

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:02.320 align:middle line:84%
And then as the
century progressed,

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:04.620 align:middle line:84%
we'd find new and new agents
that did the same thing.

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:06.495 align:middle line:84%
And all we knew of cancer
at that time was it

00:24:06.495 --> 00:24:08.750 align:middle line:90%
was a proliferation of cells.

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:10.550 align:middle line:84%
So we attacked it
that way, with toxins

00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:11.919 align:middle line:90%
that stopped cell growth.

00:24:11.919 --> 00:24:13.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: With
horrific side effects.

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:15.376 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Horrible
side effects, yeah.

00:24:15.376 --> 00:24:18.250 align:middle line:84%
And these guys were
doing the best they could

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:20.340 align:middle line:84%
with a fatal
disease, at that time

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:23.810 align:middle line:84%
these diseases were terminally
fatal, with what they had.

00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:26.010 align:middle line:84%
But they pushed harder
and harder and harder

00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:28.290 align:middle line:84%
and that's the--
and we still know--

00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:32.230 align:middle line:84%
that's what we equate today
with the side effects of-- it's

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:34.560 align:middle line:84%
sad that those are
still in use today.

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:35.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:36.320 align:middle line:90%
It seems primitive.

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:38.770 align:middle line:84%
But what I like
about your book is

00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:42.570 align:middle line:84%
that it's very generous
in honoring what was

00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:44.610 align:middle line:90%
known and possible in the day.

00:24:44.610 --> 00:24:47.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are a few people who
maybe didn't have the highest

00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:50.140 align:middle line:84%
motives along the way in
terms of trying to suppress

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:53.676 align:middle line:84%
real data, but for
the most part these

00:24:53.676 --> 00:24:55.050 align:middle line:84%
were people that
were just trying

00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:57.270 align:middle line:84%
to find any solution
to something that

00:24:57.270 --> 00:25:00.120 align:middle line:90%
seemed impossible in the day.

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.660 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the
experiments that ultimately

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:06.750 align:middle line:84%
were undertaken
with children, more

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:08.852 align:middle line:84%
with systemic like
lymphoma disease.

00:25:08.852 --> 00:25:09.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Yeah.

00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:13.505 align:middle line:84%
So really two of the
godfathers of this combination

00:25:13.505 --> 00:25:16.120 align:middle line:84%
of chemotherapy, they're
called Frei and Freireich.

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:18.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I thought that
was the weirdest thing.

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:19.030 align:middle line:90%
They had the same name.

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:19.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Yeah, Emil.

00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:20.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:21.970 align:middle line:90%
Emil Frei and Emil Freireich.

00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:24.462 align:middle line:90%


00:25:24.462 --> 00:25:25.420 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Yeah.

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:26.770 align:middle line:84%
It was perfect
because they were--

00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:28.353 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I thought
it was a typo when

00:25:28.353 --> 00:25:29.610 align:middle line:90%
I was reading your book.

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:31.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: And they
were perfect for each other

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:35.850 align:middle line:84%
because one was bold
and he would do anything

00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:38.820 align:middle line:84%
to try to cure these kids
with the fatal leukemia

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:41.950 align:middle line:84%
and the other one was cautious
and would pull the other one

00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:43.760 align:middle line:90%
back when he pushed too far.

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:47.000 align:middle line:84%
So they were--
but even with them

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.500 align:middle line:84%
together, everybody else
viewed them as crazy.

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.890 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they were
kind of marginalized

00:25:52.890 --> 00:25:56.060 align:middle line:84%
and these guys were
dripping poisons into kids.

00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And so you put
yourself in their shoes

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:01.974 align:middle line:84%
and these kids are all
dying and were they good

00:26:01.974 --> 00:26:02.890 align:middle line:90%
or were they not good?

00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:04.265 align:middle line:84%
But they were bold
enough to try.

00:26:04.265 --> 00:26:06.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and the
parents were probably

00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:08.790 align:middle line:84%
bold enough to say, do anything,
my child's almost dead anyway.

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:09.789 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Right.

00:26:09.789 --> 00:26:12.120 align:middle line:84%
So they pushed and
they pushed and that's

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:14.340 align:middle line:84%
what we know as combinational
chemotherapy, the idea

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:17.330 align:middle line:84%
that you can stack
drugs and kind of reduce

00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:19.320 align:middle line:84%
the toxicity of each
one individually

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:20.880 align:middle line:90%
if you combine them.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And then you can
add more to the mix.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And when the dust
settled, they did

00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:30.390 align:middle line:84%
cure these kids of acute
lymphoblastic leukemia, ALL.

00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:32.320 align:middle line:84%
And in the majority
of the cases,

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:35.280 align:middle line:84%
they went on to cure
Hodgkin's disease after that.

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did some of
the patients survive it?

00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:38.120 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Yeah.

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:38.560 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:38.780 align:middle line:90%
The kids did.

00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:39.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And went on to live.

00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:40.628 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Yeah.

00:26:40.628 --> 00:26:43.500 align:middle line:84%
Many of them have neurological
problems and it's not--

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:44.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The side
effect issues.

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:45.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Right,
the side effects from them.

00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:47.990 align:middle line:84%
But many went on to
live normal life spans.

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:50.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now
this was promising.

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:51.710 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Right.

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:53.126 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
dogma of the time

00:26:53.126 --> 00:26:55.420 align:middle line:84%
was, OK, let's see
how far we can go now

00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:57.970 align:middle line:84%
with these combinations
of chemotherapies.

00:26:57.970 --> 00:26:59.800 align:middle line:84%
And I think
everybody would agree

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:02.810 align:middle line:84%
that they went too far with it
because they started killing

00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:05.390 align:middle line:84%
patients trying to kill
the harder cancers that

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:07.220 align:middle line:90%
didn't respond as well.

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:11.140 align:middle line:84%
And some of the top people
like James Watson at the time,

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:11.994 align:middle line:90%
he said the--

00:27:11.994 --> 00:27:13.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: DNA of
Crick and Watson.

00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:14.368 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Yeah.

00:27:14.368 --> 00:27:17.580 align:middle line:84%
I think his quote was, the first
act of our tenure with cancer

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:19.710 align:middle line:84%
is going to be so horrific
no one is going to want

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:22.170 align:middle line:90%
to be around for the finale.

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:23.920 align:middle line:84%
So they finally
had to kind of reel

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:27.550 align:middle line:90%
back the effort at that point.

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:30.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about Dr.
Pinkel and dosing the brain

00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:31.531 align:middle line:90%
with radiation.

00:27:31.531 --> 00:27:32.488 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Yeah.

00:27:32.488 --> 00:27:34.310 align:middle line:84%
Pinkel did what's
called total therapy,

00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:36.460 align:middle line:84%
and he was in that
aspect where they were

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:38.400 align:middle line:90%
pushing really, really hard.

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:41.640 align:middle line:84%
And when these kids
came back, what

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:44.650 align:middle line:84%
would happen was the cancer
cells would find sort

00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:47.670 align:middle line:84%
of an asylum in the
cerebral spinal fluid

00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:49.640 align:middle line:84%
and then if you didn't
get it out of there,

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:51.670 align:middle line:84%
then it would erupt
back in the brain.

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:54.870 align:middle line:84%
So the kids were in remission,
they'd come back months later

00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:56.630 align:middle line:90%
with cancer in the brain.

00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:59.630 align:middle line:84%
And so he decided
to do a regimen

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:03.160 align:middle line:84%
called total therapy, where he
added radiation into the mix

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:06.680 align:middle line:84%
and extended chemotherapy
out even longer and longer.

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:10.180 align:middle line:84%
And again, there were terrible
side effects and collateral

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:13.140 align:middle line:84%
damage, but he was able to
cure a significant portion

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:15.020 align:middle line:84%
of the kids with
that total therapy.

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:17.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, in the
medical community at large,

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:19.050 align:middle line:90%
how is this perceived?

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:21.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Again,
these guys at that time

00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:25.494 align:middle line:84%
were marginalized,
they were called names.

00:28:25.494 --> 00:28:27.660 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember exactly
the names they were called.

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:30.660 align:middle line:84%
They had a sort of
acronym for them.

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:34.670 align:middle line:84%
But you'd walk by
these words at the NCI,

00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:37.460 align:middle line:84%
the chemotherapy wards,
and these kids are bald

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:41.380 align:middle line:84%
and throwing up, the kind of
horrific scene, and these guys

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:44.250 align:middle line:84%
are walking around dripping
this mustard gas, essentially,

00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:45.920 align:middle line:90%
into their veins.

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:48.710 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
time, at the end what

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:51.920 align:middle line:84%
was an invariable fatal disease,
they were getting cured.

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:54.540 align:middle line:84%
So it was this
push-pull between--

00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:56.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what the
turning point-- OK,

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:59.960 align:middle line:84%
maybe this takes us to
Nixon's war on drugs.

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:04.030 align:middle line:84%
What was the turning point that
made those two methodologies

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:06.030 align:middle line:90%
mainstream, acceptable?

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:07.450 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Right.

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:10.320 align:middle line:84%
So Nixon, when he declared war
on cancer in '71, that was when

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:11.120 align:middle line:90%
we--

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:12.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: War on
cancer-- did I say drugs?

00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:13.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I think so.

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:14.949 align:middle line:90%
That was Nancy Reagan.

00:29:14.949 --> 00:29:16.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON:
Declare war on something,

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:18.985 align:middle line:84%
you can guarantee it's going
to last forever and not work.

00:29:18.985 --> 00:29:19.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:21.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: So yeah, he
declared war on cancer in '71.

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:23.650 align:middle line:10%
And that was right after we
had these amazing successes

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:27.960 align:middle line:10%
with the kids lymphoma and
leukemias and Hodgkin's disease

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:29.030 align:middle line:10%
and testicular cancer.

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:30.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was extending
life at any cost.

00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:31.470 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Right.

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:37.950 align:middle line:84%
So this bold era of hey, let's
keep this going, the momentum

00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:40.230 align:middle line:84%
going, we thought
there'd be a general cure

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:42.740 align:middle line:84%
within five years there was
so much momentum with cancer

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:43.690 align:middle line:90%
therapy.

00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:46.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's when we really pushed
into trying to cure the harder

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:49.060 align:middle line:90%
cancers and we went too far.

00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And it is sad that those are the
mainline therapies still today.

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And they work for a
handful of cancers.

00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:59.980 align:middle line:84%
Standard care works fantastic
for testicular cancer,

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:01.240 align:middle line:90%
some of the leukemias.

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:05.030 align:middle line:84%
But we use it as an adjunctive
therapy for many cancers.

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:07.470 align:middle line:84%
And I was at a
conference recently

00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:12.490 align:middle line:84%
and there was a study that came
out that all added up together,

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:16.070 align:middle line:84%
as an adjunctive therapy,
chemotherapy confers about 2.9%

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:17.880 align:middle line:90%
increase in survival.

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:22.570 align:middle line:84%
So for all of that cost of
illness and losing hair,

00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:26.850 align:middle line:84%
is it worth a 2.9%
increase in survival?

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:27.700 align:middle line:90%
I really doubt it.

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:30.300 align:middle line:84%
So many doctors are
rethinking using it

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:32.690 align:middle line:84%
as an adjunctive
therapy in many cases.

00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:33.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:35.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, talk about Pete
Pedersen, his contribution

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:38.770 align:middle line:84%
and the role of ATP,
lactic acid, and so forth.

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:41.980 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll get
to Young Hee Ko.

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:43.826 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON:
Yeah, Young Ko.

00:30:43.826 --> 00:30:44.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow, what a hero.

00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:46.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON:
Yeah, she's fantastic.

00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:47.090 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:50.350 align:middle line:84%
So Pete Pedersen, he's-- in
writing the book that was one

00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:53.370 align:middle line:84%
of the most fun things
was getting to know Pete.

00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:57.802 align:middle line:84%
And so his lab at Johns Hopkins
took up where Warburg left off.

00:30:57.802 --> 00:31:00.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What inspired him to
pick up the metabolic theory

00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:00.620 align:middle line:90%
again?

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:02.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Well,
it was interesting

00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:05.250 align:middle line:84%
because his mentor was
named Albert Lehninger, who

00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:06.860 align:middle line:90%
discovered mitochondria.

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:11.240 align:middle line:84%
And so that lineage of
the Warburg biochemists

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:13.320 align:middle line:90%
was right there with Pete.

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:15.740 align:middle line:84%
And so he sort of took up
looking at the mitochondria

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:18.660 align:middle line:84%
and cancer, he was always
interested in cancer.

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And so he noticed right
away how damaged and defunct

00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:25.140 align:middle line:84%
mitochondria were
in cancer cells.

00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And so he sort of started
proving a lot of the stuff

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:30.970 align:middle line:84%
that Warburg only
suspected in his lab.

00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And a tremendous amount
of incredible research

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:38.920 align:middle line:84%
came out of his lab, the
discovery of hexokinase-2,

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:41.920 align:middle line:84%
which is this important
enzyme in the cancer cell

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.670 align:middle line:84%
that's responsible for
the Warburg effect,

00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:47.360 align:middle line:84%
they discovered its
importance in the cancer cell.

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And then Young
came into the lab.

00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:52.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Set us up for who
she is and what she was like.

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:53.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: OK.

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:53.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:56.960 align:middle line:84%
So Young, she's a very,
very interesting woman.

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:59.155 align:middle line:84%
She came into Pete's lab
and Pete was known for--

00:31:59.155 --> 00:32:00.488 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How long ago was this?

00:32:00.488 --> 00:32:02.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: OK,
this was I want to say

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:04.600 align:middle line:90%
the late '80s, early '90s.

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And Pete was known for this
gritty Oklahoma work ethic.

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:13.400 align:middle line:84%
He literally hadn't missed a
day of work in, like, 25 years.

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And so Young came into his
lab and she outworked Pete.

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:20.155 align:middle line:84%
She was literally in the
lab-- she slept there.

00:32:20.155 --> 00:32:21.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: She was obsessed.

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:21.900 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON:
She was obsessed

00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:24.215 align:middle line:84%
and she worked 18 hours,
would sleep a little bit.

00:32:24.215 --> 00:32:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And she told me a story,
she'd look down at her feet

00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:28.430 align:middle line:84%
after a couple of
months and realize

00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:30.210 align:middle line:84%
her shoes were
completely worn out

00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:32.510 align:middle line:84%
and hadn't even noticed
that until then.

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:35.650 align:middle line:84%
So in this lab,
they were just so

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:38.240 align:middle line:84%
focused on the
metabolism of cancer

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:40.450 align:middle line:84%
and trying to
solve this problem.

00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And Young's contribution was
they knew about the Warburg

00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:47.950 align:middle line:84%
effect and so they wanted
to target hexokinase-2,

00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:50.500 align:middle line:84%
which to them was the
driving force of cancer,

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:53.260 align:middle line:84%
the beating heart of
cancer was this one enzyme.

00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And they're trying to figure
out how to get to that enzyme.

00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And so Young in her mind,
she kept circling back, OK,

00:32:58.970 --> 00:33:00.220 align:middle line:90%
what's going on?

00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:02.650 align:middle line:84%
The cancer cell is
overproducing lactic acid

00:33:02.650 --> 00:33:05.090 align:middle line:84%
and lactic acid has to be
released from the cancer cell

00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:06.330 align:middle line:90%
or it'll kill itself.

00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:08.770 align:middle line:84%
It's like an idling
car in a parked garage,

00:33:08.770 --> 00:33:10.310 align:middle line:90%
you've got to open the door.

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:12.430 align:middle line:84%
So the cancer cells
have these little doors

00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:15.810 align:middle line:84%
called monocarboxylic
acid transport proteins,

00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:19.626 align:middle line:84%
and through those little pores
lactic acid is able to leave.

00:33:19.626 --> 00:33:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the
functional difference

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:22.720 align:middle line:84%
between a normal cell
and a cancer cell.

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:24.428 align:middle line:84%
A cancer cell will
have all these spores,

00:33:24.428 --> 00:33:26.800 align:middle line:84%
where normal cells don't
have very many of them.

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:28.960 align:middle line:84%
And so in her mind, she
thought about this molecule

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:31.420 align:middle line:84%
she worked with
in Washington that

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:34.840 align:middle line:84%
looks just like lactic acid
but it's very reactive.

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:37.930 align:middle line:84%
And so she started testing it,
it's called 3-Bromopyruvate.

00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And she started testing it on
cell lines, just Petri dishes,

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.700 align:middle line:84%
and found out that it
was just incredibly

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:45.070 align:middle line:90%
active against cancer cells.

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:47.550 align:middle line:84%
She compared it to all the
traditional chemotherapeutic

00:33:47.550 --> 00:33:51.450 align:middle line:84%
agents and it was by
far and away the best--

00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:53.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Against
all kinds of cancer.

00:33:53.170 --> 00:33:54.230 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Right.

00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:56.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's the beautiful
thing about this theory

00:33:56.740 --> 00:34:00.830 align:middle line:84%
is this metabolic defect
is in every cancer cell.

00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:02.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Doesn't
matter what kind.

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:03.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: When
you look at a PET scan,

00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:04.810 align:middle line:90%
that's what you're looking at.

00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:06.476 align:middle line:84%
You're looking at
this metabolic defect.

00:34:06.476 --> 00:34:10.070 align:middle line:84%
The cancer cell is
voraciously sucking in sugar

00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:11.699 align:middle line:84%
and converting it
to lactic acid.

00:34:11.699 --> 00:34:14.239 align:middle line:84%
In a PET scan it's
just labeled glucose.

00:34:14.239 --> 00:34:16.690 align:middle line:90%
So you're seeing this effect.

00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And 95% of cancers
are PET positive,

00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:24.750 align:middle line:84%
the remaining 5% are probably
just growing extremely slow

00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:27.250 align:middle line:90%
or not growing at all.

00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:32.124 align:middle line:84%
So the 3-Bromopyruvate,
she tested it over and over

00:34:32.124 --> 00:34:33.540 align:middle line:84%
and noticed how
tremendous it was.

00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:35.248 align:middle line:84%
And they through went
through this series

00:34:35.248 --> 00:34:37.300 align:middle line:84%
of pre-clinical data
with mice and rabbits

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:38.689 align:middle line:90%
and it looked outstanding.

00:34:38.689 --> 00:34:41.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean the pre-clinical march
was like this could be the best

00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:42.320 align:middle line:90%
care chemotherapy drug ever.

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:44.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was so exciting
reading that part of your book.

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:44.750 align:middle line:90%
And then what?

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:46.000 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Yeah, right.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And then it became embroiled
in a multi-year just dust-up

00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:53.960 align:middle line:84%
lawsuit and tragically
got sidelined

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:55.440 align:middle line:90%
for a long period of time.

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:58.110 align:middle line:84%
But now it's getting back on
its feet and back on track.

00:34:58.110 --> 00:35:00.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's talk
about what she did with it.

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:03.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean she was able to use it
at least on a human or two.

00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:04.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Right.

00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:07.670 align:middle line:84%
So the one case study was a
young man in the Netherlands,

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:10.360 align:middle line:84%
[? Javar, ?] a
16-year-old kid diagnosed

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:12.880 align:middle line:90%
with hepatocellular carcinoma.

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:16.840 align:middle line:84%
And 95% of his liver was
taken over by tumors.

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:21.820 align:middle line:84%
And so Young got the call by
his father, who was desperate,

00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:23.990 align:middle line:84%
had tried other things
and was doing everything

00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:25.864 align:middle line:84%
he could just searching
the internet at night

00:35:25.864 --> 00:35:27.490 align:middle line:90%
to find anything for his son.

00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And he stumbled
across 3-Bromopyruvate

00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:33.134 align:middle line:84%
so he called Young and
said, can you help my son?

00:35:33.134 --> 00:35:35.300 align:middle line:84%
And she's the kind of person
that will help anybody.

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:39.100 align:middle line:84%
She'll stop what she's doing,
no matter what, and try to help.

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:42.155 align:middle line:84%
So she emailed doctors to see
if they would administrate it

00:35:42.155 --> 00:35:43.299 align:middle line:90%
and none in America would.

00:35:43.299 --> 00:35:45.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This was what
was so fascinating.

00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:45.560 align:middle line:90%
They wouldn't--

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:45.670 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Right.

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:46.524 align:middle line:90%
And this--

00:35:46.524 --> 00:35:47.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --administrate it.

00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:50.450 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: And this is
the crux of the problem today

00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:53.070 align:middle line:84%
is doctors are so
scared to deviate

00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:56.690 align:middle line:84%
from standard of care
for litigious reasons,

00:35:56.690 --> 00:35:58.126 align:middle line:90%
they can get sued.

00:35:58.126 --> 00:36:00.000 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
when you have something

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.810 align:middle line:84%
like [? Javar, ?]
or glioblastoma,

00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:03.870 align:middle line:90%
you have a terminal sentence.

00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:05.617 align:middle line:84%
So the Hippocratic
oath is to do whatever

00:36:05.617 --> 00:36:06.700 align:middle line:90%
you can for your patient--

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:07.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But they wouldn't.

00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:07.970 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Right.

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:09.940 align:middle line:84%
And now we know
that combining stuff

00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:12.500 align:middle line:84%
is the only way we're
going to do this,

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:13.940 align:middle line:90%
single agents do not work.

00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:15.500 align:middle line:90%
We learned this from AIDS.

00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:19.942 align:middle line:84%
When you combine drugs, the
energies are tremendous.

00:36:19.942 --> 00:36:21.400 align:middle line:84%
But you can't get
doctors to do it.

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:23.900 align:middle line:84%
You can get some to do it,
but the majority won't.

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:26.980 align:middle line:84%
So they found this one
doctor in Germany, Dr. Vogel,

00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:28.390 align:middle line:90%
who was willing to do it.

00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And he administered it I
think 10 doses over a month

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:33.800 align:middle line:84%
and brought [? Javar ?]
back to where

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:36.150 align:middle line:84%
there was an undetectable
amount of cancer in his body.

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:38.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
was 95% of his liver

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:40.650 align:middle line:90%
had been ravaged like by cancer.

00:36:40.650 --> 00:36:41.650 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Right.

00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:43.650 align:middle line:84%
He was in such bad shape
when Young got there--

00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:46.509 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Bloated and yellow
and all but unconscious.

00:36:46.509 --> 00:36:48.550 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Yeah,
just hanging by a thread.

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:50.630 align:middle line:84%
And they literally
brought him back

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:52.720 align:middle line:84%
to where he was able
to travel to the States

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:54.630 align:middle line:90%
and speak at Johns Hopkins.

00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And he died while traveling
because he caught pneumonia.

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And when I was interviewing
Young about this,

00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:03.890 align:middle line:84%
she teared up
because they were so

00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:06.360 align:middle line:84%
excited he was feeling better
and his family was like,

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:08.400 align:middle line:90%
let's go travel.

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:12.110 align:middle line:84%
And in retrospect, he
was sick, his liver

00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:13.220 align:middle line:90%
wasn't functioning well.

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:15.660 align:middle line:90%
He just needed time to recover.

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:18.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And with that therapy,
the liver could have recovered.

00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:20.040 align:middle line:84%
It was in the process
of recovering.

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:21.040 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Right.

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:23.420 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, he was a young man.

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:24.680 align:middle line:90%
He had recuperative powers.

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:28.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And she had so many
obstacles thrown in her way.

00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:31.050 align:middle line:84%
As I remember, it was
a year between the time

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:35.490 align:middle line:84%
she was contacted and actually
got the injection underway,

00:37:35.490 --> 00:37:38.190 align:middle line:84%
which how he hung on
that long is amazing.

00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:39.190 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Right.

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:41.110 align:middle line:84%
And they just tried to buy
him time during that time

00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:42.990 align:middle line:84%
while it was going
through the committees

00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:45.180 align:middle line:90%
to get approval to use.

00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:48.920 align:middle line:84%
So the doctor was injecting
traditional chemotherapy,

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:52.096 align:middle line:84%
knowing it was probably not
going to do anything at all

00:37:52.096 --> 00:37:54.220 align:middle line:84%
but just trying to buy him
time to get him to where

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:56.220 align:middle line:90%
he could get this drug, 3BP.

00:37:56.220 --> 00:38:00.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And for her it's been
a tough road and a sad story

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:04.480 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of ways, in that
she's obviously brilliant

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:06.154 align:middle line:90%
and she was recognized for that.

00:38:06.154 --> 00:38:08.570 align:middle line:84%
But then when she'd go apply
for grants it was like, well,

00:38:08.570 --> 00:38:10.260 align:middle line:84%
you can't get a grant
if you don't have a lab

00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:12.843 align:middle line:84%
and if you don't have a lab, you
can't get a grant, and so on.

00:38:12.843 --> 00:38:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And she got caught up in
this just horrific storm

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:17.400 align:middle line:90%
of protocol.

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:22.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean kind more of she was
caught in legal situations.

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:24.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Yeah.

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:25.480 align:middle line:90%
Lots of legal-- right.

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And the infighting
at Johns Hopkins,

00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:33.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- I heard Young's side
of this whole story and so I

00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:36.350 align:middle line:84%
don't like to comment
on the other side's.

00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:39.090 align:middle line:84%
But that's all we
need to know is

00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:41.580 align:middle line:84%
there was in-fighting
there, some perceived

00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:43.120 align:middle line:90%
injustices on both sides.

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:45.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What had happened
to her and her work, then?

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:46.599 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Right.

00:38:46.599 --> 00:38:48.160 align:middle line:90%
So she left Johns Hopkins.

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:53.800 align:middle line:84%
And she still had
patents on 3BP.

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:55.760 align:middle line:84%
So after Johns
Hopkins, she's tried

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:58.710 align:middle line:84%
to get 3BP developed, which
has been its own sort of series

00:38:58.710 --> 00:39:01.500 align:middle line:90%
of problems along the way.

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:02.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:04.591 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm glad to hear-- we
already heard that footnote

00:39:04.591 --> 00:39:05.920 align:middle line:90%
that it's making a resurgence.

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:06.010 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: It is.

00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:06.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, good.

00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:07.660 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON:
She's making progress.

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:08.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, good.

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:10.460 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk about
dark material theory

00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:13.140 align:middle line:84%
because it seems to me this
is really where the story--

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:15.340 align:middle line:84%
it becomes more complex,
but it's where it also

00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:16.680 align:middle line:90%
starts making sense.

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:17.750 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Right.

00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:21.800 align:middle line:84%
So dark matter, that
was sort of a footnote

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:25.760 align:middle line:84%
in a review on the Cancer Genome
Atlas project by a scientist

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:27.500 align:middle line:90%
named Burt Vogelstein.

00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And what it was was
when he was looking

00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:33.990 align:middle line:84%
through the data from the
Cancer Genome Atlas Project,

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:37.390 align:middle line:84%
what profoundly struck
him and everybody

00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:40.480 align:middle line:84%
was there are samples that
have very, very few driving

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:41.280 align:middle line:90%
mutations.

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:45.220 align:middle line:84%
You can find samples of one or
two driving mutations or none.

00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:47.800 align:middle line:84%
And there's also
pediatric tumors

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.810 align:middle line:90%
with no driving mutations.

00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:52.862 align:middle line:84%
So the question is,
what's driving the cancer?

00:39:52.862 --> 00:39:54.570 align:middle line:84%
According to the
somatic mutation theory,

00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:56.360 align:middle line:90%
this just can't be.

00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:58.940 align:middle line:84%
So he proposed further
down in this journal

00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:01.400 align:middle line:84%
this idea of cancer's
version of dark matter,

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:04.160 align:middle line:84%
which is there is some
presumptive force driving

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:06.710 align:middle line:90%
cancer that we don't yet know.

00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And this, as I spoke to earlier,
is this sort of vortex or void

00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:14.670 align:middle line:84%
that allowed other researchers
to step in and propose

00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:16.930 align:middle line:90%
other models of cancer.

00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:18.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And one of them
is that it's the field

00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:21.870 align:middle line:84%
itself, it's the medium
itself that begins causing,

00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:23.472 align:middle line:84%
and this can be
epigenetic in nature.

00:40:23.472 --> 00:40:24.430 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Yeah.

00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:24.785 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:40:24.785 --> 00:40:25.140 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:26.515 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now
this is where we

00:40:26.515 --> 00:40:32.050 align:middle line:84%
start getting into the mind-body
emotional connections that

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:34.990 align:middle line:90%
affect the matter, the blood.

00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:35.990 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Right.

00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:37.610 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting.

00:40:37.610 --> 00:40:40.640 align:middle line:84%
When you look at-- so there's
another alternative theory

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:42.990 align:middle line:84%
called the tissue
architecture theory.

00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very compelling
theory, as well,

00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:48.760 align:middle line:84%
where the default state of
any cell is cell division.

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And what keeps a
cell in check, what

00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:53.380 align:middle line:84%
keeps it living in the
collective of the multicellular

00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:55.960 align:middle line:84%
organism, is the
tissue architecture.

00:40:55.960 --> 00:41:00.980 align:middle line:84%
So when your cells are in a
healthy tissue architecture,

00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:03.330 align:middle line:84%
they cooperate with
the collective, right?

00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:05.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, once that
architecture breaks down

00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:08.130 align:middle line:84%
through inflammation,
through carcinogens,

00:41:08.130 --> 00:41:11.820 align:middle line:84%
then you release those negative
controls from the tissue

00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:16.160 align:middle line:84%
architecture and cells are off
and racing towards neoplasm,

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:17.650 align:middle line:90%
towards cancer.

00:41:17.650 --> 00:41:21.460 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it's epigenetic, so
it's epigenetic in origin.

00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:23.050 align:middle line:84%
There's not
mutations to the DNA.

00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:25.510 align:middle line:84%
They are a side effect
of this process,

00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:28.020 align:middle line:84%
the genomic instability as
a side effect of cancer.

00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:29.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:33.740 align:middle line:84%
In Seyfried's book, Cancers
and Metabolic Disease,

00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:37.250 align:middle line:84%
there's that one quote you
put in there, mutations in DNA

00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:41.980 align:middle line:84%
arise as effects, rather than
as the cause, of tumor growth.

00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:42.980 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Yeah.

00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:43.780 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:46.285 align:middle line:84%
So Tom's model, the
metabolic theory,

00:41:46.285 --> 00:41:49.720 align:middle line:84%
is that damage to the
mitochondria happens first

00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:52.730 align:middle line:84%
and then the mitochondria
send an epigenetic signal

00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:57.060 align:middle line:84%
to the nucleus so a new shuffle
of genes gets expressed.

00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And one of those genes,
for example, is hexokinase.

00:41:59.690 --> 00:42:02.950 align:middle line:84%
And this cassette of genes now,
through epigenetic expression,

00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:05.807 align:middle line:90%
drives neoplastic growth.

00:42:05.807 --> 00:42:07.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The damage to
the mitochondria initially

00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:09.882 align:middle line:84%
has to do with the
quality of the medium.

00:42:09.882 --> 00:42:10.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Sure.

00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:12.680 align:middle line:90%
This can all be tied together.

00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:15.130 align:middle line:90%
This is all being sorted out.

00:42:15.130 --> 00:42:19.240 align:middle line:84%
So the side effect of genomic
instability and the mutations

00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:22.489 align:middle line:84%
that happen, you can see how
they looked like the cause,

00:42:22.489 --> 00:42:24.530 align:middle line:84%
but in fact, according to
these theories, they're

00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:25.647 align:middle line:90%
a side effect.

00:42:25.647 --> 00:42:27.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
interesting because even when

00:42:27.730 --> 00:42:29.590 align:middle line:84%
you look at it--
it's still esoteric,

00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:31.730 align:middle line:84%
the notion of black
hole theory and what

00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:33.960 align:middle line:84%
some of the newer
physicists have

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:36.610 align:middle line:84%
to say about it has
to do with the belief

00:42:36.610 --> 00:42:40.270 align:middle line:84%
that black holes are essentially
the source of information.

00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And so if you look
at dark matter

00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:47.370 align:middle line:84%
as producing it, giving the
impulse of certain information,

00:42:47.370 --> 00:42:51.010 align:middle line:84%
then that lends itself very well
to the notion of epigenetics.

00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:54.280 align:middle line:84%
Information comes-- there are
many inputs of information.

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:57.850 align:middle line:84%
And again, it gets back
to, as you say, toxins

00:42:57.850 --> 00:43:01.280 align:middle line:84%
in the environment, belief
systems, familial belief

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:03.820 align:middle line:90%
systems, toxic emotions.

00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:06.040 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Yeah.

00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And measurable markers
like blood glucose

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:15.970 align:middle line:84%
is very correlated to a
worse prognosis for cancer

00:43:15.970 --> 00:43:20.080 align:middle line:84%
or even a higher
rate of diagnosis.

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, for sure, I mean any
type of mental or spiritual--

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:26.140 align:middle line:90%
just being--

00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:28.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These are just
factors that feed information

00:43:28.050 --> 00:43:28.830 align:middle line:90%
into the system.

00:43:28.830 --> 00:43:28.990 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Right.

00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:31.198 align:middle line:84%
If you're healthy as a whole,
then your immune system

00:43:31.198 --> 00:43:33.639 align:middle line:84%
functions better and that's
all very provable, as well.

00:43:33.639 --> 00:43:35.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's all
provable, but nonetheless it

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:37.590 align:middle line:84%
still gets down to
this one quality

00:43:37.590 --> 00:43:38.912 align:middle line:90%
in the cells themselves, right?

00:43:38.912 --> 00:43:39.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Sure.

00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:40.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:40.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:44.090 align:middle line:84%
So now let's dive into
that because think

00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:47.130 align:middle line:84%
this is where the hope is,
it's where it gets interesting.

00:43:47.130 --> 00:43:48.680 align:middle line:84%
So we know that
healthy mitochondria

00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:50.310 align:middle line:90%
doesn't allow cancer to grow.

00:43:50.310 --> 00:43:55.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're getting down to the
ketones and the ketogenic diet,

00:43:55.520 --> 00:44:00.880 align:middle line:84%
how did this whole piece come
into the story of the glucose,

00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:02.210 align:middle line:90%
lactic acid, and so forth?

00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:02.500 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Right.

00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:03.300 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:06.240 align:middle line:84%
So according to the metabolic
theory, the driving force

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:09.340 align:middle line:84%
being cancer is mitochondrial
damage and this reversion

00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:12.240 align:middle line:90%
to anaerobic energy generation.

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:14.780 align:middle line:84%
So Tom Seyfried, I
believe, was the first one

00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:18.320 align:middle line:84%
to propose-- not the first
one to utilize, but propose--

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:21.390 align:middle line:84%
the ketogenic diet as
a therapy for cancer.

00:44:21.390 --> 00:44:23.620 align:middle line:84%
And the idea to
the ketogenic diet

00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:26.010 align:middle line:84%
is you shift away
from carbohydrates

00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:28.229 align:middle line:84%
to fat and moderate
protein and then

00:44:28.229 --> 00:44:30.770 align:middle line:84%
your body will start generating
these little molecules called

00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:34.469 align:middle line:84%
ketones to replace
circulating blood glucose.

00:44:34.469 --> 00:44:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And so ketones are
interesting in that they

00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:38.812 align:middle line:84%
have to be burned in
intact mitochondria.

00:44:38.812 --> 00:44:40.270 align:middle line:84%
They have to be
burned aerobically.

00:44:40.270 --> 00:44:45.200 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very elegant idea
because if you transition

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:48.596 align:middle line:84%
into this metabolic state,
you're going to put tremendous

00:44:48.596 --> 00:44:50.720 align:middle line:84%
pressure on cancer cells
because you're taking away

00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:54.710 align:middle line:84%
their preferred fuel, glucose,
and putting a new fuel

00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:57.540 align:middle line:84%
in the mix that normal cells can
burn perfectly but cancer cells

00:44:57.540 --> 00:44:58.550 align:middle line:90%
cannot.

00:44:58.550 --> 00:44:59.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's so simple.

00:44:59.270 --> 00:45:00.645 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON:
It's so simple.

00:45:00.645 --> 00:45:03.410 align:middle line:84%
And that idea is beautiful
and people latch onto it

00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:04.790 align:middle line:90%
and it makes perfect sense.

00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:07.800 align:middle line:84%
But beyond that,
what's interesting now

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:09.549 align:middle line:84%
is you can show
in a Petri dish--

00:45:09.549 --> 00:45:11.340 align:middle line:84%
a fabulous scientist
named Adrienne Scheck,

00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:15.690 align:middle line:84%
she's wonderful, has shown
that regardless of the glucose

00:45:15.690 --> 00:45:18.540 align:middle line:84%
concentration, ketone
bodies will slow

00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:20.180 align:middle line:90%
the growth of cancer cells.

00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:23.140 align:middle line:84%
So ketones by themselves
are extremely interesting

00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:24.360 align:middle line:90%
molecules.

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:27.270 align:middle line:84%
And she's shown that they
do an incredible amount

00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:31.390 align:middle line:84%
of epigenetic rearrangement
within cancer cells.

00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:35.017 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And can actually start
recovering the cells, right?

00:45:35.017 --> 00:45:36.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: They do.

00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:41.240 align:middle line:84%
What they do is they push
the genetic expression more

00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:43.140 align:middle line:90%
towards normal cells.

00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:45.420 align:middle line:84%
So they're pushing
cancer cells more

00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:48.100 align:middle line:84%
to act like healthy
normal cells.

00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:49.820 align:middle line:84%
At the same time,
they're potentiating

00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:55.020 align:middle line:84%
them to be more easily
killed by traditional routes.

00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:57.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
die-off that happens,

00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:59.410 align:middle line:84%
this is another thing I
remember from the book,

00:45:59.410 --> 00:46:02.570 align:middle line:84%
rather than being just
like a bloodbath of chaos

00:46:02.570 --> 00:46:07.680 align:middle line:84%
with radiation is more of
a normal, natural pattern

00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:08.950 align:middle line:90%
of die-off, right?

00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:09.470 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: That's right.

00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:10.270 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:46:10.270 --> 00:46:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And you can show that
inflammation markers

00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:15.720 align:middle line:90%
are greatly reduced in ketosis.

00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:19.160 align:middle line:84%
And one of the big
problems in brain cancer

00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:23.540 align:middle line:84%
is edema within the brain
because it's a closed cavity.

00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:26.280 align:middle line:84%
So edema is what
largely kills a lot

00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:28.130 align:middle line:90%
of people with glioblastomas.

00:46:28.130 --> 00:46:31.440 align:middle line:84%
There's just nowhere for
swelling and fluid to go.

00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:33.520 align:middle line:84%
The ketogenic diet
reduces the swelling

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:36.510 align:middle line:84%
and the amount of fluid,
the edema, within the brain.

00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:42.370 align:middle line:84%
So the die-off from radiation,
they've shown this in trials,

00:46:42.370 --> 00:46:45.230 align:middle line:84%
there's much less side effects
from chemotherapy and radiation

00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:47.440 align:middle line:90%
when a person is in ketosis.

00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:51.570 align:middle line:84%
So it modulates normal cells
and cancer cells differently.

00:46:51.570 --> 00:46:55.020 align:middle line:84%
It makes normal cells
able to withstand insults

00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:58.640 align:middle line:84%
and makes cancer cells
more vulnerable to them.

00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:02.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, this
has so many implications.

00:47:02.450 --> 00:47:04.140 align:middle line:84%
This goes
hand-in-hand-- and we're

00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:06.930 align:middle line:84%
going to talk about Marianne and
her brain tumor in a moment--

00:47:06.930 --> 00:47:11.700 align:middle line:84%
but this goes hand-in-hand with
a calorically restricted diet,

00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:15.060 align:middle line:84%
or a starvation diet,
which has had expression

00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:15.860 align:middle line:90%
all over the place.

00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:18.180 align:middle line:84%
The HCG thing that
has been raging

00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:20.680 align:middle line:84%
for the last number of years,
especially about three or four

00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:24.540 align:middle line:84%
years ago, which was
essentially the introduction

00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:27.610 align:middle line:84%
of these particular
hormones with a starvation

00:47:27.610 --> 00:47:29.130 align:middle line:90%
ketogenic diet.

00:47:29.130 --> 00:47:31.420 align:middle line:84%
And people lost weight
very rapidly and kind of

00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:32.550 align:middle line:90%
reset the system.

00:47:32.550 --> 00:47:38.330 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing I think that
without going to the HCG thing,

00:47:38.330 --> 00:47:40.660 align:middle line:84%
people were starting to
see with paleo-- which

00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:43.950 align:middle line:84%
is kind of a softer version
of a ketogenic diet--

00:47:43.950 --> 00:47:47.650 align:middle line:84%
that inflammation goes away,
diabetes is being impacted,

00:47:47.650 --> 00:47:51.190 align:middle line:84%
all inflammatory chronic
diseases are impacted.

00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:52.990 align:middle line:84%
And this is all what
you're talking about.

00:47:52.990 --> 00:47:53.948 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Yeah.

00:47:53.948 --> 00:47:56.110 align:middle line:84%
I was just at a
conference in Tampa

00:47:56.110 --> 00:47:59.040 align:middle line:84%
that was called
metabolic therapeutics.

00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And really the thrust
of the conference

00:48:01.230 --> 00:48:02.890 align:middle line:90%
was the ketogenic diet.

00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And the ketogenic has
got an amazing history

00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:05.680 align:middle line:90%
if you don't know.

00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:08.680 align:middle line:84%
It was first proposed
for epilepsy in the '20s.

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:10.200 align:middle line:90%
It was standard of care.

00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:11.177 align:middle line:90%
It's remarkable.

00:48:11.177 --> 00:48:12.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's been known
back as far as--

00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:14.301 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Something
about the glucose

00:48:14.301 --> 00:48:19.960 align:middle line:84%
in the cells was creating
the epileptic seizures

00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:21.440 align:middle line:84%
in the brain, or
how did that work?

00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:22.590 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON:
They still don't know.

00:48:22.590 --> 00:48:23.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:25.002 align:middle line:84%
But when you remove
that glucose--

00:48:25.002 --> 00:48:25.960 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Yeah.

00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:26.320 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:27.929 align:middle line:84%
Is it the removal
of the glucose or is

00:48:27.929 --> 00:48:29.220 align:middle line:90%
it the addition of the ketones?

00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:30.860 align:middle line:90%
They still don't know how.

00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:31.744 align:middle line:90%
But when you put--

00:48:31.744 --> 00:48:32.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It stops seizures.

00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:33.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Right.

00:48:33.250 --> 00:48:35.950 align:middle line:84%
It's an incredibly effective
therapy for seizures.

00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And it was the standard
of care in the '20s,

00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:40.690 align:middle line:84%
but then drugs came
around in the '30s

00:48:40.690 --> 00:48:42.410 align:middle line:90%
and the diet got forgotten.

00:48:42.410 --> 00:48:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And then it was resurrected
by Jim Abrahams, the Hollywood

00:48:44.850 --> 00:48:48.500 align:middle line:84%
movie producer, whose son had
a horrible case of epilepsy

00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:50.570 align:middle line:84%
and went through drug
after drug after drug.

00:48:50.570 --> 00:48:53.510 align:middle line:84%
And this was made into a
movie, First Do No Harm.

00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:55.800 align:middle line:84%
And the ketogenic diet
is what cured him.

00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And so these kids that are
drug refractory or are not

00:48:59.830 --> 00:49:03.630 align:middle line:84%
responding to drugs,
I think 50% of them

00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:06.370 align:middle line:84%
will be cured by
the ketogenic diet.

00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:08.990 align:middle line:84%
And so it's been
known for some reason

00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:10.870 align:middle line:84%
this incredibly
effective almost free

00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:13.850 align:middle line:84%
dietary therapy just keeps
getting forgotten about.

00:49:13.850 --> 00:49:15.770 align:middle line:84%
But at this
conference in Tampa, I

00:49:15.770 --> 00:49:18.200 align:middle line:84%
mean we were there for
Alzheimer's, for Parkinson's,

00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:21.570 align:middle line:90%
for diabetes, for cancer now.

00:49:21.570 --> 00:49:26.940 align:middle line:84%
So it makes you think, if this
one dietary state of ketosis

00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:31.147 align:middle line:84%
is so effective, this
broad swath of pathologies,

00:49:31.147 --> 00:49:31.980 align:middle line:90%
what does that mean?

00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:35.580 align:middle line:84%
That means that as humans,
we've probably stepped really

00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:38.000 align:middle line:84%
far outside our
normal state of being

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.880 align:middle line:84%
and that we are supposed
to enter ketosis

00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:40.680 align:middle line:90%
from time to time.

00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:42.440 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's supposed
to be sustained,

00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:44.310 align:middle line:84%
long periods of
time I don't know,

00:49:44.310 --> 00:49:47.270 align:middle line:84%
but it seems like
this periodically

00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:50.405 align:middle line:84%
entering it clearly seems like
it's got huge health benefits.

00:49:50.405 --> 00:49:52.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You walk
through the grocery store,

00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:54.238 align:middle line:84%
including health food
stores-- doesn't matter--

00:49:54.238 --> 00:49:56.530 align:middle line:84%
you're going to see
a plethora of baked

00:49:56.530 --> 00:50:00.120 align:middle line:84%
and candies and other things to
chew on and suck on on the way

00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:03.870 align:middle line:84%
out the door that are
laden with sugars.

00:50:03.870 --> 00:50:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And there's never
a moment we have

00:50:06.530 --> 00:50:09.720 align:middle line:84%
to be hungry or without
something in our car or purse

00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:12.951 align:middle line:84%
or whatnot or some kind of
protein bar laden with sugar,

00:50:12.951 --> 00:50:14.950 align:middle line:84%
thinking we're doing a
good thing for ourselves,

00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:18.240 align:middle line:84%
when the body actually needs to
go into these periodic states

00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:20.742 align:middle line:90%
of hunger, mini-starvation.

00:50:20.742 --> 00:50:21.700 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Yeah.

00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:22.990 align:middle line:90%
It's a renewal process.

00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:25.430 align:middle line:84%
When you do that, I mean all
kinds of fascinating things

00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:26.230 align:middle line:90%
happen.

00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:27.890 align:middle line:84%
You get mitochondrial
biogenesis,

00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:30.900 align:middle line:84%
so your mitochondrial
will renew themselves;

00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:33.750 align:middle line:84%
you get this incredible
process called autophagy, which

00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:36.945 align:middle line:84%
is the cells will
digest defunct proteins,

00:50:36.945 --> 00:50:40.450 align:middle line:84%
it's just like a house
cleaning type process.

00:50:40.450 --> 00:50:44.380 align:middle line:84%
And autophagy, when
it's mutated or not,

00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:47.500 align:middle line:84%
being effectively utilized
is associated with cancer.

00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:50.950 align:middle line:84%
So you stimulate it with
periodic fasting and things

00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:52.360 align:middle line:90%
like that--

00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:54.736 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It eats up kind of
necrotic growth in the body.

00:50:54.736 --> 00:50:55.735 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Right.

00:50:55.735 --> 00:50:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And it can even eat up
whole damaged mitochondria

00:50:57.980 --> 00:50:58.980 align:middle line:90%
that's called mitophagy.

00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:01.452 align:middle line:84%
So we have these innate
built-in renewal processes.

00:51:01.452 --> 00:51:03.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But we won't
let ourselves get hungry

00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:06.130 align:middle line:84%
and we throw a bunch of starches
and sugar into ourselves

00:51:06.130 --> 00:51:07.810 align:middle line:84%
and we're setting
ourselves up for all

00:51:07.810 --> 00:51:08.940 align:middle line:90%
of these chronic disease.

00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:11.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: And you
take the 300,000-foot view,

00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:12.710 align:middle line:90%
what happened?

00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:15.770 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, life was
tough a long time ago.

00:51:15.770 --> 00:51:18.140 align:middle line:84%
You scrapped for food and
life, we didn't live long.

00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:19.598 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We all
shared the buffalo

00:51:19.598 --> 00:51:21.060 align:middle line:90%
for a long time, dried meat.

00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:21.440 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Right.

00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:23.814 align:middle line:84%
And then 10,000 years ago,
all of the sudden, agriculture

00:51:23.814 --> 00:51:26.700 align:middle line:84%
came along and wow, we
had cheap carbohydrates.

00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:28.100 align:middle line:90%
The population exploded.

00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:31.360 align:middle line:84%
But now we're kind
of rethinking, well,

00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:33.860 align:middle line:84%
that was great to get a lot
of people on the planet,

00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:36.360 align:middle line:84%
but it's probably not the
best way to live your life,

00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:40.370 align:middle line:84%
to have a health span, to
live well for a long lifespan.

00:51:40.370 --> 00:51:41.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:51:41.170 --> 00:51:41.970 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:51:41.970 --> 00:51:44.330 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk quickly about
Marianne and the tumor

00:51:44.330 --> 00:51:47.250 align:middle line:90%
and how she was worked with.

00:51:47.250 --> 00:51:50.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: So Marianne,
she was the first case study

00:51:50.610 --> 00:51:52.090 align:middle line:90%
that Tom Seyfried worked on.

00:51:52.090 --> 00:51:55.510 align:middle line:84%
And she had a
glioblastoma which was not

00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:58.150 align:middle line:84%
able to be fully
respected surgically,

00:51:58.150 --> 00:52:00.210 align:middle line:84%
which is usually the
case with glioblastomas

00:52:00.210 --> 00:52:02.350 align:middle line:90%
because they grow tentacles.

00:52:02.350 --> 00:52:08.140 align:middle line:84%
And her doctor and Tom
Seyfried did the ketogenic diet

00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:09.620 align:middle line:90%
alongside the standard of care.

00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:12.619 align:middle line:84%
She did a really restricted
version, very few calories.

00:52:12.619 --> 00:52:14.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: 600 I
think you said a day.

00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:15.576 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON:
Right, very low.

00:52:15.576 --> 00:52:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And what was
remarkable about her

00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:22.690 align:middle line:84%
was they were able to get a
complete remission in a very,

00:52:22.690 --> 00:52:25.610 align:middle line:84%
very short period of
time that's not-- I

00:52:25.610 --> 00:52:28.020 align:middle line:84%
mean you don't see
that very often at all.

00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And so they couldn't
find any active cancer

00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:33.310 align:middle line:90%
cells in her brain right away.

00:52:33.310 --> 00:52:35.290 align:middle line:84%
And she maintained
that for a long time

00:52:35.290 --> 00:52:37.390 align:middle line:90%
until she got off the diet.

00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:38.420 align:middle line:90%
And she quit the diet--

00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:40.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, 600
calories a day, mostly fat,

00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:42.120 align:middle line:84%
means you get a few
tablespoons of fat,

00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:44.170 align:middle line:90%
a little bit of protein.

00:52:44.170 --> 00:52:45.630 align:middle line:84%
She felt she was
starving and weak.

00:52:45.630 --> 00:52:46.040 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Right.

00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:47.915 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what
happened, if they could

00:52:47.915 --> 00:52:49.360 align:middle line:90%
have brought her back to more--

00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:50.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I was wondering.

00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:52.590 align:middle line:84%
Why didn't they put her
on a 1,200 calorie a day

00:52:52.590 --> 00:52:53.390 align:middle line:90%
ketogenic diet?

00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:55.650 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: I don't know.

00:52:55.650 --> 00:52:57.070 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why that was.

00:52:57.070 --> 00:52:57.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:52:57.870 --> 00:52:59.500 align:middle line:84%
When I was reading the
book, I was wondering that.

00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:00.458 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Yeah.

00:53:00.458 --> 00:53:02.320 align:middle line:84%
So she went off it
completely and then tried

00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:06.510 align:middle line:84%
Avastin, which is a
very controversial drug

00:53:06.510 --> 00:53:08.440 align:middle line:90%
for glioblastoma.

00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:10.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So she did
ultimately-- she was tired.

00:53:10.930 --> 00:53:11.370 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Yeah.

00:53:11.370 --> 00:53:12.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: She was done fighting.

00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:13.651 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: That's right.

00:53:13.651 --> 00:53:15.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, along with
other information that

00:53:15.810 --> 00:53:17.600 align:middle line:84%
has been suppressed
throughout time--

00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:20.970 align:middle line:84%
we have the work done by Royal
Raymond Rife when, in the '30s,

00:53:20.970 --> 00:53:24.200 align:middle line:84%
the headlines were, the cure
for cancer has arrived, right?

00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And then he was systematically
destroyed and his technology.

00:53:28.660 --> 00:53:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And other things that
influence the cell more

00:53:31.130 --> 00:53:32.740 align:middle line:84%
from an electrical
point of view,

00:53:32.740 --> 00:53:35.170 align:middle line:84%
because that's another
component, right?

00:53:35.170 --> 00:53:37.650 align:middle line:84%
All of those were killed,
whether it was color therapy

00:53:37.650 --> 00:53:39.240 align:middle line:90%
or what, those were all killed.

00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:40.920 align:middle line:84%
Little by little, I
think these things

00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:43.130 align:middle line:84%
are making a comeback,
more in underground circles

00:53:43.130 --> 00:53:44.290 align:middle line:90%
than anything.

00:53:44.290 --> 00:53:46.210 align:middle line:84%
But what you're
talking about here

00:53:46.210 --> 00:53:48.170 align:middle line:84%
is something that's
so accessible

00:53:48.170 --> 00:53:51.850 align:middle line:84%
and anyone can do as a
preventative measure.

00:53:51.850 --> 00:53:54.460 align:middle line:84%
But again, now you get into
some theoretical issues.

00:53:54.460 --> 00:54:00.430 align:middle line:84%
I was a vegetarian for 20 years
for kind of spiritual reasons

00:54:00.430 --> 00:54:02.690 align:middle line:84%
and very committed to
it, wrote books on it,

00:54:02.690 --> 00:54:06.380 align:middle line:84%
did television shows on it, and
then I started getting sick.

00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:09.440 align:middle line:84%
And other people have been
through their versions

00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:10.640 align:middle line:90%
of this journey.

00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:14.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, what about the cancer
institutes around the world--

00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:16.450 align:middle line:84%
and I've interviewed
a couple of people

00:54:16.450 --> 00:54:19.320 align:middle line:84%
that are affiliated with
the well-known ones-- that

00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:21.350 align:middle line:84%
are having people
come in and then

00:54:21.350 --> 00:54:24.280 align:middle line:84%
they put them on massive
amounts of juice,

00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:27.990 align:middle line:84%
for example, which is
laden with glucose.

00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:30.971 align:middle line:84%
Some of it does
work to an extent.

00:54:30.971 --> 00:54:32.720 align:middle line:84%
Talk about that for a
minute, because this

00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:35.400 align:middle line:84%
is a lot of conflict
for people to take in.

00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:37.880 align:middle line:90%
Should I be a vegan, paleo?

00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:39.020 align:middle line:90%
I mean goodness, you know.

00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:39.610 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Right.

00:54:39.610 --> 00:54:40.410 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot.

00:54:40.410 --> 00:54:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And this type of diet, this
medical ketogenic diet,

00:54:45.450 --> 00:54:50.350 align:middle line:84%
is a very measurable
medical intervention.

00:54:50.350 --> 00:54:52.240 align:middle line:84%
So we're not talking
about anything

00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:54.430 align:middle line:84%
beyond just general
health or anything,

00:54:54.430 --> 00:54:59.430 align:middle line:84%
but just for cancer we're going
down this road of proving it

00:54:59.430 --> 00:55:00.230 align:middle line:90%
preclinically.

00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And there's a tremendous
amount of data

00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:06.160 align:middle line:84%
that's reproducible that
shows it works incredibly well

00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:07.360 align:middle line:90%
preclinically.

00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:08.460 align:middle line:90%
Will it cure cancers?

00:55:08.460 --> 00:55:11.470 align:middle line:84%
It may in some cases,
probably not in all.

00:55:11.470 --> 00:55:15.160 align:middle line:84%
But it's most effective use, it
slows the growth of tumor cells

00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:17.450 align:middle line:84%
and it looks like it will
potentiate other treatments.

00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:19.630 align:middle line:84%
So it will be one
piece of a puzzle

00:55:19.630 --> 00:55:21.780 align:middle line:84%
and it allows for
treatments to work better

00:55:21.780 --> 00:55:25.690 align:middle line:84%
with less damage, less
side effects, and so forth.

00:55:25.690 --> 00:55:26.930 align:middle line:90%
And so this is preclinically.

00:55:26.930 --> 00:55:29.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are clinical
trials going on

00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:32.270 align:middle line:84%
and Dr. Scheck is one of
them doing them in Arizona

00:55:32.270 --> 00:55:33.940 align:middle line:90%
at the Barrow Institute.

00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:36.330 align:middle line:84%
It's a trial for
high grade gliomas

00:55:36.330 --> 00:55:38.300 align:middle line:90%
alongside standard of care.

00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:42.390 align:middle line:84%
So it should be very clear
from the data it'll measure

00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:44.900 align:middle line:90%
survival, overall survival.

00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:47.340 align:middle line:84%
So I think once
we have that data,

00:55:47.340 --> 00:55:49.400 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be really
easy from that point

00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:51.980 align:middle line:84%
because now information is
disseminated so quickly,

00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:53.040 align:middle line:90%
the internet.

00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:55.950 align:middle line:84%
And people, they're
fighting for their lives,

00:55:55.950 --> 00:55:58.900 align:middle line:84%
they search things out--
most of them do, not all.

00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:01.580 align:middle line:84%
So it will be there and doctors
can't ignore it at that point.

00:56:01.580 --> 00:56:03.999 align:middle line:84%
It will be a documented
clinical study.

00:56:03.999 --> 00:56:05.540 align:middle line:84%
And then it's up to
them if they want

00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:08.730 align:middle line:84%
to put Jell-O in front
of their-- at some point,

00:56:08.730 --> 00:56:12.360 align:middle line:84%
that those that standard of
care idea will be marginalized.

00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:15.660 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is that
you've got to keep weight

00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:18.710 align:middle line:84%
on cancer patients, they
can get cachexia, which is--

00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:20.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, need
to be starved.

00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:21.360 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Right.

00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:23.310 align:middle line:90%
Well, to a certain degree.

00:56:23.310 --> 00:56:25.019 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm not
saying starve to death.

00:56:25.019 --> 00:56:26.726 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: I
would say to patients

00:56:26.726 --> 00:56:28.580 align:middle line:84%
to just declare it's
always best to do

00:56:28.580 --> 00:56:31.572 align:middle line:90%
that with a willing provider.

00:56:31.572 --> 00:56:33.280 align:middle line:84%
Because there's other
confounding factors

00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:36.630 align:middle line:84%
when you're sick with cancer
and you want to do it medically.

00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:37.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:39.994 align:middle line:84%
And that's where things like
bone broths and all this

00:56:39.994 --> 00:56:41.910 align:middle line:84%
have started coming into
the picture, as well.

00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:45.080 align:middle line:84%
Because that was used in
a very prominent case also

00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:46.650 align:middle line:84%
as the beginning
of the reversal.

00:56:46.650 --> 00:56:47.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Yeah.

00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:50.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I mean there are
a lot of ways to turn on this.

00:56:50.700 --> 00:56:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And so what you're saying in
the book at the end is it says,

00:56:54.140 --> 00:56:56.070 align:middle line:84%
the future of cancer
may look something

00:56:56.070 --> 00:57:00.800 align:middle line:84%
like a ketogenic diet
combined with 3BP,

00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:02.820 align:middle line:84%
the bromopyruvate you
were talking about

00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:08.940 align:middle line:84%
and Young Ko's work,
and perhaps something

00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:11.920 align:middle line:90%
like hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:13.880 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Yeah.

00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:16.402 align:middle line:84%
It so clear in my
mind that the way

00:57:16.402 --> 00:57:17.860 align:middle line:84%
this is going to
solve this problem

00:57:17.860 --> 00:57:20.570 align:middle line:90%
is by combinations of therapies.

00:57:20.570 --> 00:57:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's
no disagreement

00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:25.990 align:middle line:84%
in that from anybody, that
there's no magic bullet.

00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of these protocols
are synergistic with each other,

00:57:30.910 --> 00:57:33.610 align:middle line:84%
they operate through
overlapping pathways.

00:57:33.610 --> 00:57:37.360 align:middle line:84%
And there's many cases of
people doing stuff, combining

00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:42.090 align:middle line:84%
many therapies, and achieving
outstanding outcomes.

00:57:42.090 --> 00:57:43.750 align:middle line:90%
And doctors know this.

00:57:43.750 --> 00:57:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And there's many drugs that
have low toxicity that have

00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:50.920 align:middle line:84%
anti-cancer abilities that are
off label that to get those

00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:53.200 align:middle line:84%
into trials in combination
is brutally difficult.

00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:57.730 align:middle line:84%
But to somebody with
a terminal sentence--

00:57:57.730 --> 00:57:58.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Go off script.

00:57:58.750 --> 00:57:59.925 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Right.

00:57:59.925 --> 00:58:01.300 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I
think it's going

00:58:01.300 --> 00:58:03.800 align:middle line:84%
to look-- I mean with
a ketogenic diet,

00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:06.110 align:middle line:84%
hyperbaric oxygen, a
synergistic with it,

00:58:06.110 --> 00:58:08.840 align:middle line:84%
3BP could come in as
a tumoricidal agent

00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:12.520 align:middle line:84%
and mop up in a
very low toxic way.

00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And when I talk to Young Ko
and all the others involved,

00:58:15.290 --> 00:58:17.056 align:middle line:84%
they all think that
it's going to be

00:58:17.056 --> 00:58:19.430 align:middle line:84%
this combination of therapies
that's going to really make

00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:19.880 align:middle line:90%
a difference.

00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:21.504 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Totally
logical, makes sense.

00:58:21.504 --> 00:58:23.270 align:middle line:84%
I think maybe one of
the biggest issues

00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:26.500 align:middle line:84%
as much as the average
person is afraid of cancer,

00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:28.292 align:middle line:84%
the average doctor is
afraid of litigation.

00:58:28.292 --> 00:58:29.375 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Exactly.

00:58:29.375 --> 00:58:31.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And until
that barrier can somehow

00:58:31.370 --> 00:58:33.970 align:middle line:84%
be broken down,
till there can be

00:58:33.970 --> 00:58:37.480 align:middle line:84%
some kind of grace
or permission, that

00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:39.230 align:middle line:84%
seems the biggest
challenge at the moment.

00:58:39.230 --> 00:58:40.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Right.

00:58:40.020 --> 00:58:41.686 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But still,
we can take control

00:58:41.686 --> 00:58:42.880 align:middle line:90%
on a preventative level.

00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:43.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: That's right.

00:58:43.690 --> 00:58:43.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:44.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's up to us.

00:58:44.620 --> 00:58:44.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Yeah.

00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:47.740 align:middle line:10%
That's what Tom Seyfried, that's
a beautiful part of his book

00:58:47.740 --> 00:58:51.770 align:middle line:10%
is you can theoretically
ketogenic diet periodically

00:58:51.770 --> 00:58:55.830 align:middle line:10%
or intermittent fasting
or just good nutrition.

00:58:55.830 --> 00:58:57.960 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed Dr. Ames,
who talks about when you're

00:58:57.960 --> 00:59:00.380 align:middle line:84%
short of certain
nutrients, your body

00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:02.950 align:middle line:84%
rations them to
short-term survival

00:59:02.950 --> 00:59:06.860 align:middle line:84%
at the expense of enzymes that
repair DNA or keep mitochondria

00:59:06.860 --> 00:59:07.920 align:middle line:90%
healthy.

00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:12.340 align:middle line:84%
So good nutrition, periodic
fasting, all these things

00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:13.647 align:middle line:90%
are definitely preventive.

00:59:13.647 --> 00:59:15.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even proper
supplementation,

00:59:15.230 --> 00:59:17.850 align:middle line:84%
mineralization, all these
things done correctly,

00:59:17.850 --> 00:59:19.620 align:middle line:90%
enzyme therapies-- all of them.

00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:21.242 align:middle line:90%
All of these play a role in it.

00:59:21.242 --> 00:59:22.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Yeah.

00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:24.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, thank you.

00:59:24.190 --> 00:59:27.040 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for your book and
thank you for your time.

00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:30.220 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful.

>>CHRISTOFFERSON: Thank you.

00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:33.343 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This book made
me feel that we're really

00:59:33.343 --> 00:59:36.090 align:middle line:84%
on the verge of turning cancer
into preventable and reversible

00:59:36.090 --> 00:59:38.410 align:middle line:84%
disease without damaging
our overall health.

00:59:38.410 --> 00:59:39.860 align:middle line:90%
Very exciting.

00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:43.260 align:middle line:84%
This would remove a major source
of fear from the human species,

00:59:43.260 --> 00:59:44.070 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:59:44.070 --> 00:59:45.760 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, I can't
recommend the book

00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:48.810 align:middle line:84%
