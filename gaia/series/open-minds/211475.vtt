a lot of concern that people

have had in speaking
with Theo lately

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.545 align:middle line:84%

>>GILLETTE: Yeah, we did.

>>REGINA: But we
can just touch on it

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.150 align:middle line:84%
for a second just to
get that out of the way.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.290 align:middle line:84%

me what Theo is

these people coming

to you with financial concerns
and freaking out actually.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.990 align:middle line:10%
>>GILLETTE: Well,
Theo's been talking

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.200 align:middle line:10%
about this for five decades,
these changes that were coming.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.050 align:middle line:10%
And this is the chaos
we're seeing right now.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.960 align:middle line:10%
And all of the
structured environments

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.250 align:middle line:10%
that will be changing
globally, political structures,

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.380 align:middle line:10%
financial structures, we're a
global financial species here.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Our
finances here in the US

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.680 align:middle line:84%
affect everything on the planet,
and other parts of the world

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.640 align:middle line:90%
affect us.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.640 align:middle line:84%
So there's a new
financial structure

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.720 align:middle line:90%
that is being created.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.960 align:middle line:84%
So there is that
flow in the highest

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.478 align:middle line:90%
good of the human species.

00:02:36.478 --> 00:02:38.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because right now
we see and say, oh, my God,

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:39.820 align:middle line:90%
it's all digital.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.458 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
have cash anymore.

00:02:41.458 --> 00:02:43.000 align:middle line:84%
We're all going to
blend in together,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.417 align:middle line:84%
and the same old
players are going

00:02:44.417 --> 00:02:46.150 align:middle line:90%
to take over and manipulate us.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's the fear of most
people that just heard that.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Of
course, of course.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.520 align:middle line:84%
But it's the complete opposite
because what Theo talks about

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.410 align:middle line:84%
is the people are going to be
involved in these structures.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.070 align:middle line:90%
It's not the powers of the past.

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.630 align:middle line:84%
This evolution of consciousness
that's happening now,

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.480 align:middle line:90%
that structure's dissolving.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's interesting
because we're talking about--

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.010 align:middle line:84%
and I remember asking Theo about
this about a dozen years ago.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And they said, your banking
systems are going to collapse.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.500 align:middle line:84%
These things are going to be
done differently in the future.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.900 align:middle line:90%
Now the time has arrived.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.520 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're
seeing, though,

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.020 align:middle line:84%
is we see the
government taking over

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.430 align:middle line:84%
and the people say, yikes,
Federal Reserve, government,

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.545 align:middle line:84%
all of that, how is
that helping anything?

00:03:34.545 --> 00:03:36.920 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: But what people
don't understand that they've

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.900 align:middle line:90%
always been in charge.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.280 align:middle line:84%
The government's always been
in charge with regulations.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.840 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And in banking
and many other industries.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.650 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of a fallacy
that they're going to get us.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:50.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.310 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: That
doesn't serve anybody,

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.480 align:middle line:84%
Theo says these are
necessary changes,

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.090 align:middle line:90%
that we all have a voice.

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.650 align:middle line:84%
We need to use our voice,
and our large voice

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.000 align:middle line:90%
is our ability to vote.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Here in
the United States,

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:15.310 align:middle line:84%
we have that gift, if you
would, to have our voice heard.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.200 align:middle line:84%
Where in other
parts of the world,

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.190 align:middle line:90%
people don't have that luxury.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.813 align:middle line:90%
They don't have that ability.

00:04:20.813 --> 00:04:21.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So when
we have our voices

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.580 align:middle line:84%
heard, whether
we're speaking out

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.340 align:middle line:84%
or we're voting in a
certain way, whatever

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.892 align:middle line:84%
we do has the ability
to make the change.

00:04:35.892 --> 00:04:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And also
we have a choice

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.650 align:middle line:84%
of where we're putting our
money, whatever money we have.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.260 align:middle line:84%
We can go to a little
local savings and loan

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.080 align:middle line:84%
that serves our
community in small towns,

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.910 align:middle line:84%
or we can put it in
something else entirely.

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.830 align:middle line:84%
The one thing that does
talk in this world,

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.670 align:middle line:84%
in the Western
world, is our money.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.790 align:middle line:84%
So where we choose to
place it is actually

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.680 align:middle line:84%
going to have a large
effect in the future,

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.830 align:middle line:84%
including if we pull
it out and bury it

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.590 align:middle line:84%
or put it in the box spring
or whatever, the mattress.

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:05.570 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:06.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Back
in the olden days.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.792 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like in the old
days, all these things,

00:05:08.792 --> 00:05:10.650 align:middle line:84%
our choice will
end up mattering.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And it will drive
the future, I think.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Well, we see that
in marketing and products.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.380 align:middle line:84%
When people get upset
with a particular product

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.130 align:middle line:84%
or a particular vendor,
they don't go there anymore.

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:25.660 align:middle line:84%
They don't buy that
product anymore.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:26.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It tanks.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It makes
a huge difference.

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We have
the persuasion still.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.590 align:middle line:84%
Another thing I
remember them telling me

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.900 align:middle line:84%
about a dozen
years ago was this,

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.970 align:middle line:84%
that our political
systems would be

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.310 align:middle line:84%
going through some pretty
radical change starting

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.380 align:middle line:90%
with the 2016 election.

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.270 align:middle line:84%
That's what they
said, that we would

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:44.980 align:middle line:90%
start seeing the big changes.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:49.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, we might not like
that it created such--

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.240 align:middle line:84%
since then such division
and instability.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.810 align:middle line:84%
But they said again, this
is necessary for the system

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.397 align:middle line:84%
to grow into a new
system ultimately.

00:05:58.397 --> 00:05:59.230 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Exactly.

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:00.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So
Theo's been talking

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.660 align:middle line:84%
five decades about
all these changes,

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.410 align:middle line:84%
and now we're in
the midst of them.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:07.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:09.310 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: We're in that chaos.

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.390 align:middle line:84%
But out of the chaos
will come order.

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:12.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And we'll be
participating in that.

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:15.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, meanwhile,
we all are going

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.005 align:middle line:84%
to be adapting, not only now,
but in future incarnations.

00:06:21.005 --> 00:06:21.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Oh, yeah.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So everything
that we're laying down now

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:26.980 align:middle line:84%
is what we will
inherit for those

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.570 align:middle line:84%
who are going to
continue incarnating

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:30.010 align:middle line:90%
on Earth, which is most of us.

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:33.050 align:middle line:84%
Right now, a lot of people
say, I hate this place.

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:34.150 align:middle line:90%
I can't wait to jump off.

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:35.500 align:middle line:90%
I hear this all the time.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:36.370 align:middle line:90%
I want to jump off.

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:37.840 align:middle line:90%
Life is too hard.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:38.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, we're in chaos.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:39.640 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.292 align:middle line:90%
But we chose to be here.

00:06:41.292 --> 00:06:42.250 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Oh, I know.

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.500 align:middle line:84%
People think, well, I don't
want to do this again.

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.150 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, is when
you realize you've chosen it,

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.310 align:middle line:84%
you can change your
perception about that.

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And Theo's been
teaching us for years

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.770 align:middle line:84%
now ways to be able
to change our mindset.

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:04.270 align:middle line:84%
As they say, broaden the
aperture of your perceptivity

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:09.640 align:middle line:84%
out of being victimized to
that causal, that creative,

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.490 align:middle line:84%
being the person
that's creating the new

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:15.497 align:middle line:84%
rather than being
at the effect of it.

00:07:15.497 --> 00:07:17.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's the most
powerful thing any of us

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:21.750 align:middle line:84%
can do down to the very
micro levels of our own life,

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:26.790 align:middle line:84%
is not take on the mantle
of us, them, victim,

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:32.280 align:middle line:84%
beings more powerful,
pyramids with billionaires

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.490 align:middle line:84%
and shadowy figures at
the top, and so forth.

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:38.070 align:middle line:84%
Focus on that is
not helpful, I find.

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:41.880 align:middle line:84%
Yes, even Theo said, you do
have things working against you.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:42.990 align:middle line:90%
This is true.

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:44.460 align:middle line:90%
They've told me that.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, every channeler
I know in my own beings

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:48.592 align:middle line:90%
have said, yes, you do.

00:07:48.592 --> 00:07:50.550 align:middle line:84%
There are things that
need to be overcome here,

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:52.300 align:middle line:84%
and there are those
who would like you not

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.190 align:middle line:90%
to advance that way.

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:55.620 align:middle line:90%
But they don't ever focus on it.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: We can
see that daily,

00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:59.820 align:middle line:84%
that there are those
that do not want

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:03.840 align:middle line:84%
this new world to be
birthed that we're

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:07.260 align:middle line:90%
all part of midwifing in.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:11.320 align:middle line:90%
But it's a control thing.

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:16.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It's a desire
of holding the mass down

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:19.440 align:middle line:84%
so we can control
everything, including

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:24.970 align:middle line:84%
all the money and all the land,
and that's an old paradigm.

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:26.070 align:middle line:90%
It won't work.

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:28.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, the Theo
group is very clear.

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:30.900 align:middle line:90%
Mm-mm, their days are numbered.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.200 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:37.619 align:middle line:84%
And they're always empowering,
but it's with love, not fear.

00:08:37.619 --> 00:08:38.419 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:41.690 align:middle line:84%
And that is same with the
other channels that I know.

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:44.179 align:middle line:84%
There are two or three
of you that I interview

00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:45.440 align:middle line:90%
and I'm friends with.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.990 align:middle line:84%
And they all approach
it the same way.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:51.530 align:middle line:84%
Focus on sovereignty, self
empowerment, and love.

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:53.660 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to focus
on who's doing what.

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:57.500 align:middle line:90%
Just create beyond that.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Yeah,
because Theo says,

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.680 align:middle line:84%
if we can change our
mindset, change our minds,

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:07.310 align:middle line:84%
lay new neural pathways in
our brain out of the default

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:12.440 align:middle line:84%
system of fear, fright,
into possibility thinking,

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.930 align:middle line:84%
instead of what if
something horrible is

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:18.620 align:middle line:84%
going to happen, to what
if something wonderful will

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:19.550 align:middle line:90%
happen.

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:20.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:22.490 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Just flipping it.

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:25.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's interesting.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:29.120 align:middle line:84%
Cynthia Sue Larson,
that's her famous line

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.470 align:middle line:84%
is when she starts a day
is, how good can it get?

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:35.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Yeah, I
wake up in the morning

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:38.340 align:middle line:84%
and, say what magic's
happening today?

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:39.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:40.170 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: It's a similar--

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:41.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
yeah, and you both

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:44.490 align:middle line:84%
have very crystalline,
clean, clear, high energy.

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:47.640 align:middle line:84%
So proof's in the
pudding, as they say.

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:50.750 align:middle line:84%
So should we go to Theo
and get in the conversation

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:52.550 align:middle line:84%
about emotions and
all of this and what's

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.110 align:middle line:90%
coming up for humanity?

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:54.950 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: You bet.

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:55.762 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:09:55.762 --> 00:09:56.720 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Here we go.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:05.500 align:middle line:90%


00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.600 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: It is the
beginning, is it not?

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.200 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.350 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, Theo, for
joining us today.

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:14.820 align:middle line:84%
As always, I have lots
of questions to ask you.

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:18.390 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it requires
nuanced thinking on our parts.

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:23.040 align:middle line:84%
And what I wanted to speak about
is the evolving human being

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.460 align:middle line:84%
and the evolving
emotional structure

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:28.890 align:middle line:84%
that will be happening
along with this

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:31.360 align:middle line:90%
and many flavors of it.

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:34.920 align:middle line:84%
So I would like to start
with a question regarding

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:38.340 align:middle line:84%
all of the beings that are
incarnating that are being

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:41.460 align:middle line:84%
labeled as on the
spectrum or autistic

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:44.400 align:middle line:84%
because the way they
display emotions I think

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.950 align:middle line:90%
is being very misunderstood.

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:48.510 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: It is
being misunderstood

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:51.630 align:middle line:84%
because these beings
are highly calibrated

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:56.350 align:middle line:84%
in their nervous systems
and highly sensitive.

00:10:56.350 --> 00:11:02.820 align:middle line:84%
So the thought that they do
not have emotions is incorrect.

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:04.800 align:middle line:90%
They're highly emotional.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.500 align:middle line:84%
They're highly
calibrated, as we said.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And the nervous system
is very refined and also

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:13.230 align:middle line:90%
the intelligence.

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:17.430 align:middle line:84%
So to be in the fifth
dimensionary consciousness

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:21.480 align:middle line:84%
shift that is now, they will
be the ones to carry this world

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:27.480 align:middle line:84%
into this evolving state,
into this greater expanded

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:32.700 align:middle line:84%
experience on the planet, which
is learning about emotions

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:38.550 align:middle line:84%
and how to be in this body
navigating and learning

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:42.270 align:middle line:84%
emotions-- that's the
purpose of Earth anyway--

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:45.420 align:middle line:84%
but on a higher state
of consciousness.

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:48.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about that.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.520 align:middle line:84%
Let's go into the future
human, which you can see.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And yes, our choices
will matter how fast

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.020 align:middle line:84%
and how clumsily we get
there, but we'll be there.

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:02.810 align:middle line:84%
So if you could talk
about what happens

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:07.460 align:middle line:84%
when you have more highly
calibrated nervous system

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:11.000 align:middle line:84%
and set of feelings
and emotions.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.430 align:middle line:84%
And also later I'd like you
to break down the difference

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:14.990 align:middle line:90%
between feelings and emotions.

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:16.370 align:middle line:90%
What does that serve?

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:23.150 align:middle line:84%
What does it look like in the
new fifth dimensional reality?

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:28.900 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: So in this higher
calibrated state physically,

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:32.760 align:middle line:84%
this is what the fifth
dimensionary experiences

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:36.790 align:middle line:84%
is a higher calibration
of energy that

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:42.220 align:middle line:84%
brings about the emotions
coming to the surface.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And sound and
activities and movement

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:50.080 align:middle line:84%
are very off putting to those
who are highly calibrated

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:53.980 align:middle line:84%
now, which is
misunderstood, as you know.

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:56.590 align:middle line:84%
But in this evolved
state the body

00:12:56.590 --> 00:13:01.710 align:middle line:84%
is changing as well to
be-- it's a metamorphosis,

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:06.600 align:middle line:84%
to be able to accept this
higher calibrated being soul.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.460 align:middle line:90%
Your soul is eternal.

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:10.890 align:middle line:84%
It's larger than
your physical body.

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:13.500 align:middle line:84%
You birth into this
physical existence,

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.560 align:middle line:84%
and then the vibrational
frequencies of the soul

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:21.200 align:middle line:84%
enter every cell of the
body and all the organs

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.330 align:middle line:90%
and the functionality you see.

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:30.800 align:middle line:84%
So as this higher frequency can
be in this physical denseness

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.630 align:middle line:84%
in a physical body,
then of course,

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:36.830 align:middle line:84%
the body must adjust
to the functionality

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:39.030 align:middle line:90%
of that energy within it.

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:41.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the
question I would have now

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:47.000 align:middle line:84%
is what does that
expression of feeling

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.960 align:middle line:84%
and having such a highly
tuned nervous system

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.640 align:middle line:90%
allow us access to?

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:56.120 align:middle line:84%
What potential will that
give us as the new human?

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.620 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Greater creativity.

00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:58.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:01.760 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: Greater functionality
of the brain, greater access

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.520 align:middle line:90%
to the brain's capacity.

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:07.010 align:middle line:84%
It's an upgrade,
as you might say,

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:11.910 align:middle line:84%
like when you use your computer
and have a new operating system

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:14.160 align:middle line:90%
that gives it more capacity.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.330 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:17.790 align:middle line:84%
So there will be
a greater capacity

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:20.190 align:middle line:90%
for higher intelligence.

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:23.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what about the
attunement and refinement

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:25.170 align:middle line:90%
of the emotional body?

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:28.110 align:middle line:84%
What will that allow
us to have access to?

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:30.070 align:middle line:84%
Or what does its
potential look like?

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:36.030 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: Well, as this continues,
it is the shift in the brain

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:39.540 align:middle line:84%
and new neural
pathways are created.

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:43.410 align:middle line:84%
And you're moving out of the
reptilian aspect of the fright,

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:48.810 align:middle line:84%
flight, fear default system
in the brain into this broader

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:54.160 align:middle line:84%
creative expansive energetic
in the physical body

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.900 align:middle line:84%
and in the brain
function as well.

00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:03.990 align:middle line:84%
So in this, the old ways
won't be fed in the brain.

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And so that disconnects,
and the new default system

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:12.170 align:middle line:84%
is coming into
place as we speak.

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:13.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Where in the brain--

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:17.240 align:middle line:84%
if we're losing the
reptilian aspect, connection

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.732 align:middle line:84%
with the brain, what
parts of the brain--

00:15:19.732 --> 00:15:21.440 align:middle line:84%
are we looking at the
pineal or what will

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:24.170 align:middle line:90%
be more fed and illuminated?

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:27.620 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: It began in the pineal,
and the frontal lobe will be

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:28.880 align:middle line:90%
much more active because--

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, that makes sense,
where our intellect-- yes.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:31.211 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: --of creativity.

00:15:31.211 --> 00:15:31.790 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:32.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:34.010 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: However,
it's in the entirety

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:38.540 align:middle line:84%
of the brain that will be
affected by these shifts

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:39.710 align:middle line:90%
and changes.

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:42.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
really exciting.

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: It is, and as
embodied beings now

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:51.930 align:middle line:84%
are looking for how
to change their lives,

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:57.450 align:middle line:84%
its emotional changes, changes
of a belief about the self that

00:15:57.450 --> 00:16:03.080 align:middle line:84%
are simply untrue about the lack
of self worth, being lovable,

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:05.000 align:middle line:90%
the not-enoughnesses.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.240 align:middle line:84%
There is this
process that they can

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:12.350 align:middle line:84%
do to rewrite the
script out of beliefs

00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:16.310 align:middle line:84%
that were created either
externally or internally.

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:17.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Foisted upon us.

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:22.760 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: Yes, or in
the moment, the belief

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:26.690 align:middle line:90%
is created or adopted.

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:28.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:30.320 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: And those
can be changed.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:32.180 align:middle line:90%
The events won't change.

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:33.270 align:middle line:90%
They're history.

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And as you release
these old beliefs that

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:41.360 align:middle line:84%
have limited you, you as
humans, as those are released

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.790 align:middle line:84%
and you become aware
of the solid state

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:48.410 align:middle line:84%
of unconditional love that you
are in your purest essence,

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:51.590 align:middle line:84%
then there's no resistance
in the physical body

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:54.560 align:middle line:84%
to circulation and
flow energetically.

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And when there's
resistance, it's aging.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.260 align:middle line:84%
When there is none
and good circulation

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:05.550 align:middle line:84%
in all areas of the
body, then longevity,

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:09.599 align:middle line:84%
the non-aging, if you
would, not anti-aging,

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:13.900 align:middle line:84%
but non-aging can occur
because there's not resistance.

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:16.859 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so all of
those endocrine functions

00:17:16.859 --> 00:17:19.530 align:middle line:84%
are going to be shifting,
all the glandular secretions

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:22.200 align:middle line:84%
and functions, kind of
like in my body, which

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.780 align:middle line:84%
is dicey in this day
and age because we do

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:26.790 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of weird
stuff going on.

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:28.800 align:middle line:90%
But emotions can kill me.

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:32.460 align:middle line:84%
I overindulge in emotion,
I end up in the ER.

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:33.960 align:middle line:84%
It's a difference
of life and death.

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:36.540 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: Because your body
functions differently.

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:38.110 align:middle line:84%
But that's what
we're talking about--

00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:40.027 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that's
what we're moving toward.

00:17:40.027 --> 00:17:42.580 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: --is the physical
body is changing as well.

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And as these
beliefs are changed,

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:51.730 align:middle line:84%
it changes the DNA as
the mind is changed.

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:53.790 align:middle line:90%
And that's what you're talking.

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:55.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's fascinating.

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:59.940 align:middle line:84%
So when we get into, not just
the pituitary, hypothalamus,

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:03.330 align:middle line:84%
all of the pineal,
all of this is going

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:07.960 align:middle line:84%
to be changing for
a more creative flow

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:11.140 align:middle line:84%
that is allowed because
of the smoothness of where

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:13.180 align:middle line:90%
our emotions will ultimately go?

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:16.020 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes, yes.

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:21.930 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine a world
of integrated human beings

00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:24.810 align:middle line:90%
that are acting out of love?

00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:26.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, it just
brings tears to my eyes

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:29.010 align:middle line:84%
because we can all
feel that we want that

00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:30.510 align:middle line:90%
and what it would feel like.

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:34.560 align:middle line:84%
But so many feel it's
so impossible with all

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:37.290 align:middle line:84%
of the obstacles in
their way right now.

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:41.995 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: The greatest obstacle
is the lack of self-love.

00:18:41.995 --> 00:18:43.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Go ahead
and speak about that

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:45.900 align:middle line:84%
because most humans suffer from
that to one degree or another.

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:47.040 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: All humans do.

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:47.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:54.070 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: And that has
been a belief system that

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:56.800 align:middle line:84%
has been passed
along for thousands

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.770 align:middle line:90%
of years that is now changing.

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:02.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What
started it, and why?

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:03.970 align:middle line:90%
Was this part of the program?

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:06.880 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: It was part of the
third dimensional experience,

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:12.370 align:middle line:84%
and that third dimension
has been this divisiveness.

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:14.210 align:middle line:90%
There's not enough for me.

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:17.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take
mine, and you don't

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:22.150 align:middle line:84%
have any, this type of
survivalist experience.

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And there's enough
for everybody.

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:24.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:28.150 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: And imagine
a world where

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:32.550 align:middle line:84%
you could be collaborative
and not competitive.

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:35.690 align:middle line:84%
You would compete in sports
and these things, which

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:37.430 align:middle line:90%
is having fun.

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:40.680 align:middle line:84%
But you're better together
than you are apart.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And you are a collaborative
species truly,

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:47.225 align:middle line:84%
and that will be
what is recognized.

00:19:47.225 --> 00:19:48.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's beautiful.

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:50.390 align:middle line:84%
But right now, the
way competition

00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:53.960 align:middle line:84%
is used is we have these
reality shows that leave someone

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:57.500 align:middle line:84%
in tatters and crying,
while someone's

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:00.330 align:middle line:90%
climbing on top of them to win.

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And I can't watch
that sort of thing.

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:05.090 align:middle line:84%
I don't even like to see
it in the animal kingdom.

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:11.310 align:middle line:10%
>>THEO: Those types of
shows, you call them shows,

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:15.760 align:middle line:10%
entertainment, is
the old paradigm.

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely
like doubling down

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:18.880 align:middle line:90%
on the old paradigm.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:21.490 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: Yes, and
belittling, hmm?

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:23.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it's horrible.

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:27.730 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: And so we say unto all
of you, what would love do?

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:31.760 align:middle line:10%
In any interaction you
make, any intention

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:36.440 align:middle line:10%
you have, first ask
yourself what would love do?

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:39.250 align:middle line:10%
That is simple.

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:44.740 align:middle line:10%
And if everyone did that
they would act from love.

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:45.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:48.400 align:middle line:84%
This brings another
question I just kind of

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.990 align:middle line:90%
touched on a moment ago.

00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:53.050 align:middle line:84%
In the animal kingdom,
to live off of one

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:56.870 align:middle line:84%
another's bodies has
been the way many,

00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:58.450 align:middle line:90%
many species have survived.

00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:02.270 align:middle line:84%
Many species are
going extinct as well.

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:05.620 align:middle line:84%
So can you talk about
what's happening parallel

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:08.860 align:middle line:84%
to the humans in
the animal world?

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:12.520 align:middle line:84%
Will there still be the need
to kill one another to survive?

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:14.020 align:middle line:90%
Is that a constant?

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:16.870 align:middle line:84%
And have some of these
disappearing species simply

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:20.560 align:middle line:84%
blinked out because they're
in a different density now?

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.810 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: They're in
a different density,

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:25.690 align:middle line:84%
but you're speaking of
the human condition.

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:29.050 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
collaborating and creating

00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:35.180 align:middle line:84%
a better world for all,
that's a different mindset

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:39.140 align:middle line:84%
than what has been occurring
over these centuries,

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:41.600 align:middle line:84%
that these kinds
of thought patterns

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.700 align:middle line:90%
have been passed along.

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:47.330 align:middle line:10%
And that's what
you'll see change,

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:53.750 align:middle line:10%
as beings change their belief
systems out of being victimized

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:58.760 align:middle line:10%
to the creative, to the
beings that we see you to be.

00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:01.730 align:middle line:10%
If you could see
yourselves as we see you,

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:03.310 align:middle line:10%
there would be no discontent.

00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:05.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:09.700 align:middle line:84%
So back to the animal
kingdoms, are they also

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:12.430 align:middle line:84%
going through their own
transformative process

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:15.730 align:middle line:84%
collectively, spiritually
as humans are?

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:17.530 align:middle line:84%
Because if the Earth
is transitioning

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:20.020 align:middle line:84%
to higher frequencies,
then we all need to,

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:21.230 align:middle line:90%
or we can't be here.

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:23.043 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: It's all
species on your planet.

00:22:23.043 --> 00:22:24.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
I've wondered is

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:27.730 align:middle line:84%
this, because the
frequencies seem--

00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:30.340 align:middle line:84%
there has been this period of
time that's long been known

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:34.210 align:middle line:84%
where Earth would be
making her transformation

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:36.910 align:middle line:84%
and ascension into
a less dense field,

00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:41.260 align:middle line:84%
that certain species that
live in that third dimension

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:43.880 align:middle line:84%
must stay in that
third dimension.

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:47.830 align:middle line:84%
And when I say blink out, I mean
they still exist but perhaps

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:50.590 align:middle line:84%
in another body that
is still holding

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:53.350 align:middle line:84%
those third dimensional
frequency patterns.

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:57.300 align:middle line:10%
>>THEO: All will be changed
to this higher frequency.

00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:58.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So all animals will?

00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:00.890 align:middle line:84%
So the ones that
have disappeared

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:04.040 align:middle line:84%
is simply they've died out
due to environmental issues,

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:05.420 align:middle line:90%
not due to the spiritual?

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:08.240 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: It has
been environmental.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:13.130 align:middle line:84%
But as you're recognizing,
there are some species

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:14.005 align:middle line:90%
that are coming back.

00:23:14.005 --> 00:23:15.755 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
there are some new ones

00:23:15.755 --> 00:23:16.610 align:middle line:90%
we're discovering.

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:17.410 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:20.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, so yes, there
is an era for all things,

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:22.310 align:middle line:90%
including us.

00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:24.750 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: Yes, there has
been over time, yes?

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:25.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:29.000 align:middle line:10%
>>THEO: But imagine what
humans are doing now

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.430 align:middle line:10%
in this shift of
consciousness is

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:33.620 align:middle line:10%
they're changing
the patterns that

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:39.520 align:middle line:10%
have been passed along
generationally, societally,

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.940 align:middle line:10%
within the structures
of incarnating

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:44.840 align:middle line:10%
over and over again.

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:51.610 align:middle line:84%
So there's been much thought
about generational trauma.

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:55.390 align:middle line:10%
It's all generational
trauma, if you would ask us

00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:59.200 align:middle line:10%
because there's been much
trauma in the human species

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:01.630 align:middle line:10%
over thousands of years.

00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:03.580 align:middle line:90%
But you're breaking that mold.

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:04.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:08.560 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: You're changing
that dynamic now.

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:10.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
it's very exciting.

00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And then you have creatures,
human beings perhaps maybe

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:17.900 align:middle line:84%
from somewhere else
incarnating as human too,

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:20.350 align:middle line:84%
such as a man named
Elon Musk, who

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:22.600 align:middle line:90%
is both adored and vilified.

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:25.030 align:middle line:84%
He's one of those people you
love him or you hate him.

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:28.450 align:middle line:84%
And he appears as someone
who's on the spectrum.

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And he appears to be
somewhat mechanical through--

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:35.320 align:middle line:84%
many people perceive
him as mechanical when

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:37.490 align:middle line:84%
they're watching interviews
with him, and so forth.

00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:39.782 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about this
entity and others like him

00:24:39.782 --> 00:24:41.240 align:middle line:84%
because there are
many more coming?

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:42.440 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: There are
many more coming.

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.180 align:middle line:84%
There are many more
that are on the planet.

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:45.138 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Already here.

00:24:45.138 --> 00:24:47.840 align:middle line:84%
So tell us about this
one and others like him.

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.900 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: He has a heightened
frequency and intelligence,

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:52.730 align:middle line:84%
and we've been
speaking about that

00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:55.400 align:middle line:90%
as this evolutionary process.

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And what he's trying to do
and what you're sensing in him

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:05.730 align:middle line:84%
is how to speak as
others could understand

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:06.730 align:middle line:90%
what he's talking about.

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:08.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What would he
sound like if we could--

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:09.880 align:middle line:84%
what would it sound
like if he could just--

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:11.380 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: You couldn't
understand him.

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:13.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, he he's like
bursting to express what it

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:15.100 align:middle line:90%
means to--

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:16.810 align:middle line:84%
whatever it is he's
trying to bring

00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:19.540 align:middle line:84%
to the planet, so many
different things at one time.

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:23.660 align:middle line:84%
He's so enthused about, he
puts his time and all his money

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:24.460 align:middle line:90%
into it.

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:28.660 align:middle line:84%
But I feel that trying to hold
it together because there's

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:30.047 align:middle line:90%
no way to express it really.

00:25:30.047 --> 00:25:30.880 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: There isn't.

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.940 align:middle line:10%
He doesn't have a language
you could understand what

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:35.830 align:middle line:10%
he feels, senses, and knows.

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:39.010 align:middle line:10%
And many scientists have
that difficulty, as you know.

00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:44.230 align:middle line:84%
There are scientific minds
that couldn't explain anything

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:46.840 align:middle line:84%
to you because they
have their own language.

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:52.770 align:middle line:84%
He has his own
language, but very few

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:56.890 align:middle line:84%
can understand
that language yet.

00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:58.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the one
thing that also gets

00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:02.130 align:middle line:84%
tossed aside often
in the programming

00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:04.830 align:middle line:84%
that we've all had that
it's a conspiracy theory

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:06.430 align:middle line:90%
and he's all for AI.

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:08.070 align:middle line:84%
He's specifically
warning against some

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:11.460 align:middle line:84%
of the AI potentials
he created, actually.

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:13.140 align:middle line:90%
And I don't see him as evil.

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:16.560 align:middle line:84%
I see him as an entity who's
come to serve and offer

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:20.050 align:middle line:84%
as much technology toward
the new way as possible.

00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:22.290 align:middle line:84%
That's my personal
viewpoint on him.

00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:24.480 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing he
adds in in the story is,

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:27.510 align:middle line:84%
but what is all of this without
love because people see him

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:28.920 align:middle line:90%
as a dispassionate person.

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:31.080 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well,
he's got nine kids.

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:33.150 align:middle line:90%
Can't be that dispassionate.

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:35.310 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: Well, and he
wants a better place

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:36.110 align:middle line:90%
for those children.

00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:37.318 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, he does, yeah.

00:26:37.318 --> 00:26:39.060 align:middle line:10%
>>THEO: So he wouldn't
be having children

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:42.030 align:middle line:10%
if he wanted a world that
was going to destruct.

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:44.320 align:middle line:90%
So understand this.

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:47.190 align:middle line:90%
He is the future.

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:49.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I believe too.

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:50.770 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Of higher intelligence.

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:51.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:55.530 align:middle line:10%
>>THEO: And as we
began our speak

00:26:55.530 --> 00:27:01.260 align:middle line:10%
talking about the human
brain and its capacity

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:05.010 align:middle line:10%
and what's happening in
this transformational time

00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:11.760 align:middle line:10%
is that there will be a greater
capacity to the functionality

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:12.610 align:middle line:10%
of the brain.

00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:15.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So as more ordinary
people like ourselves

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:19.260 align:middle line:84%
incarnate into the future, what
we're laying down right now,

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:22.980 align:middle line:84%
what beings like Elon and
others like him are laying down

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:24.930 align:middle line:90%
is our inheritance.

00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:27.750 align:middle line:84%
That is what we're
going to be opening

00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:30.240 align:middle line:84%
into in our new vehicles
in the future, correct?

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.920 align:middle line:90%
It's not just for the few.

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:34.090 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: That's correct.

00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:38.620 align:middle line:84%
Again, imagining a future
where the collaboration

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:42.880 align:middle line:84%
of the human species
with all other species

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:47.410 align:middle line:90%
with love what that could be.

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:49.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I find it amazing.

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:52.460 align:middle line:84%
So now we get down to the human
part of where we are right now.

00:27:52.460 --> 00:28:00.350 align:middle line:84%
And that is that humans are very
attached to emotion and drama.

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:02.930 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: They're very
attached to being a victim.

00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:05.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And very
attached to being a victim.

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:08.310 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: And that's their story.

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:12.270 align:middle line:84%
And what we encourage is
relinquishing that thought

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:14.430 align:middle line:84%
and seeing the
gifts and blessings

00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:20.570 align:middle line:84%
of the challenges of life,
for the challenge is only

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:23.260 align:middle line:90%
the curriculum of life.

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:25.280 align:middle line:90%
And you've come here to learn.

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:28.120 align:middle line:90%
So what can you learn?

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:31.990 align:middle line:84%
What can you get from
all your challenge?

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:34.075 align:middle line:84%
And when you do,
when you embrace it,

00:28:34.075 --> 00:28:37.270 align:middle line:84%
you release the feeling
of victimization

00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:42.830 align:middle line:90%
to anticipation and enthusiasm.

00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Much more
beautiful and productive.

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:49.640 align:middle line:84%
So I think of a fictional
character, Spock,

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:50.720 align:middle line:90%
in the Star Trek series.

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:54.770 align:middle line:10%
And when they go
into his backstory,

00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:58.490 align:middle line:10%
his father's explaining to him
that humans don't understand

00:28:58.490 --> 00:29:00.830 align:middle line:10%
that he's actually--
that they are

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:06.290 align:middle line:10%
far more sensitive emotionally
than human beings, which

00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:09.650 align:middle line:10%
is why they have learned
the art of using their logic

00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:12.950 align:middle line:10%
to help put order and
structure to their being

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:17.100 align:middle line:10%
so that they can survive
the emotional soup, right?

00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:18.390 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:21.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us a little
bit about that from your view.

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:26.180 align:middle line:10%
>>THEO: So it's foretelling
of the future, isn't it?

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:27.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:32.850 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: So though it was
a story fictionalized,

00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:34.740 align:middle line:90%
now we're speaking about it.

00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:38.970 align:middle line:84%
And you're witnessing
these human beings

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:44.200 align:middle line:84%
with this same capacity
of intelligence

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:49.690 align:middle line:84%
and emotional intelligence
that will come from it.

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:52.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That can then
drive their endeavors

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:53.680 align:middle line:90%
with compassion.

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:54.790 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:56.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because if
you can stop yourself

00:29:56.770 --> 00:30:02.040 align:middle line:84%
from just literally frying your
circuits with emotions, which

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:04.110 align:middle line:84%
everyone's doing--
the chaos right now

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:06.330 align:middle line:90%
and emotions are crazy here.

00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:10.680 align:middle line:84%
If we can stop and take a
breath and contemplate and apply

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:13.680 align:middle line:84%
a little intellect, why are
we feeling that feeling?

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:14.550 align:middle line:90%
Is it true?

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:17.670 align:middle line:84%
Even ask a few questions
to use the mind

00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:19.710 align:middle line:84%
to help soothe the
emotions, that's

00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:21.940 align:middle line:84%
a little step forward
toward where we're headed.

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:24.420 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: So what you're speaking
about is critical thinking.

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:25.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:28.933 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: And there isn't
any right now for many.

00:30:28.933 --> 00:30:29.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:30:29.850 --> 00:30:32.893 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: So then no one
is asking, is it true?

00:30:32.893 --> 00:30:33.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:36.390 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: They're
just accepting some

00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:40.710 align:middle line:84%
of these things
that are so untrue

00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:44.370 align:middle line:84%
and not even asking
the question.

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:49.020 align:middle line:84%
So to your point,
to go within and ask

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:52.500 align:middle line:90%
your higher power in you knows.

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:55.050 align:middle line:90%
You all know truth.

00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:58.505 align:middle line:84%
So asking, is it true,
you can gain clarity.

00:30:58.505 --> 00:30:59.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you
have to then be

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:05.280 align:middle line:84%
willing to let go of that sweet
and sour addiction to drama

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:06.870 align:middle line:90%
and heavy emotions.

00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:08.040 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: To the story--

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:08.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To the story.

00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:10.030 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: --of the victimization.

00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:11.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, exactly.

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:15.190 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: And some like to
be actors in that play.

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:16.000 align:middle line:90%
Some will choose--

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Until it gets boring.

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:20.200 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: Some they
never get bored.

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:21.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: True.

00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:25.420 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the notion
of other planetary beings

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:29.140 align:middle line:84%
who are capable of and can
incarnate in human vehicles

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:32.260 align:middle line:84%
during this time
of transformation.

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:36.010 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: We find this most
amusing because people call

00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:41.110 align:middle line:90%
others aliens or other places.

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:43.142 align:middle line:90%
Imagine that you're one of them.

00:31:43.142 --> 00:31:44.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, we
are one of them.

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:52.230 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: So it's that souls
have billions of choices

00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:54.780 align:middle line:90%
of incarnating or not.

00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:57.570 align:middle line:90%
The Earth is only one.

00:31:57.570 --> 00:32:01.050 align:middle line:84%
So it is not surprising
in this time of change

00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:05.820 align:middle line:84%
to have this regressive
experience to find out--

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:08.940 align:middle line:84%
and it's an integrative
experience as well--

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:10.750 align:middle line:90%
of who you are.

00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:14.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what is
the lure then for beings

00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:17.850 align:middle line:84%
who haven't been incarnating
as human to come and try

00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:19.950 align:middle line:84%
on the human
experience right now?

00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:21.450 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: To learn emotions.

00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:22.410 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that interesting?

00:32:22.410 --> 00:32:24.240 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Have fun.

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:27.510 align:middle line:84%
But they're coming also at
a time when we're trying

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:29.385 align:middle line:84%
to transform-- when
we're going to be--

00:32:29.385 --> 00:32:31.760 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be demanded that
we transform our emotions.

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.760 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: They'll be a part
of that transformation

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:38.010 align:middle line:84%
just as all who have
enjoyed many human lives

00:32:38.010 --> 00:32:40.880 align:middle line:90%
are part of the transformation.

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:45.290 align:middle line:84%
It is quite exquisite to
have a earthly experience

00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:48.920 align:middle line:84%
and a human body, and
that's the realization

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:51.000 align:middle line:90%
that you'll come to.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Speak about that a
little more for all the people

00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:55.380 align:middle line:84%
who are saying, I don't
want to come back.

00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:58.120 align:middle line:90%


00:32:58.120 --> 00:32:59.290 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: You won the lottery.

00:32:59.290 --> 00:33:00.700 align:middle line:90%
You've got a body.

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:07.900 align:middle line:84%
There are billions of
souls who would love

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:10.930 align:middle line:90%
to have a human experience.

00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:14.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is that because
of salted caramel ice cream?

00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:15.490 align:middle line:90%
Why is it?

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:20.260 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: It's all of those things
that you enjoy because you

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:22.240 align:middle line:90%
have your Earth suit.

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:26.830 align:middle line:84%
You have all those sensory
perceptivities in the body

00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:31.000 align:middle line:84%
that you can enjoy
your ice cream.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.410 align:middle line:90%
You can touch and be touched.

00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:39.960 align:middle line:84%
You can have the thrill
of feeling the magic

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:44.110 align:middle line:90%
of your intuitive gifts.

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:46.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what is it
like for the beings that

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:49.390 align:middle line:84%
are not incarnate that
are desiring these things?

00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:50.920 align:middle line:84%
How does their
learning and growth

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:53.890 align:middle line:84%
occur without the resistance
of the Earth suit?

00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:55.820 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: They choose
something else.

00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:58.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Go somewhere
else, another kind of body?

00:33:58.570 --> 00:33:59.920 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:01.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But my
understanding is

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:03.850 align:middle line:84%
Earth is a desirable
place because

00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:08.170 align:middle line:84%
of the sheer variety
of experience

00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:09.102 align:middle line:90%
that's possible here.

00:34:09.102 --> 00:34:11.560 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: That's true, and look
at the beauty of your planet.

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:13.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, it's so beautiful.

00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:15.280 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: And know
that there could

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:20.949 align:middle line:84%
be as many as 40,000
other planets like Earth

00:34:20.949 --> 00:34:22.350 align:middle line:90%
in your universe.

00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:24.489 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: As beautiful.

00:34:24.489 --> 00:34:26.409 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: Beautiful
and experiential

00:34:26.409 --> 00:34:27.560 align:middle line:90%
and all the things.

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:31.929 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at the
pictures of the universe

00:34:31.929 --> 00:34:33.850 align:middle line:84%
that you can see,
now you can see

00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:36.159 align:middle line:90%
the vastness of what we speak.

00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:37.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, stunning.

00:34:37.810 --> 00:34:44.830 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: Yes, and so the mind has
been this small myopic viewing

00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:50.340 align:middle line:84%
point that the aperture
is being broadened now.

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:52.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let me ask
you this, within these--

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:56.130 align:middle line:84%
I think you said 40,000
other planets like Earth

00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:58.930 align:middle line:84%
within our own universe, and
there are multiple universes.

00:34:58.930 --> 00:34:59.730 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:02.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are there
other species like us?

00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:05.610 align:middle line:84%
Or are we kind of unique in
the way in which we're growing?

00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:08.250 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: We would like to tell
you you're unique and special.

00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:10.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But we're not.

00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:12.200 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: You are, on
Earth, unique and special.

00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:13.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But this is
happening elsewhere.

00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:14.750 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:16.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This isn't the
only growing experiment,

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:17.760 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:20.880 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: Correct, and it's
not even an experiment truly.

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:22.560 align:middle line:90%
It's just a choice, isn't it?

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:23.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, a choice.

00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:27.420 align:middle line:84%
So the species there have had
to make the same choices we're

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:30.510 align:middle line:84%
making right now and
have had to step up

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:33.780 align:middle line:84%
into the same faith
of their own potential

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:37.030 align:middle line:84%
to grow into what
they've become.

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:40.870 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: That's why you
incarnated because you know it.

00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And when we say you, we're
speaking of the people you,

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:48.000 align:middle line:90%
the larger mass you as humans.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.370 align:middle line:84%
Those of you who
have incarnated now

00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:53.790 align:middle line:84%
have come here purposefully
for this transformation

00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:56.470 align:middle line:84%
and transition to this
higher consciousness.

00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:58.493 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So don't
chicken out now.

00:35:58.493 --> 00:35:59.910 align:middle line:84%
Because some of
the younger people

00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:01.368 align:middle line:84%
are having so much
trouble, they're

00:36:01.368 --> 00:36:04.560 align:middle line:84%
taking their own lives,
so many young people.

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:09.000 align:middle line:84%
They're not able to handle
this density of the chaos

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.500 align:middle line:90%
and confusion.

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:12.360 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: What they're
not able to handle

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:15.720 align:middle line:84%
is the bullying and
the lack of love.

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:17.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's so true.

00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:24.770 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: So what is necessary
is support and the--

00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:25.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Unconditional.

00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:30.870 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: --regulation of the
usage of their technology.

00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:32.310 align:middle line:90%
You spoke of AI.

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:37.690 align:middle line:84%
Regulation here is
of utmost importance

00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:41.380 align:middle line:84%
for the emotional balance
and psychological balance

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:42.443 align:middle line:90%
of the species.

00:36:42.443 --> 00:36:44.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What we're
saying is, parents,

00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:47.790 align:middle line:84%
do not let your kids live
on their devices, right?

00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:48.590 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:50.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This cannot
continue like this.

00:36:50.370 --> 00:36:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: But it's not
only up to the parents.

00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:55.400 align:middle line:90%
It's up to the providers.

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:58.545 align:middle line:90%
It is up to the inventors--

00:36:58.545 --> 00:36:59.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:03.740 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: --that are creating
these new innovations.

00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:06.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because they're
creating it to be addictive.

00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:11.360 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes, for monetary.

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:12.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And don't
let our children

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:15.170 align:middle line:90%
be a cog in that machine.

00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:16.100 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Correct.

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:20.810 align:middle line:84%
But also demand something
of them as well.

00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:22.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:23.270 align:middle line:90%
Again, money.

00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:25.850 align:middle line:84%
Unplug, don't give
them your subscription.

00:37:25.850 --> 00:37:27.320 align:middle line:90%
Don't click on the clickbait.

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:28.530 align:middle line:90%
Just don't buy in.

00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:29.330 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:37:29.330 --> 00:37:29.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:30.950 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: And change will come.

00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:31.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:34.370 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: But even those that
are bringing these innovations

00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:38.210 align:middle line:84%
forward, you spoke
of the being Musk

00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:41.430 align:middle line:84%
and others are speaking
to this as well.

00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:42.230 align:middle line:90%
It's not just us.

00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:43.647 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes,
they're saying,

00:37:43.647 --> 00:37:45.620 align:middle line:84%
don't let this take over
your children's lives.

00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:47.930 align:middle line:90%
This is a mistake, yes.

00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:48.830 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Regulate it.

00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:49.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Regulate.

00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:51.640 align:middle line:84%
Yes, so that's going
to be interesting.

00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:53.390 align:middle line:84%
That's a big one that
we'll have to handle

00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:56.330 align:middle line:84%
as a species over the
next couple of decades.

00:37:56.330 --> 00:38:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Theo, you've handed
us so many pearls.

00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:02.990 align:middle line:84%
Any final thoughts before
we say goodbye today?

00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:04.680 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: We never
have final thoughts.

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:06.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well.

00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:08.580 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: There are only more
questions to be answered.

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:09.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:13.200 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: However, we are
appreciative of the opportunity

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:14.530 align:middle line:90%
to serve.

00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:16.830 align:middle line:90%
And in the asking, it is given.

00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:20.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you so much
on behalf of all of us.

00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:23.110 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: God's love unto you.

00:38:23.110 --> 00:38:23.910 align:middle line:90%
Good day.

00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:26.580 align:middle line:90%


00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:27.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Welcome back.

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:28.720 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Thank you.

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:30.787 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was
super inspiring.

00:38:30.787 --> 00:38:32.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
remember anything,

00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:36.060 align:middle line:84%
but there was some
real, real beauty,

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:38.970 align:middle line:84%
real nuggets in
there of glimpses

00:38:38.970 --> 00:38:41.270 align:middle line:90%
of what we're becoming.

00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:42.530 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: That's wonderful.

00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And many people are
asking about that now.

00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:49.450 align:middle line:84%
Theo's been talking quite a
bit about where we've been

00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:50.590 align:middle line:90%
and where we're going.

00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:53.170 align:middle line:90%
And it's quite positive.

00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Very
positive, and just

00:38:55.240 --> 00:39:00.430 align:middle line:84%
talking about what happens
when we incarnate with a more

00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:04.415 align:middle line:84%
refined nervous system and
emotional structure how it's

00:39:04.415 --> 00:39:06.040 align:middle line:84%
blowing out some of
the kids right now,

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:08.710 align:middle line:84%
the people right now that can't
handle this because they're

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:11.530 align:middle line:84%
coming in for the new
way, the new human,

00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:13.600 align:middle line:84%
the beginning phases
of the new human.

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:16.330 align:middle line:84%
But that what that is
going to lead to in the end

00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:19.840 align:middle line:84%
is just beautiful,
just stupendous.

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And I thought they explained it
really nicely because I think,

00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:25.300 align:middle line:84%
in a time of chaos,
the one thing we need

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:27.310 align:middle line:90%
is to, where's that brass ring?

00:39:27.310 --> 00:39:29.140 align:middle line:90%
Why bother?

00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:32.680 align:middle line:84%
You need to see a glimpse
of what's possible.

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:37.050 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Yeah, and I think
we have to get out of paying

00:39:37.050 --> 00:39:38.920 align:middle line:84%
attention to what's
happening out there--

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:39.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:42.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: --and pay attention
to what's happening in here.

00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:43.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:49.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And that can give
us that stability if we do that.

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:55.770 align:middle line:84%
And most are caught up in the
reaction of being triggered

00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:57.635 align:middle line:90%
by what's happening out here.

00:39:57.635 --> 00:39:59.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
that's the point.

00:39:59.010 --> 00:40:02.280 align:middle line:84%
It keeps you glued to your
phone for the next headline.

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:03.360 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yeah.

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:04.870 align:middle line:90%
So more people should meditate--

00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:05.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:08.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: --and
get an inner balance.

00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:09.400 align:middle line:90%
And it's all going to be OK.

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:10.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you still
start your days--

00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:12.340 align:middle line:84%
I've known you for
a lot of years now.

00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:15.840 align:middle line:84%
Do you still start your days
with a meditation and a soak?

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:17.813 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Well,
sometimes a soak.

00:40:17.813 --> 00:40:19.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Usually,
you soak a lot.

00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:21.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Yeah, well, we
still do, in the hot tub.

00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:23.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, we're hot tub lovers--

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:25.777 align:middle line:84%
but meditation for
sure and gratitude.

00:40:25.777 --> 00:40:26.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Gratitude.

00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:32.190 align:middle line:10%
>>GILLETTE: Just before my feet
hit the floor in the morning,

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:37.270 align:middle line:10%
I've been grateful for one thing
and proud of myself for one

00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:38.210 align:middle line:10%
thing that I've done--

00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:39.010 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:39.010 --> 00:40:42.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: --because we tend
to always ruminate and go,

00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:44.560 align:middle line:84%
I should have done it
another way or this.

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:46.750 align:middle line:84%
But really being
proud of yourself,

00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:50.200 align:middle line:84%
large or small of
something that you've done,

00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:53.740 align:middle line:84%
this is the transformation
of that unconditional love

00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:58.330 align:middle line:84%
of self, moving out of
that old thinking pattern

00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:00.173 align:middle line:84%
of not being worthy
or good enough.

00:41:00.173 --> 00:41:02.215 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely, and
it's such a simple one.

00:41:02.215 --> 00:41:02.470 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: It is.

00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:04.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think you shared
that on one of the other shows

00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:06.080 align:middle line:90%
recently with us.

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:07.420 align:middle line:90%
And it is profound.

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:09.670 align:middle line:84%
Just to start with
gratitude alone,

00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:11.860 align:middle line:84%
before you even do
self-appreciation,

00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:14.290 align:middle line:84%
takes you into a
very refined field

00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:16.030 align:middle line:90%
of love and connectedness.

00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:18.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And to your
point too is meditation.

00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:19.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:21.910 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Most people go,
I don't have enough time.

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:23.590 align:middle line:84%
That's when you
need it the most.

00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:23.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:25.150 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And what
does it give you?

00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:26.350 align:middle line:90%
It gives you focus.

00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:29.710 align:middle line:84%
So it seems like you have
more time if you do it.

00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:30.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:33.790 align:middle line:84%
And there are all kinds of
little apps and everything

00:41:33.790 --> 00:41:37.195 align:middle line:84%
in the world of technology
to assist us to go inside.

00:41:37.195 --> 00:41:38.260 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:39.250 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yeah.

00:41:39.250 --> 00:41:41.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you're,
what do you call it,

00:41:41.410 --> 00:41:43.930 align:middle line:84%
twixt and between the
worlds of technology

00:41:43.930 --> 00:41:46.480 align:middle line:84%
and the organic meditation,
combine the two.

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:48.130 align:middle line:84%
There are all kinds
of ways to help--

00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:50.110 align:middle line:84%
otherwise, you can
just stop and take

00:41:50.110 --> 00:41:51.760 align:middle line:84%
a little breath
or two somewhere.

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:52.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Take
a walk in nature.

00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:53.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:53.410 --> 00:41:54.430 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: That's a meditation.

00:41:54.430 --> 00:41:55.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Simple.

00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:56.150 align:middle line:90%
Sheila, thank you.

00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:57.820 align:middle line:90%
It was absolutely beautiful.

00:41:57.820 --> 00:41:59.740 align:middle line:84%
Really, really lovely
transmission today.

00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:00.657 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Oh, thanks

00:42:00.657 --> 00:42:02.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So until
next time, thank

00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:03.313 align:middle line:90%
you so much for being here.

00:42:03.313 --> 00:42:04.480 align:middle line:90%
