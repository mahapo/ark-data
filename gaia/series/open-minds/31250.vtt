If you haven't already
seen my last conversation

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:24.157 align:middle line:84%
with Barbara Hand Clow,
you might want to view

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:25.459 align:middle line:90%
that before you watch this.

00:00:25.459 --> 00:00:27.728 align:middle line:84%
This is a direct
extension of that,

00:00:27.728 --> 00:00:30.731 align:middle line:84%
which is about the nine
dimensions of human existence.

00:00:30.731 --> 00:00:32.699 align:middle line:84%
In the last interview,
we covered the first

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:34.067 align:middle line:90%
through fourth dimensions.

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:36.870 align:middle line:84%
In this conversation, we
will explore the lesser known

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.607 align:middle line:84%
but equally present fifth
through ninth dimensions.

00:00:40.607 --> 00:00:44.177 align:middle line:84%
Okay, we just had a hot
conversation last time around.

00:00:44.177 --> 00:00:44.811 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, here we go again.

00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:45.746 align:middle line:90%
Here we go again.

00:00:45.746 --> 00:00:47.080 align:middle line:84%
[laughter] Okay,
now we didn't get

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.915 align:middle line:84%
to the last 20 questions I
had about the fourth dimension

00:00:48.915 --> 00:00:50.384 align:middle line:84%
and I know we can't
cover everything

00:00:50.384 --> 00:00:53.987 align:middle line:84%
and that's well delineated
in your book, fabulous book.

00:00:53.987 --> 00:00:55.856 align:middle line:84%
But let's pick it
up a little bit

00:00:55.856 --> 00:00:57.190 align:middle line:90%
in the fourth dimensional field.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.160 align:middle line:84%
We were talking about how
easy it is to reach in through

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.996 align:middle line:84%
that field and control
mind perception, emotions,

00:01:03.996 --> 00:01:05.699 align:middle line:90%
and so forth control of us.

00:01:05.699 --> 00:01:08.902 align:middle line:90%
And we also, we do it willingly.

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:11.705 align:middle line:84%
We give up our control
willingly as well.

00:01:11.705 --> 00:01:15.775 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk a little bit about
what it takes to break free

00:01:15.775 --> 00:01:18.712 align:middle line:84%
from that kind of programming
in the fourth dimension

00:01:18.712 --> 00:01:22.015 align:middle line:84%
to start reaching into and
utilizing the fifth dimension

00:01:22.015 --> 00:01:24.618 align:middle line:84%
and what that is, but
the crossover first.

00:01:24.618 --> 00:01:27.788 align:middle line:84%
Okay, well all of the
higher five dimensions,

00:01:27.788 --> 00:01:30.924 align:middle line:84%
fifth dimensions through ninth
dimension, penetrate the top

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:33.727 align:middle line:84%
of the canopy and start
moving down through 4D

00:01:33.727 --> 00:01:36.696 align:middle line:84%
and then finally those
impulses and consciousness

00:01:36.696 --> 00:01:40.567 align:middle line:84%
that are coming in come down
into us into third dimension.

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:43.036 align:middle line:84%
So the reason that the
Pleiadians used a person

00:01:43.036 --> 00:01:46.640 align:middle line:84%
on a healing table in order
to explain this dynamic is

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.975 align:middle line:84%
that they're trying to help
us understand how the lower

00:01:48.975 --> 00:01:52.144 align:middle line:84%
dimensions below our
bodies are energizing us,

00:01:52.144 --> 00:01:54.648 align:middle line:84%
and then how our
energy and thoughts

00:01:54.648 --> 00:01:57.217 align:middle line:84%
and emotions are
flowing out of us

00:01:57.217 --> 00:01:58.652 align:middle line:84%
into the fourth dimension
'cause, see,

00:01:58.652 --> 00:02:00.120 align:middle line:90%
we create the fourth dimension.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.324 align:middle line:84%
The reason it's a collective
area of consciousness is

00:02:04.324 --> 00:02:06.827 align:middle line:84%
because it's coming
from us as humans.

00:02:06.827 --> 00:02:09.328 align:middle line:84%
So then once you're into
the fourth dimension,

00:02:09.328 --> 00:02:13.066 align:middle line:84%
for most people, what you're
dealing with is dualities,

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:14.568 align:middle line:90%
dark and light, good and evil,

00:02:14.568 --> 00:02:17.471 align:middle line:84%
because the whole fourth
dimension is polarized

00:02:17.471 --> 00:02:20.640 align:middle line:90%
into a range of potentiality.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.177 align:middle line:84%
And so what we need to
understand as human beings is

00:02:24.177 --> 00:02:28.448 align:middle line:84%
that how we handle the fourth
dimension depends upon our level

00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:31.885 align:middle line:84%
of healing and upon our
level of mental clarity.

00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:33.186 align:middle line:90%
So in other words, unders--

00:02:33.186 --> 00:02:35.889 align:middle line:84%
being able to deal with the
fourth dimension involves

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:39.392 align:middle line:84%
activating our minds, breaking
the paradigms, getting a hold

00:02:39.392 --> 00:02:43.096 align:middle line:84%
of the real truth, and also
processing our emotional blocks

00:02:43.096 --> 00:02:44.498 align:middle line:90%
and our emotional issues.

00:02:44.498 --> 00:02:45.499 align:middle line:90%
Big one. Yeah.

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:46.433 align:middle line:90%
Trap trauma.

00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:47.567 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:02:47.567 --> 00:02:48.869 align:middle line:84%
So you could see why the
Pleiadians are showing

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:50.704 align:middle line:84%
that person lying
on a table-- Yes.

00:02:50.704 --> 00:02:53.673 align:middle line:84%
-- with the canopy because that
canopy is like this big mushroom

00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:55.541 align:middle line:84%
above your head which
is just filled

00:02:55.541 --> 00:02:57.477 align:middle line:90%
with all the collective mind.

00:02:57.477 --> 00:03:01.181 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens is that--
it's a beautiful energy range

00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:03.316 align:middle line:84%
because it's what connects
you with everything else.

00:03:03.316 --> 00:03:05.252 align:middle line:84%
You can really think
of the fourth dimension

00:03:05.252 --> 00:03:08.088 align:middle line:84%
as being a dimension
of connectivity.

00:03:08.088 --> 00:03:11.525 align:middle line:84%
But you're not going to be able
to really be connected with that

00:03:11.525 --> 00:03:13.627 align:middle line:90%
in an intelligent level

00:03:13.627 --> 00:03:17.030 align:middle line:84%
and understand the game unless
you activate your mental

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.633 align:middle line:84%
abilities and also--
and if you--

00:03:19.633 --> 00:03:22.169 align:middle line:84%
you have to clear
yourself emotionally.

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:23.702 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're not
clear emotionally,

00:03:23.702 --> 00:03:25.705 align:middle line:84%
then everything is
us against them,

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:28.408 align:middle line:84%
and whenever anybody starts a
war, this guy is the good guy,

00:03:28.408 --> 00:03:30.143 align:middle line:84%
that guy is the bad
guy, and as we all know,

00:03:30.143 --> 00:03:32.112 align:middle line:84%
all of that is absolutely
absurd.

00:03:32.112 --> 00:03:34.814 align:middle line:84%
Yes. And the only thing that's
going to stop any of it is

00:03:34.814 --> 00:03:37.117 align:middle line:84%
when the individual
players on the--

00:03:37.117 --> 00:03:38.618 align:middle line:84%
and think of the
fourth dimension

00:03:38.618 --> 00:03:40.086 align:middle line:90%
as a gigantic chessboard.

00:03:40.086 --> 00:03:42.956 align:middle line:84%
That's why they treat it
like in Masonic tradition.

00:03:42.956 --> 00:03:44.457 align:middle line:90%
Right. They show the chessboard.

00:03:44.457 --> 00:03:46.693 align:middle line:84%
Right. And the issues
that we're facing now

00:03:46.693 --> 00:03:50.197 align:middle line:84%
as species is getting
smart on the chessboard,

00:03:50.197 --> 00:03:52.866 align:middle line:84%
because at this point it's
very clear that the people,

00:03:52.866 --> 00:03:54.668 align:middle line:84%
the game masters, if you
want to call them there,

00:03:54.668 --> 00:03:56.603 align:middle line:84%
or the global elite,
it's very clear

00:03:56.603 --> 00:03:57.938 align:middle line:84%
that they don't know
what they're doing.

00:03:57.938 --> 00:03:59.072 align:middle line:90%
No, they don't.

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:00.740 align:middle line:84%
They only are carrying
out an agenda that seems

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.576 align:middle line:90%
to serve only themselves-- Yeah.

00:04:02.576 --> 00:04:03.777 align:middle line:90%
-- for most part not-- Right.

00:04:03.777 --> 00:04:05.679 align:middle line:90%
Not the bulk of humanity.

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:07.914 align:middle line:84%
Right. And one thing
we were talking

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:09.916 align:middle line:90%
about in the last program is

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:13.587 align:middle line:84%
that these beings
have been doing this

00:04:13.587 --> 00:04:16.489 align:middle line:84%
for about the last 5,000
years or arguably beyond

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.226 align:middle line:84%
but certainly the last
5,000 years because--

00:04:19.226 --> 00:04:20.794 align:middle line:84%
and from the time
of the cataclysm,

00:04:20.794 --> 00:04:22.295 align:middle line:90%
11-1/2 thousand years ago.

00:04:22.295 --> 00:04:23.797 align:middle line:84%
That's more like
12,000 years ago.

00:04:23.797 --> 00:04:25.165 align:middle line:90%
12,000 years ago.

00:04:25.165 --> 00:04:27.434 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Because at that
time when you had such--

00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:29.169 align:middle line:84%
and this is what you
explained, I'm just setting this

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:30.303 align:middle line:90%
up again for everyone.

00:04:30.303 --> 00:04:32.105 align:middle line:90%
When you have such vast trauma

00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:35.175 align:middle line:84%
as a cataclysm people
tend to lose bearings.

00:04:35.175 --> 00:04:36.276 align:middle line:90%
They're devastated.

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:39.546 align:middle line:84%
And only the fit-- the
most fit emotionally

00:04:39.546 --> 00:04:42.148 align:middle line:84%
and mentally could grab
the reins and run with them

00:04:42.148 --> 00:04:43.717 align:middle line:90%
and have been in control since.

00:04:43.717 --> 00:04:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's where-- that's where
we're picking up from here.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.190 align:middle line:84%
So we have this trapped
physical, emotional trauma

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.360 align:middle line:84%
from cataclysms and then
what's been perpetuated

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.728 align:middle line:90%
since then, day-in and day-out.

00:04:54.728 --> 00:04:57.530 align:middle line:84%
It's like there's mini
cataclysms everyday

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:58.632 align:middle line:84%
of our lives, it
seems-- That's right.

00:04:58.632 --> 00:04:59.899 align:middle line:90%
-- on an emotional level-- Yeah.

00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:02.135 align:middle line:84%
-- perpetuated from
and distributed

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:03.236 align:middle line:90%
through the fourth dimension.

00:05:03.236 --> 00:05:04.437 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's right.

00:05:04.437 --> 00:05:08.675 align:middle line:84%
And so this fourth
dimensional field, the big bang

00:05:08.675 --> 00:05:11.478 align:middle line:84%
in there is the original
cataclysm which is why I did

00:05:11.478 --> 00:05:14.814 align:middle line:84%
so much other research on how
to get beyond the cataclysm,

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:17.417 align:middle line:84%
because what people don't
realize is that they get blocked

00:05:17.417 --> 00:05:19.486 align:middle line:90%
or locked into that force field.

00:05:19.486 --> 00:05:22.155 align:middle line:84%
And so the reason that the
new paradigm movement is

00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:24.324 align:middle line:84%
so critical right now
and it's so important

00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:25.759 align:middle line:84%
which there's two
things that are going

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:27.927 align:middle line:84%
on that are incredibly
important,

00:05:27.927 --> 00:05:31.865 align:middle line:84%
the new paradigm movement
in terms of mental clarity

00:05:31.865 --> 00:05:36.770 align:middle line:84%
and then the healing movement
in terms of healing from trauma.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.739 align:middle line:90%
We are a post traumatic species.

00:05:39.739 --> 00:05:40.907 align:middle line:90%
Yes. We really are.

00:05:40.907 --> 00:05:42.242 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:05:42.242 --> 00:05:43.677 align:middle line:84%
And then what happens whenever
there's another cataclysm,

00:05:43.677 --> 00:05:47.947 align:middle line:84%
it just reinforces the
posttraumatic stress syndrome

00:05:47.947 --> 00:05:51.685 align:middle line:84%
which explains why 9/11
was so intense for people.

00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:54.087 align:middle line:84%
But see, the global relief,
if you're watching closely,

00:05:54.087 --> 00:05:56.556 align:middle line:84%
they keep on re-traumatizing
us-- Yes.

00:05:56.556 --> 00:05:58.591 align:middle line:84%
-- because they know that
we're going to continue

00:05:58.591 --> 00:06:01.695 align:middle line:84%
with the trauma data banks
and then we're going to be--

00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:04.531 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be unhealed
emotionally and we're going

00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:06.766 align:middle line:90%
to be basically stupid mentally.

00:06:06.766 --> 00:06:08.635 align:middle line:84%
Right. And-- There's a cap
on how far you can go--

00:06:08.635 --> 00:06:10.036 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, if your agenda is

00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:12.639 align:middle line:84%
to control people then you want
them to be emotionally trapped

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:15.375 align:middle line:84%
and you want them to not be
able to use their brains.

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:17.944 align:middle line:84%
And so, this is why the whole
new paradigm movement is

00:06:17.944 --> 00:06:19.479 align:middle line:90%
so critically important.

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:22.615 align:middle line:84%
And I know we're getting some
place because if you go down

00:06:22.615 --> 00:06:25.819 align:middle line:84%
or if you down in age with
people, the further down you go

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:28.221 align:middle line:84%
in age, the more people
know what's going on.

00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:32.525 align:middle line:84%
And, as you know in my book,
Awakening the Planetary Mind

00:06:32.525 --> 00:06:34.327 align:middle line:84%
which used to be
called Catastrophobia,

00:06:34.327 --> 00:06:36.396 align:middle line:90%
it has an incredible data of--

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:38.164 align:middle line:84%
it has incredible
footnotes at the end,

00:06:38.164 --> 00:06:40.266 align:middle line:90%
an amazing bibliography,

00:06:40.266 --> 00:06:43.169 align:middle line:84%
which is basically giving
us the last 20,000 years

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:44.604 align:middle line:90%
of human consciousness.

00:06:44.604 --> 00:06:46.773 align:middle line:84%
I have eight-year olds
and nine-year olds coming

00:06:46.773 --> 00:06:48.208 align:middle line:84%
to book signings--
Isn't that amazing?

00:06:48.208 --> 00:06:50.443 align:middle line:84%
-- who are asking me
about my footnotes.

00:06:50.443 --> 00:06:52.178 align:middle line:90%
Wow. Yeah, yeah, so I can tell.

00:06:52.178 --> 00:06:53.313 align:middle line:90%
That's very helpful.

00:06:53.313 --> 00:06:55.749 align:middle line:84%
I can tell that there
isn't a mental opening.

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:58.118 align:middle line:84%
And then let's look at
the-- for just a moment,

00:06:58.118 --> 00:07:00.253 align:middle line:84%
the whole healing movement
that's been going out on,

00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:03.189 align:middle line:84%
the whole body movement,
basically it got kicked off

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:06.559 align:middle line:84%
in 1977 when Chiron
was discovered,

00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:07.627 align:middle line:90%
the little body-- Yes.

00:07:07.627 --> 00:07:08.962 align:middle line:84%
-- that orbits between
Saturn and Uranus.

00:07:08.962 --> 00:07:09.629 align:middle line:90%
The wounded healer.

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:10.897 align:middle line:90%
The wounded healer.

00:07:10.897 --> 00:07:12.999 align:middle line:84%
And so as soon as the wounded
healer teacher came in--

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:15.034 align:middle line:84%
teaching came in,
people have been,

00:07:15.034 --> 00:07:17.804 align:middle line:84%
on that table, doing
their sessions.

00:07:17.804 --> 00:07:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I'm sure people
think they're not getting any

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.474 align:middle line:90%
place but they are.

00:07:21.474 --> 00:07:26.479 align:middle line:84%
What we're doing is we're
gradually clearing the duality,

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:29.482 align:middle line:84%
dark and light field of
the fourth dimension,

00:07:29.482 --> 00:07:32.152 align:middle line:84%
and then the fourth
dimension becomes diaphanous

00:07:32.152 --> 00:07:34.421 align:middle line:90%
which means penetrated by light.

00:07:34.421 --> 00:07:37.757 align:middle line:84%
And once the fourth dimension
becomes diaphanous then the

00:07:37.757 --> 00:07:40.827 align:middle line:84%
higher dimensions could
reach through directly to us.

00:07:40.827 --> 00:07:43.897 align:middle line:84%
It's the misreading of these
higher frequencies coming

00:07:43.897 --> 00:07:46.933 align:middle line:84%
in through the fourth
dimension that confuses people.

00:07:46.933 --> 00:07:47.867 align:middle line:90%
And of course it does.

00:07:47.867 --> 00:07:49.335 align:middle line:90%
They don't know what's going on.

00:07:49.335 --> 00:07:53.006 align:middle line:84%
Right. And just another little
recap from the last conversation

00:07:53.006 --> 00:07:55.175 align:middle line:84%
because it was so
important and this is just

00:07:55.175 --> 00:07:57.410 align:middle line:90%
so against what a lot of people

00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:59.179 align:middle line:84%
that have been expanding
consciousness

00:07:59.179 --> 00:08:03.349 align:middle line:84%
and meditating belief and
that is not only are we going

00:08:03.349 --> 00:08:05.452 align:middle line:84%
to be reaching up into
these-- in these conversation,

00:08:05.452 --> 00:08:06.853 align:middle line:90%
in these higher dimensions,

00:08:06.853 --> 00:08:09.622 align:middle line:84%
but that we are also constantly
being fed by staying connected

00:08:09.622 --> 00:08:11.991 align:middle line:84%
to the lower dimensions
which have massive amounts

00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:15.028 align:middle line:84%
of intelligence in them, the
Akashic records as you say,

00:08:15.028 --> 00:08:17.831 align:middle line:84%
and what we consider the
lower dimensional fields.

00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:19.165 align:middle line:90%
It's really being able

00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:22.502 align:middle line:84%
to vertically access both
directions,-- That's right.

00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:23.903 align:middle line:90%
-- right? Yeah, that's right.

00:08:23.903 --> 00:08:25.171 align:middle line:84%
That's what's going to keep us
in the state of balance harmony.

00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:26.306 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, and that is absolutely--

00:08:26.306 --> 00:08:28.007 align:middle line:84%
yeah, the Pleiadians of
course coming a joke,

00:08:28.007 --> 00:08:29.342 align:middle line:90%
and they always do that.

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:31.744 align:middle line:84%
[laughter] They said, "Look,
you're like an Oreo cookie,"

00:08:31.744 --> 00:08:34.147 align:middle line:84%
[laughter] and the second
dimension is one part

00:08:34.147 --> 00:08:37.249 align:middle line:84%
of the dark brown cookie and
the third dimension is the sugar

00:08:37.249 --> 00:08:37.951 align:middle line:90%
in between-- The frosting.

00:08:37.951 --> 00:08:39.185 align:middle line:90%
-- and then in the top,

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:41.220 align:middle line:84%
the fourth dimension is
the top of the Oreo cookie.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:43.289 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. So we have just to
stay in that frosting.

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:44.557 align:middle line:84%
And see, the two--
yeah, the two dimensions

00:08:44.557 --> 00:08:46.826 align:middle line:84%
that we are the most
affected by minute

00:08:46.826 --> 00:08:48.361 align:middle line:84%
by minute are the
second dimension

00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:49.629 align:middle line:90%
and the fourth dimension.

00:08:49.629 --> 00:08:52.165 align:middle line:84%
Yes. And this is pretty
important stuff because like,

00:08:52.165 --> 00:08:54.868 align:middle line:84%
for example, people are
dealing with climate change

00:08:54.868 --> 00:08:58.471 align:middle line:84%
and weather changes and tectonic
issues, earthquakes, volcanoes,

00:08:58.471 --> 00:09:00.073 align:middle line:84%
tornadoes and all
this kind of stuff,

00:09:00.073 --> 00:09:03.343 align:middle line:84%
those are all second
dimensional energetic forces.

00:09:03.343 --> 00:09:06.579 align:middle line:84%
Yes. And according to indigenous
traditions, how we're doing

00:09:06.579 --> 00:09:09.749 align:middle line:84%
with the planet depends
upon our consciousness.

00:09:09.749 --> 00:09:11.684 align:middle line:90%
Yes. This is real tricky one.

00:09:11.684 --> 00:09:15.989 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is also being proven
now in HearthMath's Institute

00:09:15.989 --> 00:09:18.758 align:middle line:84%
and some of the Global Coherence
projects they're working with.

00:09:18.758 --> 00:09:21.427 align:middle line:84%
They're looking at how
the human emotional body

00:09:21.427 --> 00:09:24.330 align:middle line:84%
in mass is affecting the
earth's emotional body.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:25.064 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:09:25.064 --> 00:09:25.765 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:09:25.765 --> 00:09:26.633 align:middle line:90%
So this is like-- Yeah.

00:09:26.633 --> 00:09:28.001 align:middle line:90%
This is isn't woo-woo.

00:09:28.001 --> 00:09:29.102 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, and those are big deals.

00:09:29.102 --> 00:09:30.703 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. They did bring
up issues like fracking

00:09:30.703 --> 00:09:32.105 align:middle line:90%
and we won't talk about today.

00:09:32.105 --> 00:09:34.774 align:middle line:84%
But there's a tremendous amount
of disturbance going on-- Yes.

00:09:34.774 --> 00:09:36.175 align:middle line:90%
-- with the second dimension.

00:09:36.175 --> 00:09:38.144 align:middle line:84%
And the more they disturb
the second dimension,

00:09:38.144 --> 00:09:39.812 align:middle line:84%
the more the third dimension
is going to be disturbed.

00:09:39.812 --> 00:09:41.648 align:middle line:84%
We didn't talk about in the
last one but I wanted to

00:09:41.648 --> 00:09:46.085 align:middle line:84%
and is it an issue as-- from
a Pleiadians' point of view,

00:09:46.085 --> 00:09:48.788 align:middle line:84%
is it an issue that we also
mine a lot of the crystal

00:09:48.788 --> 00:09:51.424 align:middle line:84%
in structure so that we
have access to crystals?

00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:52.792 align:middle line:90%
Is that a problem for the Earth?

00:09:52.792 --> 00:09:55.228 align:middle line:84%
You know, many people have
asked me that and I'm kind

00:09:55.228 --> 00:09:58.164 align:middle line:84%
of a hybrid here and I don't get
it that it's a problem at all.

00:09:58.164 --> 00:09:59.566 align:middle line:90%
Okay, good.

00:09:59.566 --> 00:10:01.534 align:middle line:84%
I get it that-- I get it that
that whole process of bringing

00:10:01.534 --> 00:10:03.937 align:middle line:84%
through jewels and
crystals and all that-- Yes.

00:10:03.937 --> 00:10:06.005 align:middle line:84%
-- is a way for us in
the third dimension

00:10:06.005 --> 00:10:07.574 align:middle line:90%
to activate our awareness-- Yes.

00:10:07.574 --> 00:10:08.708 align:middle line:90%
-- in the second dimension.

00:10:08.708 --> 00:10:10.910 align:middle line:84%
It's more about mining
the second dimension.

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:13.079 align:middle line:84%
Because the second dimension
could take some of it

00:10:13.079 --> 00:10:15.014 align:middle line:84%
but it's a matter-- it's
a matter of degrees.

00:10:15.014 --> 00:10:16.983 align:middle line:84%
Yes. And sometimes we
go overboard on that.

00:10:16.983 --> 00:10:18.051 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely.

00:10:18.051 --> 00:10:19.385 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. Okay.

00:10:19.385 --> 00:10:21.654 align:middle line:84%
So, everything you just said
about the fourth dimension,

00:10:21.654 --> 00:10:24.857 align:middle line:84%
we have to also stay connected
into the first second and third,

00:10:24.857 --> 00:10:29.062 align:middle line:84%
how do we then break into
and through into utilizing

00:10:29.062 --> 00:10:30.797 align:middle line:84%
and accessing the
fifth dimension?

00:10:30.797 --> 00:10:32.966 align:middle line:84%
And also, I want to talk
about the Pleiadians a bit

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:36.102 align:middle line:84%
who you say are the keepers
of the fifth dimension.

00:10:36.102 --> 00:10:39.639 align:middle line:84%
Right. So the issue is that we
need to harmonize our minds,

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:42.075 align:middle line:84%
balance our minds, and
balance our emotions.

00:10:42.075 --> 00:10:44.010 align:middle line:90%
And the minute we achieve that,

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:47.013 align:middle line:84%
what happens immediately is
the fifth dimension opens.

00:10:47.013 --> 00:10:49.182 align:middle line:84%
And for some people-- by
the way, some of the--

00:10:49.182 --> 00:10:51.517 align:middle line:84%
the reason they show that
canopy with the lines--

00:10:51.517 --> 00:10:56.155 align:middle line:84%
dimensional lines coming into it
is some people may just balance

00:10:56.155 --> 00:10:58.124 align:middle line:84%
their emotions or
balance their mind

00:10:58.124 --> 00:10:59.592 align:middle line:84%
and then the eighth
dimension may come in.

00:10:59.592 --> 00:11:00.893 align:middle line:90%
So one of the things that goes

00:11:00.893 --> 00:11:03.496 align:middle line:84%
on with teaching this
material is how to identify

00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:04.631 align:middle line:90%
which dimension is which,

00:11:04.631 --> 00:11:06.633 align:middle line:84%
which of course we're
going to do today.

00:11:06.633 --> 00:11:08.401 align:middle line:90%
But for a vast number of people,

00:11:08.401 --> 00:11:11.371 align:middle line:84%
as soon as they harmonize
their minds and their emotions,

00:11:11.371 --> 00:11:13.706 align:middle line:84%
then what happens is the
fifth dimension opens

00:11:13.706 --> 00:11:15.742 align:middle line:84%
and what happens
is the heart opens.

00:11:15.742 --> 00:11:19.178 align:middle line:84%
And so, the fifth dimension
is all about opening the heart

00:11:19.178 --> 00:11:20.947 align:middle line:90%
and unconditional love.

00:11:20.947 --> 00:11:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And when people, enough
people are moving into a state

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:26.419 align:middle line:84%
of unconditional love,
this is another reason

00:11:26.419 --> 00:11:29.956 align:middle line:84%
that I'm optimistic, what we
see in situation like each of--

00:11:29.956 --> 00:11:33.192 align:middle line:84%
during the Arab Spring,
I saw tremendous forces

00:11:33.192 --> 00:11:36.596 align:middle line:84%
of the heart opening going on
in Egypt, and I'm very familiar

00:11:36.596 --> 00:11:38.464 align:middle line:84%
with Egypt 'cause I
taught there a lot.

00:11:38.464 --> 00:11:40.900 align:middle line:84%
And yet, at the same
time, the thing about us

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.836 align:middle line:84%
as human is the minute we make
that kind of breakthrough,

00:11:43.836 --> 00:11:46.339 align:middle line:84%
then a lot that chaos
also accompanies it.

00:11:46.339 --> 00:11:47.240 align:middle line:90%
We can't control.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.409 align:middle line:90%
Because when the heart is open,

00:11:49.409 --> 00:11:51.344 align:middle line:84%
then what happens
is whatever there is

00:11:51.344 --> 00:11:54.013 align:middle line:84%
that isn't processed
emotionally and mentally

00:11:54.013 --> 00:11:57.050 align:middle line:84%
at that other level
starts to come forth.

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:58.418 align:middle line:90%
So one the great difficulties

00:11:58.418 --> 00:12:00.420 align:middle line:84%
of our time right
now are these times,

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:02.155 align:middle line:90%
is we're making great process

00:12:02.155 --> 00:12:04.424 align:middle line:84%
but at the same time we're
getting these force fields

00:12:04.424 --> 00:12:06.726 align:middle line:84%
coming in that are so
difficult for us to handle.

00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:07.827 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:12:07.827 --> 00:12:09.696 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. And when you're
talking about this,

00:12:09.696 --> 00:12:11.931 align:middle line:84%
this accessing the higher
dimensions through the heart,

00:12:11.931 --> 00:12:13.266 align:middle line:90%
it's striking something.

00:12:13.266 --> 00:12:15.301 align:middle line:84%
When I go into a deep meditation
where I choose to connect

00:12:15.301 --> 00:12:17.804 align:middle line:84%
with the higher mind, the
higher aspect of myself,

00:12:17.804 --> 00:12:22.275 align:middle line:84%
there is protocols or
feelings, and it's a system

00:12:22.275 --> 00:12:24.143 align:middle line:84%
that I can feel, it
doesn't take long.

00:12:24.143 --> 00:12:26.746 align:middle line:84%
It goes through, feel it here,
feel it there, this happens,

00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:30.383 align:middle line:84%
that, and it's all feeling in
the body, but then it lands

00:12:30.383 --> 00:12:33.352 align:middle line:84%
in the heart and the heart goes
in to almost an static state

00:12:33.352 --> 00:12:35.655 align:middle line:84%
like I call it little
champagne bubbles in the heart.

00:12:35.655 --> 00:12:36.756 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:38.391 align:middle line:84%
When it lands there,
that's when I understand

00:12:38.391 --> 00:12:40.026 align:middle line:84%
that the connection
has taken place.

00:12:40.026 --> 00:12:41.928 align:middle line:90%
Now does that make sense then?

00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:44.997 align:middle line:84%
It not only make sense, it was
one of the things that was hard

00:12:44.997 --> 00:12:47.433 align:middle line:84%
about this book,
hard for me to write,

00:12:47.433 --> 00:12:49.168 align:middle line:84%
is in a sense you don't
need anything more

00:12:49.168 --> 00:12:50.703 align:middle line:90%
than the awakening of the heart.

00:12:50.703 --> 00:12:53.139 align:middle line:84%
So we could do workshops
where you just connect

00:12:53.139 --> 00:12:55.308 align:middle line:84%
up the force fields of
the lower dimensions

00:12:55.308 --> 00:12:57.610 align:middle line:84%
and then process
the fourth dimension

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.579 align:middle line:84%
and then open the heart
and there you are.

00:12:59.579 --> 00:13:02.281 align:middle line:84%
But these other dimensions
are fields of higher

00:13:02.281 --> 00:13:04.851 align:middle line:84%
and higher vibratory
intelligence.

00:13:04.851 --> 00:13:08.855 align:middle line:84%
And based on what you
just said, you can go--

00:13:08.855 --> 00:13:11.023 align:middle line:84%
you can go and reversing
dimensions,

00:13:11.023 --> 00:13:13.526 align:middle line:84%
like let's just take a
minute and go through them

00:13:13.526 --> 00:13:15.795 align:middle line:84%
in one direction and back
through the other reaction

00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:17.663 align:middle line:84%
to get a sense of what
we're talking about.

00:13:17.663 --> 00:13:20.800 align:middle line:84%
The heart opens and then
when the heart opens,

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.202 align:middle line:90%
a geometrical field expands

00:13:23.202 --> 00:13:25.805 align:middle line:84%
out of the heart
and into the cosmos.

00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And so, the sixth
dimension is the field

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:30.343 align:middle line:90%
of geometrical form and shape.

00:13:30.343 --> 00:13:34.547 align:middle line:84%
Then once the geometrical shapes
and forms begin to activate--

00:13:34.547 --> 00:13:35.815 align:middle line:84%
and by the way this
is spherical.

00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:36.949 align:middle line:84%
I can't really show
it right now.

00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:38.284 align:middle line:90%
It's all spherical.

00:13:38.284 --> 00:13:42.255 align:middle line:84%
Then the next thing that happens
is sound creates geometry.

00:13:42.255 --> 00:13:44.190 align:middle line:90%
So as the geometry expands,

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:46.626 align:middle line:84%
we start to hear the
music of the spheres.

00:13:46.626 --> 00:13:49.195 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, we're
in the seventh dimension.

00:13:49.195 --> 00:13:52.698 align:middle line:84%
And then when we hear the music
of the spheres, then the music

00:13:52.698 --> 00:13:55.568 align:middle line:84%
of the spheres transmutes
into light

00:13:55.568 --> 00:13:58.204 align:middle line:84%
which is the eighth
dimension, the divine level.

00:13:58.204 --> 00:14:00.373 align:middle line:84%
And then once we move
in the divine level,

00:14:00.373 --> 00:14:03.576 align:middle line:84%
then the interesting thing the
Pleiadian teaching is the next

00:14:03.576 --> 00:14:05.845 align:middle line:84%
dimension that we
move into is time.

00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:07.280 align:middle line:90%
And we'll go back to that later.

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.382 align:middle line:84%
Which is interesting because we
also think of the third-- Yeah.

00:14:09.382 --> 00:14:11.684 align:middle line:84%
-- as the one where
we're trapped in time.

00:14:11.684 --> 00:14:12.518 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:14:12.518 --> 00:14:13.553 align:middle line:90%
But time has different values.

00:14:13.553 --> 00:14:14.587 align:middle line:84%
This is different
kind of time though.

00:14:14.587 --> 00:14:16.589 align:middle line:84%
Yes. This is evolutionary
cosmic time.

00:14:16.589 --> 00:14:18.591 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. So if we go in
the other direction,

00:14:18.591 --> 00:14:21.794 align:middle line:84%
in the ninth dimension,
whatever agendas are needed

00:14:21.794 --> 00:14:25.264 align:middle line:84%
for the evolution of the
planet come into form by means

00:14:25.264 --> 00:14:26.666 align:middle line:90%
of different time cycles.

00:14:26.666 --> 00:14:30.336 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Then they download into the
eighth dimension and they turned

00:14:30.336 --> 00:14:33.940 align:middle line:84%
into light and then the power
of the light creates the sound

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:36.375 align:middle line:84%
which is exactly the
same thing as the Bible.

00:14:36.375 --> 00:14:38.411 align:middle line:84%
The God-- the word--
you know, the word--

00:14:38.411 --> 00:14:39.478 align:middle line:90%
First there was the word, yes.

00:14:39.478 --> 00:14:42.081 align:middle line:84%
Whatever that was in
John's revelations.

00:14:42.081 --> 00:14:44.650 align:middle line:90%
Then once the sound comes in,

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:47.320 align:middle line:84%
then the sound creates
the geometry.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.722 align:middle line:84%
And then once the
geometry exists--

00:14:49.722 --> 00:14:52.425 align:middle line:84%
now this is all in relationship
by the way to the individuals.

00:14:52.425 --> 00:14:55.261 align:middle line:84%
This is in relation to
this individual's dynamic

00:14:55.261 --> 00:14:57.230 align:middle line:90%
in the third dimension.

00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:00.132 align:middle line:84%
So then the geometry
creates the structure

00:15:00.132 --> 00:15:01.834 align:middle line:90%
and force of the heart.

00:15:01.834 --> 00:15:04.904 align:middle line:84%
So what you're describing there
when you talk about meditating,

00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:07.840 align:middle line:84%
meditating and then finally the
bubbles come into the heart,

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:10.376 align:middle line:84%
I think what you're talking
about is this dissension

00:15:10.376 --> 00:15:11.811 align:middle line:84%
of energy from these
higher plains.

00:15:11.811 --> 00:15:13.613 align:middle line:84%
It feels like a-- it's a
vertical kind of integration.

00:15:13.613 --> 00:15:15.381 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and I think you have
some of kind of ability.

00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:16.816 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's got--
and what's wonderful

00:15:16.816 --> 00:15:19.518 align:middle line:84%
about this is everybody has
a different way of doing it

00:15:19.518 --> 00:15:22.021 align:middle line:84%
and this teaching is
simply about the structure

00:15:22.021 --> 00:15:24.423 align:middle line:90%
and form of dimensionality.

00:15:24.423 --> 00:15:25.992 align:middle line:84%
And so, I think what you're
doing is I think you're going

00:15:25.992 --> 00:15:29.128 align:middle line:84%
up to the higher level and
probably eighth dimension,

00:15:29.128 --> 00:15:33.299 align:middle line:84%
calling in for what's the
purpose then the purpose turns

00:15:33.299 --> 00:15:37.737 align:middle line:84%
into the activation by sound,
activation by geometry,

00:15:37.737 --> 00:15:39.438 align:middle line:90%
and then the heart awakens.

00:15:39.438 --> 00:15:41.107 align:middle line:90%
So it goes either way out there.

00:15:41.107 --> 00:15:42.508 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it goes either way.

00:15:42.508 --> 00:15:46.145 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting, you were
just talking about this whole--

00:15:46.145 --> 00:15:50.816 align:middle line:84%
the hierarchy of events that
occurs until we create form,

00:15:50.816 --> 00:15:54.553 align:middle line:84%
and this is something that
until people were exposed

00:15:54.553 --> 00:15:56.956 align:middle line:84%
to the notion of
cymatics, for example,

00:15:56.956 --> 00:15:58.925 align:middle line:84%
they didn't really get-- people
didn't get-- Couldn't see it.

00:15:58.925 --> 00:16:01.294 align:middle line:84%
-- how could sound and form be--
And then we had cymatics, yeah.

00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:02.695 align:middle line:90%
-- related.

00:16:02.695 --> 00:16:05.731 align:middle line:84%
And then you could go to YouTube
and look at videos on cymatics

00:16:05.731 --> 00:16:06.632 align:middle line:90%
which is really fascinating.

00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:07.967 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it incredible?

00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:10.202 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, to watch sound and then
watch this beautiful forms

00:16:10.202 --> 00:16:12.538 align:middle line:84%
in very fine sand
that are created

00:16:12.538 --> 00:16:14.907 align:middle line:84%
and they're always
geometrical in nature,

00:16:14.907 --> 00:16:16.842 align:middle line:90%
beautiful sacred geometry.

00:16:16.842 --> 00:16:18.945 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. And we were talking
off camera and, again,

00:16:18.945 --> 00:16:20.146 align:middle line:90%
I'll just throw this out

00:16:20.146 --> 00:16:22.548 align:middle line:84%
and then we can start
doing a linear progression

00:16:22.548 --> 00:16:25.318 align:middle line:90%
through the dimensions.

00:16:25.318 --> 00:16:27.787 align:middle line:84%
There is a microscope
that existed in the 19--

00:16:27.787 --> 00:16:30.022 align:middle line:84%
I think it's '50s, '60s
called anemoscope [phonetic]

00:16:30.022 --> 00:16:33.626 align:middle line:84%
and it was able to
magnify 3.5 million times

00:16:33.626 --> 00:16:36.028 align:middle line:84%
which in a lab they
devoted 2,000.

00:16:36.028 --> 00:16:39.131 align:middle line:84%
I mean what we see and what
is being utilized is nothing

00:16:39.131 --> 00:16:42.735 align:middle line:84%
compared to what has existed and
has been swept into the field

00:16:42.735 --> 00:16:45.604 align:middle line:84%
of black ops, use for
other military applications

00:16:45.604 --> 00:16:47.406 align:middle line:84%
but we don't get
the advantage of it.

00:16:47.406 --> 00:16:49.075 align:middle line:84%
Some of the imagery
which Steven Ross

00:16:49.075 --> 00:16:52.478 align:middle line:84%
of World Research Foundation
brought with him showed,

00:16:52.478 --> 00:16:54.780 align:middle line:84%
you could see the
way I interpreted it

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:56.816 align:middle line:90%
and it's an energetic matrix

00:16:56.816 --> 00:16:59.552 align:middle line:84%
of information flowing
around an atom.

00:16:59.552 --> 00:17:02.355 align:middle line:84%
And again, it was showing
these very same forms you're

00:17:02.355 --> 00:17:03.656 align:middle line:90%
talking about.

00:17:03.656 --> 00:17:06.993 align:middle line:84%
The information showed
up as white lines.

00:17:06.993 --> 00:17:08.361 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:17:08.361 --> 00:17:10.428 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and it was showing, in
this case, I think it was iron

00:17:10.428 --> 00:17:12.732 align:middle line:84%
but it was showing
up as hexagonal.

00:17:12.732 --> 00:17:14.867 align:middle line:84%
You get into the star
tetrahedron and the hexagon.

00:17:14.867 --> 00:17:17.470 align:middle line:90%
We're talking reality, creation.

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:18.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:19.972 align:middle line:84%
And that was just the-- And be
able to see that transformation.

00:17:19.972 --> 00:17:21.307 align:middle line:90%
-- energetic signature of it.

00:17:21.307 --> 00:17:23.641 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. So it's everywhere around
us, so it's not something

00:17:23.641 --> 00:17:26.745 align:middle line:84%
that we just say, "Oh, your
sacred geometry forms,"

00:17:26.745 --> 00:17:29.281 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to get into
it including crop circles

00:17:29.281 --> 00:17:30.249 align:middle line:90%
in a moment.

00:17:30.249 --> 00:17:31.784 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. So now, let's
go into this--

00:17:31.784 --> 00:17:34.954 align:middle line:84%
let's go into the fifth a little
further and how it's interacting

00:17:34.954 --> 00:17:38.090 align:middle line:84%
with kind of the galactic
frequencies around us even

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:41.160 align:middle line:84%
down into gamma rays and
then this one thing you wrote

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.063 align:middle line:84%
in your book I found fascinating
that the Pleiadian say

00:17:44.063 --> 00:17:47.033 align:middle line:84%
that Earth's biological life
should have been disseminated

00:17:47.033 --> 00:17:49.802 align:middle line:84%
throughout the galaxy
by December of 2012.

00:17:49.802 --> 00:17:51.470 align:middle line:90%
What does this all mean?

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:53.239 align:middle line:84%
How the gamma rays
and all this figure

00:17:53.239 --> 00:17:54.440 align:middle line:90%
in to the fifth dimension?

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.942 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the question is this
just really happening.

00:17:56.942 --> 00:17:59.478 align:middle line:84%
Yes. First question would
be is the information

00:17:59.478 --> 00:18:01.414 align:middle line:84%
on this planet being
disseminated,

00:18:01.414 --> 00:18:03.549 align:middle line:84%
and it's a very hard
question and when you look

00:18:03.549 --> 00:18:05.618 align:middle line:84%
at the condition of
things right now.

00:18:05.618 --> 00:18:09.455 align:middle line:84%
And so I actually don't--
that's a mystery in the book,

00:18:09.455 --> 00:18:10.723 align:middle line:84%
if you know what I
mean, that came true

00:18:10.723 --> 00:18:12.491 align:middle line:84%
from the Pleiadians
who said that.

00:18:12.491 --> 00:18:16.028 align:middle line:84%
However, so many of the things
they have said have turned

00:18:16.028 --> 00:18:19.365 align:middle line:84%
out to be true that I'm
kind of living my life to--

00:18:19.365 --> 00:18:22.134 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about 2013
'cause that's where we are.

00:18:22.134 --> 00:18:22.635 align:middle line:90%
Yes, please.

00:18:22.635 --> 00:18:23.836 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:18:23.836 --> 00:18:25.171 align:middle line:84%
That's goes more into the
fifth dimensional stuff.

00:18:25.171 --> 00:18:26.572 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so I'm kind of living
that principle and I'm kind

00:18:26.572 --> 00:18:28.441 align:middle line:84%
of assuming that
everything that I'm creating

00:18:28.441 --> 00:18:29.809 align:middle line:90%
and everything I'm thinking

00:18:29.809 --> 00:18:33.479 align:middle line:84%
and everything I'm doing is
I actually being disseminated

00:18:33.479 --> 00:18:35.314 align:middle line:84%
throughout the whole
universe itself.

00:18:35.314 --> 00:18:36.315 align:middle line:90%
And so, let me tell you,

00:18:36.315 --> 00:18:38.484 align:middle line:84%
I'm very careful
about what I'm doing.

00:18:38.484 --> 00:18:43.522 align:middle line:84%
And I am having some feelings
as I watch the world movie,

00:18:43.522 --> 00:18:46.559 align:middle line:84%
I'm having some feelings that
things are going out of forms.

00:18:46.559 --> 00:18:47.893 align:middle line:90%
Some of the negative things

00:18:47.893 --> 00:18:50.763 align:middle line:84%
that we're seeing are actually
I think going out of form.

00:18:50.763 --> 00:18:55.468 align:middle line:84%
Mainly because once they're
exposed, these things change.

00:18:55.468 --> 00:18:56.635 align:middle line:90%
Yes. You know what I'm saying?

00:18:56.635 --> 00:18:59.672 align:middle line:84%
Yes. So 2013 is an
absolutely fascinating time

00:18:59.672 --> 00:19:01.107 align:middle line:90%
because if that's true

00:19:01.107 --> 00:19:03.809 align:middle line:84%
and if information is really
being disseminated throughout

00:19:03.809 --> 00:19:07.246 align:middle line:84%
the universe from this
planet, then surely we're going

00:19:07.246 --> 00:19:09.448 align:middle line:84%
to have an-- we're going to
have connection with that.

00:19:09.448 --> 00:19:12.818 align:middle line:84%
You know, when information goes
out, information comes back in.

00:19:12.818 --> 00:19:14.653 align:middle line:84%
Yes. But this is a
very-- I think it's--

00:19:14.653 --> 00:19:16.789 align:middle line:84%
I really understand, I think
it's a very difficult time

00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:17.923 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:19:17.923 --> 00:19:19.358 align:middle line:84%
It's a very difficult
time and, in one hand,

00:19:19.358 --> 00:19:22.027 align:middle line:84%
it depends on which polarity
you choose to focus on.

00:19:22.027 --> 00:19:23.996 align:middle line:84%
And if I were to turn
the television on

00:19:23.996 --> 00:19:25.998 align:middle line:84%
and watch the news, I
would definitely be set

00:19:25.998 --> 00:19:28.968 align:middle line:84%
down the drain pipe of the
lower frequencies-- Yeah.

00:19:28.968 --> 00:19:31.237 align:middle line:84%
-- and total manipulation
and control.

00:19:31.237 --> 00:19:33.873 align:middle line:84%
Yes. I can't even read the
newspaper because of that.

00:19:33.873 --> 00:19:37.476 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, yeah, However, if I'm
going about my day and hooking

00:19:37.476 --> 00:19:39.879 align:middle line:84%
up with my friends and
whatnot or meditating,

00:19:39.879 --> 00:19:43.149 align:middle line:84%
I'm living in a completely
different reality as we talked

00:19:43.149 --> 00:19:45.684 align:middle line:84%
about off camera about
Sedona [phonetic],

00:19:45.684 --> 00:19:48.888 align:middle line:84%
everything is playing out
in that region in extreme.

00:19:48.888 --> 00:19:50.156 align:middle line:90%
So might we just be looking

00:19:50.156 --> 00:19:52.825 align:middle line:84%
at polarity more
than anything else?

00:19:52.825 --> 00:19:56.529 align:middle line:84%
I mean if it's just polarity,
hasn't that always been--

00:19:56.529 --> 00:20:00.065 align:middle line:90%
might it just more extreme now?

00:20:00.065 --> 00:20:05.938 align:middle line:84%
I think that polarity
is in control of us

00:20:05.938 --> 00:20:08.140 align:middle line:84%
if we don't know
what's going on.

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:09.875 align:middle line:84%
And there's this whole
issue of secrecy.

00:20:09.875 --> 00:20:12.545 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm watching, I watch
things much more than you do

00:20:12.545 --> 00:20:15.114 align:middle line:84%
because of my website and
things I need to write about.

00:20:15.114 --> 00:20:16.482 align:middle line:90%
And I-- and, you know,

00:20:16.482 --> 00:20:19.351 align:middle line:84%
I take half a day off a week
'cause I can't stand it either.

00:20:19.351 --> 00:20:23.923 align:middle line:84%
And I am seeing some signs
of secrecy being revealed.

00:20:23.923 --> 00:20:26.258 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. They're going to make it
impossible for certain things

00:20:26.258 --> 00:20:27.626 align:middle line:90%
to continue on this planet.

00:20:27.626 --> 00:20:30.429 align:middle line:84%
Yes. And I'm working on a novel
right now where I'm dealing

00:20:30.429 --> 00:20:33.299 align:middle line:84%
with the back problem
of priest sexual abuse

00:20:33.299 --> 00:20:35.134 align:middle line:84%
and how it's connected
with things

00:20:35.134 --> 00:20:36.769 align:middle line:90%
that happened 2,000 years ago.

00:20:36.769 --> 00:20:38.971 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I'm
really trying to bust some

00:20:38.971 --> 00:20:41.574 align:middle line:84%
of the bigger secrets--
I'm so excited about this.

00:20:41.574 --> 00:20:43.742 align:middle line:84%
-- because things
change like my--

00:20:43.742 --> 00:20:45.844 align:middle line:84%
I have to take my
children out of the church

00:20:45.844 --> 00:20:48.747 align:middle line:84%
because I could tell that we
had an abuser in our parish,

00:20:48.747 --> 00:20:50.983 align:middle line:84%
so I took the kids out
of the church years ago.

00:20:50.983 --> 00:20:53.786 align:middle line:84%
Nobody else knew we had
an abuser in the parish.

00:20:53.786 --> 00:20:56.455 align:middle line:84%
Right. But now 30 years later,
they do not only know what

00:20:56.455 --> 00:20:59.091 align:middle line:84%
that abuser was doing in that
parish, they know what's going

00:20:59.091 --> 00:21:00.526 align:middle line:90%
on all over the place.

00:21:00.526 --> 00:21:01.860 align:middle line:84%
You can't get away
with this stuff

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.562 align:middle line:84%
when people understand
what's going on.

00:21:03.562 --> 00:21:04.530 align:middle line:90%
You can't.

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:05.864 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I notice
as I travel,

00:21:05.864 --> 00:21:07.833 align:middle line:84%
'cause I'm on a plane a couple
of times a week, and I'm--

00:21:07.833 --> 00:21:10.636 align:middle line:84%
so I'm sitting next to all
kinds of individuals,-- Yeah.

00:21:10.636 --> 00:21:12.037 align:middle line:90%
-- is that you were talking

00:21:12.037 --> 00:21:14.974 align:middle line:84%
about is this really
being disseminated.

00:21:14.974 --> 00:21:18.310 align:middle line:84%
The way I'm seeing it
surface is through doubt.

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:20.779 align:middle line:90%
People are now saying "Hmm."

00:21:20.779 --> 00:21:22.114 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:21:22.114 --> 00:21:23.849 align:middle line:84%
They're hearing things and
say, "I don't know about that."

00:21:23.849 --> 00:21:24.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's true.

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:25.884 align:middle line:90%
That's huge.

00:21:25.884 --> 00:21:28.754 align:middle line:84%
That's an evolutionary
leap in consciousness just

00:21:28.754 --> 00:21:30.456 align:middle line:90%
to begin doubting the story.

00:21:30.456 --> 00:21:31.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:34.293 align:middle line:84%
And then another way
that reality is--

00:21:34.293 --> 00:21:36.428 align:middle line:84%
we could go on about
this all day.

00:21:36.428 --> 00:21:38.998 align:middle line:84%
But another thing that's
happening is great big symbols

00:21:38.998 --> 00:21:41.033 align:middle line:84%
are being thrown at
us at this point.

00:21:41.033 --> 00:21:43.302 align:middle line:84%
For example, the
Boston Marathon.

00:21:43.302 --> 00:21:46.572 align:middle line:84%
The people who commit--
who did that may not have--

00:21:46.572 --> 00:21:49.241 align:middle line:84%
they, I think, probably just
thought they were hitting a

00:21:49.241 --> 00:21:53.445 align:middle line:84%
crowded event, just a
crowd, but just the thought

00:21:53.445 --> 00:21:55.581 align:middle line:84%
of runners' legs
being blown off.

00:21:55.581 --> 00:21:59.151 align:middle line:84%
Now, these symbols are
huge and I see signs

00:21:59.151 --> 00:22:01.553 align:middle line:84%
that people are really
learning from these things.

00:22:01.553 --> 00:22:03.355 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like it's
hitting you so hard

00:22:03.355 --> 00:22:04.723 align:middle line:90%
in the face and you cannot see.

00:22:04.723 --> 00:22:06.458 align:middle line:84%
[Inaudible] sacrificial lambs
in a way-- Yeah, it's only--

00:22:06.458 --> 00:22:07.826 align:middle line:84%
[Multiple Speakers] --
the larger learning.

00:22:07.826 --> 00:22:09.228 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. Yeah.

00:22:09.228 --> 00:22:11.730 align:middle line:84%
So that's why it's so difficult
for those who are at that point

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:15.367 align:middle line:84%
where truth is exposed and
it's important for people

00:22:15.367 --> 00:22:18.971 align:middle line:84%
to be really angry and object
and do whatever they can.

00:22:18.971 --> 00:22:21.240 align:middle line:84%
We all have our own way of
[inaudible] great change.

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:24.376 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Okay, let's talk about
what the Pleiadians also say

00:22:24.376 --> 00:22:26.445 align:middle line:84%
about energy and
orgasmic energy.

00:22:26.445 --> 00:22:27.413 align:middle line:90%
I love this part-- Yeah.

00:22:27.413 --> 00:22:28.681 align:middle line:84%
-- because you say,
they're saucy.

00:22:28.681 --> 00:22:30.549 align:middle line:84%
They like to-- Yeah, well
they are really saucy.

00:22:30.549 --> 00:22:31.650 align:middle line:90%
They are. Yeah, yeah.

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:33.585 align:middle line:84%
They like to live and
they like to-- Yeah.

00:22:33.585 --> 00:22:35.821 align:middle line:84%
They like to be and
they like to-- Yeah.

00:22:35.821 --> 00:22:39.158 align:middle line:84%
I mean sex is a big part of
it and that sexual expression.

00:22:39.158 --> 00:22:41.660 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. But let's talk about
what they meant when it says

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:44.997 align:middle line:84%
that the-- and the Mayans
which are the deep connection

00:22:44.997 --> 00:22:49.134 align:middle line:84%
of Pleiadians said human orgasms
move the galactic center.

00:22:49.134 --> 00:22:49.902 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. What does that mean?

00:22:49.902 --> 00:22:51.003 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's great because--

00:22:51.003 --> 00:22:52.438 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
fifth dimensional sex.

00:22:52.438 --> 00:22:53.639 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's great
because I've been--

00:22:53.639 --> 00:22:56.809 align:middle line:84%
that certainly made my
orgasms more useful.

00:22:56.809 --> 00:23:00.312 align:middle line:84%
[laughter] But [inaudible]
that and how delightful,

00:23:00.312 --> 00:23:02.247 align:middle line:84%
and of course these
are Pleiadians.

00:23:02.247 --> 00:23:05.451 align:middle line:84%
Yes. But the other side of
it is think of Wilhelm Reich.

00:23:05.451 --> 00:23:08.253 align:middle line:84%
Yes. And think of the issue
of organ energy and speaking

00:23:08.253 --> 00:23:10.889 align:middle line:84%
of another scientist who got
shut down by the government.

00:23:10.889 --> 00:23:11.724 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:23:11.724 --> 00:23:13.592 align:middle line:90%
Wilhelm Reich was really going

00:23:13.592 --> 00:23:17.563 align:middle line:84%
after how the central
orgasmic life force

00:23:17.563 --> 00:23:20.866 align:middle line:84%
in our dimension is actually
affecting the whole universe.

00:23:20.866 --> 00:23:22.468 align:middle line:90%
And so, for my perspective,

00:23:22.468 --> 00:23:27.673 align:middle line:84%
it would affect every dimension
that-- the human orgasmic force.

00:23:27.673 --> 00:23:30.109 align:middle line:84%
And this was-- this
is very important

00:23:30.109 --> 00:23:31.477 align:middle line:84%
because that's the
kind of energy

00:23:31.477 --> 00:23:33.512 align:middle line:90%
that moves the cosmos itself.

00:23:33.512 --> 00:23:34.513 align:middle line:90%
And we have a choice.

00:23:34.513 --> 00:23:35.647 align:middle line:90%
Are we going to be dead?

00:23:35.647 --> 00:23:37.349 align:middle line:84%
I mean look at how many
people who are just dead

00:23:37.349 --> 00:23:39.118 align:middle line:84%
in their bodies in
the third dimension.

00:23:39.118 --> 00:23:41.520 align:middle line:84%
Oh yeah. Drugs and
[inaudible] and so on

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.288 align:middle line:90%
and so forth, unfortunately.

00:23:43.288 --> 00:23:44.823 align:middle line:90%
And we have a choice about that.

00:23:44.823 --> 00:23:46.125 align:middle line:90%
We're here to be alive.

00:23:46.125 --> 00:23:47.626 align:middle line:90%
We're here to have orgasms.

00:23:47.626 --> 00:23:49.728 align:middle line:84%
And we're here to
move to universe.

00:23:49.728 --> 00:23:51.096 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:23:51.096 --> 00:23:53.432 align:middle line:84%
And so-- and you can-- when
you're just speaking about it,

00:23:53.432 --> 00:23:56.735 align:middle line:84%
a person, anyone who's
had an orgasm can feel

00:23:56.735 --> 00:23:58.303 align:middle line:90%
that this is a quality of energy

00:23:58.303 --> 00:24:00.973 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't happen
really any other way.

00:24:00.973 --> 00:24:03.542 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Subtler feelings that are
very similar can happen-- Yeah.

00:24:03.542 --> 00:24:06.845 align:middle line:84%
-- even in meditation, music,
dance, ecstasy can happen,

00:24:06.845 --> 00:24:10.082 align:middle line:84%
but that's so intensely
specific.

00:24:10.082 --> 00:24:12.084 align:middle line:84%
And then from the point
of view of my system,

00:24:12.084 --> 00:24:13.352 align:middle line:90%
the reason why it's different

00:24:13.352 --> 00:24:16.255 align:middle line:84%
than anything else is I think
it's our greatest access

00:24:16.255 --> 00:24:18.757 align:middle line:84%
to the second dimensional
forces.

00:24:18.757 --> 00:24:20.159 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:24:20.159 --> 00:24:21.460 align:middle line:84%
'Cause I mean I'll be-- okay,
I've been married for 40 years,

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:22.494 align:middle line:90%
I can say it on the show.

00:24:22.494 --> 00:24:23.829 align:middle line:90%
[laughs] I think yes you can.

00:24:23.829 --> 00:24:27.366 align:middle line:84%
When I have a orgasms, I
see green organic light.

00:24:27.366 --> 00:24:30.269 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's green
like plant-like

00:24:30.269 --> 00:24:34.406 align:middle line:84%
and it has yellow light in it,
and it's very, very vibrant

00:24:34.406 --> 00:24:37.109 align:middle line:84%
and I could tell that it's
a biological force that's

00:24:37.109 --> 00:24:38.744 align:middle line:90%
in the second dimension.

00:24:38.744 --> 00:24:40.712 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
what keeps us alive

00:24:40.712 --> 00:24:42.114 align:middle line:90%
and it's what keeps us healthy.

00:24:42.114 --> 00:24:44.183 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you've given us a
little bit of homework.

00:24:44.183 --> 00:24:46.785 align:middle line:84%
Next time we have an orgasm,
try to relax and pay attention

00:24:46.785 --> 00:24:48.320 align:middle line:84%
to the colors that
is swirling about.

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.555 align:middle line:90%
No, I see colors too.

00:24:49.555 --> 00:24:51.590 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. But I when I see that
incredible green-- Yeah.

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:54.560 align:middle line:84%
-- green orga-- and I think
it's a whole Celtic tradition

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:55.394 align:middle line:90%
of the green man.

00:24:55.394 --> 00:24:56.161 align:middle line:90%
Yes. Yeah.

00:24:56.161 --> 00:24:57.563 align:middle line:90%
I think it's [inaudible].

00:24:57.563 --> 00:25:00.199 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the energy is
actually coming from partner.

00:25:00.199 --> 00:25:00.799 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:25:00.799 --> 00:25:01.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:03.135 align:middle line:84%
And we can't get anymore
specific than that.

00:25:03.135 --> 00:25:04.703 align:middle line:84%
Now, we think anymore
specific from that.

00:25:04.703 --> 00:25:06.438 align:middle line:84%
Okay, I just wanted to-- We'll
do a section of it some time.

00:25:06.438 --> 00:25:08.207 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to
throw that out there.

00:25:08.207 --> 00:25:12.444 align:middle line:84%
The sacred teachers accessing
higher dimensions of love,

00:25:12.444 --> 00:25:13.846 align:middle line:84%
we just spoke about
that a little bit.

00:25:13.846 --> 00:25:16.281 align:middle line:84%
And then I wanted to go into the
some of the Earth energy parts

00:25:16.281 --> 00:25:18.717 align:middle line:84%
of it and the connection
between the fifth dimension

00:25:18.717 --> 00:25:20.752 align:middle line:84%
and these Earth energies
through geometry,

00:25:20.752 --> 00:25:23.822 align:middle line:84%
i.e. labyrinths,
which are ancient.

00:25:23.822 --> 00:25:25.657 align:middle line:84%
There are labyrinths
all over the planet.

00:25:25.657 --> 00:25:27.359 align:middle line:90%
What are labyrinths doing?

00:25:27.359 --> 00:25:28.527 align:middle line:90%
Well, one of the fun things

00:25:28.527 --> 00:25:30.529 align:middle line:84%
about researching
'cause this was the res--

00:25:30.529 --> 00:25:31.797 align:middle line:90%
I mean it's so outrageous

00:25:31.797 --> 00:25:34.032 align:middle line:84%
to scientifically research
[inaudible] channel book.

00:25:34.032 --> 00:25:35.467 align:middle line:90%
So another thing I need-- Yes.

00:25:35.467 --> 00:25:37.836 align:middle line:84%
-- another thing I did
that's completely out of line

00:25:37.836 --> 00:25:40.372 align:middle line:84%
from some people's point
of view is I assumed

00:25:40.372 --> 00:25:44.076 align:middle line:84%
that ancient science, labyrinths
or megalithic science,

00:25:44.076 --> 00:25:47.279 align:middle line:84%
I assumed that ancient
science was as scientific

00:25:47.279 --> 00:25:50.015 align:middle line:84%
as modern science, and I
believe that and I think

00:25:50.015 --> 00:25:52.017 align:middle line:84%
that people are really
missing to boat

00:25:52.017 --> 00:25:54.253 align:middle line:84%
when they don't look
for ancient science.

00:25:54.253 --> 00:25:59.224 align:middle line:84%
For example, the sixth dimension
is working with sacred geometry

00:25:59.224 --> 00:26:02.494 align:middle line:84%
and then sacred geometry, as it
moves into the fifth dimension,

00:26:02.494 --> 00:26:04.830 align:middle line:84%
it moves into the
platonic solids

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:08.867 align:middle line:84%
and the five platonic solids are
a great mystery on our planet

00:26:08.867 --> 00:26:11.570 align:middle line:84%
because the platonic solids
have actually been known.

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:15.007 align:middle line:84%
We know this from archeology for
10,000-- at least 10,000 years,

00:26:15.007 --> 00:26:18.610 align:middle line:84%
the oldest ones we've
ever found or 8,000 BC.

00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:23.549 align:middle line:84%
And so, the platonic
solids are a key to an or--

00:26:23.549 --> 00:26:25.951 align:middle line:90%
kind of an organic geometry.

00:26:25.951 --> 00:26:27.586 align:middle line:84%
And so, somebody is
making a whole lot

00:26:27.586 --> 00:26:29.788 align:middle line:84%
of money off this right
now because a group

00:26:29.788 --> 00:26:32.925 align:middle line:84%
of Japanese scientist back
around-- and this is--

00:26:32.925 --> 00:26:35.127 align:middle line:84%
all this stuff is
referenced in alchemy.

00:26:35.127 --> 00:26:38.096 align:middle line:90%
Right around 1998 and 1999,

00:26:38.096 --> 00:26:40.999 align:middle line:84%
they created a completely
new chemistry based

00:26:40.999 --> 00:26:42.734 align:middle line:90%
on the platonic solids.

00:26:42.734 --> 00:26:45.671 align:middle line:84%
In other words, instead of
using normal geometrical forms

00:26:45.671 --> 00:26:49.474 align:middle line:84%
for working with chemistry,
they used the platonic solids

00:26:49.474 --> 00:26:51.176 align:middle line:90%
which are more organic.

00:26:51.176 --> 00:26:53.879 align:middle line:84%
And so, there's just
tremendous owned information

00:26:53.879 --> 00:26:55.480 align:middle line:90%
in these fields.

00:26:55.480 --> 00:27:00.252 align:middle line:84%
Now, you had mentioned where
we're going to go into platonia

00:27:00.252 --> 00:27:03.922 align:middle line:84%
but also in this, in the
same area of your book,

00:27:03.922 --> 00:27:07.225 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about how
this relates to mists

00:27:07.225 --> 00:27:09.795 align:middle line:90%
and paths and time capsules.

00:27:09.795 --> 00:27:11.196 align:middle line:90%
How does that all come together?

00:27:11.196 --> 00:27:13.732 align:middle line:84%
Well that's a very good leap on
your part Virginia [phonetic]

00:27:13.732 --> 00:27:15.667 align:middle line:84%
because you asked
about labyrinths.

00:27:15.667 --> 00:27:20.339 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Well, labyrinths are
an ancient coded form made

00:27:20.339 --> 00:27:23.108 align:middle line:84%
by megalithic people,
probably older, at least back

00:27:23.108 --> 00:27:25.577 align:middle line:84%
to megalithic times, where
they would take like, say,

00:27:25.577 --> 00:27:28.580 align:middle line:84%
there's a slight rise in a
hill and then they would take

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:31.149 align:middle line:84%
that rise on the hill and
they would create a labyrinth

00:27:31.149 --> 00:27:34.219 align:middle line:84%
on the top of that hill or maybe
on a rock wall or whatever,

00:27:34.219 --> 00:27:37.055 align:middle line:84%
and what the labyrinths are
doing is the labyrinths are

00:27:37.055 --> 00:27:42.027 align:middle line:84%
actually pulling the sixth
dimensional fields and forms

00:27:42.027 --> 00:27:43.929 align:middle line:90%
into the fifth dimension.

00:27:43.929 --> 00:27:45.097 align:middle line:90%
That's what they do.

00:27:45.097 --> 00:27:47.799 align:middle line:84%
So when you walk in one,
what happens for you--

00:27:47.799 --> 00:27:48.967 align:middle line:90%
and I love labyrinths.

00:27:48.967 --> 00:27:50.435 align:middle line:90%
What happens for you at--

00:27:50.435 --> 00:27:53.338 align:middle line:84%
the heart opens because that
the labyrinth is a system

00:27:53.338 --> 00:27:54.873 align:middle line:90%
that takes you into the heart.

00:27:54.873 --> 00:27:56.375 align:middle line:90%
That as your heart is opening

00:27:56.375 --> 00:27:58.810 align:middle line:84%
and you're walking the various
stages of the labyrinth,

00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:01.279 align:middle line:84%
the sixth dimensional
geometrical fields are being

00:28:01.279 --> 00:28:03.515 align:middle line:84%
pulled in to the
labyrinths itself.

00:28:03.515 --> 00:28:07.619 align:middle line:84%
And so, 5, 6,000 years ago, they
have them all over the place

00:28:07.619 --> 00:28:10.355 align:middle line:84%
because they knew that
they needed those in order

00:28:10.355 --> 00:28:12.124 align:middle line:90%
to anchor the sixth dimension.

00:28:12.124 --> 00:28:14.026 align:middle line:84%
And so, can we move
to the six dimension?

00:28:14.026 --> 00:28:14.993 align:middle line:84%
Yes, let's go right-- We
may go back to the fifth.

00:28:14.993 --> 00:28:15.961 align:middle line:90%
No, let's go there now.

00:28:15.961 --> 00:28:17.229 align:middle line:84%
But if we go to the
sixth dimension,

00:28:17.229 --> 00:28:18.930 align:middle line:84%
the point would be
why would anybody want

00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:22.134 align:middle line:84%
to anchor the six dimension in--
well, when you're anchoring it

00:28:22.134 --> 00:28:24.536 align:middle line:84%
in through the heart of
an individual walking

00:28:24.536 --> 00:28:27.773 align:middle line:84%
in a labyrinth, you're actually
bringing into third dimension.

00:28:27.773 --> 00:28:31.143 align:middle line:84%
So much of ancient
megalithic and Egyptian,

00:28:31.143 --> 00:28:34.646 align:middle line:84%
much of the ancient sacred
systems were involved

00:28:34.646 --> 00:28:36.948 align:middle line:84%
with anchoring the
sixth dimension

00:28:36.948 --> 00:28:39.751 align:middle line:84%
into the third dimension
as much as possible.

00:28:39.751 --> 00:28:43.021 align:middle line:84%
So the reason they built temples
and labyrinths and all that was

00:28:43.021 --> 00:28:46.158 align:middle line:84%
to anchor the sixth dimension
into the third dimension.

00:28:46.158 --> 00:28:48.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, the reason that
they were doing this is

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:50.062 align:middle line:90%
because they knew something

00:28:50.062 --> 00:28:52.297 align:middle line:84%
that we're fortunately
remembering again,

00:28:52.297 --> 00:28:54.800 align:middle line:84%
regardless of how much
science tries to stop us

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:56.401 align:middle line:90%
from getting where we're going.

00:28:56.401 --> 00:28:59.171 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
individuals are doing.

00:28:59.171 --> 00:29:03.709 align:middle line:84%
Individuals have discovered that
if you do yoga, sacred dance,

00:29:03.709 --> 00:29:07.913 align:middle line:84%
tai chi, any of these forms of
body movement that are based

00:29:07.913 --> 00:29:10.348 align:middle line:90%
on geometrical balance,

00:29:10.348 --> 00:29:13.885 align:middle line:84%
what's happening is you are
pulling your sixth dimensional

00:29:13.885 --> 00:29:17.355 align:middle line:90%
ideal form into your body.

00:29:17.355 --> 00:29:19.624 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that
you need to do this is

00:29:19.624 --> 00:29:23.729 align:middle line:84%
that if you can keep your
third dimensional form aligned

00:29:23.729 --> 00:29:26.865 align:middle line:84%
with your sixth dimensional
ideal form, you don't have aches

00:29:26.865 --> 00:29:28.633 align:middle line:84%
and pains, you don't
get arthritis,

00:29:28.633 --> 00:29:32.137 align:middle line:84%
your face doesn't fall off of
the front of you, you continue

00:29:32.137 --> 00:29:36.041 align:middle line:84%
to look like an integral
balanced geometrical human.

00:29:36.041 --> 00:29:39.945 align:middle line:84%
And in the ancient times,
people did that intentionally,

00:29:39.945 --> 00:29:42.314 align:middle line:84%
so they created temples
and sacred sites

00:29:42.314 --> 00:29:44.750 align:middle line:84%
and people would go there
to realign themselves,

00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:46.318 align:middle line:90%
but we're not missing anything.

00:29:46.318 --> 00:29:47.018 align:middle line:90%
We've got yoga.

00:29:47.018 --> 00:29:48.086 align:middle line:90%
We've got tai chi.

00:29:48.086 --> 00:29:50.122 align:middle line:84%
We've got whatever
system we like to use.

00:29:50.122 --> 00:29:52.290 align:middle line:90%
That's a beautiful concept.

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:54.726 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so then as we getting
into this higher dimensions,

00:29:54.726 --> 00:29:58.396 align:middle line:84%
what's really fun is that
the most important aspect

00:29:58.396 --> 00:30:01.333 align:middle line:84%
of those dimensions is how
did they affect us in 3D?

00:30:01.333 --> 00:30:02.634 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:30:02.634 --> 00:30:04.803 align:middle line:84%
So back to that person on
the table, that person lying

00:30:04.803 --> 00:30:07.506 align:middle line:84%
on that table activated
by the lower dimensions.

00:30:07.506 --> 00:30:12.277 align:middle line:84%
If that person's heart is open,
all of your emotional complexes

00:30:12.277 --> 00:30:14.079 align:middle line:90%
and all of your fears and all

00:30:14.079 --> 00:30:16.214 align:middle line:84%
of your difficulties
disappear, don't they?

00:30:16.214 --> 00:30:19.451 align:middle line:84%
The opening of the heart
melts the fear-- Absolutely.

00:30:19.451 --> 00:30:22.487 align:middle line:84%
-- and melts the--
and it's just easier

00:30:22.487 --> 00:30:24.956 align:middle line:84%
than constantly processing
in the fourth dimension,

00:30:24.956 --> 00:30:26.491 align:middle line:90%
although we sometimes have to.

00:30:26.491 --> 00:30:27.759 align:middle line:90%
Right. Yeah.

00:30:27.759 --> 00:30:31.196 align:middle line:84%
So the-- so one form of
processing ourselves in order

00:30:31.196 --> 00:30:35.500 align:middle line:84%
to move to the higher
frequencies is by doing work

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:39.371 align:middle line:84%
on the table and an
intellectual work and,

00:30:39.371 --> 00:30:41.173 align:middle line:90%
you know, psychological work.

00:30:41.173 --> 00:30:45.076 align:middle line:84%
But then in the sixth dimension,
it is a-- and this so important.

00:30:45.076 --> 00:30:49.714 align:middle line:84%
It is a conscious intention to
maintain your beautiful being

00:30:49.714 --> 00:30:52.984 align:middle line:84%
in the sixth dimension,
clearly in the third dimension.

00:30:52.984 --> 00:30:55.387 align:middle line:84%
And so, that's why
you do yoga everyday

00:30:55.387 --> 00:30:58.323 align:middle line:84%
and that's why you take a walk,
I mean, if you're not grounded

00:30:58.323 --> 00:31:00.192 align:middle line:84%
or that's why you do
tai chi when you got--

00:31:00.192 --> 00:31:02.494 align:middle line:84%
want to get in touch
with those frequencies.

00:31:02.494 --> 00:31:03.595 align:middle line:90%
[Multiple Speaker] Yeah.

00:31:03.595 --> 00:31:06.565 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Okay now, let's
talk about--

00:31:06.565 --> 00:31:09.301 align:middle line:84%
we bought up the Platonic
solids a moment ago.

00:31:09.301 --> 00:31:13.805 align:middle line:84%
So, what is Platonia and how
does Platonia factor in here?

00:31:13.805 --> 00:31:16.708 align:middle line:84%
This is my favorite part of
Alchemy of Nine Dimensions.

00:31:16.708 --> 00:31:19.644 align:middle line:84%
Okay, when I was-- and I
remember, go back to me

00:31:19.644 --> 00:31:23.014 align:middle line:90%
from like 1996 through 2003.

00:31:23.014 --> 00:31:25.684 align:middle line:84%
I'm out teaching
workshops about material

00:31:25.684 --> 00:31:28.153 align:middle line:90%
that I don't understand myself.

00:31:28.153 --> 00:31:31.022 align:middle line:84%
Right. [Multiple Speaker] I'm
reading, studying, I'm searching

00:31:31.022 --> 00:31:32.724 align:middle line:90%
and [inaudible] anyway.

00:31:32.724 --> 00:31:38.163 align:middle line:84%
Okay, so in 1998, a book was
published called The End of Time

00:31:38.163 --> 00:31:41.800 align:middle line:84%
by Julian Barbour who
was an English physicist.

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:44.836 align:middle line:84%
So, I thought, "Oh okay, the
ninth dimension is time."

00:31:44.836 --> 00:31:46.705 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, when we get
to the ninth dimensions,

00:31:46.705 --> 00:31:49.374 align:middle line:84%
I didn't understand the
ninth dimensions until 2010.

00:31:49.374 --> 00:31:51.443 align:middle line:84%
And the reason this
book came out is an--

00:31:51.443 --> 00:31:53.879 align:middle line:84%
in a new edition is I finally
got the one dimension I

00:31:53.879 --> 00:31:54.980 align:middle line:90%
didn't have.

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:57.582 align:middle line:84%
But since I knew the
ninth dimension was time

00:31:57.582 --> 00:32:00.585 align:middle line:84%
because a Pleiadian said it
was then anything I could read

00:32:00.585 --> 00:32:03.388 align:middle line:84%
on time is-- I bought it
and read it, studied it.

00:32:03.388 --> 00:32:06.057 align:middle line:84%
So, I bought The End of
Time by Julian Barbour,

00:32:06.057 --> 00:32:09.361 align:middle line:84%
a book I highly recommend and
I had to read it three times

00:32:09.361 --> 00:32:10.996 align:middle line:84%
in order to understand
it so I want it more.

00:32:10.996 --> 00:32:13.565 align:middle line:84%
And this is physics
and physics is a real.

00:32:13.565 --> 00:32:16.234 align:middle line:84%
[Multiple Speaker] Physics
is a very big struggle for me

00:32:16.234 --> 00:32:19.938 align:middle line:84%
but Julian Barbour comes
along and he says, "Look,

00:32:19.938 --> 00:32:22.674 align:middle line:84%
we've thrown the baby
out at the bath water."

00:32:22.674 --> 00:32:24.442 align:middle line:90%
And what he said was he said,

00:32:24.442 --> 00:32:27.112 align:middle line:84%
"When we discovered
Quantum mechanics,

00:32:27.112 --> 00:32:30.849 align:middle line:84%
what happened was
everybody started thinking

00:32:30.849 --> 00:32:33.184 align:middle line:84%
that the older sciences
that we were working

00:32:33.184 --> 00:32:35.287 align:middle line:90%
with didn't apply anymore."

00:32:35.287 --> 00:32:37.155 align:middle line:90%
And so he said specifically,

00:32:37.155 --> 00:32:40.725 align:middle line:84%
"Until we discovered
Quantum mechanics,

00:32:40.725 --> 00:32:45.030 align:middle line:84%
we believed that we live
in a universe that had Form

00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:48.400 align:middle line:84%
in another dimension and
the reason that the Form was

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:50.869 align:middle line:84%
in another dimension," of course
this is the sixth dimension

00:32:50.869 --> 00:32:53.038 align:middle line:84%
and I corresponded with
him but didn't hear back

00:32:53.038 --> 00:32:55.640 align:middle line:84%
from 'cause he was
older but this is Plato.

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:59.711 align:middle line:84%
He calls it Platonia because he
says, "There is this dimension

00:32:59.711 --> 00:33:03.048 align:middle line:84%
where all the Forms exist
and then the Forms replicate

00:33:03.048 --> 00:33:04.582 align:middle line:90%
in the third dimension."

00:33:04.582 --> 00:33:08.119 align:middle line:84%
And until Quantum mechanics was
discovered, everybody believes

00:33:08.119 --> 00:33:12.057 align:middle line:84%
that and when Quantum mechanics
came in an early 19th century,

00:33:12.057 --> 00:33:13.692 align:middle line:90%
it was such a huge revolution

00:33:13.692 --> 00:33:15.527 align:middle line:84%
and such an incredible
discovery.

00:33:15.527 --> 00:33:16.995 align:middle line:84%
People throw it out
and they said,

00:33:16.995 --> 00:33:18.163 align:middle line:90%
"Okay, there's none of that.

00:33:18.163 --> 00:33:19.965 align:middle line:84%
No Forms in other
dimensions, you knew that."

00:33:19.965 --> 00:33:23.034 align:middle line:84%
And Rupert Sheldrake came
along and he tried to say,

00:33:23.034 --> 00:33:25.303 align:middle line:84%
"Wait a minute, there are
more of the genetic fields,

00:33:25.303 --> 00:33:28.139 align:middle line:84%
the reason biology exist on
this planet is 'cause there

00:33:28.139 --> 00:33:29.541 align:middle line:90%
were Forms."

00:33:29.541 --> 00:33:31.943 align:middle line:84%
Yes. But Rupert Sheldrake as we
know we couldn't get anywhere

00:33:31.943 --> 00:33:33.011 align:middle line:90%
in conventional science.

00:33:33.011 --> 00:33:34.112 align:middle line:90%
No, he can't.

00:33:34.112 --> 00:33:35.513 align:middle line:84%
Even in England, they
still won't listen.

00:33:35.513 --> 00:33:37.115 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so Julian Barbour is the
one who created the breakthrough

00:33:37.115 --> 00:33:39.851 align:middle line:84%
and by the way, Julian
Barbour has just strong physics

00:33:39.851 --> 00:33:41.953 align:middle line:90%
on its ass at this point.

00:33:41.953 --> 00:33:45.557 align:middle line:84%
Nothing is going on in physics
right basically except some

00:33:45.557 --> 00:33:48.493 align:middle line:84%
research with string theory
because they're still trying

00:33:48.493 --> 00:33:52.197 align:middle line:84%
to integrate the fact
that Julian Barbour proved

00:33:52.197 --> 00:33:54.532 align:middle line:84%
that Forms exist in
another dimension.

00:33:54.532 --> 00:33:57.168 align:middle line:84%
Now, he does not say, like
I say, the sixth dimensions,

00:33:57.168 --> 00:33:59.471 align:middle line:84%
it's not about my
system, it's about him.

00:33:59.471 --> 00:34:03.208 align:middle line:84%
In order to prove that
there was a World of Forms

00:34:03.208 --> 00:34:07.211 align:middle line:84%
in a non-physical dimension,
the calculation is physical--

00:34:07.211 --> 00:34:11.916 align:middle line:84%
physics calculations that he
had to do would be hundreds

00:34:11.916 --> 00:34:16.254 align:middle line:84%
of miles long just to prove
the Triangle Land exist.

00:34:16.254 --> 00:34:20.557 align:middle line:84%
What he did was he came, he
proved with physics calculations

00:34:20.557 --> 00:34:24.729 align:middle line:84%
that Triangle Land exist
which was a proof of a Form

00:34:24.729 --> 00:34:25.697 align:middle line:90%
in another dimensions.

00:34:25.697 --> 00:34:28.033 align:middle line:84%
What you used underneath
the-- Yeah.

00:34:28.033 --> 00:34:29.401 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yeah.

00:34:29.401 --> 00:34:31.836 align:middle line:84%
And then what he said is he
said, "Look, it took, you know,

00:34:31.836 --> 00:34:33.537 align:middle line:90%
40 miles to do Triangle Land.

00:34:33.537 --> 00:34:35.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to do
Quadrangle Land, I'm not going

00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:36.941 align:middle line:84%
to do the other ones,
that's enough."

00:34:36.941 --> 00:34:39.711 align:middle line:84%
And he's right about
that but the reason

00:34:39.711 --> 00:34:45.883 align:middle line:84%
that his book is just incredibly
mentally unbelievable is

00:34:45.883 --> 00:34:48.153 align:middle line:84%
when he took a leaf and
because he took this leaf,

00:34:48.153 --> 00:34:50.555 align:middle line:84%
they're trying to ignore him
but they won't get away with it.

00:34:50.555 --> 00:34:54.559 align:middle line:84%
The leaf the he took is he said,
"Okay, there's consciousness

00:34:54.559 --> 00:34:56.628 align:middle line:90%
in that World of Forms.

00:34:56.628 --> 00:35:01.199 align:middle line:84%
There is a relationship to what
we're doing in our dimension."

00:35:01.199 --> 00:35:04.335 align:middle line:84%
And so what he said is he
said, "If we're excited

00:35:04.335 --> 00:35:07.472 align:middle line:84%
about something in our
dimension, then in the triangle

00:35:07.472 --> 00:35:10.108 align:middle line:84%
in Triangle Land,
the mist rises."

00:35:10.108 --> 00:35:13.511 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "And if we're
bored, the mist goes down."

00:35:13.511 --> 00:35:16.748 align:middle line:84%
So at that point, the Pleiadians
came in screaming saying,

00:35:16.748 --> 00:35:19.451 align:middle line:84%
"Oh the mist in Platonia
is going

00:35:19.451 --> 00:35:21.619 align:middle line:84%
down for the Roman
Catholic Church."

00:35:21.619 --> 00:35:25.824 align:middle line:84%
Which the Pleiadians hate
the Roman Catholic Church.

00:35:25.824 --> 00:35:27.292 align:middle line:84%
[Multiple Speaker] But,
the idea is it's very,

00:35:27.292 --> 00:35:29.561 align:middle line:84%
very significant
idea which would be

00:35:29.561 --> 00:35:30.862 align:middle line:90%
that what we're thinking

00:35:30.862 --> 00:35:34.699 align:middle line:84%
about in this dimension is
what's making that mist rise

00:35:34.699 --> 00:35:36.401 align:middle line:90%
in that World of Forms.

00:35:36.401 --> 00:35:40.038 align:middle line:84%
So, in other words we change
what happens in the World

00:35:40.038 --> 00:35:43.475 align:middle line:84%
of Forms, and the World of
Forms is what creates our world.

00:35:43.475 --> 00:35:46.177 align:middle line:84%
Yes. We change it by what we're
thinking about and this is

00:35:46.177 --> 00:35:48.113 align:middle line:84%
by far-- And what we're
enthusiastic about.

00:35:48.113 --> 00:35:49.380 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, well yeah because
you don't--

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:50.615 align:middle line:90%
let's face it, you're not going

00:35:50.615 --> 00:35:52.617 align:middle line:84%
to read a difficult book
unless you're enthusiastic.

00:35:52.617 --> 00:35:54.719 align:middle line:84%
Right. So, this whole
quest movement,

00:35:54.719 --> 00:35:56.688 align:middle line:90%
this whole new paradigm movement

00:35:56.688 --> 00:35:58.890 align:middle line:84%
where people are just
fanatically trying to figure

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:01.526 align:middle line:84%
out where Mary-- whether, you
know, Mary Magdalene was married

00:36:01.526 --> 00:36:03.661 align:middle line:84%
to Jesus or whatever
people are into.

00:36:03.661 --> 00:36:09.067 align:middle line:84%
This is all about activating the
World of Forms so that the World

00:36:09.067 --> 00:36:13.138 align:middle line:84%
of Forms can be a place that
causes us in our dimension

00:36:13.138 --> 00:36:16.741 align:middle line:84%
to create beauty, and joy
and art instead of war,

00:36:16.741 --> 00:36:18.810 align:middle line:90%
destruction, and ugliness.

00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:21.546 align:middle line:84%
So, what each one of us does,
this is the ultimate thing,

00:36:21.546 --> 00:36:25.917 align:middle line:84%
the beauty way that we each
create and the type of life

00:36:25.917 --> 00:36:27.919 align:middle line:84%
that we live, the
way the, I think,

00:36:27.919 --> 00:36:31.623 align:middle line:84%
Pleiadians footed is everybody
has one vote in plutonium.

00:36:31.623 --> 00:36:32.490 align:middle line:90%
I was going to say.

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:33.424 align:middle line:90%
Yes, good one.

00:36:33.424 --> 00:36:34.159 align:middle line:84%
So it either strengthens
the mist?

00:36:34.159 --> 00:36:35.193 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:36:35.193 --> 00:36:35.760 align:middle line:84%
Or it dissipates the
mist of creation.

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:36.895 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:36:36.895 --> 00:36:38.796 align:middle line:84%
And so, this is where
the media is so tricky.

00:36:38.796 --> 00:36:40.632 align:middle line:84%
This is because see, I
have to pay attention

00:36:40.632 --> 00:36:42.066 align:middle line:84%
at the media because
of what I do.

00:36:42.066 --> 00:36:45.537 align:middle line:84%
Yes. So, what I watch out
for is anything I hear

00:36:45.537 --> 00:36:47.839 align:middle line:84%
that I know is wrong,
I just simply say,

00:36:47.839 --> 00:36:51.843 align:middle line:84%
out and I'm always watching
my mind very carefully

00:36:51.843 --> 00:36:55.380 align:middle line:84%
because I don't want to charge
the mist in Plutonia for a war

00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:57.549 align:middle line:84%
in Syria for example,
if you know what I mean.

00:36:57.549 --> 00:36:58.683 align:middle line:90%
Yeah exactly.

00:36:58.683 --> 00:37:00.151 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, and
through Barbara Marciniak,

00:37:00.151 --> 00:37:03.588 align:middle line:84%
the Pleiadians talk about she--
what's that term that she uses?

00:37:03.588 --> 00:37:05.356 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I won't remember,
she's got a great term

00:37:05.356 --> 00:37:06.958 align:middle line:90%
for keeping your head clear.

00:37:06.958 --> 00:37:08.760 align:middle line:90%
Yes, okay so we get the concept,

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:11.029 align:middle line:84%
to keep our thoughts
as clear as we can.

00:37:11.029 --> 00:37:13.731 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. In the direction we
choose for them to go rather

00:37:13.731 --> 00:37:15.833 align:middle line:90%
than basically being enslaved

00:37:15.833 --> 00:37:17.101 align:middle line:84%
to whatever is being
projected at us.

00:37:17.101 --> 00:37:18.603 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we really have to
keep control of your--

00:37:18.603 --> 00:37:21.506 align:middle line:84%
again, because what you're doing
is you're activating this other

00:37:21.506 --> 00:37:23.908 align:middle line:84%
dimension which is
creating everything here.

00:37:23.908 --> 00:37:25.176 align:middle line:90%
Yes. Yeah.

00:37:25.176 --> 00:37:29.013 align:middle line:84%
Okay, now the Syrians, Sirius
are the keepers-- Yeah.

00:37:29.013 --> 00:37:30.882 align:middle line:90%
-- of the six dimension.

00:37:30.882 --> 00:37:32.650 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little bit
about those beings?

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:35.286 align:middle line:84%
Okay, so then what the
Pleiadians said is they said

00:37:35.286 --> 00:37:37.956 align:middle line:84%
there was a keeper for each
dimension and for example,

00:37:37.956 --> 00:37:40.825 align:middle line:84%
in the third dimension, our
dimension, we're the keepers,

00:37:40.825 --> 00:37:42.961 align:middle line:84%
humans are keepers
because dimension,

00:37:42.961 --> 00:37:44.996 align:middle line:84%
the Pleiadians are
keepers as we know.

00:37:44.996 --> 00:37:46.397 align:middle line:90%
So, in the sixth dimension,

00:37:46.397 --> 00:37:50.201 align:middle line:84%
the Syrians of the Sirius
star systems are keepers.

00:37:50.201 --> 00:37:52.704 align:middle line:84%
And so, the question will be
this could just seem to be

00:37:52.704 --> 00:37:54.973 align:middle line:84%
in our keen curiosity
the question would be,

00:37:54.973 --> 00:37:56.574 align:middle line:90%
what's the value of that?

00:37:56.574 --> 00:38:02.113 align:middle line:84%
Well, each one of these keepers
is your access to a data bank.

00:38:02.113 --> 00:38:06.684 align:middle line:84%
Yes. So, in the sixth dimension,
there are different data banks

00:38:06.684 --> 00:38:09.921 align:middle line:84%
on our planet that are
Syrian and they're identified

00:38:09.921 --> 00:38:11.923 align:middle line:84%
in the Alchemy of Nine
Dimensions and one

00:38:11.923 --> 00:38:14.525 align:middle line:84%
of the best ones is
the Egyptian Data Bank.

00:38:14.525 --> 00:38:17.762 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptian culture and Dogon
culture of Central Africa.

00:38:17.762 --> 00:38:19.163 align:middle line:84%
I was just going to ask
you about Dogon, yes.

00:38:19.163 --> 00:38:20.732 align:middle line:84%
Yes because the Dogon
culture and the Egyptian--

00:38:20.732 --> 00:38:22.367 align:middle line:84%
That's what's angry
in to this indigenous.

00:38:22.367 --> 00:38:23.768 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:38:23.768 --> 00:38:26.070 align:middle line:84%
Yeah and the Dogon culture have
had a wonderful influence on us

00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:27.872 align:middle line:90%
and the current moment too.

00:38:27.872 --> 00:38:31.542 align:middle line:84%
So, the Dogon and Egyptian
culture are Syrian.

00:38:31.542 --> 00:38:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And so, if you want to
activate Syrian consciousness,

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:37.782 align:middle line:84%
all you have to do
study Egyptology

00:38:37.782 --> 00:38:39.851 align:middle line:90%
and study Dogon wisdom.

00:38:39.851 --> 00:38:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And what happens for you
and some people just--

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:43.788 align:middle line:90%
yeah, this probably--

00:38:43.788 --> 00:38:45.757 align:middle line:84%
this dimension is
probably the dimension

00:38:45.757 --> 00:38:48.960 align:middle line:84%
where there are the most
subjects that people studied

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:51.329 align:middle line:84%
because so many people
have studied Egyptology.

00:38:51.329 --> 00:38:53.031 align:middle line:84%
Yes. And then of course,
when you get into--

00:38:53.031 --> 00:38:54.132 align:middle line:90%
And psychogeometry, yeah.

00:38:54.132 --> 00:38:56.301 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, why are you going
to study Egyptology?

00:38:56.301 --> 00:38:59.037 align:middle line:84%
Well, then the Egyptology
is going to get you in touch

00:38:59.037 --> 00:39:01.039 align:middle line:84%
with a whole lot of
things which we could go

00:39:01.039 --> 00:39:02.640 align:middle line:90%
on and on about, yeah.

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:03.941 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a couple of minutes

00:39:03.941 --> 00:39:06.277 align:middle line:84%
because it's readily
available for the most part.

00:39:06.277 --> 00:39:10.281 align:middle line:84%
If someone were going to make
a study to activate that level

00:39:10.281 --> 00:39:12.617 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness within their
being or their connection

00:39:12.617 --> 00:39:15.720 align:middle line:84%
with it, where would
you say a person begin?

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:17.822 align:middle line:90%
By studying Egyptology and.

00:39:17.822 --> 00:39:20.458 align:middle line:84%
The hieroglyphics or--
Well, you know, you just--

00:39:20.458 --> 00:39:21.292 align:middle line:90%
I think it was just something.

00:39:21.292 --> 00:39:22.427 align:middle line:90%
And just anything just to begin.

00:39:22.427 --> 00:39:24.529 align:middle line:84%
Well, Egyptology and for
example, another thing,

00:39:24.529 --> 00:39:26.864 align:middle line:84%
let's go to Egyptology
for just a moment.

00:39:26.864 --> 00:39:30.168 align:middle line:84%
We have all the older
Egyptologist and archeologist

00:39:30.168 --> 00:39:32.303 align:middle line:84%
and I read them all
and I love them.

00:39:32.303 --> 00:39:34.639 align:middle line:84%
My grandfather, Cherokee
grandfather have been studying

00:39:34.639 --> 00:39:38.376 align:middle line:84%
to Egyptology when I was
four, you know, and I--

00:39:38.376 --> 00:39:40.511 align:middle line:90%
as I say, taught in Egypt a lot.

00:39:40.511 --> 00:39:43.414 align:middle line:84%
But what's amazing about
our current moment is some

00:39:43.414 --> 00:39:45.917 align:middle line:84%
breakthroughs of what have
been made in Egyptology,

00:39:45.917 --> 00:39:47.985 align:middle line:90%
they are absolutely astonishing.

00:39:47.985 --> 00:39:52.924 align:middle line:84%
One of which is by-- well two
major breakthroughs are via

00:39:52.924 --> 00:39:55.460 align:middle line:84%
teacher and writer Ed
Milcarsky [phonetic],

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:58.429 align:middle line:84%
you may have heard of,
and then Laird Scranton.

00:39:58.429 --> 00:40:02.633 align:middle line:84%
And Laird Scranton, go to
him first, has discovered

00:40:02.633 --> 00:40:07.071 align:middle line:84%
that hieroglyphics are a
quantum mechanical language.

00:40:07.071 --> 00:40:08.206 align:middle line:90%
You're aware of this.

00:40:08.206 --> 00:40:11.476 align:middle line:84%
Yes I am. Yeah and so
all of the different--

00:40:11.476 --> 00:40:15.213 align:middle line:84%
That's why I was saying
hieroglyphics are a good place

00:40:15.213 --> 00:40:16.014 align:middle line:90%
to begin and he's the guy.

00:40:16.014 --> 00:40:16.714 align:middle line:90%
Well, yeah.

00:40:16.714 --> 00:40:17.548 align:middle line:90%
They are the guy, okay.

00:40:17.548 --> 00:40:18.750 align:middle line:90%
Yeah they are there first so I--

00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:20.118 align:middle line:84%
we'll have to admit that
not very many people will

00:40:20.118 --> 00:40:21.085 align:middle line:90%
study hieroglyphics.

00:40:21.085 --> 00:40:22.420 align:middle line:84%
Yes. You know, it's
just you know.

00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:25.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, I can read hieroglyphics
but in the Egyptian temple

00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:27.558 align:middle line:90%
so I've been tested for this.

00:40:27.558 --> 00:40:30.928 align:middle line:84%
It's because I understand the
language but don't look at me

00:40:30.928 --> 00:40:34.532 align:middle line:84%
to be able to show the-- how it
relates to quantum mechanics.

00:40:34.532 --> 00:40:36.200 align:middle line:84%
Yes. So Laird Scranton
is incredible.

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:37.502 align:middle line:90%
He's a genius.

00:40:37.502 --> 00:40:39.070 align:middle line:84%
Okay, so that's a good place
to begin to activate that.

00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:40.371 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. Okay, great.

00:40:40.371 --> 00:40:42.306 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for that, I'm glad
we took and extra minute.

00:40:42.306 --> 00:40:44.809 align:middle line:84%
Now let's go-- And Ed
Milcarsky, just to add him here.

00:40:44.809 --> 00:40:46.344 align:middle line:90%
And Ed Milcarsky, okay.

00:40:46.344 --> 00:40:49.981 align:middle line:84%
Ed Milcarsky has taken the
granite technology of Egypt back

00:40:49.981 --> 00:40:54.285 align:middle line:84%
to around 40,000 BC
proving the advance level

00:40:54.285 --> 00:40:58.322 align:middle line:84%
of technological abilities
of the ancient Egyptian.

00:40:58.322 --> 00:41:00.391 align:middle line:90%
He has proved them slam dunk.

00:41:00.391 --> 00:41:02.126 align:middle line:84%
There are other people
who have gone into this

00:41:02.126 --> 00:41:02.994 align:middle line:90%
such as Chris Tan [phonetic].

00:41:02.994 --> 00:41:04.328 align:middle line:90%
Chris Tan.

00:41:04.328 --> 00:41:07.331 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Different people Chris
Tan back in those old days.

00:41:07.331 --> 00:41:08.666 align:middle line:90%
Everybody thought I was nuts

00:41:08.666 --> 00:41:11.736 align:middle line:84%
and his work isn't really
important but he's proving it.

00:41:11.736 --> 00:41:12.703 align:middle line:90%
Yes he does.

00:41:12.703 --> 00:41:14.238 align:middle line:84%
So then right there,
in your face,

00:41:14.238 --> 00:41:17.842 align:middle line:84%
there was an advanced
civilization 40,000 years

00:41:17.842 --> 00:41:19.010 align:middle line:90%
ago period.

00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:19.944 align:middle line:90%
Period. You know.

00:41:19.944 --> 00:41:21.145 align:middle line:90%
Okay, done and dusted.

00:41:21.145 --> 00:41:22.947 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Let's go to some--
So that's why you get in--

00:41:22.947 --> 00:41:24.582 align:middle line:84%
that's why you study
these dimensions,

00:41:24.582 --> 00:41:26.117 align:middle line:90%
because they actually are going

00:41:26.117 --> 00:41:27.652 align:middle line:84%
to take you into
those databanks.

00:41:27.652 --> 00:41:28.853 align:middle line:90%
Okay. Uh-hmm.

00:41:28.853 --> 00:41:31.656 align:middle line:84%
Okay now, let's go into
the 7-D, seventh dimension

00:41:31.656 --> 00:41:33.891 align:middle line:84%
which is the galactic
highways of light.

00:41:33.891 --> 00:41:36.561 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Okay, so what's
happening there is that geometry

00:41:36.561 --> 00:41:39.497 align:middle line:84%
in the sixth dimension,
Platonia is expanding,

00:41:39.497 --> 00:41:40.765 align:middle line:90%
expanding, expanding.

00:41:40.765 --> 00:41:44.368 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, the edge
of that geometry is sound.

00:41:44.368 --> 00:41:46.704 align:middle line:90%
And as you mentioned earlier,

00:41:46.704 --> 00:41:49.340 align:middle line:84%
we are able to use
Cymatics machines in it

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:52.210 align:middle line:84%
to actually see sound
creating geometry.

00:41:52.210 --> 00:41:56.114 align:middle line:84%
We also can see sound creating
geometry with crop circles

00:41:56.114 --> 00:41:57.181 align:middle line:90%
because when people have been

00:41:57.181 --> 00:41:59.083 align:middle line:84%
around when a crop
circle got laid,

00:41:59.083 --> 00:42:00.818 align:middle line:90%
some people can hear the sound.

00:42:00.818 --> 00:42:03.521 align:middle line:84%
Yes. So we now know
there for sure.

00:42:03.521 --> 00:42:06.858 align:middle line:84%
And so as we move-- and what did
you just ask for [inaudible]?

00:42:06.858 --> 00:42:08.259 align:middle line:84%
Oh that's-- yeah,
I just want to move

00:42:08.259 --> 00:42:09.360 align:middle line:90%
in to the seventh dimension.

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:10.695 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so moving in--
The highways of light.

00:42:10.695 --> 00:42:11.329 align:middle line:90%
Oh I see. Yeah.

00:42:11.329 --> 00:42:12.130 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that's right.

00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:13.464 align:middle line:90%
That's what we want to get.

00:42:13.464 --> 00:42:17.168 align:middle line:84%
So when that material came
through, I already knew about--

00:42:17.168 --> 00:42:19.637 align:middle line:84%
well no, I discovered
Cymatics after it came in.

00:42:19.637 --> 00:42:22.507 align:middle line:84%
So I-- but Cymatics
is fairly easy

00:42:22.507 --> 00:42:24.242 align:middle line:90%
to understand, you know, okay.

00:42:24.242 --> 00:42:26.744 align:middle line:84%
But-- fine, the other
thing the Pleiadians said

00:42:26.744 --> 00:42:30.448 align:middle line:84%
about the seventh dimension
back in '94, '95 is they said,

00:42:30.448 --> 00:42:32.950 align:middle line:84%
there are these great
lines of light going

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:34.685 align:middle line:90%
through the whole universe

00:42:34.685 --> 00:42:38.422 align:middle line:84%
and they call them the galactic
information highways of life.

00:42:38.422 --> 00:42:40.925 align:middle line:84%
Okay, so I published I just
like you did with everything

00:42:40.925 --> 00:42:42.560 align:middle line:84%
with this material,
I just published it.

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:45.196 align:middle line:84%
But of course, I had no idea
what he's talking about.

00:42:45.196 --> 00:42:48.699 align:middle line:84%
And then a Portuguese
physicist, Joao Magueijo

00:42:48.699 --> 00:42:53.571 align:middle line:84%
in 2003 published
information on the discovery

00:42:53.571 --> 00:42:54.939 align:middle line:90%
of this galactic inform--

00:42:54.939 --> 00:42:57.341 align:middle line:84%
he didn't call them galactic
information highways of life,

00:42:57.341 --> 00:43:00.278 align:middle line:84%
he called them threads
going through the universe.

00:43:00.278 --> 00:43:05.550 align:middle line:84%
They're kind of like threads
that are like a black hole

00:43:05.550 --> 00:43:07.752 align:middle line:84%
where as you get closer
and closer to the essence

00:43:07.752 --> 00:43:10.888 align:middle line:84%
of the thread, time
starts moving faster

00:43:10.888 --> 00:43:12.490 align:middle line:90%
than the speed of light.

00:43:12.490 --> 00:43:14.892 align:middle line:84%
Now, the speed of
light for a minute,

00:43:14.892 --> 00:43:18.462 align:middle line:84%
the speed of light is simply
the edge of the universe

00:43:18.462 --> 00:43:20.064 align:middle line:84%
that we can apprehend--
The third dimension?

00:43:20.064 --> 00:43:22.266 align:middle line:84%
By telescopes or by
perception or whatever.

00:43:22.266 --> 00:43:24.769 align:middle line:84%
Right. And we now know that
there are speeds of light

00:43:24.769 --> 00:43:26.537 align:middle line:90%
that are faster than that.

00:43:26.537 --> 00:43:29.006 align:middle line:84%
But since we can't apprehend
it, we're not getting very far

00:43:29.006 --> 00:43:30.241 align:middle line:90%
at picking up on them.

00:43:30.241 --> 00:43:33.311 align:middle line:84%
Well, Joao Magueijo
said that these threads,

00:43:33.311 --> 00:43:34.845 align:middle line:84%
the galactic information
highways

00:43:34.845 --> 00:43:37.582 align:middle line:84%
of light are moving throughout
the universe and they're almost

00:43:37.582 --> 00:43:40.585 align:middle line:84%
like lines of black hole
forces where the speed

00:43:40.585 --> 00:43:43.287 align:middle line:84%
of light is going
faster in these threads.

00:43:43.287 --> 00:43:44.555 align:middle line:90%
So that's when I decided

00:43:44.555 --> 00:43:46.157 align:middle line:84%
to write the Alchemy
of Nine Dimensions.

00:43:46.157 --> 00:43:49.493 align:middle line:84%
When I got a hold of his
material, I came screaming

00:43:49.493 --> 00:43:51.395 align:middle line:84%
into the kitchen while Jerry
was having his morning time--

00:43:51.395 --> 00:43:52.530 align:middle line:90%
Validation.

00:43:52.530 --> 00:43:53.898 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Guess what the
seventh dimension is.

00:43:53.898 --> 00:43:55.266 align:middle line:90%
It's just been verified."

00:43:55.266 --> 00:43:57.535 align:middle line:84%
And Jerry said, "Now, it's time
for you to write that book."

00:43:57.535 --> 00:43:59.570 align:middle line:90%
Okay now, how do we access them?

00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:01.372 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean to us?

00:44:01.372 --> 00:44:03.441 align:middle line:84%
And I want to get into
the crop circle part.

00:44:03.441 --> 00:44:05.676 align:middle line:84%
We actually-- we'll
probably have

00:44:05.676 --> 00:44:07.478 align:middle line:84%
to go pretty quickly
through the-- Sure.

00:44:07.478 --> 00:44:09.447 align:middle line:84%
-- eighth and ninth dimension
but I want to take time

00:44:09.447 --> 00:44:10.881 align:middle line:90%
in this crop circle phenomena.

00:44:10.881 --> 00:44:13.284 align:middle line:84%
Sure. You, the symbolism
when you start writing books,

00:44:13.284 --> 00:44:15.453 align:middle line:84%
you're shown things,
crop circles turn out,

00:44:15.453 --> 00:44:16.554 align:middle line:90%
tell us about all these.

00:44:16.554 --> 00:44:17.955 align:middle line:84%
Okay, we'll see how much
of that we could go.

00:44:17.955 --> 00:44:20.424 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Okay, the only way I've
ever been able to get in touch

00:44:20.424 --> 00:44:22.293 align:middle line:84%
with the seventh
dimension personally is

00:44:22.293 --> 00:44:23.761 align:middle line:90%
by going into hyperspace.

00:44:23.761 --> 00:44:26.564 align:middle line:84%
And, I've had some
craniosacral treatments

00:44:26.564 --> 00:44:28.966 align:middle line:84%
where I've actually
moved into hyperspace.

00:44:28.966 --> 00:44:30.668 align:middle line:84%
And when I've been
in hyperspace,

00:44:30.668 --> 00:44:36.207 align:middle line:84%
I can see those lines and I
can see that it's like 2001.

00:44:36.207 --> 00:44:38.409 align:middle line:84%
In some movie, we have
where they really tried

00:44:38.409 --> 00:44:41.579 align:middle line:84%
to show hyperspace and somebody
taking off into hyperspace

00:44:41.579 --> 00:44:44.115 align:middle line:84%
and the forces are
just in-- Contact?

00:44:44.115 --> 00:44:45.483 align:middle line:90%
It could be, yeah.

00:44:45.483 --> 00:44:46.817 align:middle line:84%
[Multiple Speaker] There's one
where just everything comes

00:44:46.817 --> 00:44:49.053 align:middle line:84%
into life coming in
and the forces are

00:44:49.053 --> 00:44:51.122 align:middle line:90%
just incomprehensible.

00:44:51.122 --> 00:44:52.790 align:middle line:84%
So, the other way that
people get in touch

00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:54.458 align:middle line:84%
with the seventh
dimension is all

00:44:54.458 --> 00:44:56.560 align:middle line:84%
of the wonderful sound
healing techniques

00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:59.330 align:middle line:84%
that we're working with, like
working with crystal balls,

00:44:59.330 --> 00:45:01.198 align:middle line:90%
working with cymatics, we're--

00:45:01.198 --> 00:45:04.135 align:middle line:84%
all people are developing,
Tom Kenyon's singing.

00:45:04.135 --> 00:45:06.804 align:middle line:84%
Yes. You know, all kinds
of people are bringing

00:45:06.804 --> 00:45:09.540 align:middle line:84%
in this level of
information from the--

00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:11.242 align:middle line:90%
through to seventh dimension.

00:45:11.242 --> 00:45:14.779 align:middle line:84%
Fabulous. Okay and what
about the Andromedans

00:45:14.779 --> 00:45:16.547 align:middle line:84%
because they are
the keepers of it?

00:45:16.547 --> 00:45:18.049 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us a
little bit about that?

00:45:18.049 --> 00:45:21.652 align:middle line:84%
That's a real mystery because
Andromeda is a twin galaxy

00:45:21.652 --> 00:45:24.488 align:middle line:84%
to the Milky Way
and the Milky Way

00:45:24.488 --> 00:45:26.757 align:middle line:84%
and Andromeda Galaxy
are emerging

00:45:26.757 --> 00:45:30.027 align:middle line:84%
and coming closer
together 10 times faster

00:45:30.027 --> 00:45:32.997 align:middle line:84%
than can be scientifically
understood.

00:45:32.997 --> 00:45:34.098 align:middle line:90%
There's something going on

00:45:34.098 --> 00:45:35.966 align:middle line:84%
and people discovered
this about maybe 50.

00:45:35.966 --> 00:45:37.702 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is a type
of information that's

00:45:37.702 --> 00:45:39.170 align:middle line:84%
in the footnotes
because it's very,

00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:40.738 align:middle line:90%
very complicated information.

00:45:40.738 --> 00:45:43.474 align:middle line:84%
People need to check the sources
and all that kind of stuff

00:45:43.474 --> 00:45:45.976 align:middle line:84%
but we are merging
with Andromeda Galaxy.

00:45:45.976 --> 00:45:49.814 align:middle line:84%
And so, the Pleiadians send
Andromeda Galaxy as the keeper

00:45:49.814 --> 00:45:53.451 align:middle line:84%
and Andromeda is an incredibly
beautifully spiral galaxy.

00:45:53.451 --> 00:45:55.419 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a whole
other teaching going on there

00:45:55.419 --> 00:45:58.789 align:middle line:84%
about how about how
Andromeda Galaxy has a plan--

00:45:58.789 --> 00:46:01.692 align:middle line:84%
has a solar system and
like our solar system.

00:46:01.692 --> 00:46:04.895 align:middle line:84%
It has a planet in that solar
system that which is the name

00:46:04.895 --> 00:46:09.734 align:middle line:84%
of the planet is Ion, and Ion
is a planet that's exactly

00:46:09.734 --> 00:46:12.036 align:middle line:84%
like earth but they have
not had a cataclysm.

00:46:12.036 --> 00:46:14.472 align:middle line:84%
When I read that, I
thought, how beautiful.

00:46:14.472 --> 00:46:15.873 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I know.

00:46:15.873 --> 00:46:19.043 align:middle line:84%
So they are saying that Ion is
holding space out of the heart,

00:46:19.043 --> 00:46:21.879 align:middle line:84%
open heart for our
planet that we will get

00:46:21.879 --> 00:46:24.081 align:middle line:84%
through the post
traumatic stress syndrome

00:46:24.081 --> 00:46:25.549 align:middle line:90%
and comeback into harmonics.

00:46:25.549 --> 00:46:27.485 align:middle line:90%
So were the Andromedans similar

00:46:27.485 --> 00:46:29.520 align:middle line:84%
to human form like
the Pleiadians?

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:30.855 align:middle line:90%
Pleiadians are always depicted

00:46:30.855 --> 00:46:32.890 align:middle line:84%
as very symmetrical
[inaudible] hair,

00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:34.959 align:middle line:90%
blue-eyed [inaudible] humans.

00:46:34.959 --> 00:46:37.361 align:middle line:84%
What are-- what about
those from Andromeda?

00:46:37.361 --> 00:46:40.598 align:middle line:84%
Andromedans-- and then we have
well, Andromedans walking all

00:46:40.598 --> 00:46:44.468 align:middle line:84%
over the planet and they tend
to be tall and very geometrical

00:46:44.468 --> 00:46:47.838 align:middle line:84%
or very beautiful people
and they tend to be obsessed

00:46:47.838 --> 00:46:51.175 align:middle line:84%
with how to go from point
A to point B. They work

00:46:51.175 --> 00:46:53.444 align:middle line:84%
in the airlines and they
like to be in anything

00:46:53.444 --> 00:46:56.080 align:middle line:84%
that involves moving people
around from here to there.

00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:59.316 align:middle line:84%
I'll watch for really
beautiful attendant

00:46:59.316 --> 00:47:00.851 align:middle line:90%
that looks like that next time.

00:47:00.851 --> 00:47:02.386 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Although usually,
if they're that tall,

00:47:02.386 --> 00:47:03.587 align:middle line:84%
they don't hire them
because they can't fit

00:47:03.587 --> 00:47:04.922 align:middle line:90%
in the cabin, but okay.

00:47:04.922 --> 00:47:06.757 align:middle line:84%
And my husband Jerry is an
Andromedan and so he's working

00:47:06.757 --> 00:47:09.059 align:middle line:84%
with craniaosacral dynamics
because that works--

00:47:09.059 --> 00:47:10.194 align:middle line:90%
And he's tall and beautiful?

00:47:10.194 --> 00:47:11.729 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and he is actually
but that's how--

00:47:11.729 --> 00:47:14.165 align:middle line:84%
he's working with how
the skull is interfacing

00:47:14.165 --> 00:47:16.534 align:middle line:84%
with the consciousness
coming in from everywhere.

00:47:16.534 --> 00:47:17.601 align:middle line:90%
Yes. Yeah.

00:47:17.601 --> 00:47:20.471 align:middle line:84%
And then also, they
say take the--

00:47:20.471 --> 00:47:22.640 align:middle line:84%
the quote I got on
the book, take control

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:24.742 align:middle line:84%
of your mind now is
what they're saying.

00:47:24.742 --> 00:47:26.343 align:middle line:90%
It keeps feeding back into this,

00:47:26.343 --> 00:47:28.612 align:middle line:84%
breaking this fourth
dimensional hold on this.

00:47:28.612 --> 00:47:31.982 align:middle line:84%
So, that's-- they are directed
to us, take back our minds now

00:47:31.982 --> 00:47:33.417 align:middle line:90%
so we can continue to progress

00:47:33.417 --> 00:47:35.119 align:middle line:84%
and maybe emerge
with them, Sure.

00:47:35.119 --> 00:47:39.523 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Okay, let's talk about the
divine mind, eighth dimension.

00:47:39.523 --> 00:47:40.925 align:middle line:90%
Okay. I love that area.

00:47:40.925 --> 00:47:44.595 align:middle line:84%
And so the best image for that
is that it's really pretty easy

00:47:44.595 --> 00:47:46.897 align:middle line:84%
to get a sense of
sound, creating geometry

00:47:46.897 --> 00:47:49.567 align:middle line:84%
if you go the other way, you
know, if we go backwards.

00:47:49.567 --> 00:47:51.469 align:middle line:84%
Yes. So then, if we
move the other way.

00:47:51.469 --> 00:47:54.839 align:middle line:84%
What's happening is
sound is created by light

00:47:54.839 --> 00:47:57.408 align:middle line:84%
and it took me a long
time to see that.

00:47:57.408 --> 00:47:59.510 align:middle line:84%
I finally have to
see it in a vision.

00:47:59.510 --> 00:48:04.615 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, in some mysterious
way, light is creating sound

00:48:04.615 --> 00:48:08.152 align:middle line:84%
which then creates geometry
which then opens the heart.

00:48:08.152 --> 00:48:10.621 align:middle line:84%
So, that's just kind of
a physiological thing

00:48:10.621 --> 00:48:12.089 align:middle line:90%
and then the only access we have

00:48:12.089 --> 00:48:18.028 align:middle line:84%
to those database are religious
traditions especially Islam.

00:48:18.028 --> 00:48:20.598 align:middle line:84%
And religious traditions
that are really like look

00:48:20.598 --> 00:48:23.267 align:middle line:84%
at the Islamic beautiful
sacred geometrical power--

00:48:23.267 --> 00:48:24.368 align:middle line:90%
And beautiful, yes.

00:48:24.368 --> 00:48:26.971 align:middle line:84%
With Islam and they have
this, in my opinion,

00:48:26.971 --> 00:48:29.106 align:middle line:84%
a much more highly
developed sense

00:48:29.106 --> 00:48:32.142 align:middle line:84%
of the light creating a
sound, creating the geometry.

00:48:32.142 --> 00:48:34.812 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. And they seem to
have to very, very attuned.

00:48:34.812 --> 00:48:36.080 align:middle line:84%
They're always going
to be religious,

00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:37.948 align:middle line:84%
I probably be a [inaudible]
just because of that.

00:48:37.948 --> 00:48:40.284 align:middle line:84%
Right. And at that
attunement with the lights.

00:48:40.284 --> 00:48:41.252 align:middle line:90%
Sound and movement.

00:48:41.252 --> 00:48:42.653 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. And then, yeah.

00:48:42.653 --> 00:48:45.456 align:middle line:84%
And then what happens for people
on the table back to this issue

00:48:45.456 --> 00:48:47.358 align:middle line:84%
of what dimension
are you picking up.

00:48:47.358 --> 00:48:49.193 align:middle line:84%
When people pick the
eighth dimension,

00:48:49.193 --> 00:48:52.563 align:middle line:84%
when they're meditating or when
they're in healing or whatever,

00:48:52.563 --> 00:48:57.268 align:middle line:84%
often, they will get a very,
very profound voice that with--

00:48:57.268 --> 00:48:59.069 align:middle line:90%
it's actually very ethical.

00:48:59.069 --> 00:49:01.372 align:middle line:84%
If they're dealing with
some kind of moral dilemma,

00:49:01.372 --> 00:49:06.310 align:middle line:84%
they will often hear a voice
that says you will do this now.

00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:08.946 align:middle line:84%
Yes. So, the age dimension
is a whole databank

00:49:08.946 --> 00:49:11.782 align:middle line:84%
that we can jump
right into in order

00:49:11.782 --> 00:49:15.686 align:middle line:84%
to detect the best solution
for any given situation.

00:49:15.686 --> 00:49:18.389 align:middle line:84%
Well, it also then connects
back to the heart, right?

00:49:18.389 --> 00:49:19.089 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's right.

00:49:19.089 --> 00:49:20.291 align:middle line:90%
Yes. Yeah, that's right.

00:49:20.291 --> 00:49:21.926 align:middle line:84%
Now, all the road seem to
lead back to the heart.

00:49:21.926 --> 00:49:25.563 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Let' talk about
Galactic Federation in Orion.

00:49:25.563 --> 00:49:28.465 align:middle line:84%
I mean all I hear that, you
know, I get the little eblast.

00:49:28.465 --> 00:49:30.834 align:middle line:84%
Join, go-- come, the
Galactic Federation is doing a

00:49:30.834 --> 00:49:31.936 align:middle line:90%
presentation tonight.

00:49:31.936 --> 00:49:33.737 align:middle line:84%
And I've always kind
of just stayed away.

00:49:33.737 --> 00:49:35.673 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. But tell me
the reality of this.

00:49:35.673 --> 00:49:39.476 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, this is a really good
example of how I faithfully put

00:49:39.476 --> 00:49:41.946 align:middle line:84%
down whatever I've got
because nothing makes me more

00:49:41.946 --> 00:49:45.115 align:middle line:84%
uncomfortable than the
Galactic Federation.

00:49:45.115 --> 00:49:47.985 align:middle line:84%
And also the Nephilim
and the Anunnaki,

00:49:47.985 --> 00:49:49.720 align:middle line:84%
they make me pretty
uncomfortable too.

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:52.289 align:middle line:84%
But I faithfully
reported and as you know,

00:49:52.289 --> 00:49:56.627 align:middle line:84%
the Pleiadians say the Anunnaki
and the Nephilim are the keepers

00:49:56.627 --> 00:49:57.761 align:middle line:90%
of the fourth dimension

00:49:57.761 --> 00:49:59.530 align:middle line:84%
which when you read it,
makes a lot of sense.

00:49:59.530 --> 00:50:02.800 align:middle line:84%
Yes. When you go into it
now but in terms of Orion,

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:06.036 align:middle line:84%
astronomically, Orion
goes through a rise

00:50:06.036 --> 00:50:08.405 align:middle line:84%
and Robert Bauval did
a great job on this

00:50:08.405 --> 00:50:09.306 align:middle line:90%
in the Orion Mysteries.

00:50:09.306 --> 00:50:10.841 align:middle line:90%
Yes. Very good book.

00:50:10.841 --> 00:50:13.944 align:middle line:84%
And Orion, based on
her recessional cycle,

00:50:13.944 --> 00:50:17.481 align:middle line:84%
goes through a high rising
cycle and a low rising cycle

00:50:17.481 --> 00:50:19.817 align:middle line:90%
in relationship to the horizon.

00:50:19.817 --> 00:50:22.086 align:middle line:90%
And we have just come to very--

00:50:22.086 --> 00:50:25.322 align:middle line:84%
we are just coming to the
very top of the Orion cycle

00:50:25.322 --> 00:50:27.958 align:middle line:84%
at this point which I think
is another indication.

00:50:27.958 --> 00:50:30.761 align:middle line:84%
We're moving into higher
state of consciousness.

00:50:30.761 --> 00:50:32.096 align:middle line:90%
So, I think the reasons

00:50:32.096 --> 00:50:35.532 align:middle line:84%
that they use the term Galactic
Federation is they want us

00:50:35.532 --> 00:50:37.434 align:middle line:90%
to understand that it kind

00:50:37.434 --> 00:50:40.337 align:middle line:84%
of works the way our
corporate structures work.

00:50:40.337 --> 00:50:43.073 align:middle line:84%
There has to be some
way like for instance,

00:50:43.073 --> 00:50:45.275 align:middle line:84%
here we are at [inaudible],
there has to be a way

00:50:45.275 --> 00:50:48.379 align:middle line:84%
to have a corporation and
have structures in order

00:50:48.379 --> 00:50:51.148 align:middle line:84%
to make reality come
into manifestation.

00:50:51.148 --> 00:50:54.351 align:middle line:84%
So, they use that more or
less to help us understand.

00:50:54.351 --> 00:50:56.987 align:middle line:84%
Okay. And then, I've attuned
at the Galactic Federation,

00:50:56.987 --> 00:50:58.756 align:middle line:84%
they're very much
light beings, very,

00:50:58.756 --> 00:51:01.759 align:middle line:84%
very high consciousness
beings, you know.

00:51:01.759 --> 00:51:04.128 align:middle line:84%
And other reasons we get
a negative wrap on some

00:51:04.128 --> 00:51:05.396 align:middle line:90%
of those stuff is remember,

00:51:05.396 --> 00:51:08.198 align:middle line:84%
everything in the higher
dimensions has to go through 4D?

00:51:08.198 --> 00:51:09.900 align:middle line:84%
But when I get emails
from them all the time,

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:11.168 align:middle line:90%
you know, it makes you wonder.

00:51:11.168 --> 00:51:13.137 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. You know, you
have to be discerning

00:51:13.137 --> 00:51:14.905 align:middle line:84%
and I just have been drawn
to go there at this time.

00:51:14.905 --> 00:51:16.306 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Well, let me
put to you this way

00:51:16.306 --> 00:51:18.609 align:middle line:84%
and I don't mind
saying this on your--

00:51:18.609 --> 00:51:22.713 align:middle line:84%
people who were looking at
the Orion Galactic Federation

00:51:22.713 --> 00:51:24.882 align:middle line:84%
that way are probably
working very much

00:51:24.882 --> 00:51:26.216 align:middle line:90%
at a fourth dimensional level.

00:51:26.216 --> 00:51:27.818 align:middle line:90%
Yes. Maybe sixth dimensional.

00:51:27.818 --> 00:51:31.588 align:middle line:84%
Okay. I find that people--
if you feel of working at one

00:51:31.588 --> 00:51:34.091 align:middle line:90%
of those levels, that's fine.

00:51:34.091 --> 00:51:36.860 align:middle line:84%
Like for example, there's
a [inaudible] teachings

00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:39.363 align:middle line:84%
and that's a very sixth
dimensional teaching.

00:51:39.363 --> 00:51:40.664 align:middle line:90%
And that's a good example

00:51:40.664 --> 00:51:43.567 align:middle line:84%
of the eighth dimensional
divine light coming

00:51:43.567 --> 00:51:45.102 align:middle line:84%
through our sixth
dimensional level.

00:51:45.102 --> 00:51:46.036 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:51:46.036 --> 00:51:46.837 align:middle line:84%
And if that's the
way people need

00:51:46.837 --> 00:51:48.205 align:middle line:90%
to understand it, it's fine.

00:51:48.205 --> 00:51:49.573 align:middle line:84%
Right, right, and just so you
resonate within the moment.

00:51:49.573 --> 00:51:50.841 align:middle line:84%
But they just need to know
what they're doing 'cause

00:51:50.841 --> 00:51:52.876 align:middle line:84%
if you don't watch out,
suddenly, you're in the Vatican.

00:51:52.876 --> 00:51:53.877 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:51:53.877 --> 00:51:54.578 align:middle line:84%
You got to be careful
where you are.

00:51:54.578 --> 00:51:55.913 align:middle line:90%
Be careful, be careful.

00:51:55.913 --> 00:51:57.581 align:middle line:84%
You know, the Annunaki are
running the Vatican Absolutely,

00:51:57.581 --> 00:51:58.882 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:51:58.882 --> 00:51:59.683 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. And too bad we didn't
get into that in our talk

00:51:59.683 --> 00:52:00.551 align:middle line:90%
in the fourth dimension.

00:52:00.551 --> 00:52:02.252 align:middle line:90%
I had-- that was in the rest

00:52:02.252 --> 00:52:03.821 align:middle line:84%
of the 20 questions
we didn't get to,

00:52:03.821 --> 00:52:05.322 align:middle line:84%
kind of like what
will happen right now.

00:52:05.322 --> 00:52:07.458 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Okay, contacting
the eighth D

00:52:07.458 --> 00:52:09.426 align:middle line:90%
by entering the mind of the sun.

00:52:09.426 --> 00:52:11.995 align:middle line:90%
That concept just blew me away.

00:52:11.995 --> 00:52:13.130 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:52:13.130 --> 00:52:15.466 align:middle line:84%
Yeah so that is just a
technique you literally

00:52:15.466 --> 00:52:19.303 align:middle line:84%
on this planet can take your
consciousness into the sun.

00:52:19.303 --> 00:52:21.572 align:middle line:84%
And then when you're in
the sun, you can act--

00:52:21.572 --> 00:52:23.307 align:middle line:90%
it's just a technique.

00:52:23.307 --> 00:52:25.709 align:middle line:84%
But you're telling about
the mind of the sun.

00:52:25.709 --> 00:52:27.010 align:middle line:90%
Sure. Yeah.

00:52:27.010 --> 00:52:28.746 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the mind of the sun
is very eighth dimensional.

00:52:28.746 --> 00:52:30.581 align:middle line:90%
The mind-- take of how the sun--

00:52:30.581 --> 00:52:32.749 align:middle line:84%
and that's why we have
all the solar cultures,

00:52:32.749 --> 00:52:35.686 align:middle line:84%
they recognize the
divine level of the sun.

00:52:35.686 --> 00:52:40.657 align:middle line:84%
Yes and we're talking about also
this is a whole dimension we're

00:52:40.657 --> 00:52:42.826 align:middle line:84%
talking about spin
or to create--

00:52:42.826 --> 00:52:44.761 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
spin-- light.

00:52:44.761 --> 00:52:48.665 align:middle line:84%
Spin, light, sound, geometry,
and the step down process

00:52:48.665 --> 00:52:49.967 align:middle line:90%
into the physical creation.

00:52:49.967 --> 00:52:53.203 align:middle line:84%
But in a nutshell, before we
go to the ninth dimension,

00:52:53.203 --> 00:52:56.206 align:middle line:84%
in a nutshell, what is the most
important thing we need to do

00:52:56.206 --> 00:52:59.309 align:middle line:84%
to remember in terms of
embodying and incorporating

00:52:59.309 --> 00:53:00.911 align:middle line:84%
that into or conscious
awareness?

00:53:00.911 --> 00:53:03.981 align:middle line:84%
Then we have direct access
to the eighth dimension

00:53:03.981 --> 00:53:06.183 align:middle line:84%
and the technique for how
to do that is in the book.

00:53:06.183 --> 00:53:10.988 align:middle line:84%
Yes. And so at any moment
in this planet, anyone of us

00:53:10.988 --> 00:53:13.657 align:middle line:84%
in the third dimension, if we
want to know whether to do this

00:53:13.657 --> 00:53:15.959 align:middle line:84%
or that, we can move
our consciousness

00:53:15.959 --> 00:53:18.095 align:middle line:84%
to the eighth dimension
and seek the answers there.

00:53:18.095 --> 00:53:20.364 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to seek the
answers in the dualized,

00:53:20.364 --> 00:53:21.999 align:middle line:90%
polarized fourth dimension.

00:53:21.999 --> 00:53:24.601 align:middle line:84%
We don't even want to seek
it at the geometrical level.

00:53:24.601 --> 00:53:26.336 align:middle line:90%
We want to go the source.

00:53:26.336 --> 00:53:27.471 align:middle line:90%
Okay. Yeah.

00:53:27.471 --> 00:53:29.106 align:middle line:84%
That's a very good thing
to bring up and also,

00:53:29.106 --> 00:53:30.707 align:middle line:84%
those are very clear
instructions

00:53:30.707 --> 00:53:32.242 align:middle line:84%
in the book as to
how to do that.

00:53:32.242 --> 00:53:33.944 align:middle line:84%
[Multiple Speaker] And then it
takes about four or five hours

00:53:33.944 --> 00:53:35.879 align:middle line:84%
if you-- if you're
really into a big mess

00:53:35.879 --> 00:53:37.614 align:middle line:84%
which we often get
ourselves into.

00:53:37.614 --> 00:53:40.951 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. This is the best way
to really change a situation.

00:53:40.951 --> 00:53:42.853 align:middle line:84%
Yes. I thought it
was very effective.

00:53:42.853 --> 00:53:47.257 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. So now, we're going into--
and there's another thing here

00:53:47.257 --> 00:53:49.459 align:middle line:84%
that the sun directs
our intentions.

00:53:49.459 --> 00:53:51.461 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of leading
out from the eighth

00:53:51.461 --> 00:53:53.997 align:middle line:84%
into the ninth dimension
which is the black hole

00:53:53.997 --> 00:53:55.933 align:middle line:90%
at the center of the Milky Way.

00:53:55.933 --> 00:53:58.602 align:middle line:84%
So, let's talk about what
the ninth dimension is

00:53:58.602 --> 00:54:03.240 align:middle line:84%
functionally-- what it is
functionally within us.

00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:06.577 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's-- the keeper of the
ninth dimension is Tzolkin,

00:54:06.577 --> 00:54:09.079 align:middle line:84%
the Mayan calendar which
I didn't understand

00:54:09.079 --> 00:54:11.248 align:middle line:84%
until a few years ago which
is the reason this book

00:54:11.248 --> 00:54:12.282 align:middle line:90%
was rewritten.

00:54:12.282 --> 00:54:14.318 align:middle line:90%
So in terms of the structure--

00:54:14.318 --> 00:54:16.954 align:middle line:84%
structural issues that
we're dealing with,

00:54:16.954 --> 00:54:20.224 align:middle line:84%
the vertical axis goes from the
first dimension at the center

00:54:20.224 --> 00:54:22.993 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth and goes
into the black hole

00:54:22.993 --> 00:54:24.795 align:middle line:90%
in the center of the galaxy.

00:54:24.795 --> 00:54:27.497 align:middle line:84%
And so, in terms of how
we maintain ourselves

00:54:27.497 --> 00:54:31.068 align:middle line:84%
as physical beings in the
third dimension, we really need

00:54:31.068 --> 00:54:34.338 align:middle line:84%
to start to realize that we're
on the vertical axis going

00:54:34.338 --> 00:54:35.739 align:middle line:84%
from the fourth to
the ninth dimension.

00:54:35.739 --> 00:54:37.174 align:middle line:84%
Yes. And the of course,
in my case,

00:54:37.174 --> 00:54:40.077 align:middle line:84%
it's an absolute
100 percent practice

00:54:40.077 --> 00:54:42.446 align:middle line:90%
that I live with, you know.

00:54:42.446 --> 00:54:45.182 align:middle line:84%
And you talked earlier-- you
brought up the fact that this is

00:54:45.182 --> 00:54:47.517 align:middle line:84%
where time of a different
nature comes in.

00:54:47.517 --> 00:54:48.919 align:middle line:90%
Yes. So let's speak about that.

00:54:48.919 --> 00:54:51.221 align:middle line:84%
And so I like I saym, I did not
understand that ninth dimension.

00:54:51.221 --> 00:54:52.522 align:middle line:90%
I honored it, okay.

00:54:52.522 --> 00:54:56.560 align:middle line:84%
Tzolkin is the keeper and
Tzolkin is the day calendar

00:54:56.560 --> 00:54:57.594 align:middle line:90%
of the Mayan calendar.

00:54:57.594 --> 00:54:59.596 align:middle line:90%
So, I had no idea what it meant.

00:54:59.596 --> 00:55:02.132 align:middle line:84%
I knew what the keeper
was the galactic center.

00:55:02.132 --> 00:55:04.301 align:middle line:84%
In the galactic center,
the keeper in terms

00:55:04.301 --> 00:55:06.036 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness is Tzolkin.

00:55:06.036 --> 00:55:10.807 align:middle line:84%
And so, when I discovered
Carl Calleman's work in 2004,

00:55:10.807 --> 00:55:13.310 align:middle line:84%
that's when I finally understood
'cause I just couldn't--

00:55:13.310 --> 00:55:16.680 align:middle line:84%
how could time be at a
higher dimensional level

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:18.915 align:middle line:90%
than the divine mind?

00:55:18.915 --> 00:55:22.085 align:middle line:84%
What it-- all it is, is
that the agendas are coming

00:55:22.085 --> 00:55:26.823 align:middle line:84%
through time codes so that the
divine mind will create reality.

00:55:26.823 --> 00:55:29.059 align:middle line:84%
It makes to be released
at exactly the right time

00:55:29.059 --> 00:55:30.994 align:middle line:84%
of seeding or fertilization,
what not.

00:55:30.994 --> 00:55:32.229 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. And then you--
also, you know,

00:55:32.229 --> 00:55:33.931 align:middle line:84%
there's higher dimensions
to this.

00:55:33.931 --> 00:55:36.566 align:middle line:84%
Yes. What the Pleiadians are
saying is these are the nine

00:55:36.566 --> 00:55:40.470 align:middle line:84%
dimensions that we can get in
touch with and we can utilize.

00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:41.938 align:middle line:84%
And they're saying
there's another--

00:55:41.938 --> 00:55:45.375 align:middle line:84%
they're saying there's 26-- this
whole issue of 26 dimensions.

00:55:45.375 --> 00:55:48.478 align:middle line:84%
They agree with that, it's just
that we don't have the ability

00:55:48.478 --> 00:55:49.880 align:middle line:90%
to get in touch with anything

00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:52.015 align:middle line:84%
above the ninth dimension
at this time.

00:55:52.015 --> 00:55:53.684 align:middle line:84%
That's what they're
saying, you know.

00:55:53.684 --> 00:55:55.952 align:middle line:84%
Okay, now let's talk about--
So let me just-- Yes, go ahead.

00:55:55.952 --> 00:55:59.923 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, that would suggest
that the higher dimensional--

00:55:59.923 --> 00:56:02.659 align:middle line:84%
dimensions are what are
giving the time codes

00:56:02.659 --> 00:56:03.694 align:middle line:90%
into the ninth dimension.

00:56:03.694 --> 00:56:04.895 align:middle line:90%
You see what I mean?

00:56:04.895 --> 00:56:07.164 align:middle line:84%
We don't-- we supposedly
don't have access to that.

00:56:07.164 --> 00:56:09.499 align:middle line:84%
Okay and let's talk
about Harmonic.

00:56:09.499 --> 00:56:11.201 align:middle line:84%
We just have a couple
of minutes left here.

00:56:11.201 --> 00:56:12.269 align:middle line:90%
I want to go back to this

00:56:12.269 --> 00:56:13.704 align:middle line:84%
because something
was really happening,

00:56:13.704 --> 00:56:17.107 align:middle line:84%
going back to the Harmonic
Convergence, August 16, 1987.

00:56:17.107 --> 00:56:19.076 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people were
somewhere at that time

00:56:19.076 --> 00:56:20.444 align:middle line:90%
and they may remember.

00:56:20.444 --> 00:56:25.082 align:middle line:84%
But there were supposedly a
galactic synchronization beam.

00:56:25.082 --> 00:56:27.150 align:middle line:84%
It says here that was
to take us to the stage

00:56:27.150 --> 00:56:31.855 align:middle line:84%
of our evolution biologically to
move beyond the reptilian model.

00:56:31.855 --> 00:56:33.924 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I think people
want to hear in all this

00:56:33.924 --> 00:56:35.959 align:middle line:84%
that we're moving beyond
the reptilian model.

00:56:35.959 --> 00:56:38.695 align:middle line:84%
So I was the publisher,
Jose Arguelles.

00:56:38.695 --> 00:56:42.065 align:middle line:84%
Yes. And then I was very
active in Harmonic Convergence

00:56:42.065 --> 00:56:45.102 align:middle line:84%
at [inaudible] north
of Mexico City.

00:56:45.102 --> 00:56:49.005 align:middle line:84%
And I experienced the galactic
synchronization beam during

00:56:49.005 --> 00:56:50.407 align:middle line:90%
those ceremonies.

00:56:50.407 --> 00:56:54.344 align:middle line:84%
So, this is a fabulous example
of how all those potentialist

00:56:54.344 --> 00:56:56.413 align:middle line:84%
out there which is really
what Jose was saying.

00:56:56.413 --> 00:56:59.249 align:middle line:84%
Yes. And it's there and
the only question is,

00:56:59.249 --> 00:57:00.751 align:middle line:90%
do you hook into it or not?

00:57:00.751 --> 00:57:03.720 align:middle line:84%
And the medial course was
ridiculous, what the media did

00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:07.958 align:middle line:84%
because literally, millions
of people at [inaudible] north

00:57:07.958 --> 00:57:10.861 align:middle line:90%
of Mexico City, I was there.

00:57:10.861 --> 00:57:13.930 align:middle line:84%
There were 100,000
people there and you--

00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:16.099 align:middle line:84%
and the media made it look
like people were out humming

00:57:16.099 --> 00:57:17.367 align:middle line:84%
in the backyard, if
you know what I mean.

00:57:17.367 --> 00:57:20.270 align:middle line:84%
Right. So, as far as I can
tell and many other people

00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:22.472 align:middle line:84%
who participate in this
including yourself,

00:57:22.472 --> 00:57:25.709 align:middle line:84%
we hooked into the galactic
synchronization beam.

00:57:25.709 --> 00:57:27.944 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Now, wouldn't it
make sense that we hooked

00:57:27.944 --> 00:57:30.947 align:middle line:84%
into the galactic
synchronization light?

00:57:30.947 --> 00:57:34.551 align:middle line:84%
You know, that the Forms going
through the seventh dimension?

00:57:34.551 --> 00:57:35.886 align:middle line:90%
Would it make sense that we--

00:57:35.886 --> 00:57:39.356 align:middle line:84%
that Jose kind of let
us into a way to hook

00:57:39.356 --> 00:57:41.825 align:middle line:84%
into those galactic
synchronization beams?

00:57:41.825 --> 00:57:43.160 align:middle line:84%
You know going through
the universe,

00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:45.128 align:middle line:84%
galactic information
highways of life.

00:57:45.128 --> 00:57:46.062 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Would that make
sense to you?

00:57:46.062 --> 00:57:46.897 align:middle line:90%
It makes total sense.

00:57:46.897 --> 00:57:47.964 align:middle line:90%
Because I just did it, you know,

00:57:47.964 --> 00:57:51.168 align:middle line:84%
in a ceremonial situation,
you know.

00:57:51.168 --> 00:57:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And so when we're starting
to tie it all together, now,

00:57:53.570 --> 00:57:59.009 align:middle line:84%
let's look at going from kind of
the basest to the most sublime.

00:57:59.009 --> 00:58:03.647 align:middle line:84%
The global elite have had
control of these species

00:58:03.647 --> 00:58:05.315 align:middle line:90%
and our consciousness anyway.

00:58:05.315 --> 00:58:08.185 align:middle line:84%
You can say it's by design,
you can say it's just kind

00:58:08.185 --> 00:58:10.620 align:middle line:84%
of how things evolved
for a long time

00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:13.490 align:middle line:84%
and this is the opportunity
now with the frequency shifting

00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:17.194 align:middle line:84%
for us to take back the
paradigm we're creating.

00:58:17.194 --> 00:58:18.962 align:middle line:84%
Tell us just in a
minute or so what--

00:58:18.962 --> 00:58:21.064 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's help take
practice our dimension.

00:58:21.064 --> 00:58:22.265 align:middle line:90%
Take back that dimension.

00:58:22.265 --> 00:58:24.267 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's exactly what
it is and so the only way

00:58:24.267 --> 00:58:28.738 align:middle line:84%
that we can take back our
third dimension is to deal with

00:58:28.738 --> 00:58:31.041 align:middle line:84%
and understand the way that
the fourth dimension is

00:58:31.041 --> 00:58:32.242 align:middle line:90%
controlling us.

00:58:32.242 --> 00:58:35.745 align:middle line:84%
And I don't-- I can't see
any reason why, I mean,

00:58:35.745 --> 00:58:39.850 align:middle line:84%
at this point, I'll be-- say
it honestly for maybe 10 years,

00:58:39.850 --> 00:58:42.052 align:middle line:84%
I've understood what was going
on in the fourth dimension.

00:58:42.052 --> 00:58:44.554 align:middle line:84%
And it's not what I'm
doing and I never will.

00:58:44.554 --> 00:58:47.757 align:middle line:84%
And so, it's a matter of
each person taking back their

00:58:47.757 --> 00:58:49.893 align:middle line:84%
consciousness just so
that they have one vote

00:58:49.893 --> 00:58:51.461 align:middle line:90%
in Platonia, you know.

00:58:51.461 --> 00:58:52.929 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely, sure here.

00:58:52.929 --> 00:58:54.598 align:middle line:84%
That's really what
it is, you know.

00:58:54.598 --> 00:58:56.266 align:middle line:84%
[laughter] Barbara, it's
been absolutely delightful.

00:58:56.266 --> 00:58:58.101 align:middle line:84%
I cannot wait for
your novel to come

00:58:58.101 --> 00:58:59.369 align:middle line:90%
out which you're working on.

00:58:59.369 --> 00:59:00.937 align:middle line:84%
You said you've never had
so much fun in your life.

00:59:00.937 --> 00:59:02.239 align:middle line:90%
Yes, right, this call me.

00:59:02.239 --> 00:59:03.707 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to bring
all these concepts together

00:59:03.707 --> 00:59:05.075 align:middle line:90%
in a really revitting manner.

00:59:05.075 --> 00:59:06.042 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yes.

00:59:06.042 --> 00:59:07.344 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile, this
is revitting in

00:59:07.344 --> 00:59:09.279 align:middle line:84%
and of itself even
though it's non-fiction,

00:59:09.279 --> 00:59:10.780 align:middle line:90%
how can we have nine dimensions.

00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:13.016 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
a lifetime of work.

00:59:13.016 --> 00:59:14.284 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you.

00:59:14.284 --> 00:59:16.119 align:middle line:84%
And I know you're going to
come back, when you get--

00:59:16.119 --> 00:59:17.087 align:middle line:90%
when the next book is done?

00:59:17.087 --> 00:59:18.455 align:middle line:90%
Yes. Will you join us again?

00:59:18.455 --> 00:59:19.122 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes. Very good.

00:59:19.122 --> 00:59:19.990 align:middle line:90%
Okay, thank you.

00:59:19.990 --> 00:59:21.291 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:59:21.291 --> 00:59:23.360 align:middle line:84%
[laughter] I hope this has
been an illuminating journey

00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:24.828 align:middle line:84%
over these last two
conversations

00:59:24.828 --> 00:59:26.296 align:middle line:90%
as Barbara has stated by owning

00:59:26.296 --> 00:59:28.265 align:middle line:84%
on our own multidimensional
nature

00:59:28.265 --> 00:59:30.367 align:middle line:84%
and using the forces
available to us,

00:59:30.367 --> 00:59:34.104 align:middle line:84%
we can create a new golden
age together freeing ourselves

00:59:34.104 --> 00:59:35.839 align:middle line:84%
from the control
of lesser forces.

00:59:35.839 --> 00:59:37.974 align:middle line:84%
You can pick up a copy
of Barbara's book Alchemy

00:59:37.974 --> 00:59:39.843 align:middle line:84%
of Nine Dimensions
which features all

00:59:39.843 --> 00:59:43.213 align:middle line:84%
of the information we've spoken
about plus beautiful meditations

00:59:43.213 --> 00:59:45.148 align:middle line:90%
for each dimensional learning.

00:59:45.148 --> 00:59:47.484 align:middle line:84%
Buy it at Amazon and
other major book sellers.

00:59:47.484 --> 00:59:51.187 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
