>>REGINA MEREDITH: One of
my favorite publications

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.330 align:middle line:10%
is Popular Mechanics
these days, and that's

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.630 align:middle line:10%
because they're diving right
into the center of the UFO issue

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.500 align:middle line:10%
and consciousness itself.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.890 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, other media
only pay lip service

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.740 align:middle line:84%
to the existence of other
civilizations, which

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.470 align:middle line:84%
has led activist Attorney
Daniel Sheehan to begin

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.600 align:middle line:84%
taking real action
toward public disclosure.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.920 align:middle line:90%
Good to see you again, Danny.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.450 align:middle line:90%
>>DANIEL SHEEHAN: Terrific.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.050 align:middle line:90%
Great, Regina.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.320 align:middle line:90%
It's good to be here again.

on right now, right now.

00:00:46.087 --> 00:00:46.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: There is.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you know, I had a
whole conversation planned out.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.018 align:middle line:84%
We'll get to some
of it, but I want

00:00:51.018 --> 00:00:54.200 align:middle line:84%
to tell a tiny little
story about you and I, just

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.950 align:middle line:90%
for people to set this up.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.120 align:middle line:90%
I met you.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.160 align:middle line:84%
I was at the International
UFO Congress.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.960 align:middle line:84%
And that was in Laughlin,
Nevada for many, many years.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.519 align:middle line:90%
And someone was speaking.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.330 align:middle line:84%
I must not have been
interested, nor were you,

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.765 align:middle line:84%
and I were sitting on a park
bench next to the river,

00:01:10.765 --> 00:01:12.640 align:middle line:84%
and no one else was out
there, and I happened

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.060 align:middle line:90%
to be on that park bench.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.790 align:middle line:84%
We started chatting,
and you told me--

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.760 align:middle line:84%
I said something about President
Bush, who had been elected--

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.930 align:middle line:90%
had just been elected.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.090 align:middle line:84%
You said, Well, you don't think
you actually have a say in that,

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.890 align:middle line:90%
do you?

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.430 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, what
are you speaking of?

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.060 align:middle line:90%
That is so jaded.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.930 align:middle line:84%
And you said, No, these
things are actually

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.710 align:middle line:90%
done well in advance.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And you said, For
example, John Kerry

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.650 align:middle line:84%
was going to become the
presidential candidate in 2004.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.380 align:middle line:90%
So this was 2001, we met.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, how
do you know that?

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And you said, This stuff
is done behind the scenes.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.280 align:middle line:90%
And I felt--

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.500 align:middle line:84%
I was intrigued, certainly,
but I was very disheartened.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.440 align:middle line:84%
Sure enough, 2004 comes, and
there we have John Kerry.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.150 align:middle line:84%
But I started noticing how
the media manipulated it

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.420 align:middle line:84%
from the very beginning
to make sure that he

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.250 align:middle line:84%
was going to get it from a
popular point of view as well.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.580 align:middle line:84%
In that matrix, how
do these things work?

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.990 align:middle line:90%
You say it's pre-selected.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.870 align:middle line:84%
They just have to
manipulate the public

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.710 align:middle line:90%
to go a certain direction?

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:12.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Well, yes.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.240 align:middle line:10%
I mean, some of
the things are very

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.850 align:middle line:10%
clear is that the general
population is basically up

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.500 align:middle line:10%
until they had primaries, the
Democratic National committee

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.090 align:middle line:10%
and Republican National
Committee, respectively,

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.840 align:middle line:10%
chose who the candidates
were going to be,

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.380 align:middle line:10%
and they're the ones that
set up the debates, following

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.900 align:middle line:10%
the original 1960 debate.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And they would hone
the list of people

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.190 align:middle line:84%
that are going to be allowed
to be on the debate stage,

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.595 align:middle line:90%
and that they--

00:02:45.595 --> 00:02:46.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Limit perception.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And as
you know, they end up

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.880 align:middle line:84%
feeding the questions
ahead of time to the person

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.050 align:middle line:84%
that they want to
be the nominee.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.910 align:middle line:10%
And so that manipulation, that
Machiavellian manipulation

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.230 align:middle line:10%
was going on with both
of the political parties.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And I knew,
as early as 1986,

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.420 align:middle line:84%
that John Kerry was lined up to
get to be the candidate later.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And I talked
to Tip O'Neill about it.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.820 align:middle line:84%
I talked to Claiborne
Pell about it.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I
recommended John Kerry

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.900 align:middle line:84%
to be the head of the
Special Select Committee

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.130 align:middle line:84%
to investigate the
Iran-Contra stuff.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.210 align:middle line:84%
So you knew he was
already being positioned

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:33.830 align:middle line:90%
to be in a position of power?

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Well, the
quote from Tip O'Neill,

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.522 align:middle line:84%
he said, look, you've shown
me all your complaint.

00:03:40.522 --> 00:03:42.980 align:middle line:84%
You've got here the federal
criminal racketeering complaint

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.410 align:middle line:84%
against the
off-the-shelf enterprise.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.590 align:middle line:84%
I need you to go over
and meet with Claiborne

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.050 align:middle line:90%
Pell on the Senate side.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.100 align:middle line:84%
Tip was the Speaker of
the House at the time.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.600 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted you to go over
and meet with Claiborne

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.570 align:middle line:84%
on the Senate
side, because he is

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.490 align:middle line:84%
the ranking member of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee,

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:02.650 align:middle line:84%
and they're going
to be the ones that

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.400 align:middle line:84%
are going to have to
have a special Select

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.200 align:middle line:84%
Committee to study this stuff
that you're talking about.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you go there,
and you tell them

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.600 align:middle line:84%
you want the Select
Committee appointed,

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.790 align:middle line:90%
if we win the Senate back.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.370 align:middle line:90%
And this is in November of '86.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.195 align:middle line:90%
He said, You tell him.

00:04:18.195 --> 00:04:19.570 align:middle line:84%
He's going to ask
you, Who do you

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.470 align:middle line:84%
think should chair
that Select Committee?

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:22.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you said--

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: You should tell it.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.605 align:middle line:84%
He said, Tip O'Neill, you
should tell him, John Kerry.

00:04:25.605 --> 00:04:25.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: John Kerry.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: He said
he loves John Kerry.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.470 align:middle line:84%
He said, we kid
him that John Kerry

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.190 align:middle line:90%
must be his illegitimate son.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.340 align:middle line:84%
He said-- so he
thinks John Kerry is

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.670 align:middle line:90%
going to be president someday.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.790 align:middle line:84%
I said to Tip, I said,
Well, that's interesting

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.063 align:middle line:90%
because so does John Kerry.

00:04:38.063 --> 00:04:38.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: He laughed then.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.520 align:middle line:84%
And so we knew all
the way then, I

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.860 align:middle line:84%
knew that John Kerry shut
down that investigation.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's how he got
to be the nominee.

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this begs
a much larger question

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.780 align:middle line:90%
on all of it-- all of it.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.630 align:middle line:84%
How much is preordained by
hidden hands versus the public's

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.340 align:middle line:84%
actual enthusiastic
participation.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.830 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems like it's
just a pure manipulation.

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Well, this is
a challenge, actually,

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.370 align:middle line:84%
of the American
Educational system.

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.860 align:middle line:84%
We've got to educate our
students to actually participate

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:14.800 align:middle line:90%
as citizens.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.600 align:middle line:90%
Most people don't.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.233 align:middle line:84%
They don't even vote until
a presidential election.

00:05:20.233 --> 00:05:22.150 align:middle line:84%
They don't even vote in
the interim elections,

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.340 align:middle line:90%
a lot of people.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.090 align:middle line:84%
The voting rate
falls way below 50%

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.710 align:middle line:84%
in the non-presidential
election years.

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.230 align:middle line:90%
And you get up around 52%, 53%.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.040 align:middle line:84%
62% is the highest
we've ever had.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.290 align:middle line:90%
And that was with Obama.

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you think
if we were actually

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.600 align:middle line:84%
critically thinking, informed
people, that our presence would

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.400 align:middle line:90%
make a difference?

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.817 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Well,
it's interesting.

00:05:43.817 --> 00:05:45.190 align:middle line:90%
That's the right question.

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.240 align:middle line:84%
It would, at least, exhaust all
of our administrative remedies,

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.430 align:middle line:84%
as we say, that we would
have made our best effort.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.670 align:middle line:84%
And then we'd have the
people in a position

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.800 align:middle line:84%
where with a little
bit more oomph

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.210 align:middle line:84%
on the thing over
a particular issue,

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.390 align:middle line:90%
you can really drive it home.

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:04.130 align:middle line:84%
Because the particular
elected representatives,

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.780 align:middle line:84%
once you establish a
linkage into all 435

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.520 align:middle line:84%
congressional
districts, that's what

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.720 align:middle line:84%
we're doing right now in
the New Paradigm Institute.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.400 align:middle line:84%
We're setting up full teams in
all 435 congressional districts.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.310 align:middle line:84%
And that way, they
have the ability

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:23.170 align:middle line:84%
to unseat a particular person
in the House or Senate.

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:25.970 align:middle line:84%
That's what the people, the
elected leaders are afraid of.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:26.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, of
course, they are.

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:28.847 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And of course,
the elected leaders,

00:06:28.847 --> 00:06:31.430 align:middle line:84%
the problem is, they are
also being dictated to.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.030 align:middle line:84%
And so that they've got-- we've
got to give them the ability

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:37.280 align:middle line:84%
to say to the people to
whom they answer, look,

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.710 align:middle line:90%
I had to do it.

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.720 align:middle line:84%
I had to do this, because my
people would have unelected me.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't be here to
do what you need me to do.

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:45.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
let's talk about that.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.550 align:middle line:84%
So you just said,
so those people

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.170 align:middle line:84%
at the top, those elected
leaders, are told by others.

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:53.400 align:middle line:84%
So that's where I wanted
to go in this conversation

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.290 align:middle line:84%
at some point is, the
whole hidden hand thing.

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:57.370 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we're sick of it.

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:59.250 align:middle line:90%
We feel it.

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.150 align:middle line:90%
It's tyrannical.

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:02.950 align:middle line:84%
We don't want it
anymore as humans,

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:05.350 align:middle line:84%
but don't know the faces,
don't know the names,

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:07.290 align:middle line:84%
don't know who's
controlling what,

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:11.130 align:middle line:84%
just that it is being-- this
reality is being controlled.

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.840 align:middle line:84%
So now one of the things
you're trying to do,

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.880 align:middle line:84%
which has been very tightly
controlled, is not--

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:22.380 align:middle line:84%
beyond disclosure, really,
but full-on real disclosure,

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.840 align:middle line:84%
starting to go
back to real cases

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.690 align:middle line:84%
that were documented that the
government is fully aware of.

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that is happening now,

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:36.990 align:middle line:84%
that these there's going to be
this release of information,

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:42.960 align:middle line:84%
regarding our government's
interaction with craft and space

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.110 align:middle line:90%
entities, ETs.

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:44.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Yes.

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:46.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
are part of this,

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.857 align:middle line:84%
and you've been part of this
whole thing with the New York

00:07:48.857 --> 00:07:51.030 align:middle line:84%
Times and TikTok and
that whole thing.

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.280 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
where you are,

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.090 align:middle line:84%
where you're trying
to take all of this,

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:59.020 align:middle line:84%
and we'll get into some of
the juicy anecdotal stuff

00:07:59.020 --> 00:07:59.820 align:middle line:90%
along the way.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Well, the
key is, as I mentioned,

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:06.290 align:middle line:84%
that we've established a
New Paradigm Institute.

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:09.860 align:middle line:84%
This is the Romero
Institute, which

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:13.300 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that are the
progeny of the Christic

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:14.100 align:middle line:90%
Institute.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:17.000 align:middle line:84%
The Christic Institute is what
we set up out of Washington, DC,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.130 align:middle line:90%
back in 1980.

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And we did the Karen
Silkwood case--

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:23.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: --ended
up shutting down

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.860 align:middle line:84%
the facility from which they
were smuggling bomb grade

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:31.040 align:middle line:84%
plutonium to Israel
for their weapons.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.030 align:middle line:90%
We did the Iran-Contra case.

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:36.440 align:middle line:84%
We shut down the weapons supply,
the covert weapons supply

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.000 align:middle line:84%
that was being
brought to the Contras

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.610 align:middle line:90%
by the Reagan-Bush people.

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:42.390 align:middle line:90%
We've done a number of these.

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:44.530 align:middle line:84%
We're the ones that
stopped them from pumping

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:46.180 align:middle line:84%
all the radioactive
effluents out

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.900 align:middle line:84%
of the Three-Mile Island
facility into the Susquehanna

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:49.700 align:middle line:90%
River.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:53.320 align:middle line:84%
So we pushed that
as far as we could,

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.980 align:middle line:84%
with Chris Dick
and George HW Bush,

00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:01.750 align:middle line:84%
when he got elected in
1992 for a second term.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:05.170 align:middle line:84%
Because we'd been working with
Ross Perot, and Ross Perot

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:08.950 align:middle line:84%
came into the 1992
election, as you recall,

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:11.260 align:middle line:90%
and took 19% of the vote.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And all of it was basically
away from George Bush.

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:21.550 align:middle line:10%
And so, actually, Bill Clinton
won the election with only 43%

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:23.590 align:middle line:10%
of the popular vote.

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:28.790 align:middle line:84%
So we've been involved,
intimately, in George Bush Sr.

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:32.740 align:middle line:84%
because of that ordered the
IRS to revoke our Christic

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:35.062 align:middle line:84%
Institute's 501(c)(3)
tax exempt charter.

00:09:35.062 --> 00:09:36.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's how
you go after people.

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:38.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And so
that's how we then

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:39.640 align:middle line:90%
set up the Romero Institute.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And the Romero
Institute are the ones

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:45.580 align:middle line:84%
that have created this
New Paradigm Institute.

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And what we're doing
is we're organizing,

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:52.660 align:middle line:84%
in all 435 congressional
districts, the house districts,

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:55.830 align:middle line:84%
teams of people who will go
to their local newspapers

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:57.690 align:middle line:84%
and write letters
to the editor, get

00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:00.940 align:middle line:84%
on the local television, their
cable television stations,

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.400 align:middle line:84%
and write letters to their
congressmen and senators.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:04.590 align:middle line:90%
That's what we're doing.

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:07.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To start getting the
ball rolling on true disclosure.

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:08.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: On true disclosure.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:12.450 align:middle line:84%
And the initial
issue in disclosure

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:16.270 align:middle line:84%
is the UFO information and the
extraterrestrial information.

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:18.840 align:middle line:84%
But disclosure-- the
Disclosure Project

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.130 align:middle line:84%
is aiming for more
than just that.

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:24.270 align:middle line:84%
It's also disclosing,
for example, the stuff

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:26.050 align:middle line:90%
about the JFK assassination.

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:27.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to get
into that in just a second.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:28.030 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's exactly right.

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:29.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I definitely
want to go down there.

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:31.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: But major things
that have been covered up,

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:35.580 align:middle line:84%
and they're being covered up by
a little cabal, a small cabal

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.722 align:middle line:84%
of the people that you're
asking about is, who is it this?

00:10:38.722 --> 00:10:39.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Who are they?

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.510 align:middle line:90%
We all talk about the they.

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:42.630 align:middle line:90%
Who are they?

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:46.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Well,
actually, the tightest

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:51.890 align:middle line:84%
link onto it that we've got
is an executive committee

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:58.255 align:middle line:84%
of the International Sovereign
Order of the Knights of Malta.

00:10:58.255 --> 00:11:00.860 align:middle line:90%


00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:02.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK,
that's interesting.

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:05.172 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: There's a thing--
there's a thing called the Monte

00:11:05.172 --> 00:11:10.110 align:middle line:84%
Carlo Committee, which is
made up of about 6 to 8 men,

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:11.460 align:middle line:90%
actually, at any given time.

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:15.170 align:middle line:84%
There's, apparently,
a woman on it now.

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:19.550 align:middle line:84%
But the bottom line is that
this is where it shakes down to,

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:21.060 align:middle line:90%
when you track it all back.

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So extraordinarily
old wealth and influence.

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:24.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Yes.

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:26.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And hidden
from public view,

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:28.830 align:middle line:84%
so you never know
their identities,

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:31.700 align:middle line:84%
but they have the
ability to call anyone.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:33.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: They-- yeah.

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:35.100 align:middle line:90%
They don't even call them.

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:38.270 align:middle line:84%
They just push a button,
and the word goes out.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:42.550 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, as I say, that you track
through the different layers

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:46.310 align:middle line:84%
of this, and it ends up
getting to a place like that.

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:47.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:48.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: The
first layer of this

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:57.160 align:middle line:84%
is going to be the leadership of
an unacknowledged special access

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.070 align:middle line:84%
Defense Department
program that's called

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:02.900 align:middle line:90%
the Immaculate Constellation.

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.920 align:middle line:84%
There's a group of
people that run that,

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:11.200 align:middle line:84%
and they are answerable to a
group called the Legacy Group.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.020 align:middle line:84%
The Legacy Group is more
than just that one program,

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:19.730 align:middle line:84%
but they oversee the UFO issue,
and they have overseen this.

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:22.850 align:middle line:84%
It's the progeny
of the Majestic 12.

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:25.630 align:middle line:84%
It's known about,
the magic group

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:30.560 align:middle line:84%
that was assigned by
Truman in the modern era.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:34.430 align:middle line:84%
This started in December
of 1945, actually,

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:40.110 align:middle line:84%
with the recovery of $1.2
trillion in gold bullion,

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:45.090 align:middle line:84%
in silver bullion, and platinum
and big 50-gallon drums

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:49.440 align:middle line:84%
of diamonds and rubies, and from
the Philippine Islands that were

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:52.770 align:middle line:84%
put there by the Japanese when
they thought we were going to be

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:54.790 align:middle line:90%
invading the Japanese islands.

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:57.960 align:middle line:84%
This was a treasure that
had been put together

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:01.650 align:middle line:84%
by a secret group in
the Japanese military,

00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:04.980 align:middle line:90%
leading up to World War II.

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.435 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So Hiroshita would
have been involved in that?

00:13:07.435 --> 00:13:08.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Yeah, Yakushima.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yakushima,
the military?

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:11.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Yeah.

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:14.530 align:middle line:90%
It was called the Golden Lily.

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:15.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:16.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And
they're the ones that

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:20.310 align:middle line:84%
gathered all of this treasure
together, all throughout Asia,

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:23.710 align:middle line:84%
building up a massive war chest
for Japan, the Empire of Japan.

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:27.960 align:middle line:84%
And when they knew that
the Germans had surrendered

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.760 align:middle line:84%
in May of 1945, and we were
all-- the Allies were turning

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.510 align:middle line:84%
their attention to the
islands and getting

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:35.870 align:middle line:84%
ready to do the
invasion, they started

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:38.910 align:middle line:84%
shipping this secret troughs
of gold out of there.

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And there were 176
separate deep mine

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.465 align:middle line:84%
shafts that were dug in
the Philippine Islands,

00:13:46.465 --> 00:13:47.340 align:middle line:90%
and they were buried.

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:53.210 align:middle line:84%
Each one of them had $100
billion in gold and platinum

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:55.320 align:middle line:90%
and silver and jewels.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they talk
about the recovery of that?

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:00.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Yeah, but not-- all
they recovered was 12 of them.

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:02.430 align:middle line:90%
And that was Ed Lansdale.

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:04.670 align:middle line:84%
Ed Lansdale was
the G-2 in Manila,

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:06.690 align:middle line:90%
back in December of 1945.

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And what he did is
when he punched--

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:14.330 align:middle line:84%
what he did is when
Yakushima turned himself in,

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:20.390 align:middle line:84%
after the bombing of Hiroshima
and Nagasaki in August of 1945,

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:21.930 align:middle line:90%
the Japanese surrendered.

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:26.480 align:middle line:84%
And when Yakushima turned
himself in, what Lansdale did--

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:32.130 align:middle line:84%
Ed Lansdale, the G-2, head of
army intelligence in Manila,

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:36.280 align:middle line:84%
kidnapped his driver, who had
driven him around when they

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:41.080 align:middle line:90%
buried these 176 treasures.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And they found 12 of
them from torturing him.

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:46.960 align:middle line:84%
They punched one of
them and discovered

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:50.290 align:middle line:84%
that it had the $100 billion
worth of gold and silver

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:54.790 align:middle line:84%
and platinum and jewels, and
Ed Lansdale flew immediately

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:57.100 align:middle line:84%
to Singapore to
meet with MacArthur,

00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:59.600 align:middle line:84%
who was the head of the
Pacific Theater at that time,

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.220 align:middle line:84%
and told him what
they had found.

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And MacArthur sent him,
that is, Ed Lansdale,

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:09.310 align:middle line:84%
with MacArthur's G-2,
George Willoughby.

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:11.510 align:middle line:84%
And they flew all the
way to Washington, DC,

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:13.420 align:middle line:90%
to meet with Truman.

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:15.630 align:middle line:84%
And the chief of
staff wouldn't let

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:18.130 align:middle line:84%
them meet with him, unless they
told the chief of staff what

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:19.070 align:middle line:90%
it was about.

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:21.820 align:middle line:84%
That Chief of Staff
was Clark Clifford,

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:24.550 align:middle line:84%
and they told him--
they had the meeting.

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:27.880 align:middle line:84%
When Truman started
realizing that they

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:32.490 align:middle line:84%
had gotten hold of $1.2
trillion in these 12 tranches,

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:34.860 align:middle line:84%
that he called in
General Stilwell

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:38.250 align:middle line:84%
the Secretary of War,
and his three deputies--

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:45.330 align:middle line:84%
Robert Lovett, John Jay
McCloy, and Robert Anderson.

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And Truman put these people
in charge of a secret trust

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:53.290 align:middle line:90%
to control all of that money.

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And they shipped it out
with US military transports

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:59.710 align:middle line:84%
to the International Credit
Bank in Geneva, Switzerland,

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:01.710 align:middle line:84%
and deposited it
there and then began

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:04.110 align:middle line:84%
to write gold
certificates, issue gold

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:07.350 align:middle line:84%
certificates from that bank,
which they used as bearer bonds.

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:10.630 align:middle line:84%
And it became the source of
a major covert operation.

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And they stopped the election
of any of the resistance--

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:19.200 align:middle line:84%
the resistance fighters
against the Nazis and stuff,

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.440 align:middle line:84%
the partisans,
because they perceived

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:26.350 align:middle line:90%
them to be anti-fascist.

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And they viewed that
as being socialist.

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.460 align:middle line:90%
And so they were opposing.

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:33.570 align:middle line:84%
So that's the very first one
of this little coven of group

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:34.503 align:middle line:90%
that got put together.

00:16:34.503 --> 00:16:36.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, so where
does the Legacy Group?

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:37.680 align:middle line:84%
Do they come down
the road from that?

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:39.263 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: The
Legacy-- what happened,

00:16:39.263 --> 00:16:40.860 align:middle line:90%
that was in December of 1945.

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:45.750 align:middle line:84%
Then, two years later, in
1947, with the Roswell crash

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:49.560 align:middle line:84%
in July, what happened is
when they notified Truman

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.930 align:middle line:84%
that they had recovered this
craft, which they brought

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:55.470 align:middle line:84%
to the Wright
field at that time,

00:16:55.470 --> 00:17:00.565 align:middle line:84%
that Truman then convened
another group of people saying,

00:17:00.565 --> 00:17:02.940 align:middle line:84%
I've already done this with
regard to the secret treasure

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:03.840 align:middle line:90%
that we have.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.410 align:middle line:90%
And he did the same thing again.

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And he put together
this group that's

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:10.960 align:middle line:84%
been referred to as
the Magic Group, MJ-12.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:11.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: MJ-12.

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:14.393 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: But this
has become the prodigy

00:17:14.393 --> 00:17:15.810 align:middle line:84%
of this-- this has
come down to be

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:19.050 align:middle line:84%
this new group, this group
that is presently operating

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:24.030 align:middle line:84%
called the Legacy Group, that
they are the legacy of magic.

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And that group is
the one that oversees

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:30.480 align:middle line:84%
the secrets about the
UFOs and the contact

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.590 align:middle line:84%
with an extraterrestrial
civilization.

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And this is the height of the
power inside the United States.

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.600 align:middle line:84%
This has to do with the
unique United States power.

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:44.015 align:middle line:84%
Now, this other group
that I'm talking about--

00:17:44.015 --> 00:17:45.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What did
you call them again?

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: They actually called
the Monte Carlo Committee.

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:48.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:49.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: OK.

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And this group runs
out through different--

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:54.010 align:middle line:84%
there's a thing
called Le Circle--

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:56.940 align:middle line:90%
Le Cirque, that there's--

00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:02.280 align:middle line:84%
what this is an
international fascist cabal

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:07.050 align:middle line:84%
that they believe, pursuant
to the writings of Mussolini,

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:10.710 align:middle line:84%
that the best
economic structure is

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:16.410 align:middle line:84%
to have the major corporations
owned by private shareholders

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:20.010 align:middle line:84%
and that the corporations
exercise control

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:22.080 align:middle line:90%
over the elected governments.

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And what they do is,
they get the governments

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:26.700 align:middle line:84%
to put the instrumentalities
of the state

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:29.778 align:middle line:84%
at the disposal of the
interests of the corporations,

00:18:29.778 --> 00:18:32.070 align:middle line:84%
and they believe that what's
good for General Motors is

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:33.360 align:middle line:90%
good for the country.

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.130 align:middle line:90%
They actually believe that.

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:38.460 align:middle line:84%
So they have a certain
ideological and economic belief

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:41.740 align:middle line:84%
that tracks all the way back
to Brown Brothers Harriman.

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:44.460 align:middle line:84%
Brown Brothers
Harriman is the group

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:48.510 align:middle line:84%
of the Robber Barons, the
Rockefellers and the E.H.

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:50.730 align:middle line:90%
Harriman and the Du Ponts.

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:58.540 align:middle line:84%
And you take, maybe 20
of the Robber Barons--

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:00.390 align:middle line:84%
major Robber Barons,
and they became

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:02.820 align:middle line:84%
private investors in
an investment group

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:05.760 align:middle line:84%
called Brown Brothers
Harriman in New York City.

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And this is the group that set
up at the end of World War I,

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:12.720 align:middle line:90%
actually--

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:18.420 align:middle line:84%
They set up a fund to create a
bank, called Union Bank of New

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:21.750 align:middle line:84%
York, which set up a
foreign subsidiary up

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:24.830 align:middle line:84%
in the Netherlands, called the
Bank of Shipping and Commerce.

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:27.220 align:middle line:84%
They financed the construction
of the International

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:30.250 align:middle line:84%
headquarters of the Third
Reich to set them up

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:32.530 align:middle line:84%
as the bulwark
against Bolshevism

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:37.870 align:middle line:84%
in Europe, to block the
socialists entry into Europe.

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And this group at
Brown Brothers Harriman

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:43.510 align:middle line:84%
turned their attention
westward, across the Pacific,

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:46.420 align:middle line:84%
to overthrow the
Hawaiian Islands

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:50.330 align:middle line:84%
and to take Guam and begin to
move into the Asian market.

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:53.650 align:middle line:84%
This is a major
economic cabal that

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:57.440 align:middle line:84%
believes in the kind of
fascist ideology of wedding

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.320 align:middle line:84%
the interests of the
major corporations

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:01.940 align:middle line:84%
to control the
instrumentalities of the state.

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:03.467 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
dealing with here.

00:20:03.467 --> 00:20:04.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But it's global.

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:05.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: It's global.

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:05.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:08.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: But this one is
in was in the United States.

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:11.890 align:middle line:10%
And what's happened is once
the United States got its hands

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:14.920 align:middle line:10%
on the Roswell Craft,
and they realized

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:19.840 align:middle line:10%
that this was a global issue,
that this had to branch out

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:23.973 align:middle line:10%
and have representatives from
other major wealthy families

00:20:23.973 --> 00:20:25.390 align:middle line:10%
and corporations
around the world.

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:27.015 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: At this
point, I have to ask,

00:20:27.015 --> 00:20:29.520 align:middle line:84%
what is it in-- why is
it in their interest

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.740 align:middle line:84%
to see to it that
the population is

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:35.530 align:middle line:84%
kept ignorant of these craft
and events and so forth?

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:40.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Because the
control of the information

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:43.530 align:middle line:84%
that is about the
UFO people, about

00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:46.170 align:middle line:90%
the extraterrestrial people.

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:52.240 align:middle line:84%
These people in this elite
group that I'm talking about,

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.790 align:middle line:84%
the human group, humans
that they're saying,

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:59.680 align:middle line:84%
look at, have us be
your legates here.

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.865 align:middle line:90%
Let us stay in control here.

00:21:02.865 --> 00:21:04.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're pleading
this to the people

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:05.640 align:middle line:90%
or to whoever's above them?

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:06.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: To the ET people.

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:07.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The ET people.

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:09.217 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: That
we'll handle this.

00:21:09.217 --> 00:21:12.750 align:middle line:84%
We'll, in a certain
sense, be your colony,

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:15.330 align:middle line:90%
and we'll handle this.

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:16.990 align:middle line:90%
But you keep yourself secret.

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:18.430 align:middle line:90%
We'll keep ourselves secret.

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And what we'll do is, we'll
control the natural resources

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:22.920 align:middle line:90%
on our planet.

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:28.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think that what the bottom
line is that the ET people view

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:31.380 align:middle line:84%
our Earth as being
extraordinarily important,

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:35.630 align:middle line:84%
because our Earth is one of the
comparatively few planets that

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:39.180 align:middle line:84%
gestates life, that
actually gestates life.

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:42.080 align:middle line:84%
There's a biochemical
process that

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:44.580 align:middle line:84%
goes on our planet
that gestates life.

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:46.310 align:middle line:10%
It, obviously, happens
on other planets,

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:49.250 align:middle line:10%
because there are other
intelligent species

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:50.810 align:middle line:10%
in our galaxy.

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:54.990 align:middle line:84%
But they're comparatively
rare in what they have to do.

00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:57.740 align:middle line:84%
They're interested in making
sure that we don't totally

00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:00.530 align:middle line:84%
destroy the planet,
that we don't blow up

00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:02.820 align:middle line:84%
the planet with
thermonuclear weapons.

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:05.373 align:middle line:84%
That's why they began to
appear so prominently.

00:22:05.373 --> 00:22:07.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I can
understand that, but why

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:10.790 align:middle line:84%
do we need to remain ignorant
of them in those very messages?

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:12.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Because it
would undermine the power

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:14.132 align:middle line:90%
of the elite, if we knew--

00:22:14.132 --> 00:22:15.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The human
elite, their minions.

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:16.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's right.

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:19.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They are overlords,
but they're minions.

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:22.065 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Well, it's an
alliance-- it's an alliance.

00:22:22.065 --> 00:22:25.120 align:middle line:90%


00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:27.550 align:middle line:84%
From their point of view,
it's an intelligent alliance

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:28.540 align:middle line:90%
to establish.

00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:29.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It works for them.

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:31.365 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And it
works for them.

00:22:31.365 --> 00:22:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And to the extent to
which the ET people are

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:37.300 align:middle line:84%
more interested in
maintaining the sustainability

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:39.440 align:middle line:84%
of our planet, the
generation of life,

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:41.950 align:middle line:84%
because I believe that,
based on everything that I've

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:45.610 align:middle line:84%
been told about
this, is that they

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:50.620 align:middle line:84%
harvest life from our planet,
different types of plants

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:55.060 align:middle line:84%
and fauna and flora
and human DNA.

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:59.770 align:middle line:10%
And that they plant it
in other solar systems,

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:02.990 align:middle line:10%
where there are planets that
are capable of sustaining life,

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:05.380 align:middle line:10%
but they haven't
generated life yet.

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And so this is an
extraordinarily valuable

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:09.310 align:middle line:90%
resource, our planet.

00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:10.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, it doesn't
mean they're going--

00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:12.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To be so
self-certain, that it's

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:16.000 align:middle line:84%
keeping people in ignorance
is the only way to do that.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Well, that's
basically from our elite,

00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:21.000 align:middle line:84%
advising them,
saying, look, the best

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.120 align:middle line:84%
way to do this is to have
us remain in control,

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:26.730 align:middle line:90%
and we'll handle this part.

00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:29.460 align:middle line:84%
But the problem
is that they still

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:33.090 align:middle line:84%
have their nationalist
dynamic of the nation

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:35.250 align:middle line:84%
states being in competition
with each other-- the

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:39.850 align:middle line:84%
US versus Russia, the US versus
China, China versus Russia.

00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:44.080 align:middle line:84%
Upon occasion,
India versus China.

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.690 align:middle line:90%
And what they're driving at--

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:47.130 align:middle line:84%
what they're driving
at, is trying

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:52.680 align:middle line:84%
to figure out a way to establish
a one world government, which

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:54.010 align:middle line:90%
is what we keep bumping into.

00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:55.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We keep bumping
into over and over.

00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:56.702 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: This whole process--

00:23:56.702 --> 00:23:59.670 align:middle line:84%
this whole process of
the World Economic Forum,

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:04.200 align:middle line:84%
the United Nations, bringing it
together as a unified planetary

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.170 align:middle line:84%
government so that
they can control it.

00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:10.810 align:middle line:84%
And this is-- I don't usually
get into this kind of detail,

00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:13.610 align:middle line:84%
but its important because
we're at a juncture

00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:17.990 align:middle line:84%
right now, where the newly
elected president, who

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:21.000 align:middle line:84%
has promised to reveal
this information,

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.030 align:middle line:90%
he's been out of the loop.

00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:26.000 align:middle line:84%
He should know better, but
he doesn't, because he hasn't

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.095 align:middle line:90%
come up through the ranks.

00:24:27.095 --> 00:24:29.720 align:middle line:84%
He hasn't come up through being
an elected local representative

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:32.400 align:middle line:84%
and come up through the ranks
to really get used to the fact.

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And so he's been expressing
this distemper of the people

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:40.290 align:middle line:84%
against being manipulated
by this elite.

00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And so that he now comes
into this situation,

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:47.690 align:middle line:84%
where rather than being
elected as a surprise to him

00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:50.280 align:middle line:84%
and everybody else, when he
wasn't really ready for it,

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:53.510 align:middle line:84%
he's gotten himself ready for it
now, and he's come into office.

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And he has taken the
somewhat naive position.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell
everybody about this.

00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:00.198 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But wait
a minute, that's

00:25:00.198 --> 00:25:02.570 align:middle line:84%
what all the other presidents
before him, almost all

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:05.280 align:middle line:84%
of them in modern history,
have said the same thing.

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:07.017 align:middle line:84%
They all want
access to the files.

00:25:07.017 --> 00:25:09.350 align:middle line:84%
They all want to be read in,
and they want to release it

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:10.260 align:middle line:90%
and never do.

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:12.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: But all of them have
come up through the system.

00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:14.900 align:middle line:84%
They've all come up
through the system

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:19.310 align:middle line:84%
of being elected governor in
either Georgia or Arkansas

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:21.560 align:middle line:90%
or Texas.

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.503 align:middle line:84%
And they've come up
through the structure.

00:25:23.503 --> 00:25:24.920 align:middle line:84%
So they've always
known that there

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:27.380 align:middle line:84%
is this kind of--
there's an elite here,

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:29.210 align:middle line:90%
that you can't cross them.

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:30.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But don't
they think they could?

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that was
their stated goal.

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:34.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: No, they didn't--
they didn't realize that this

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:36.080 align:middle line:84%
was such a vital
issue to the elite.

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because I
mean, with Jimmy Carter

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:39.090 align:middle line:84%
that whole thing about
Jimmy Carter being told,

00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:42.358 align:middle line:84%
I remember people talking about
that meeting where he was upset,

00:25:42.358 --> 00:25:44.900 align:middle line:84%
because they said, you, sir,
are not on a need-to-know basis.

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:46.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: That
was George HW Bush.

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:48.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I thought
that was Carter.

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:51.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: No, he was told-- he
told it, because he was the CIA

00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:51.710 align:middle line:90%
director.

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:52.668 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, exactly.

00:25:52.668 --> 00:25:55.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: But the thing
to remember is that--

00:25:55.010 --> 00:26:00.620 align:middle line:84%
so here, you have the elected
president of President Carter,

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:01.950 align:middle line:90%
meeting with who?

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:04.470 align:middle line:84%
The head of the Central
Intelligence, George HW Bush--

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:05.780 align:middle line:90%
George Herbert Walker Bush.

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:09.060 align:middle line:84%
If you go back to Brown
Brothers Harriman,

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:11.370 align:middle line:84%
the CEO of Brown
Brothers Harriman

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:13.920 align:middle line:90%
was George Herbert Walker.

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:15.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:15.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: OK?

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:16.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:18.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: That's George
Herbert Walker, whose

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:20.550 align:middle line:90%
son-in-law was Prescott Bush.

00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:21.630 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:24.220 align:middle line:84%
And he's the grandfather
of George HW--

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:25.560 align:middle line:90%
George Herbert Walker Bush.

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:26.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: So there's
a linkage here

00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:32.380 align:middle line:84%
of staying on top of this
information and the power.

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:37.620 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't until 1947
when they actually picked up

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:40.090 align:middle line:90%
the craft and had the bodies.

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And they knew that
this-- and since Truman

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:45.840 align:middle line:84%
had already set up this
predecessor operation,

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.220 align:middle line:90%
completely different.

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Because of having
found the $1.2 trillion

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.920 align:middle line:84%
in gold and silver and
stuff, that they set up

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.920 align:middle line:84%
this covert program,
basically, an anti-socialist,

00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:01.860 align:middle line:84%
anti-communist, pro-capitalist,
pro-fascist alliance

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:05.740 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the war, that
they had a template for this.

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And so when they got the craft,
and Truman realized, saying,

00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:12.470 align:middle line:84%
holy mackerel, this is even
more important than the fact

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:15.710 align:middle line:84%
that we have this $1.2
trillion in secret gold.

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:18.060 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to set up
something just like this.

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:21.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out,
this is the top dog.

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:24.870 align:middle line:84%
This is the ultimate
information to know.

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:27.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: By the way,
anybody-- one read on it

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:30.620 align:middle line:90%
is The Day After Roswell.

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:32.750 align:middle line:84%
Lieutenant Colonel
Corso, he tells

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:35.540 align:middle line:84%
a lot of details surrounding
that day and what was going on.

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:36.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's right.

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:37.477 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When the
information was

00:27:37.477 --> 00:27:39.470 align:middle line:84%
released to the various
industrial contractors

00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:40.110 align:middle line:90%
and military.

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:41.110 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's right.

00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And so that whole
thing ended up being,

00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:47.090 align:middle line:84%
look, let's get this
information to the corporations.

00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:48.365 align:middle line:90%
The corporations are--

00:27:48.365 --> 00:27:49.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Better
engineer this stuff.

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:50.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's right.

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to supervise
this entire process so that

00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:58.470 align:middle line:84%
the thing that's the hardest to
understand about this is that it

00:27:58.470 --> 00:27:59.270 align:middle line:90%
doesn't--

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:03.420 align:middle line:84%
from at the origins, it doesn't
appear to be sinister to them.

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:05.970 align:middle line:84%
It appears to be just
the smart thing to do,

00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:09.500 align:middle line:84%
because they believe that
they're better equipped

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:10.300 align:middle line:90%
to govern.

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:13.422 align:middle line:84%
They don't believe the regular
people are capable of governing.

00:28:13.422 --> 00:28:15.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Übermensch--
übermensch, right?

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:18.650 align:middle line:84%
They believe-- they believe
have the abilities to manage

00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:19.450 align:middle line:90%
humanity.

00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:20.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: They believe it.

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:23.730 align:middle line:84%
And until we do
our job as citizens

00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:27.840 align:middle line:84%
to get people educated and
trained and willing to read

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:28.903 align:middle line:90%
and do critical thinking.

00:28:28.903 --> 00:28:30.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Critical thinking.

00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:33.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: The problem is
there is some truth to that.

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:35.243 align:middle line:84%
And that's the most
frightening thing.

00:28:35.243 --> 00:28:36.535 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The most frightening.

00:28:36.535 --> 00:28:37.510 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:39.250 align:middle line:90%
We're showing it to be true.

00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:41.167 align:middle line:90%
We are not an educated populace.

00:28:41.167 --> 00:28:42.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: No, no, I know.

00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:43.080 align:middle line:90%
And that's why--

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:43.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's not cool.

00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:46.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: That's why the
reason that the New Paradigm

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:50.370 align:middle line:84%
Institute has been set up is
to break those rules, to get

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:51.940 align:middle line:90%
the information to the people.

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:54.750 align:middle line:84%
Because the state-run schools
aren't going to do it.

00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:58.140 align:middle line:84%
The privately funded elite
schools aren't going to do it.

00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:01.050 align:middle line:84%
So what we have to do is,
we have to have, basically,

00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:04.730 align:middle line:84%
a citizen uprising,
literally uprising--

00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:08.050 align:middle line:84%
rising up and being willing
to spend the time rather than

00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:08.850 align:middle line:90%
spend--

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:10.950 align:middle line:90%
I mean, more people--

00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:14.250 align:middle line:90%
more people by factors of 100.

00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:20.540 align:middle line:84%
A hundred times more citizens
know who the National Football

00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:22.665 align:middle line:84%
Championship in college
was going to be,

00:29:22.665 --> 00:29:24.540 align:middle line:84%
than they know who the
Secretary of State is.

00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:25.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's true.

00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:25.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: OK?

00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:27.703 align:middle line:90%
And part of that is intentional.

00:29:27.703 --> 00:29:28.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is intentional.

00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:29.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: This is bread and--

00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:30.505 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Bread down.

00:29:30.505 --> 00:29:33.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: --bread and
circuses, entertain the people.

00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And so what we've
got to do is have,

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:39.690 align:middle line:84%
in my opinion,
spiritually driven,

00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:42.920 align:middle line:84%
not religiously institutional,
but a spiritually

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:46.320 align:middle line:84%
driven movement to
lift up the people,

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:48.930 align:middle line:84%
rise up, get the
people to listen,

00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:53.000 align:middle line:84%
pay attention, read, or see the
things that they need to see

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.090 align:middle line:84%
and from an upward, positive,
forward movement, not furious,

00:29:58.090 --> 00:29:58.890 align:middle line:90%
not hostile.

00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:01.690 align:middle line:84%
Let's not all hang them,
have a French Revolution,

00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:04.990 align:middle line:84%
where we decapitate
all the ruling class.

00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:08.860 align:middle line:84%
But what we need to do is rise
up and share the information

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:09.800 align:middle line:90%
with the people.

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:12.460 align:middle line:84%
This needs to be a major
transition of getting

00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:15.160 align:middle line:84%
the information
to the people, not

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:16.890 align:middle line:84%
dependent upon the
government to do it.

00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:17.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:19.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: But our
own direct activity,

00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:22.060 align:middle line:84%
getting the information,
establishing direct contact

00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:24.290 align:middle line:84%
with the extraterrestrial
people, saying,

00:30:24.290 --> 00:30:32.260 align:middle line:84%
look, you have chosen to align
with this elite fascist group

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:35.650 align:middle line:84%
of corporate moguls
here on our planet.

00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:38.360 align:middle line:90%
That's not the best choice.

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:42.100 align:middle line:84%
We have to demonstrate that
we merit an alliance with you,

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:43.330 align:middle line:90%
as the people.

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:44.800 align:middle line:90%
Our people need to be educated.

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:46.842 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No matter who
sits in that office, that

00:30:46.842 --> 00:30:48.110 align:middle line:90%
now, is what they have to do.

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:48.460 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Yes.

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:49.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:51.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And so we have to
pass the power to the people.

00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And we, as the people,
have to rise up

00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:56.720 align:middle line:84%
in merit, this type
of responsibility.

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:58.310 align:middle line:90%
It's a tough job.

00:30:58.310 --> 00:31:01.060 align:middle line:90%
You need to pay more attention.

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:04.110 align:middle line:84%
You can't go through-- you can't
go through life being a C minus

00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:07.360 align:middle line:84%
student in high school and
think that's sufficient.

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:09.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: C minus
today would have been

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:12.540 align:middle line:90%
an F minus in previous decades.

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:13.867 align:middle line:90%
It's already the bar so low.

00:31:13.867 --> 00:31:15.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And so
what we've got to do

00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:17.170 align:middle line:90%
now is we've got to mobilize.

00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:20.040 align:middle line:84%
That's what the New Paradigm
Institute is all about.

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:21.790 align:middle line:90%
And we're going to be doing.

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:23.230 align:middle line:90%
We're doing it right now.

00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:26.340 align:middle line:84%
We're organizing people,
I said, in all 435

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:28.480 align:middle line:84%
congressional districts,
all 50 states,

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:31.470 align:middle line:84%
and we're engaged
in a direct outreach

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:33.040 align:middle line:90%
to the extraterrestrial people.

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:33.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:36.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: This is what the
CE-5 stuff is all about.

00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:40.590 align:middle line:84%
This is the direct telepathic
communication with the beings

00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:45.160 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with them, to
earn the trust of the people,

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:49.260 align:middle line:84%
to have them vitiate
the contract or whatever

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:52.048 align:middle line:84%
agreements they've got with
this kind of ruling elites.

00:31:52.048 --> 00:31:54.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thousands of people
are in contact with them.

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:54.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's right.

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:55.480 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:57.313 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This isn't
new or special anymore.

00:31:57.313 --> 00:31:59.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: No, but we've got
to get more and more people

00:31:59.690 --> 00:32:03.830 align:middle line:84%
in contact with them, not be
afraid, not be fearful, not

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:06.390 align:middle line:84%
buy into this, oh, they're
a horrible threat to us,

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:08.408 align:middle line:84%
or, oh, you can't get
near their refers,

00:32:08.408 --> 00:32:10.200 align:middle line:84%
or you're going to get
cancer or something.

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.360 align:middle line:90%
None of that's true.

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:14.630 align:middle line:84%
That is all part of a story
on the part of the governing

00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:18.140 align:middle line:84%
elite, the pillars of
power that they present--

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:19.770 align:middle line:90%
that are presently in charge.

00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:23.040 align:middle line:84%
We have to evolve
beyond that right now.

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not talking
about spending

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:26.430 align:middle line:90%
another 100 years doing this.

00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:29.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about doing this
over the next four years,

00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:32.990 align:middle line:84%
that we've got to dig in and
have a process of getting out

00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:36.350 align:middle line:84%
the information, establishing
direct contact and communication

00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:40.220 align:middle line:84%
with the extraterrestrial
beings and supplant

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:43.320 align:middle line:84%
the ultimate governing
ruling class.

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:45.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, OK, so
just inserting this here,

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:47.040 align:middle line:90%
very simple thought--

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:49.670 align:middle line:84%
up till now, in human
history, we only

00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:51.620 align:middle line:90%
change through a few methods.

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:52.650 align:middle line:90%
We have war.

00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:54.090 align:middle line:90%
We have plague.

00:32:54.090 --> 00:32:56.200 align:middle line:84%
We have environmental
catastrophe,

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:57.890 align:middle line:90%
and we have economic collapse.

00:32:57.890 --> 00:32:59.410 align:middle line:90%
Those are the ways we go down.

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:03.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And-- yeah, and we
have the rising consciousness.

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:05.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I'm about to say.

00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:07.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: There's a
counter process going on.

00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:10.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It seems
that fifth way is now

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:14.530 align:middle line:84%
what we have to focus on, is
that people have to become

00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:17.740 align:middle line:84%
aware, just, first, become
aware of your world around you

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:18.620 align:middle line:90%
and what's going on.

00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:20.170 align:middle line:90%
People like you are educating.

00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:21.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's right.

00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:23.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And our
spiritual alignment

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:26.400 align:middle line:84%
is already starting to shoot
up, at least with a good part

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:27.200 align:middle line:90%
of the population.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:28.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: A major acceleration.

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:29.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that
we have a choice.

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:32.810 align:middle line:84%
We don't go on this
wrecking ball of pendulum--

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:34.640 align:middle line:84%
Democrat, Republican,
Democrat, Republican.

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:36.140 align:middle line:84%
It's just going
to-- it's perpetual.

00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:38.690 align:middle line:84%
It can't stop, because
it's all out of balance.

00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:41.520 align:middle line:84%
But the people themselves
have to make this choice,

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:42.320 align:middle line:90%
like you said.

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:43.653 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: The people ourselves.

00:33:43.653 --> 00:33:45.020 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: The people ourselves--

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:45.820 align:middle line:10%
ourselves--

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:46.220 align:middle line:10%
>>SHEEHAN: That's right.

00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:47.803 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --have to
make this decision

00:33:47.803 --> 00:33:51.700 align:middle line:84%
to be critically aware
and spiritually aligned

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:54.520 align:middle line:84%
and choose what kind
of future we want.

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:55.480 align:middle line:90%
We've never done that.

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:56.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: No, no, no.

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:58.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: At this point in
history, we've never chosen.

00:33:58.150 --> 00:33:59.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: No, no.

00:33:59.010 --> 00:34:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And we haven't been-- we haven't
been able to, because the people

00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:06.480 align:middle line:84%
were so parochial, and
they only traveled--

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:11.469 align:middle line:84%
Back when the Catholic Church
got set up, 2,000 years ago,

00:34:11.469 --> 00:34:18.270 align:middle line:84%
2025 years ago, that 99.9% of
all the people were completely

00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:19.560 align:middle line:90%
illiterate, you know?

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't go more than
50 miles away from the place

00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:23.500 align:middle line:90%
where they were born.

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:25.900 align:middle line:84%
So they didn't have
any larger perspective.

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And so this-- the people that
were better educated or even

00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:35.130 align:middle line:84%
more intellectually
developed just asserted

00:34:35.130 --> 00:34:36.130 align:middle line:90%
the control over that.

00:34:36.130 --> 00:34:39.699 align:middle line:84%
And it became this elite ruling
class that has, in fact--

00:34:39.699 --> 00:34:41.175 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Governed monarchies.

00:34:41.175 --> 00:34:43.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: In the form
of the royal families.

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And then, it shifted
over to the United States

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.639 align:middle line:84%
with the major corporations
and the elite owners

00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:50.050 align:middle line:84%
of the corporations and
the rich people, et cetera.

00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:53.060 align:middle line:84%
We have to get the information
from the extraterrestrial

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:55.980 align:middle line:84%
people, share it
with the peoples,

00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:58.610 align:middle line:84%
or the people are rising
and rising their information

00:34:58.610 --> 00:35:01.080 align:middle line:84%
and increasing our
levels of consciousness.

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:03.060 align:middle line:84%
All of these things
are important, OK?

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:05.420 align:middle line:84%
But we've got a very
limited period of time,

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:07.610 align:middle line:84%
because the ruling
elite that are

00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:09.440 align:middle line:84%
in charge of the
major corporations

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:12.050 align:middle line:84%
and the wealth of
the planet are so

00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:14.360 align:middle line:84%
desperate to maintain
control of it

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:16.550 align:middle line:84%
and not share it
with the people.

00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:18.800 align:middle line:84%
That they view the
rising of the people

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:23.360 align:middle line:84%
as a threat, a social democratic
movement on the planet

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:24.795 align:middle line:90%
they view as a threat.

00:35:24.795 --> 00:35:26.420 align:middle line:84%
And what they'll do
is they'll threaten

00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:30.280 align:middle line:84%
to blow up the whole world,
rather than relinquish power

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:31.080 align:middle line:90%
to us.

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.788 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everyone
watching this can feel

00:35:32.788 --> 00:35:35.090 align:middle line:90%
that the restriction of that.

00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:36.660 align:middle line:90%
The time has come to end it.

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:37.740 align:middle line:90%
We're all tired of it.

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:39.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And we
have to do the work.

00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:40.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We have
to do the work,

00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:42.770 align:middle line:84%
and that means opening up some
of your psychic abilities.

00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:44.100 align:middle line:84%
I just want to share
one little thing.

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:45.830 align:middle line:84%
So I went out with Steven
Greer a couple of times,

00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:48.410 align:middle line:84%
out in the field for a week
and all that kind of thing,

00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:51.310 align:middle line:84%
doing the gazing, checking
in with what was funny,

00:35:51.310 --> 00:35:53.000 align:middle line:90%
because my bunny ears were up.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.530 align:middle line:84%
Is that in one of them, I kept
talking about, well, there's

00:35:56.530 --> 00:36:00.850 align:middle line:84%
this beautiful semi-transparent
blue elliptical craft sitting

00:36:00.850 --> 00:36:02.780 align:middle line:84%
at the edge of a craig,
blah, blah, blah.

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:04.210 align:middle line:90%
We were out in Joshua Tree.

00:36:04.210 --> 00:36:05.920 align:middle line:84%
The final day, someone
took a photograph

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:09.230 align:middle line:84%
on digital, which was new and
said, Oh my God, there it is.

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:10.930 align:middle line:84%
The next time we
went out, you know

00:36:10.930 --> 00:36:13.670 align:middle line:84%
how we're all looking like
this to the sky for it?

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:17.960 align:middle line:84%
I saw, behind us, all
these little domed craft.

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:22.140 align:middle line:84%
They were watching us, watching
them, totally peacefully.

00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:22.940 align:middle line:90%
It was funny.

00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:24.700 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they knew, I knew.

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:26.260 align:middle line:90%
I was just laughing.

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, they're
actually right here.

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:30.550 align:middle line:84%
They're right here
among us, if we want

00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:32.270 align:middle line:90%
to dial in and chat with them.

00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:34.310 align:middle line:90%
This is not a scary thing.

00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:37.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: But we
have to be able to try

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:42.280 align:middle line:84%
to seal the breach
between, for example,

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:46.240 align:middle line:90%
Steven Greer and Luis Elizondo.

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:47.810 align:middle line:90%
If we continue--

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:49.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We can't to do that.

00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:50.950 align:middle line:84%
It's just tearing that
whole community apart.

00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:51.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: No.

00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:54.700 align:middle line:84%
The fact of the matter is, we
have to be able to do this.

00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:56.617 align:middle line:90%
We can't war against ourselves.

00:36:56.617 --> 00:36:57.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We cannot.

00:36:57.450 --> 00:37:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And Lou and Greer
both come from backgrounds that

00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:05.218 align:middle line:90%
make this still possible, that--

00:37:05.218 --> 00:37:07.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let me just explain
something to the viewers.

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:12.270 align:middle line:84%
So, Lou Elizondo had clearance
and been inside some of this

00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:14.710 align:middle line:84%
and knows what's going
on in the UFO community.

00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:17.040 align:middle line:84%
He was the one that
was on Capitol Hill,

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:19.320 align:middle line:84%
giving testimony that
many of our viewers

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:22.110 align:middle line:84%
saw happening in
November of 2024.

00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:23.110 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's right.

00:37:23.110 --> 00:37:24.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Steven Greer,
we all know Steven.

00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:25.770 align:middle line:90%
He's been here on Gaia.

00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:27.520 align:middle line:84%
He's been taking people
out in the field.

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:31.290 align:middle line:84%
He was responsible for
the original disclosure

00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:32.950 align:middle line:90%
in Washington, DC.

00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:33.760 align:middle line:90%
These two--

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:34.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And I
was legal counsel.

00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:35.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
were legal counsel.

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:36.610 align:middle line:90%
That's where I met you.

00:37:36.610 --> 00:37:37.410 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:40.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And Steven is saying,
look, invite these beings in.

00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:43.300 align:middle line:84%
They're here, that we can
collaborate with them.

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:46.105 align:middle line:84%
And Lou's still giving the
impression, oh, be very afraid.

00:37:46.105 --> 00:37:47.480 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
they're up to.

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:48.280 align:middle line:90%
Not good.

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:52.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And Lou and Steven
Greer have, in my opinion--

00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:55.857 align:middle line:84%
and I've been legal
counsel to both of them.

00:37:55.857 --> 00:37:56.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To both of them.

00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:58.280 align:middle line:90%
I know, you're everywhere.

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:02.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And so, I love them
both, and I know them both.

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And we, as people, who are
genuinely interested in getting

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:13.930 align:middle line:84%
the disclosure, have to be able
to overcome these strange things

00:38:13.930 --> 00:38:14.730 align:middle line:90%
that happen.

00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:17.300 align:middle line:84%
The horizontal
conflicts that we get

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:20.870 align:middle line:84%
into, we've got to show that
we can overcome this, or else,

00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:23.322 align:middle line:84%
the ET people are
going to not trust us.

00:38:23.322 --> 00:38:25.280 align:middle line:84%
They're going to say the
people haven't evolved

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:27.920 align:middle line:84%
to the level of trusting
them with the information

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:31.280 align:middle line:84%
that they have about
new technologies, about

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:34.650 align:middle line:84%
the relationship of
consciousness to technologies.

00:38:34.650 --> 00:38:35.940 align:middle line:90%
They're not going to do that.

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:37.800 align:middle line:90%
So that we have to merit this.

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:40.430 align:middle line:90%
We have to evolve ourselves.

00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:45.560 align:middle line:84%
I, not coincidentally, when
I began this entire mission,

00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:49.055 align:middle line:84%
this journey was at Jesuit
National Headquarters.

00:38:49.055 --> 00:38:49.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I remember.

00:38:49.930 --> 00:38:52.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: I was legal counsel
to Jesuit National Headquarters

00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:55.850 align:middle line:84%
in their social
ministry program.

00:38:55.850 --> 00:39:00.080 align:middle line:84%
This is a social ministry
that we're talking about here.

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:02.350 align:middle line:84%
It's not proselytizing
on behalf of one

00:39:02.350 --> 00:39:05.060 align:middle line:84%
particular religious
institution or denomination.

00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:07.700 align:middle line:84%
It's a social ministry
to the people.

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:10.670 align:middle line:84%
We have to-- that's what the
New Paradigm Institute is,

00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:13.720 align:middle line:84%
it's a social ministry
program of trying

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:15.740 align:middle line:84%
to assist all of
our people together,

00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:17.600 align:middle line:90%
mutually, all of us cooperating.

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:20.380 align:middle line:84%
I have a special kind
of responsibility

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:25.360 align:middle line:84%
to try to work both with
Luis Elizondo and with Steven

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:26.870 align:middle line:90%
to maintain--

00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And I get in some difficulty
with both of them--

00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:32.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:32.910 align:middle line:90%
I hear about it.

00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:35.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: --because
of their desire

00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:37.030 align:middle line:84%
to be in this
dialectical relationship

00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:38.540 align:middle line:90%
with each other, both of them.

00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:42.530 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm saying is that
we have to be able to get--

00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:44.030 align:middle line:84%
in my opinion, I
have to do the very

00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:47.690 align:middle line:84%
best I can to try
to get each of them

00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:51.350 align:middle line:84%
to stop demonizing
the other one.

00:39:51.350 --> 00:39:55.200 align:middle line:84%
Because this is the projection
of the ultimate other--

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:57.080 align:middle line:84%
the projection of
the ultimate other.

00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we
have to get over,

00:39:58.910 --> 00:40:00.530 align:middle line:84%
if we're going to
have a relationship

00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:02.580 align:middle line:84%
with the extraterrestrial
civilization.

00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:06.860 align:middle line:84%
Because if we come at this
with an intrinsic dialectical

00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:09.547 align:middle line:90%
dynamic, it's not going to work.

00:40:09.547 --> 00:40:11.130 align:middle line:84%
They're not going
to let us out there.

00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:13.410 align:middle line:84%
They're going to say, you
guys are way too primitive.

00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:16.820 align:middle line:84%
This us and them
thing, and arming

00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:19.410 align:middle line:84%
yourself to beat up and
vanquish the ultimate other.

00:40:19.410 --> 00:40:20.670 align:middle line:90%
You can't come out here.

00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:21.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But I do have to say--

00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:23.005 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
you pay attention

00:40:23.005 --> 00:40:25.440 align:middle line:84%
to the bashars and the various
channeled groups and such,

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:28.950 align:middle line:84%
but they all say that time
is very rapidly approaching,

00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:31.100 align:middle line:84%
that we will go
into relationship

00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:32.910 align:middle line:90%
with the other species.

00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:35.030 align:middle line:90%
And you're part of that.

00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:37.843 align:middle line:84%
We're the rest of it,
what we decide to do.

00:40:37.843 --> 00:40:38.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Absolutely.

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:40.052 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So we're out of time.

00:40:40.052 --> 00:40:43.060 align:middle line:84%
So how can people
become involved

00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:44.990 align:middle line:90%
in New Paradigm Institute?

00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:47.000 align:middle line:84%
I know you're doing some
calls to action like,

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.050 align:middle line:90%
let's get this together.

00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:48.370 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Yes.

00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:49.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So what can they do?

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:54.280 align:middle line:10%
>>SHEEHAN: They should go
to newparadigminstitute.org.

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:55.400 align:middle line:10%
Very simple.

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:57.040 align:middle line:10%
It's a little hard
to spell paradigm--

00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:02.620 align:middle line:10%
P-A-R-A-D-I-G-M.
newparadigminstitute.org,

00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:04.040 align:middle line:90%
come to that website.

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:05.980 align:middle line:84%
What we're attempting
to do is to bring

00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:11.590 align:middle line:84%
in all of the best effort from
Steven Greer in his work, Luis

00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:13.310 align:middle line:90%
Elizondo and all of the allies.

00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:15.110 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to bring
everybody together.

00:41:15.110 --> 00:41:16.790 align:middle line:90%
We have our own challenges.

00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:19.180 align:middle line:84%
There are other
organizations that view

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:21.050 align:middle line:90%
us as competitive with them.

00:41:21.050 --> 00:41:23.510 align:middle line:90%
We're trying to overcome that.

00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:26.092 align:middle line:90%
We don't want that to happen.

00:41:26.092 --> 00:41:27.800 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to be
friends with everyone.

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:29.592 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to get
everybody to cooperate.

00:41:29.592 --> 00:41:31.460 align:middle line:90%
newparadigminstitute.org.

00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:33.550 align:middle line:84%
And what you're going
to do is come in,

00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:35.770 align:middle line:84%
and many people will
want to become part

00:41:35.770 --> 00:41:38.380 align:middle line:90%
of citizens for disclosure.

00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:41.260 align:middle line:84%
Citizens for
Disclosure is the group

00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:44.870 align:middle line:84%
that's going to be organized
in all 435 congressional.

00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:47.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, we brought it
full circle to where we started.

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:48.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's right.

00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:49.295 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which is perfect.

00:41:49.295 --> 00:41:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And also, I just want
to say-- and tell me

00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:53.487 align:middle line:84%
if I have this right, because
it's been a while since I've

00:41:53.487 --> 00:41:54.410 align:middle line:90%
actually said this.

00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:56.210 align:middle line:90%
You have your degrees.

00:41:56.210 --> 00:41:58.540 align:middle line:90%
You're overeducated, Danny.

00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:02.120 align:middle line:84%
OK, as I understand, you
have PhDs primarily in--

00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:04.810 align:middle line:84%
isn't it theology, ethics,
constitutional law,

00:42:04.810 --> 00:42:05.740 align:middle line:90%
and something else?

00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:06.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Could I be clear?

00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:08.020 align:middle line:84%
Because honesty is
an important part.

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:08.853 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes it is.

00:42:08.853 --> 00:42:10.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: I have
my honors graduate

00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:13.200 align:middle line:84%
from Harvard College in
American Foreign Policy.

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:14.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, OK.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: So with Henry
Kissinger and others,

00:42:17.830 --> 00:42:23.240 align:middle line:84%
all of that group of people
I went on to get my honors.

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And from there, I was the
Rhodes Scholar Nominee

00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:28.180 align:middle line:90%
from Harvard College.

00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:30.410 align:middle line:84%
I ended up going to
Harvard Law School.

00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:33.310 align:middle line:84%
I was the co-founder of the
Harvard Civil Rights Law Review

00:42:33.310 --> 00:42:35.090 align:middle line:90%
with Mark Green out of New York.

00:42:35.090 --> 00:42:38.636 align:middle line:84%
I was in the very first class
with Professor Laurence Tribe.

00:42:38.636 --> 00:42:41.190 align:middle line:90%


00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:45.140 align:middle line:10%
I, then, went on out
practicing, and I practiced law,

00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:47.570 align:middle line:10%
became established
writer/journalists

00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:50.000 align:middle line:10%
to protect their
confidential news sources,

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.080 align:middle line:10%
represented the New York Times
in the Pentagon Papers case,

00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:56.670 align:middle line:10%
and went on to F.
Lee Bailey's office.

00:42:56.670 --> 00:43:00.150 align:middle line:84%
We represented James McCord
in the Watergate burglary.

00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:01.980 align:middle line:84%
That's how I know about
the assassination.

00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:02.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:02.390 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:03.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: And then I ended up--

00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:05.210 align:middle line:90%
I ended up going back.

00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:09.500 align:middle line:84%
Because of the work at the
F. Lee Bailey's office,

00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:11.600 align:middle line:84%
I went back to
Harvard University

00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:16.610 align:middle line:84%
to do the PhD studies in
comparative social ethics.

00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:19.435 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out to be
at the theology school.

00:43:19.435 --> 00:43:20.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, got it.

00:43:20.310 --> 00:43:21.630 align:middle line:90%
So that brings it all together.

00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:23.505 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: I ended up
doing the master's work

00:43:23.505 --> 00:43:26.540 align:middle line:84%
and then was rolling it over
into the PhD at that time

00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:29.460 align:middle line:84%
and got recruited by the
Jesuits National Headquarters.

00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:30.350 align:middle line:90%
And that's how--

00:43:30.350 --> 00:43:30.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
how you started.

00:43:30.870 --> 00:43:33.245 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: --that's how I
ended up at the Jesuit National

00:43:33.245 --> 00:43:35.600 align:middle line:84%
Headquarters and got contacted
when President Carter was

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:38.150 align:middle line:84%
elected, who wanted to
have an investigation

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:40.820 align:middle line:90%
done of the UFO phenomenon.

00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:41.810 align:middle line:90%
That's how I started.

00:43:41.810 --> 00:43:42.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which we read about.

00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:43.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: That's how
I started this journey,

00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:46.230 align:middle line:84%
and that's why it's a
spiritual journey, ultimately.

00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:48.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Danny, I have to
say, you're unbelievable.

00:43:48.450 --> 00:43:50.300 align:middle line:84%
We've closed the circle
for now, and we didn't even

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:52.033 align:middle line:84%
get to some of the
really juicy stuff.

00:43:52.033 --> 00:43:52.950 align:middle line:90%
You have to come back.

00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:53.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: I will.

00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:55.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
don't age, I think,

00:43:55.730 --> 00:43:58.430 align:middle line:84%
because you're running so
much energy and so much good

00:43:58.430 --> 00:44:01.048 align:middle line:84%
intention through
your being, period.

00:44:01.048 --> 00:44:02.090 align:middle line:90%
That's all I want to say.

00:44:02.090 --> 00:44:02.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Thank you.

00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:04.310 align:middle line:84%
I plan to stay here
until we get this done.

00:44:04.310 --> 00:44:05.143 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:44:05.143 --> 00:44:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And no one has worked
harder than you.

00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:09.030 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Danny.

00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And we'll have you on
again soon, because I want

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:11.970 align:middle line:90%
to get to these other things.

00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:12.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Thank you.

00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:15.240 align:middle line:84%
