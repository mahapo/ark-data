00:00:29.082 --> 00:00:31.540 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: We're all
familiar with the nature of pi

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.150 align:middle line:10%
or the Fibonacci sequence,
but our guest, Marty Leeds,

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.790 align:middle line:10%
has created a new
numeric system based

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.030 align:middle line:10%
on a system of numbers of one
through seven and back again.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.240 align:middle line:84%
His life has been
lived in numbers,

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.650 align:middle line:84%
and he's going to share what
numbers are the basis of,

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.200 align:middle line:84%
including the notion
of universal creation,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.310 align:middle line:90%
but Marty, welcome.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTY LEEDS: Thank you.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.449 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Before
we get to all that,

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.985 align:middle line:84%
your mind played in a
lot of different areas,

00:00:52.985 --> 00:00:55.360 align:middle line:84%
and I just need to make a
quick statement before we start

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.800 align:middle line:90%
getting into the math of it.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.380 align:middle line:84%
I can't figure out how two
negatives make a positive,

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.410 align:middle line:84%
and my sweetie is a math
genius and has tried

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.330 align:middle line:90%
to draw models of this for me.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.400 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not completely ignorant,
but I'm more math challenged,

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.410 align:middle line:84%
so you'll have to
explain it to my level.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.650 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully the people watching
this, our viewers, are more

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:15.550 align:middle line:90%
lit up than I am.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: Sure.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But first of
all, you really started

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:18.970 align:middle line:84%
coming from a
place that had more

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.450 align:middle line:84%
to do with mythology,
symbolism, philosophy.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.250 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about this
time of your life.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.830 align:middle line:84%
You were looking for something
and all of your explorations

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.310 align:middle line:90%
and what they were bringing you.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.940 align:middle line:10%
>>LEEDS: Yeah, basically in
my mid 20s I kind of underwent

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.860 align:middle line:10%
an existential crisis--

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.795 align:middle line:10%
basically just hit a wall and
was like, what am I doing here?

00:01:40.795 --> 00:01:41.920 align:middle line:90%
What's the meaning of life?

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.920 align:middle line:90%
Where am I going?

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What were you doing
at that time in your life?

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.057 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of
young man hit this,

00:01:46.057 --> 00:01:47.640 align:middle line:84%
so I want to know
what it looked like.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: Being a punk.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.286 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You were
a little punk.

00:01:50.286 --> 00:01:51.085 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: Yeah.

00:01:51.085 --> 00:01:52.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, pretty rebellious.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.100 align:middle line:90%
Playing rock and roll bands.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.080 align:middle line:90%
Dropped out of college--

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.220 align:middle line:90%
those sorts of things.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.120 align:middle line:84%
So I basically just got to
a point where I was mid-20s,

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.810 align:middle line:84%
maybe 28, something like that,
where I basically just started

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.060 align:middle line:84%
asking some of the
major questions.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And so that sort of led down a
road to looking at everything

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.530 align:middle line:90%
I could get my hands on.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.446 align:middle line:84%
And I've always been a
pretty voracious reader

00:02:14.446 --> 00:02:16.990 align:middle line:84%
since I was like maybe 16,
17 or something like that,

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.680 align:middle line:84%
and then it really kicked
up in the late 20s.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And so it was psychology, and
mythology, and that eventually

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.190 align:middle line:90%
led to math.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.523 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where are you finding
that your life as a punk

00:02:28.523 --> 00:02:30.520 align:middle line:84%
was just becoming
somewhat unsatisfying,

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.130 align:middle line:84%
or was it just like
you're actually using that

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.040 align:middle line:84%
as a vehicle trying to reach
something more inside yourself?

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: I think just
from a very early age

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.290 align:middle line:84%
I just kind of saw the
world as really screwed up,

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.180 align:middle line:84%
and so trying to
make a place, trying

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.712 align:middle line:84%
to find my place in the
world was very difficult.

00:02:45.712 --> 00:02:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that
was really sort

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.600 align:middle line:84%
of the impetus
behind reaching out

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.220 align:middle line:84%
into all of these
different avenues

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.650 align:middle line:84%
and trying to figure out, what
am I doing here, kind of thing.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And so that obviously
led to-- well,

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.050 align:middle line:84%
like I said-- mathematics,
but religion and spirituality

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.972 align:middle line:90%
had a huge part of that.

00:03:01.972 --> 00:03:04.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We'll get into
that, but what's interesting

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.790 align:middle line:84%
is you said around
28, which classically

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.820 align:middle line:84%
in astrology that would be
called the Saturn return.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.300 align:middle line:84%
So you were kind of hitting
the big questions just

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.190 align:middle line:84%
about the time when classically
a person should be doing that,

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.990 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.460 align:middle line:84%
So you were really listening to
higher cycles within yourself.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: Looking
back, yeah, maybe.

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.342 align:middle line:84%
I could say that
at the time, no.

00:03:26.342 --> 00:03:28.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's go into
some of the other areas

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.950 align:middle line:84%
that you were studying at the
time, including symbolism,

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.710 align:middle line:84%
theology, mythology, and so
forth, and kind of give us

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.870 align:middle line:84%
a little guided
tour as to what you

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.020 align:middle line:84%
gleaned from each one of these
and what your influences were.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: Well, really it
ended up coming back to really

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.600 align:middle line:90%
putting my--

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.740 align:middle line:90%
how do I want to say this?

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.882 align:middle line:84%
Basically, when I went
out into the world

00:03:49.882 --> 00:03:52.090 align:middle line:84%
and started looking at all
of these different things,

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.900 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have anything to grasp.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:54.700 align:middle line:90%
Any--

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:55.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you didn't know
what you were looking for.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.053 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: And I didn't know
what I was looking for, yeah,

00:03:58.053 --> 00:04:00.370 align:middle line:84%
so that ended up leading
to this idea of mathematics

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.130 align:middle line:84%
as the foundation-- that, if
I was going to view the world,

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.713 align:middle line:84%
I could view it
through something that

00:04:04.713 --> 00:04:09.010 align:middle line:84%
had some substance,
had verifiability,

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.187 align:middle line:84%
and it was demonstrable,
and all of those things.

00:04:11.187 --> 00:04:12.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It had some precedent.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: What's that?

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It had some precedent.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.476 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: Yes, exactly.

00:04:15.476 --> 00:04:17.019 align:middle line:84%
So basically what
I ended up doing

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.700 align:middle line:84%
was focusing on
mathematics, and kind

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.680 align:middle line:84%
of viewing all of these
things through the lens

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.810 align:middle line:84%
of mathematics, and really
learning it all on myself--

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:24.610 align:middle line:90%
autodidact.

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.260 align:middle line:84%
So I basically even remember
looking back in my notebook.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.780 align:middle line:84%
I was going through and doing
multiplication tables again,

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.360 align:middle line:84%
something I had learned 20
years earlier or whatever,

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.790 align:middle line:84%
but basically I wanted to
just start from scratch,

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.620 align:middle line:84%
and so I learned
multiplication tables,

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.650 align:middle line:84%
learned the
qualities of numbers.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.436 align:middle line:84%
And then that got into
esoterica, certain numbers that

00:04:44.436 --> 00:04:45.560 align:middle line:90%
ended up showing up a lot--

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.010 align:middle line:84%
864, 108, 32, 33,
those sorts of things.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And so, yeah, that's
kind of where it led.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so where
did the touching-- which

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.450 align:middle line:84%
one of these disciplines had the
most profound touching points

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.930 align:middle line:84%
for you in terms of looking at
it through the lens of math,

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:07.545 align:middle line:84%
like theology versus symbolism,
which is a little easier.

00:05:07.545 --> 00:05:09.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: Yeah, I mean, I think
theology was the big one,

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.060 align:middle line:84%
because ultimately that's
the question that is on most

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.460 align:middle line:84%
people's minds when
they go to do a search

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.230 align:middle line:90%
for what's the meaning of life--

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.570 align:middle line:84%
is what is my relationship
to the divine?

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.580 align:middle line:84%
So when I got to mathematics,
I realized that--

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.064 align:middle line:84%
and this is talked about
quite extensively in esoteric

00:05:26.064 --> 00:05:28.480 align:middle line:84%
literature and things like--
that basically mathematics is

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.600 align:middle line:90%
sort of this alphabet of God--

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.070 align:middle line:90%
is the language of God.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.350 align:middle line:84%
And so that, if you were
working with mathematics,

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.210 align:middle line:84%
you were actually
speaking this language.

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is how
basically modern science

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.810 align:middle line:84%
comes to understand
the world-- is

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.370 align:middle line:84%
through the language
of mathematics.

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.661 align:middle line:84%
They don't look at it in the
same viewpoint, of course,

00:05:43.661 --> 00:05:46.560 align:middle line:84%
but when I went in there
and looked at this stuff,

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.310 align:middle line:84%
I realized that there was
so much more to mathematics

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.570 align:middle line:84%
and the relationship to
religions that basically

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:55.710 align:middle line:90%
nobody was really covering.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:56.910 align:middle line:84%
There was a few
authors here and there

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.118 align:middle line:84%
that we were talking about
it, but that was about it.

00:05:59.118 --> 00:06:01.500 align:middle line:84%
And so that I just really
just dove in and then realized

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.890 align:middle line:84%
that so many of these things
within literally pretty

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:08.940 align:middle line:84%
much every religion out there
has a numeric or geometric

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.290 align:middle line:90%
metaphor to it.

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And so that's really
what kind of lit my fire.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:16.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if we just
want to get to the point,

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.250 align:middle line:90%
so the meaning of life is 108?

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: Actually it is 42.

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.995 align:middle line:90%


00:06:22.995 --> 00:06:26.150 align:middle line:84%
When you look at our
number line, number one,

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.640 align:middle line:84%
42 is the answer of
life in Douglas Adams'

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.890 align:middle line:84%
book "Hitchhiker's
Guide to the Galaxy."

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:36.280 align:middle line:84%
There's 42 generations
from Abraham to Christ,

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.090 align:middle line:90%
42 principles of the maat.

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.334 align:middle line:84%
So when you say, hey,
42 is answer life,

00:06:40.334 --> 00:06:42.500 align:middle line:84%
it actually is, because you
can actually go and find

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:43.940 align:middle line:90%
why 42 is important.

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.230 align:middle line:84%
If you walk up your number
line, just ascending up

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:47.030 align:middle line:90%
a number line--

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:49.460 align:middle line:84%
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.042 align:middle line:84%
12-- when you get to
13, 14, and 15, what

00:06:53.042 --> 00:06:54.500 align:middle line:84%
you have within
those three numbers

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:59.195 align:middle line:84%
is the number 3.1415 just as
it unfolds in our number line.

00:06:59.195 --> 00:07:01.320 align:middle line:84%
If you look at those three
numbers and add them up,

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.120 align:middle line:90%
it's 42.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.590 align:middle line:90%
So 13 plus 14 plus 15 is 42.

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:07.860 align:middle line:84%
So really when they talk about
the 42 principles of maat

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.600 align:middle line:84%
being the principles
of life, law, order,

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.110 align:middle line:84%
and truth, that sort
of thing, there's

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:15.444 align:middle line:84%
actual math to that-- is
what they're pointing to,

00:07:15.444 --> 00:07:17.110 align:middle line:84%
and what they're
pointing to, of course,

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.530 align:middle line:84%
is pi, which is one of
these geometric archetypes

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:21.510 align:middle line:84%
that the creator
has given us to help

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:23.430 align:middle line:90%
us understand the creation.

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:27.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so for you, you
didn't study classic gematria

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:31.170 align:middle line:84%
as it's been laid out in Bible
code and some other works that

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:32.400 align:middle line:90%
happened-- or did you?

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.380 align:middle line:84%
Did you already look
into all of that?

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:35.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: I had.

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.678 align:middle line:84%
When I was looking
at into numbers,

00:07:36.678 --> 00:07:39.270 align:middle line:84%
I looked into gematria for
quite a bit and especially

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.561 align:middle line:84%
within English, because that's
really the only language

00:07:41.561 --> 00:07:42.720 align:middle line:90%
I know besides math.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.610 align:middle line:84%
And I saw that most of the
ciphers that had been created--

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:47.794 align:middle line:84%
simple, ordinal, reduction,
Pythagorean, Chaldean,

00:07:47.794 --> 00:07:49.210 align:middle line:84%
and there's some
other people that

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:50.334 align:middle line:90%
have come up with ciphers--

00:07:50.334 --> 00:07:52.290 align:middle line:90%
everything was a force fit.

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:55.090 align:middle line:84%
Everything seemed like people
were forcing conclusions,

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:55.500 align:middle line:90%
and that's [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.583 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and most
of it was based on Hebrew

00:07:57.583 --> 00:07:58.649 align:middle line:90%
to begin with.

00:07:58.649 --> 00:08:00.690 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't based on the
English alphabet, so there

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:01.680 align:middle line:90%
you get some--

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.240 align:middle line:84%
yeah, there's your
first challenge.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: Yeah, so that's the
one thing I noticed right away.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.571 align:middle line:84%
When you look at all of the
older languages, especially

00:08:07.571 --> 00:08:09.210 align:middle line:90%
the predominant ones--

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:13.770 align:middle line:84%
Greek, Latin, Arabic,
and Hebrew, of course--

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:15.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Akkadian.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: Yes, some of those.

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:20.707 align:middle line:84%
Those languages had
predominant ciphers to them.

00:08:20.707 --> 00:08:22.290 align:middle line:84%
So there was a
fundamental mathematics

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:23.748 align:middle line:84%
behind each one of
those languages,

00:08:23.748 --> 00:08:26.174 align:middle line:84%
and then basically holy
books, like holy scripture,

00:08:26.174 --> 00:08:28.590 align:middle line:84%
was actually written with a
mathematical foundation to it.

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:31.173 align:middle line:84%
So basically I came to the point
where I was asking, OK, well,

00:08:31.173 --> 00:08:32.490 align:middle line:90%
does English have that?

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:35.346 align:middle line:84%
Is English considered what
would be a sacred language?

00:08:35.346 --> 00:08:37.679 align:middle line:84%
Now we know that we have the
whole Holy Bible is written

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:40.270 align:middle line:84%
in English and stuff like
that, but as far as I knew,

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.709 align:middle line:84%
there wasn't any
predominant cipher for it.

00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And even in esoteric
literature, even

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:46.690 align:middle line:84%
like Manly Palmer
Hall, who's written--

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:47.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Manly P. Hall.

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:49.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: Everyone
knows Manly P. Hall.

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:51.120 align:middle line:84%
Even he has said, in
the several lectures,

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.950 align:middle line:84%
that he doesn't think
that English was written

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:55.325 align:middle line:84%
with a mathematical foundation,
and I just always thought

00:08:55.325 --> 00:08:58.110 align:middle line:84%
that was weird considering you
had holy books written in it.

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:01.040 align:middle line:84%
So that ended up a pursuit
of trying to figure that out

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.540 align:middle line:84%
and basically just
a revelatory moment.

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it was just
an incongruity in your mind

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.300 align:middle line:90%
that had to somehow be reduced.

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:09.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: Yes, exactly.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know you're
not a fan of reductionism,

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:12.570 align:middle line:84%
but, in essence,
that is what you

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:14.153 align:middle line:84%
had to do through
this process, right?

00:09:14.153 --> 00:09:16.087 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: Yeah, pretty much.

00:09:16.087 --> 00:09:18.420 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, just trying to
figure this stuff out myself

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.640 align:middle line:90%
with no help-- and so, yeah.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
did you discover

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:26.680 align:middle line:84%
in that journey regarding
the sacredness or not

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:28.290 align:middle line:90%
of the English language?

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:32.490 align:middle line:84%
What did you find that is
embedded in this language?

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:34.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: The most
important thing

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:37.050 align:middle line:84%
that I think people need to
understand when they look

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:39.060 align:middle line:84%
at gematria is
that you basically

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:42.420 align:middle line:84%
have sacred principles
crafted within the language

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.050 align:middle line:84%
and within every
single language.

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And now I've gone into
Hebrew and looked at that,

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.960 align:middle line:90%
decoded Genesis 1:1 in Hebrew.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.420 align:middle line:10%
I literally just put
out a video two days ago

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:55.740 align:middle line:10%
on Greek and English looking at
the holy name of Jesus Christ

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:59.340 align:middle line:10%
and showing how the Greek cipher
and English cipher that I've

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.130 align:middle line:10%
uncovered is very congruent.

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:04.350 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you have some of
the same principles encoded

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:07.260 align:middle line:90%
with both names.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.950 align:middle line:84%
So when you look at English,
what you are looking at is,

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:11.850 align:middle line:90%
when you--

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:13.530 align:middle line:84%
for instance, we can
go over the cipher,

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:15.480 align:middle line:84%
but when you look
at the number seven,

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.760 align:middle line:90%
seven encodes the number 22.

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:18.704 align:middle line:90%
So S-E-V-E-N is six.

00:10:18.704 --> 00:10:20.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's like two
negatives make a positive.

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:22.615 align:middle line:90%
How does it encode 22?

00:10:22.615 --> 00:10:25.297 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: So S-E-V-E-N,
if you put the--

00:10:25.297 --> 00:10:26.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I see.

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:27.600 align:middle line:90%
If you spell out the number.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.516 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: Yes, exactly.

00:10:28.516 --> 00:10:30.059 align:middle line:90%
So S-E-V-E-N is 65551 equals--

00:10:30.059 --> 00:10:31.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see how you get it.

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:32.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: --22.

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:35.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, any mathematician that
sees, hey, I got 22 in seven.

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:38.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, 22 divided by 7 is
a common approximation

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:40.320 align:middle line:90%
of pi, 3.142.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.330 align:middle line:84%
So basically what
you have is what

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:44.220 align:middle line:84%
you could call
universal archetypes,

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:47.760 align:middle line:84%
or cosmological constants, or
mathematical constants embedded

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.779 align:middle line:90%
within all of these things.

00:10:49.779 --> 00:10:50.820 align:middle line:90%
We could go to billiards.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:51.653 align:middle line:90%
We could go to dice.

00:10:51.653 --> 00:10:53.340 align:middle line:90%
We could go to the Ouija board.

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:56.790 align:middle line:84%
We could go to all
of holy scripture.

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:57.739 align:middle line:90%
It's like I said.

00:10:57.739 --> 00:11:00.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you look at
especially the name like Jesus

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:02.530 align:middle line:84%
Christ, because you have the
whole New Testament essentially

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:04.587 align:middle line:84%
written about this
character, the things that

00:11:04.587 --> 00:11:05.420 align:middle line:90%
are embedded in it--

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:08.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is it the same if
it's Yeshua versus Jesus?

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:10.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: So that's
what I actually go over

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.161 align:middle line:84%
in this last video, and
I think I go over it

00:11:12.161 --> 00:11:14.160 align:middle line:84%
in some of the books, as
well, but you basically

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.440 align:middle line:90%
have an evolution of a name.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.970 align:middle line:90%
So it starts as Yeshua.

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:19.650 align:middle line:90%
Then it's Iesus and Iesis.

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:21.260 align:middle line:90%
I think that's Latin--

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:22.060 align:middle line:90%
Greek, Latin.

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:23.643 align:middle line:84%
And in English, it's
Jesus, of course.

00:11:23.643 --> 00:11:25.190 align:middle line:84%
So then you have
to say, OK, well,

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:27.660 align:middle line:84%
I have to take that particular
name into the language

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:30.860 align:middle line:84%
that it's written in, use that
cipher, and then see, hey,

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:31.950 align:middle line:90%
what's encoded in there?

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:33.241 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: See if it matches up.

00:11:33.241 --> 00:11:34.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: Exactly.

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:35.950 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes
to, like I said,

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:38.100 align:middle line:84%
the major languages,
we know for a fact

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:39.810 align:middle line:84%
that these languages
were written

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:42.420 align:middle line:84%
with a mathematical foundation,
and we know for a fact

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:45.630 align:middle line:84%
that those Bibles were written
with a mathematical foundation.

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:49.480 align:middle line:84%
So what I did is I said, OK,
we take the sevenfold cipher

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:52.350 align:middle line:84%
that you discussed, put
it to work in the Bible,

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:54.310 align:middle line:90%
and see what we can uncover.

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:56.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So regardless of
the language-- for example,

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:58.370 align:middle line:84%
if you go from Genesis
1 to Genesis 2,

00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:00.410 align:middle line:84%
you have two totally
different stories.

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:02.690 align:middle line:84%
It's two different authors,
two different stories,

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:05.750 align:middle line:84%
two different origins, two
different sets of gods--

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:06.950 align:middle line:90%
totally different.

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:10.490 align:middle line:84%
So does the author,
regardless of the language,

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:13.760 align:middle line:84%
have its own kind of
cipher or imprint to it

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.310 align:middle line:84%
that you have to take
into consideration

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:18.245 align:middle line:84%
because of the intention
behind the writing.

00:12:18.245 --> 00:12:20.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: That's an
excellent question and one

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:22.661 align:middle line:84%
that I don't think we can even
answer, because we'd basically

00:12:22.661 --> 00:12:24.654 align:middle line:84%
have to go back in
time, and really

00:12:24.654 --> 00:12:26.570 align:middle line:84%
get sort of an objective
viewpoint of history,

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:28.084 align:middle line:90%
and say, who decoded this?

00:12:28.084 --> 00:12:30.000 align:middle line:84%
Who was the first-- who
were the people that--

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can tell they're
different authors, for sure.

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:34.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: Yes, you can tell that
there are different writers.

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:35.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you look
at Timothy as opposed

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:38.134 align:middle line:84%
to St. John's revelation,
it's two completely.

00:12:38.134 --> 00:12:39.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Totally different.

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:40.341 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: Yeah, it looks--

00:12:40.341 --> 00:12:42.230 align:middle line:84%
just the language
in and of itself.

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:43.110 align:middle line:90%
So you can see that--

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:43.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's just
a composite document

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:45.410 align:middle line:90%
with a myriad of authors.

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:47.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: Yeah, so
you can see that.

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:49.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, from what I
understand anyway,

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:52.480 align:middle line:84%
when the King James Bible
was translated from the--

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Francis Bacon, right?

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:55.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: Probably right.

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.414 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's pretty
much the thought now,

00:12:57.414 --> 00:12:59.450 align:middle line:84%
and he did have
understanding of gematria--

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:02.720 align:middle line:84%
numerology,
astronomy, astrology.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.340 align:middle line:90%
He had that basis.

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:07.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: Yes, I mean, my
conjecture is that you

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:10.012 align:middle line:84%
basically had a guild of writers
at that point that were--

00:13:10.012 --> 00:13:11.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All skilled
in the higher arts.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:12.375 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: Of course.

00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:12.670 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:13.545 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:13:13.545 --> 00:13:16.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: Esotericism, symbolism,
numerology, astrology,

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:17.360 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And so basically what you
had is linguists, polyglots

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:23.150 align:middle line:84%
that were looking at these
different Hebrew, and Greek,

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:25.608 align:middle line:84%
and all that stuff, and then
translating that into English,

00:13:25.608 --> 00:13:28.400 align:middle line:90%
and basically canonizing it.

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.957 align:middle line:84%
So all of these different--
from my own studies,

00:13:30.957 --> 00:13:32.540 align:middle line:84%
anyway, all of these
different authors

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:34.498 align:middle line:84%
that were putting together
the King James Bible

00:13:34.498 --> 00:13:36.260 align:middle line:84%
were actually using
the same cipher

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.930 align:middle line:84%
and coding the same cosmological
principles because they all

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:40.955 align:middle line:84%
knew them, because
they had learned them

00:13:40.955 --> 00:13:42.270 align:middle line:90%
from the other languages.

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:43.978 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about the cipher.

00:13:43.978 --> 00:13:45.107 align:middle line:90%
What is a cipher?

00:13:45.107 --> 00:13:46.440 align:middle line:90%
We'll just start from beginning.

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.606 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: What is the cipher?

00:13:47.606 --> 00:13:48.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: So the
cipher, basically--

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:55.910 align:middle line:84%
the construction of the cipher
is based on natural principles

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:58.880 align:middle line:84%
that everybody knows,
one being your hands.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.339 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at
your human body--

00:14:00.339 --> 00:14:02.088 align:middle line:84%
there's 26 letters in
the English alphabet

00:14:02.088 --> 00:14:03.120 align:middle line:90%
first and foremost.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:03.920 align:middle line:90%
If you look at--

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.795 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there's what,
24 in Hebrew, 22 in Greek?

00:14:06.795 --> 00:14:07.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: 24 in Greek.

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:08.720 align:middle line:90%
22 in Hebrew.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:08.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 22 in Hebrew.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:09.480 align:middle line:90%
The other way around.

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:10.605 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: Depending if you--

00:14:10.605 --> 00:14:11.900 align:middle line:90%
finals-- that's 27.

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:13.527 align:middle line:90%
There's 23 in Latin.

00:14:13.527 --> 00:14:15.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is
what makes gematria

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:17.250 align:middle line:84%
a difficult
proposition, because you

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:20.226 align:middle line:84%
have to find the numeric value
in all the languages, then.

00:14:20.226 --> 00:14:22.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: Yes, and what's
actually interesting

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:25.380 align:middle line:84%
is that, when you look at
all these different languages

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:27.660 align:middle line:84%
and you say, OK, well this
language has 24 letters,

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.840 align:middle line:84%
this has 22, this has
26, how could there

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:32.712 align:middle line:84%
be any sort of correlation
between the two?

00:14:32.712 --> 00:14:34.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you actually
look at the mathematics

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:36.628 align:middle line:84%
and you understand the
language of mathematics,

00:14:36.628 --> 00:14:38.900 align:middle line:84%
then you can say, oh, if I
find 365 in this language,

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.722 align:middle line:90%
and 365 here, and 365 here--

00:14:40.722 --> 00:14:41.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Without forcing it.

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:42.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: Without forcing it.

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:43.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Organically.

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: Organically.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, once again, it
has to be demonstrable.

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:47.720 align:middle line:90%
It has to be verifiable.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:48.980 align:middle line:84%
If I come up with
it, you have to be

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:49.400 align:middle line:84%
able to come with
the same thing.

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:50.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:52.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: Otherwise, we're
shooting in the dark.

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:53.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Someone's idea.

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.198 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: Exactly right.

00:14:54.198 --> 00:14:55.520 align:middle line:90%
So that's the idea.

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:59.137 align:middle line:90%
So how is the cipher built?

00:14:59.137 --> 00:15:00.595 align:middle line:84%
26 letters in the
English alphabet.

00:15:00.595 --> 00:15:02.870 align:middle line:84%
And what I did is I split
the alphabet in two--

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:04.550 align:middle line:90%
13 letters and 13 letters.

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:05.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Up to M, right?

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:07.004 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: A through M.

00:15:07.004 --> 00:15:08.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And N [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:10.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: N through
Z. And the reason

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:13.500 align:middle line:84%
I did that initially was because
of the duality of creation,

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:14.300 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you look at your
entire body, your body's--

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:18.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean just as it goes
down my shirt here,

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.197 align:middle line:84%
it's symmetrical
left and right--

00:15:20.197 --> 00:15:22.280 align:middle line:84%
left eye, right eye, left
hemisphere of the brain,

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.867 align:middle line:84%
right ears, breasts,
shoulders, hands.

00:15:24.867 --> 00:15:25.825 align:middle line:90%
Everything is mirrored.

00:15:25.825 --> 00:15:26.815 align:middle line:90%
It's symmetrical.

00:15:26.815 --> 00:15:28.190 align:middle line:84%
So basically I
said, OK, well I'm

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:30.292 align:middle line:84%
going to take A through
M and N through Z.

00:15:30.292 --> 00:15:32.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you did
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: And then I went
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:34.317 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

00:15:34.317 --> 00:15:35.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:36.983 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you get
13 on each side--

00:15:36.983 --> 00:15:38.300 align:middle line:90%
26.

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:39.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: You get one through
seven back down to one.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:41.796 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But feminine
and masculine I assume?

00:15:41.796 --> 00:15:43.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: Feminine and
masculine-- that whole idea.

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:46.195 align:middle line:84%
You have black and whites, Adam
and Eve, up and down, Shiva

00:15:46.195 --> 00:15:47.490 align:middle line:90%
and Shakti, that kind of thing.

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:50.610 align:middle line:84%
So now, when people say, well,
why did you walk up to one

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:52.110 align:middle line:84%
through seven and
back down to one--

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, because
they say, wait a minute.

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:53.870 align:middle line:90%
Wait a minute.

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:55.280 align:middle line:84%
There are no eights
or nines in there.

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:56.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: Exactly.

00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:56.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's what I thought.

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:57.714 align:middle line:90%
That's what I was thinking.

00:15:57.714 --> 00:15:59.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: Yeah, pretty
much everyone says that.

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:02.090 align:middle line:84%
And you say, well, if
you actually look at it,

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:04.160 align:middle line:84%
it's really not anything
mystical at all,

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.570 align:middle line:84%
because this is just another
way to square a number.

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:09.320 align:middle line:84%
So if you go 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1--

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.260 align:middle line:90%
you add those up.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:11.210 align:middle line:90%
It's 49.

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:14.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, 7 squared is 49, and
seven is that central pillar.

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:16.880 align:middle line:84%
So and then people
say, well, yeah,

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.500 align:middle line:84%
why don't you use
eight and nine?

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:21.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can create eight
and nine with this cipher.

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:22.925 align:middle line:84%
So it's basically
just saying that--

00:16:22.925 --> 00:16:24.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just values of eight
and nine with the cipher.

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:25.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: Exactly.

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:29.900 align:middle line:84%
So another interesting thing for
people to really kind of grasp

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:32.390 align:middle line:84%
is that, when you have
the creation of languages

00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:33.860 align:middle line:90%
and you have numbers--

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:36.274 align:middle line:84%
so if I said to you,
22, well, I could just

00:16:36.274 --> 00:16:38.690 align:middle line:84%
write the number 22 to you,
and you'd be like, oh, I know.

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:39.770 align:middle line:90%
That's 22.

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:43.940 align:middle line:84%
There's really no logical reason
that you would actually write

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:48.350 align:middle line:84%
out T-W-E-N-T-Y-T-W-O, unless
you were going to actually

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:51.839 align:middle line:84%
incorporate or encode something
particular in that word that

00:16:51.839 --> 00:16:52.880 align:middle line:90%
tells you about a number.

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.755 align:middle line:90%


00:16:55.755 --> 00:17:01.580 align:middle line:84%
One really interesting thing
is, if you look at trimesters--

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:03.620 align:middle line:90%
trimesters in English gematria.

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.750 align:middle line:84%
We all know trimesters
is nine months--

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:07.619 align:middle line:90%
three, three, and three months.

00:17:07.619 --> 00:17:09.540 align:middle line:90%
So that would be 39 weeks--

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:11.780 align:middle line:90%
13, 13, 13.

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:13.380 align:middle line:90%
52 weeks in a year.

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:15.349 align:middle line:90%
Well, trimesters equals 52.

00:17:15.349 --> 00:17:17.690 align:middle line:84%
You say, well,
shouldn't it equal 39?

00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:18.770 align:middle line:90%
Wouldn't that make sense?

00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:20.686 align:middle line:84%
Then you actually do the
numerical equivalents

00:17:20.686 --> 00:17:22.690 align:middle line:84%
of the words 52,
and it equals 39.

00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:24.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Again,
using the dematria.

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: Exactly.

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:26.500 align:middle line:90%
So you find the same thing.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:27.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or gematria.

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:29.133 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: Yeah, I've heard
it pronounced both ways,

00:17:29.133 --> 00:17:31.134 align:middle line:90%
so potato, "pa-tah-to."

00:17:31.134 --> 00:17:33.050 align:middle line:84%
So then when you look
at there's other things,

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:35.810 align:middle line:84%
like the number
9, like N-I-N-E--

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:37.080 align:middle line:90%
this equals 12.

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, 9 and 12 is
3/4 of a circle,

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:40.440 align:middle line:90%
same thing as trimesters--

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.140 align:middle line:90%
39, 52.

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:43.760 align:middle line:84%
So you can see a
lot of these things

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.717 align:middle line:90%
are embedded within the numbers.

00:17:45.717 --> 00:17:48.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so you start
to say earlier there are kind

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:51.350 align:middle line:84%
of natural elements
of the cipher,

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:53.930 align:middle line:84%
such as what's evident
in the physical world,

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:56.630 align:middle line:84%
and one of them brought
up was the 10 fingers--

00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:57.545 align:middle line:90%
10 fingers, 10 toes.

00:17:57.545 --> 00:17:58.420 align:middle line:90%
How's this factor in?

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:00.949 align:middle line:90%


00:18:00.949 --> 00:18:02.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: To answer that
question, let's not

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:03.573 align:middle line:90%
talk about gematria.

00:18:03.573 --> 00:18:06.260 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about numerology,
because this is a better way

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.000 align:middle line:90%
to approach this, I think.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.470 align:middle line:84%
Most modern
mathematicians-- if you

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:12.650 align:middle line:84%
go to any sort of university
or academic setting,

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:14.240 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
pooh pooh numerology.

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:16.070 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be like, oh,
that's just a pseudo science.

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:17.670 align:middle line:90%
Don't pay any attention to that.

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:19.941 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually if you
look on your hands,

00:18:19.941 --> 00:18:21.440 align:middle line:84%
you can actually
find out that there

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:24.600 align:middle line:84%
is a quantity and a quality,
and it's available right

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:25.400 align:middle line:90%
on your hands.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:27.730 align:middle line:90%
So we'll walk through this.

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:30.070 align:middle line:84%
Basic numerological function
is basically saying, hey,

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:31.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take
the number 22--

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:32.000 align:middle line:90%
most people know this.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take
2 plus 2 equals 4.

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:35.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you have
a quantity of 22,

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:37.190 align:middle line:84%
that quantity does
not equal 4, and this

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:39.065 align:middle line:84%
is why numerology is
essentially pooh poohed.

00:18:39.065 --> 00:18:40.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you look on
your hands, you actually

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:42.410 align:middle line:90%
have 14 phalanges of your hands.

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:47.990 align:middle line:84%
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:50.690 align:middle line:90%
14 plus 14 is 28.

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:54.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, you have two
thumbs and eight fingers.

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:56.150 align:middle line:90%
And what's 2 plus 8?

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:57.080 align:middle line:90%
It's 10.

00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:58.070 align:middle line:90%
Let's got to one hand.

00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:59.960 align:middle line:90%
14 phalanges on one hand.

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:01.490 align:middle line:90%
What's 1 plus 4?

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:02.510 align:middle line:90%
It's 5.

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:04.689 align:middle line:84%
You have one thumb
and four fingers.

00:19:04.689 --> 00:19:07.230 align:middle line:84%
So this numerological function
that's essentially dismissed--

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:09.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Forwards and
backwards it still works.

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:11.563 align:middle line:84%
What about a little guy I
knew who had two extra thumbs?

00:19:11.563 --> 00:19:12.370 align:middle line:90%
What's that mean?

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:13.255 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: Well, he's--

00:19:13.255 --> 00:19:14.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He had six.

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:14.890 align:middle line:84%
He had two thumbs
and four fingers.

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:16.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: Funny enough,
my brother and my father

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:18.691 align:middle line:90%
were both born with six toes.

00:19:18.691 --> 00:19:19.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, were they?

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:20.150 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:21.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: Yeah, on one foot.

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:22.130 align:middle line:90%
So that's interesting.

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:24.213 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We can't use
that as part of the cipher.

00:19:24.213 --> 00:19:26.292 align:middle line:90%


00:19:26.292 --> 00:19:27.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: But as you can see--

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just things like
that where it's like, OK,

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:31.880 align:middle line:84%
numerology has no function
in the real world.

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:32.900 align:middle line:90%
That's nonsense.

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:35.930 align:middle line:84%
It actually works right
on your two hands.

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:39.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now let's get into
the whole notion of alchemy,

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:40.147 align:middle line:90%
the stage of alchemy.

00:19:40.147 --> 00:19:42.230 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about-- no,
let's talk about your name.

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:44.690 align:middle line:84%
So you started with yourself
because you were really

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:46.250 align:middle line:84%
looking to dig into
finding out who

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:48.350 align:middle line:90%
you were amidst all of this.

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And so you have a
very Irish name.

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:55.306 align:middle line:90%
You were born-- please share.

00:19:55.306 --> 00:19:56.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: So Marty
Leeds is a pseudonym.

00:19:56.930 --> 00:20:00.170 align:middle line:84%
So my real name is Kevin
Ryan Martin McNally.

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:01.754 align:middle line:84%
And then I also have
another pseudonym

00:20:01.754 --> 00:20:02.711 align:middle line:90%
called Claudia Pavonis.

00:20:02.711 --> 00:20:04.005 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Claudia Pavonis.

00:20:04.005 --> 00:20:06.470 align:middle line:84%
Who is your alter
ego or feminine half?

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:07.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: Yeah, basically.

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And all of these names were
derived before I had ever

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:12.140 align:middle line:90%
even got the cipher.

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:15.530 align:middle line:84%
So basically I had used Marty
Leeds for a very long time--

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:17.510 align:middle line:84%
years-- and then
as I was writing

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:20.480 align:middle line:90%
my first book, which was on pi.

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why did you
choose Marty Leeds?

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:24.815 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: That's a
long story, actually.

00:20:24.815 --> 00:20:26.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's actually not
that long of a story.

00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:27.648 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We have time.

00:20:27.648 --> 00:20:28.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: OK.

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:30.806 align:middle line:84%
Middle name is Martin,
so Ryan Martin, so Marty,

00:20:30.806 --> 00:20:32.180 align:middle line:84%
and my grandpa's
name was Martin,

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:33.950 align:middle line:90%
so kind of just after him.

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:36.560 align:middle line:84%
And then Leeds is actually
after a girl in high school

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:39.350 align:middle line:84%
that I kind of like fell
for a long, long time ago,

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:43.610 align:middle line:84%
and she kind of introduced
me to the world of poetry,

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:45.620 align:middle line:84%
romanticizing my life,
kind of thing like that.

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:46.340 align:middle line:90%
So it was just kind of--

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:47.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Higher thought.

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:48.198 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: Yeah, exactly.

00:20:48.198 --> 00:20:49.550 align:middle line:90%
So it was a kind of--

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:53.941 align:middle line:84%
anyway, but I had come
up with that pseudonym

00:20:53.941 --> 00:20:55.940 align:middle line:84%
a long time ago never
thinking that I'd actually

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:57.410 align:middle line:84%
use it to be an author
because I didn't think I'd

00:20:57.410 --> 00:20:58.550 align:middle line:90%
be writing books.

00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:00.920 align:middle line:84%
So Kevin Ryan Martin
McNally got Marty Leeds,

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:03.253 align:middle line:84%
and then when I was writing
my first book, "Pi The Great

00:21:03.253 --> 00:21:05.210 align:middle line:84%
Work," which was not
even on the cipher--

00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:06.668 align:middle line:84%
I dealt with language
a little bit,

00:21:06.668 --> 00:21:09.320 align:middle line:84%
but I had come up with
the name Claudia Pavonis.

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:11.210 align:middle line:90%
And so I had these three names.

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:12.680 align:middle line:84%
So then I find
the cipher I don't

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:16.520 align:middle line:84%
know how many months later or
whatever, and then I did the--

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:20.300 align:middle line:84%
well, the whole cipher is
based on seven once again.

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:22.820 align:middle line:84%
Then I did the numerical
equivalents of all my names.

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:26.240 align:middle line:84%
So Marty Leeds is
38, and etc., etc.

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:29.700 align:middle line:90%
Well, all of it added up to 143.

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:31.699 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you do the
gematria equivalents.

00:21:31.699 --> 00:21:32.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which is eight.

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:33.335 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: What's that?

00:21:33.335 --> 00:21:34.501 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which is it eight.

00:21:34.501 --> 00:21:36.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: Yeah, it
reduces down to eight,

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:38.810 align:middle line:84%
which pi is eight, by
the way, in this cipher.

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:41.870 align:middle line:84%
Pi is three five,
which equals eight,

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:44.720 align:middle line:84%
but then if you actually look
at the seven visible heavenly

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:49.010 align:middle line:84%
spheres-- sun, moon, Mercury,
Venus, Saturn, Jupiter, etc.,

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:53.090 align:middle line:84%
you add those gematria
values up, and it's 143.

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:55.659 align:middle line:84%
And so it was just this
moment of just holy cow.

00:21:55.659 --> 00:21:57.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why not embrace
the entire solar system

00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:58.880 align:middle line:90%
while I'm at it, right?

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:01.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: Well, and it was all
based on the number seven.

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And so it was just like,
is that a coincidence?

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:06.500 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how is that possible?

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:09.680 align:middle line:90%
Further, Marty Leeds encodes pi.

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.190 align:middle line:90%
If you actually break down--

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:13.330 align:middle line:84%
the name Marty
actually equals 16.

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:14.580 align:middle line:90%
One plus six or seven.

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:15.520 align:middle line:90%
Leeds equals 22.

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:17.190 align:middle line:90%
22 divided by 7 is pi.

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:19.920 align:middle line:84%
Claudia equals 22, and
it has seven letters.

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:21.870 align:middle line:90%
22 divided by 7 is pi.

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:24.510 align:middle line:84%
So all of these things
were encoded in these names

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:27.930 align:middle line:84%
that I had just chosen, and
it was just this magical,

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:30.090 align:middle line:84%
synchronistic, there's
no explanation,

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:32.520 align:middle line:84%
it's not a nuts and bolts
answer kind of thing.

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:34.680 align:middle line:84%
And it was things like
that changed my life.

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:36.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's like
your higher part

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:38.790 align:middle line:84%
speaking to you through
the language of numbers.

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:42.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: Yes and what's really
interesting about the Claudia

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.520 align:middle line:84%
Pavonis thing is
that there was--

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:46.170 align:middle line:84%
when I studied
esoterica, especially

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:48.930 align:middle line:84%
like in native myths, and
things like that, and alchemy--

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:50.610 align:middle line:84%
you find this really
strong in alchemy,

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:53.212 align:middle line:84%
but there's always this idea
of the androgynous being,

00:22:53.212 --> 00:22:55.420 align:middle line:84%
that every human being is
made with electromagnetism.

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:56.790 align:middle line:84%
So you have a male
part of you, and you

00:22:56.790 --> 00:22:57.560 align:middle line:90%
have a female part of you.

00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:59.000 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
what your external--

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Electromagnetic.

00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:00.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: Exactly.

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:02.280 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter what
your externally is.

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.500 align:middle line:84%
Interior-- so there's
this basically

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:06.000 align:middle line:84%
spiritual or
psychological process

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.620 align:middle line:84%
of merging those opposites-- man
and woman becoming one within.

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And so psychologically
that's what

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:16.440 align:middle line:84%
I was doing that
entire time, and then

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:19.620 align:middle line:84%
to go on the other side and
then actually do the math

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:21.327 align:middle line:90%
for it was pretty remarkable.

00:23:21.327 --> 00:23:23.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that
had to be pretty tippy.

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:25.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, Claudia
Pavonis, as I recall,

00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:28.530 align:middle line:84%
has to do with part of
an alchemical process.

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:30.900 align:middle line:84%
And the name of the book
is "A Peacock's Tail."

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:35.850 align:middle line:84%
So now start guiding us
through what all of this means

00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:38.400 align:middle line:84%
and how it came
together for the work.

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:41.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: So my foray into
alchemy was really trying

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:42.280 align:middle line:90%
to figure out--

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.730 align:middle line:90%
because it's so weird.

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:46.470 align:middle line:84%
When you look at
alchemical illustrations

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:48.030 align:middle line:84%
and things like that,
at least for the layman,

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:50.350 align:middle line:84%
at least for me, when I
was younger, I was like,

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:51.700 align:middle line:90%
what do all these things mean?

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:53.670 align:middle line:84%
Why is that, when we talk
about that androgynous being--

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:54.878 align:middle line:90%
there's a really famous one--

00:23:54.878 --> 00:23:56.392 align:middle line:90%
I think it's by Michael Meyer.

00:23:56.392 --> 00:23:58.350 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's by
Michael Meyer, excuse me,

00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:00.120 align:middle line:90%
but it's called Rebus.

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:01.437 align:middle line:90%
And it's this character.

00:24:01.437 --> 00:24:02.520 align:middle line:90%
It's an androgynous being.

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.769 align:middle line:84%
It's got a compass in one
hand, a square in the other.

00:24:04.769 --> 00:24:06.960 align:middle line:10%
It's got the seven
visible heavenly spheres--

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.900 align:middle line:10%
heavenly bodies above
him, standing on an egg--

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:12.720 align:middle line:10%
or standing on a dragon,
which is on an egg,

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:13.950 align:middle line:10%
and there's a three and four.

00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:16.620 align:middle line:10%
So just all of these elements,
and I'm looking at this

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:20.200 align:middle line:10%
and having essentially no idea
what any of this stuff means.

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:25.170 align:middle line:84%
So then that really sent me
down a path of symbolism.

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:26.790 align:middle line:90%
What can I extract from this?

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:28.530 align:middle line:90%
What are they trying to say?

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:30.627 align:middle line:84%
And so that's kind of
where I went with it,

00:24:30.627 --> 00:24:33.210 align:middle line:84%
and then when I saw that you're
basically dealing-- especially

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:35.010 align:middle line:84%
when you talk about
the androgynous being

00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:38.430 align:middle line:84%
as far as understanding merging
the man and woman within,

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:40.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
high spirituality

00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:43.464 align:middle line:84%
that they're trying
to purvey to people

00:24:43.464 --> 00:24:44.880 align:middle line:84%
within just a
simple illustration,

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:47.050 align:middle line:84%
and you don't have
to say anything.

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:51.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the alchemy
translated to what for you?

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:54.456 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: Well alchemy, when
you actually look at the word--

00:24:54.456 --> 00:24:55.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people
say it's alchemit,

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:58.320 align:middle line:84%
and this is the black land in
Egypt, and yada, yada, yada.

00:24:58.320 --> 00:24:59.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think it's more
refined than that, but go on.

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:00.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: Exactly right.

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:01.940 align:middle line:90%
So you hear all of these things.

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:05.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, when I say it, I say, OK,
"al," all, and Al, and Allah.

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:06.180 align:middle line:90%
This is all.

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:06.750 align:middle line:90%
This is the god.

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:07.630 align:middle line:90%
This is the eternity.

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:09.696 align:middle line:90%
This is the eternal one.

00:25:09.696 --> 00:25:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And then you have "chemy,"
which is like chemistry.

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:14.160 align:middle line:84%
So basically, when you
look at the word alchemy,

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:16.040 align:middle line:84%
you're talking
about God chemistry.

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is basically
just saying, OK,

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:23.820 align:middle line:84%
how do I connect with-- how do
I transform myself chemically,

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:26.940 align:middle line:84%
if you will, to be
one with that divine,

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:29.930 align:middle line:84%
to actually have that
relationship with the divine.

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And that, to me, is what
alchemy is all about,

00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:34.370 align:middle line:84%
and that's when you have that
transubstantiation of the soul

00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:37.100 align:middle line:84%
being from lead into gold, from
something impure to something

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:38.250 align:middle line:90%
incorruptible.

00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:39.708 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I agree
with you on that.

00:25:39.708 --> 00:25:41.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in the
hermetic tradition,

00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:44.370 align:middle line:84%
the metaphor for
transforming lead to gold

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:46.860 align:middle line:84%
is really having to
do with reflecting

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:52.160 align:middle line:84%
the bringing of the lower in
terms of understanding spirit

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:55.230 align:middle line:84%
and connection to the higher,
from lower to the higher.

00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:59.547 align:middle line:84%
So really people use the
term alchemy so loosely now.

00:25:59.547 --> 00:26:01.380 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me that,
at the very base of it,

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:04.640 align:middle line:84%
it means to transform something
from the lower to the higher--

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.814 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in its
really dense term.

00:26:06.814 --> 00:26:08.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: So when you
look at the word alchemy,

00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:11.910 align:middle line:84%
when I actually did the
numerics of the word in English,

00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:15.390 align:middle line:84%
it's A-L-C-H-E-M-Y, and this
is the number-- is what?

00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:18.960 align:middle line:90%
Is 1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 2.

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:20.970 align:middle line:90%
So there's the 365.

00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:23.640 align:middle line:84%
Everybody sees that the solar
year in the name of alchemy.

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, then this
whole thing was based

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:29.340 align:middle line:84%
on the corollary or basically
geometric metaphors--

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:33.102 align:middle line:84%
that basically all of this
stuff has a geometric metaphor.

00:26:33.102 --> 00:26:34.560 align:middle line:84%
You multiply those
numbers, and you

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:38.500 align:middle line:84%
get 360, which is, of course,
the degrees of a circle.

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:40.420 align:middle line:84%
So the whole thing is
based on the circle.

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:43.520 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when going
back to that rebus,

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:47.310 align:middle line:84%
there's two numbers below in the
egg, and it's three and four.

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, in sacred
geometrical study,

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:52.490 align:middle line:84%
heaven is known as a circle,
and Earth is known as a square.

00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:54.990 align:middle line:84%
And these are actually given
the distinctions of the numbers

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:55.790 align:middle line:90%
three and four.

00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:57.390 align:middle line:90%
Of course, 3 plus 4 is 7.

00:26:57.390 --> 00:27:01.140 align:middle line:84%
So and then you say, well, why
is heaven a circle-- is three?

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the circle
encapsulates everything,

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.010 align:middle line:84%
encapsulates the
most amount of space.

00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:06.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That
brings us to zero.

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:07.383 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: And that
brings us to zero.

00:27:07.383 --> 00:27:09.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about zero.

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:14.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: So when you look at
particular principles within

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:14.930 align:middle line:90%
the numbers--

00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:16.910 align:middle line:84%
so every number has
a characteristic,

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:18.656 align:middle line:90%
has something unique about it.

00:27:18.656 --> 00:27:20.780 align:middle line:84%
When you start at zero,
it's actually a non-number.

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:22.580 align:middle line:84%
It's the first number in our
number line not a number,

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:23.380 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:25.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, zero actually
has the qualities

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.230 align:middle line:90%
of the divine within it.

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:29.720 align:middle line:84%
If you just look at the
zero and ask the question.

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:30.520 align:middle line:90%
So zero is--

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:33.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's the only unbroken
line that can contain all.

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:34.933 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: Alpha and
omega, if you will,

00:27:34.933 --> 00:27:36.794 align:middle line:90%
the beginning and the end.

00:27:36.794 --> 00:27:38.960 align:middle line:84%
So then you look at zero,
and you say, OK, well zero

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:39.380 align:middle line:90%
is nothing.

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:40.180 align:middle line:90%
It's no thing.

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:41.560 align:middle line:90%
It's immateriality.

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:44.756 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing, yet
we have a symbol for it

00:27:44.756 --> 00:27:46.130 align:middle line:84%
so we know that
we're referencing

00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:47.930 align:middle line:90%
something that's immaterial.

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:50.252 align:middle line:84%
And then you put that
zero behind a one,

00:27:50.252 --> 00:27:52.710 align:middle line:84%
and next thing you know it has
an order of magnitude of 10.

00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:53.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 10, right.

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:55.181 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: So then you
say, OK, well you just

00:27:55.181 --> 00:27:56.224 align:middle line:90%
ask the zero a question.

00:27:56.224 --> 00:27:57.140 align:middle line:90%
What's your qualities?

00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:57.960 align:middle line:90%
What's your principles?

00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.360 align:middle line:84%
What are you there
to tell me about?

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:01.443 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's there to tell
you about the nothingness

00:28:01.443 --> 00:28:03.909 align:middle line:84%
and immateriality of god
and the power of god.

00:28:03.909 --> 00:28:04.950 align:middle line:90%
And that's with the zero.

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:08.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Might the zero
contain the consciousness.

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:11.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: Well, the idea of--

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:14.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is an idea that's--
cross-culturally we see all

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:17.030 align:middle line:84%
over, that basically
in the idea--

00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:18.260 align:middle line:90%
in the beginning was nothing.

00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:19.940 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning,
there was no thing.

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:22.370 align:middle line:90%
And from that no thing, sprang--

00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:25.130 align:middle line:84%
well, in Genesis it talks
about-- and God saying,

00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:26.000 align:middle line:90%
let there be light.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.250 align:middle line:84%
So you had basically
a materiality coming

00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:30.710 align:middle line:90%
from an infinite immateriality.

00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:33.620 align:middle line:90%
Well, what's the next number?

00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:35.745 align:middle line:90%
Zero, one.

00:28:35.745 --> 00:28:37.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Zero, one, yes.

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, when I
look at it in my head,

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:43.347 align:middle line:84%
I see it almost more you have
the hidden logos or the word.

00:28:43.347 --> 00:28:44.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: Absolutely.

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:47.060 align:middle line:84%
Which is the thought, which
is a creative thought,

00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:49.010 align:middle line:90%
and you have prima materia.

00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:50.330 align:middle line:90%
Masculine in logos.

00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:51.760 align:middle line:90%
Feminine prima materia.

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:53.810 align:middle line:84%
The essence for
the creation of all

00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:55.850 align:middle line:90%
of the material reality, right?

00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:58.970 align:middle line:90%
So zero in that--

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:01.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could almost
say that from the zero,

00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:04.190 align:middle line:84%
the hidden logos and
prima materia have

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:08.210 align:middle line:84%
to have already
met, so to speak,

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:12.010 align:middle line:84%
and the language is
given birth through that.

00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:14.139 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I'm
seeing it in my head.

00:29:14.139 --> 00:29:15.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: No, I think
you're right on track.

00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:18.880 align:middle line:10%
The idea is that,
essentially, in the beginning,

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:20.630 align:middle line:10%
the great creator, the
great spirit if you

00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:22.560 align:middle line:10%
want to-- whatever
you want to call it,

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:25.670 align:middle line:10%
imagined creation,
imagined how creation would

00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:29.360 align:middle line:10%
manifest in that immateriality.

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:31.430 align:middle line:84%
And then when it
decided it was like, OK,

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:34.561 align:middle line:84%
I have the perfect creation,
it gave birth to that creation.

00:29:34.561 --> 00:29:36.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It imprinted the
prima materia, so to speak.

00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:38.110 align:middle line:90%
It blended and became--

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:39.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: That zero,
which is a circle--

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:42.910 align:middle line:84%
we can view it as a circle-- the
egg of creation, if you will--

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:45.216 align:middle line:90%
was split-- one.

00:29:45.216 --> 00:29:46.090 align:middle line:90%
And what do you have?

00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:47.919 align:middle line:84%
You have a circle,
and you have a line.

00:29:47.919 --> 00:29:49.460 align:middle line:84%
So when you just
mentioned the logos,

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:52.850 align:middle line:84%
logos is also referred to as
the word or the word of God.

00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:54.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, then I ask
the question-- well,

00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:56.660 align:middle line:90%
this is the question I asked.

00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:58.024 align:middle line:90%
What language does God speak?

00:29:58.024 --> 00:29:58.940 align:middle line:90%
Does he speak Russian?

00:29:58.940 --> 00:29:59.510 align:middle line:90%
Does he Italian?

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:00.260 align:middle line:90%
Does he speak English?

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:01.093 align:middle line:90%
Does he speak Greek?

00:30:01.093 --> 00:30:02.080 align:middle line:90%
Does he speak Latin?

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:03.180 align:middle line:90%
What language?

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:05.210 align:middle line:84%
Which is the language that God
is speaking to everybody in?

00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:07.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course, God
speaks all languages,

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:09.847 align:middle line:84%
but the one language that we
know God speaks is mathematics.

00:30:09.847 --> 00:30:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And so when you talk about
the birth of the logos,

00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:14.305 align:middle line:84%
the birth of the word, what
you're actually talking about

00:30:14.305 --> 00:30:17.480 align:middle line:84%
is the birth of a word that's
in the language of mathematics.

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:20.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, what better candidate
do you have than pi?

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And as we just went
over, the numbers zero

00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:24.812 align:middle line:84%
and one actually give us that
geometry right off the bat.

00:30:24.812 --> 00:30:27.020 align:middle line:84%
We didn't even get to two
yet and talk about duality.

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:28.430 align:middle line:84%
We didn't get to three to
talk about the trinity.

00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:30.680 align:middle line:84%
We didn't get to four
to talk about Earth,

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:32.120 align:middle line:90%
that sort of thing.

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:33.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
interesting, because when

00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:34.598 align:middle line:84%
I was reading that
part of the book

00:30:34.598 --> 00:30:36.710 align:middle line:84%
and I was contemplating
what you were saying,

00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:42.800 align:middle line:84%
the way I was experiencing
it is that creation itself

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:46.190 align:middle line:84%
into anything of a
manifest position,

00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:47.750 align:middle line:84%
physical manifestation,
even if it's

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:50.900 align:middle line:84%
in another realm of
a finer nature, that

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:55.070 align:middle line:84%
is it possible that that
came through a sensual

00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:57.610 align:middle line:84%
experience of the
creation itself

00:30:57.610 --> 00:30:59.630 align:middle line:84%
and that the organizing
principle of it

00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:01.870 align:middle line:90%
might simply be the math?

00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:04.200 align:middle line:84%
That the actual creation
is already full?

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:05.000 align:middle line:90%
It's full.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.490 align:middle line:90%
It has sensual content to it.

00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:08.477 align:middle line:90%
It has movement.

00:31:08.477 --> 00:31:09.560 align:middle line:90%
It has light it has color.

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:10.520 align:middle line:90%
It has sound.

00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:12.500 align:middle line:84%
It has all of
that, but I started

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:15.440 align:middle line:84%
seeing the math as more
or less an organizing

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:20.110 align:middle line:84%
principle for creating the form
of all of those constituents.

00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:22.502 align:middle line:90%


00:31:22.502 --> 00:31:24.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: Yeah, I think
I agree with that,

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:26.376 align:middle line:84%
because basically what you
have with the mathematics

00:31:26.376 --> 00:31:28.565 align:middle line:84%
is sort of the
underpinnings of creation.

00:31:28.565 --> 00:31:30.690 align:middle line:84%
Even if we look at this
nautical shell right there,

00:31:30.690 --> 00:31:32.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we could say,
hey, that's five.

00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:32.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You can see that--

00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:34.711 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: We know that there's
an archetype right there.

00:31:34.711 --> 00:31:37.849 align:middle line:84%
So now the problem with a lot
of people with mathematics

00:31:37.849 --> 00:31:40.140 align:middle line:84%
is that they're not really
into mathematics, especially

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:42.000 align:middle line:84%
when you talk about the
qualitative aspects,

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.900 align:middle line:84%
but really, I mean most
numbers are very, very potent

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:50.370 align:middle line:84%
with meaning, and actually you
can get that central aspect out

00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:53.376 align:middle line:84%
of it, which is something I
never thought out of math.

00:31:53.376 --> 00:31:55.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or is math
simply reflecting

00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:56.580 align:middle line:90%
the sensual principles?

00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:58.290 align:middle line:84%
So it's a kind of a
chicken or egg thing,

00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:00.600 align:middle line:84%
and I guess that debate
could go on endlessly.

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:04.710 align:middle line:84%
The point is it does
organize everything.

00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:09.202 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: And we can actually
come to understand the design,

00:32:09.202 --> 00:32:11.160 align:middle line:84%
and we can understand
that organizing principle

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:14.130 align:middle line:84%
by understanding that canon,
that language of mathematics.

00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:16.560 align:middle line:84%
Chicken or egg-- what came
first, the chicken or egg?

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:17.940 align:middle line:90%
There's an answer.

00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:18.800 align:middle line:84%
There's an answer
to that question.

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:19.966 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's the answer?

00:32:19.966 --> 00:32:21.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: The answer is the egg.

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And then you say,
well, why the egg?

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:23.590 align:middle line:90%
Why the chicken?

00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:24.390 align:middle line:90%
Why the egg?

00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:26.790 align:middle line:90%
Well, what were you born from?

00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:28.500 align:middle line:90%
How many species lay eggs?

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:30.810 align:middle line:90%
Birds, fish, snakes.

00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:32.820 align:middle line:90%
How many species lay chickens?

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:34.195 align:middle line:90%
Even you were born from an egg.

00:32:34.195 --> 00:32:36.820 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk about what came
first, the chicken or the egg--

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:37.380 align:middle line:90%
and this is--

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:38.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which is zero.

00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:39.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: Zero.

00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:41.070 align:middle line:90%
And it's even ovular--

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:45.690 align:middle line:90%
ovum, of course, ovular, ovis.

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:47.554 align:middle line:84%
So you have that egg,
and then of course you

00:32:47.554 --> 00:32:48.720 align:middle line:90%
look at all the mythologies.

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.164 align:middle line:84%
You have the cosmic
egg in Egypt.

00:32:51.164 --> 00:32:53.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could just
go on and on with that.

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:55.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it's, again,
being born from the no thing--

00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:56.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: Absolutely.

00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:57.986 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and the zero,
which is the planet.

00:32:57.986 --> 00:33:00.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: Which is spirituality.

00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:01.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:04.380 align:middle line:84%
There was a lovely
physicist I knew once

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:07.890 align:middle line:84%
upon a time named Mark
Cummings, and when

00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:09.740 align:middle line:90%
people talked of black holes--

00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:12.540 align:middle line:84%
and I think Nassim Haramein and
then Samantha [INAUDIBLE] also

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:15.600 align:middle line:84%
went the same direction-- but
when they spoke of black holes,

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:19.140 align:middle line:84%
they spoke of the fact that
you're talking about a plenum.

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:21.270 align:middle line:84%
We think of it as
no thing, nothing,

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:24.480 align:middle line:84%
sucking in everything toward
it, when, in fact, there

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:27.300 align:middle line:84%
may be this merging of
consciousness with prima

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:29.760 align:middle line:84%
materia, so to
speak, to be bringing

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:34.320 align:middle line:84%
through all of creation through
this no thing, this black hole.

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:37.392 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: For me, anymore,
because I'm not an astronomer--

00:33:37.392 --> 00:33:38.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm not any of that
sort of stuff--

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:42.062 align:middle line:84%
what I like to do is focus on
the things that I can know--

00:33:42.062 --> 00:33:43.770 align:middle line:84%
I can know myself and
I can prove myself,

00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:44.675 align:middle line:90%
because I know that--

00:33:44.675 --> 00:33:46.800 align:middle line:84%
doing this for-- I don't
know-- seven, eight years,

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:47.910 align:middle line:90%
whatever it's been now--

00:33:47.910 --> 00:33:50.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've gotten things wrong
because I've been going off

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:52.850 align:middle line:84%
of-- there's times when I've
gone off of faulty information.

00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:54.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're
staying in the area

00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:55.305 align:middle line:90%
that you've put together.

00:33:55.305 --> 00:33:55.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: So I'm staying in--

00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:57.600 align:middle line:90%
I know I can prove these things.

00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:59.340 align:middle line:90%
I can prove them myself.

00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:01.650 align:middle line:90%
That's what I want to focus on.

00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:04.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now let's
talk about the position.

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:07.450 align:middle line:84%
Let's start talking about, for
example, the name of Jesus,

00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:09.330 align:middle line:84%
which you talked about
a little bit ago.

00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:12.310 align:middle line:84%
One thing I was wondering
is, in classical dematria,

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:17.880 align:middle line:84%
for example, or numerology,
they tend to use addition,

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:23.310 align:middle line:84%
but you're using multiplication,
which isn't classical,

00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:24.630 align:middle line:90%
but you have a reason for that.

00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:26.489 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about,
like you said,

00:34:26.489 --> 00:34:30.030 align:middle line:84%
you went back and learned
the multiplication tables.

00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:32.100 align:middle line:84%
Why did you start
using multiplication

00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:35.107 align:middle line:90%
of these instead of addition?

00:34:35.107 --> 00:34:37.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: I mean, there's a
number of things that I used,

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:39.210 align:middle line:84%
like foundational
principles usually

00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:42.389 align:middle line:84%
that I use when I go to
investigate this stuff, those

00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:44.139 align:middle line:84%
being add, subtract,
multiply, and divide,

00:34:44.139 --> 00:34:46.290 align:middle line:84%
because those are
basic functions,

00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:48.989 align:middle line:84%
mathematical functions, that
essentially everybody knows.

00:34:48.989 --> 00:34:50.040 align:middle line:84%
You talk to somebody
about algebra,

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:51.539 align:middle line:84%
you talk to them
about trigonometry,

00:34:51.539 --> 00:34:53.830 align:middle line:84%
you talk to them about
chaos theory, it's like,

00:34:53.830 --> 00:34:54.630 align:middle line:90%
well, I don't know.

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:56.296 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know a
lot about that stuff,

00:34:56.296 --> 00:34:59.610 align:middle line:84%
but when you talk about a
universal sacred science,

00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:02.440 align:middle line:84%
you talk about a science that is
universal to all people, well,

00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:05.040 align:middle line:84%
it would have to be something
that everybody can understand.

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:07.534 align:middle line:84%
Well, the one thing that
pretty much everybody can do

00:35:07.534 --> 00:35:09.700 align:middle line:84%
is add, subtract, multiply,
and divide, square root,

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:12.074 align:middle line:84%
square some things, cube some
things, that sort of thing.

00:35:12.074 --> 00:35:14.729 align:middle line:84%
So I focused on those things
because they were simple.

00:35:14.729 --> 00:35:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And then I was like, OK,
if I can use these basic

00:35:16.770 --> 00:35:20.700 align:middle line:84%
mathematical principles and
just look at-- use these

00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:22.770 align:middle line:84%
as the foundation
to go into this,

00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:25.830 align:middle line:84%
then we can actually unveil
a sort of sacred science,

00:35:25.830 --> 00:35:27.090 align:middle line:90%
because it's nothing--

00:35:27.090 --> 00:35:28.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's literally just
counting on your fingers--

00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:30.906 align:middle line:84%
multiplying and adding on
your fingers, if you will.

00:35:30.906 --> 00:35:34.464 align:middle line:84%
So that's essentially
why I used that.

00:35:34.464 --> 00:35:36.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you explained
a little bit a while ago

00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:40.650 align:middle line:84%
about how you came to
the numerics of Jesus,

00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:43.210 align:middle line:84%
or Yeshua, whatever names you
were going to apply to it.

00:35:43.210 --> 00:35:45.060 align:middle line:84%
It had the same
value, but one thing

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:46.590 align:middle line:84%
that was interesting
in there, too,

00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:51.280 align:middle line:84%
is that you found that Horus
had the same numeric value.

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:55.620 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at this
through other lenses,

00:35:55.620 --> 00:36:00.810 align:middle line:84%
you would find that they would
state that, whether Zoroaster,

00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:03.660 align:middle line:90%
Mithras, Jesus, and so forth--

00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:09.126 align:middle line:84%
it kind of all goes back to
an entity known as Horus,

00:36:09.126 --> 00:36:10.500 align:middle line:84%
that Horus is the
key figure that

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:13.260 align:middle line:84%
runs through all of
these characters' stories

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:18.030 align:middle line:84%
right down to the time of birth,
and the cosmological position

00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:20.960 align:middle line:84%
of Earth at that
time, and so forth.

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:22.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: Well, in
every culture--

00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:24.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm sure you've
talked about this on your show

00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:27.440 align:middle line:84%
quite a bit, but you basically
have this hero archetype.

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:28.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:30.410 align:middle line:84%
Virgin mother, born
the same day the year,

00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:35.030 align:middle line:84%
December 25th right after the
solstice, winter solstice.

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:36.555 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: That sort of idea.

00:36:36.555 --> 00:36:38.180 align:middle line:84%
The great solar myth
you could call it,

00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:41.810 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, but great
redeemer, mediator, of humanity.

00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:43.415 align:middle line:84%
And that's your sort
of hero archetype

00:36:43.415 --> 00:36:46.770 align:middle line:84%
that everybody wants to
evolve into, or grow into,

00:36:46.770 --> 00:36:47.570 align:middle line:90%
that sort of thing.

00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:49.370 align:middle line:90%
So I mean, when you look at--

00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:53.120 align:middle line:84%
and Attis, Dionysus, as you
were saying, Zoroaster, Horus,

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:56.409 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could
just go down the line.

00:36:56.409 --> 00:36:57.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's always
the same story.

00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:59.810 align:middle line:84%
Do their names kind
of have the same value

00:36:59.810 --> 00:37:03.236 align:middle line:84%
when you start running
it through this lens?

00:37:03.236 --> 00:37:04.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: So this
is the one thing

00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:06.420 align:middle line:90%
that I just did with Jesus.

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:11.390 align:middle line:84%
So you go into the original
New Testament written in Greek,

00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:13.810 align:middle line:84%
and you go to the name
of Lord Jesus Christ

00:37:13.810 --> 00:37:16.502 align:middle line:84%
just as it's given in the
strong concordance of the Bible,

00:37:16.502 --> 00:37:17.960 align:middle line:84%
and that's an
exhaustive compendium

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:20.097 align:middle line:84%
of looking at Hebrew, and
Greek, and the English,

00:37:20.097 --> 00:37:20.930 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:22.130 align:middle line:84%
So let's say we're
just going to look,

00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:24.070 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to grab
the cipher for Greek.

00:37:24.070 --> 00:37:25.340 align:middle line:84%
We're going to put the
numbers to the letters

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:27.080 align:middle line:84%
of the Greek name
of Jesus Christ.

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:31.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, this gives
you 800, 88, and 1480.

00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:34.590 align:middle line:84%
So if you just do basic
numerology on that, 800--

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:36.980 align:middle line:90%
8 plus 0 plus 0 is 8.

00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:39.200 align:middle line:90%
888 is 8 plus 8 plus 8 is 24.

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:41.180 align:middle line:90%
2 plus 4 is 6.

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:43.250 align:middle line:90%
1481 plus 4 plus 8 plus 0 is 13.

00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:45.710 align:middle line:84%
1 plus 3 is 4 giving
you the numbers

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:47.600 align:middle line:84%
in the name of
Jesus Christ as it's

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.440 align:middle line:84%
given in the original
Greek New Testament--

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:50.900 align:middle line:90%
864.

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:53.499 align:middle line:84%
There's 86,400
seconds in one day--

00:37:53.499 --> 00:37:55.290 align:middle line:84%
60 seconds in a minute,
60 minutes an hour,

00:37:55.290 --> 00:37:56.700 align:middle line:90%
24 hours in a day.

00:37:56.700 --> 00:38:00.140 align:middle line:84%
So if you say, OK, well, what
is the number 864 related to?

00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:02.015 align:middle line:90%
Well, the son, of course.

00:38:02.015 --> 00:38:03.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, as we
were going to go next.

00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:04.310 align:middle line:90%
So talk about that.

00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:06.685 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: And so when you talk
about the great solar myth,

00:38:06.685 --> 00:38:08.240 align:middle line:84%
now we'll go to,
OK, now we're going

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:11.470 align:middle line:84%
to look at Jesus the
Son of God in English.

00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:13.340 align:middle line:90%
Jesus equals 27.

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:14.640 align:middle line:90%
Christ equals 32.

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:18.890 align:middle line:90%
27 times 32 is 864.

00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:22.250 align:middle line:84%
So basically you have a 2000
year old document giving you

00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:25.040 align:middle line:84%
a number, and you have
500 year old document

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:28.640 align:middle line:84%
written in a completely
different language, translated

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:31.400 align:middle line:84%
from the original Greek,
giving you the same number.

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:33.441 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then, of
course, in the great myth,

00:38:33.441 --> 00:38:36.590 align:middle line:84%
the great solar myth, Horus is
the representative of the sun.

00:38:36.590 --> 00:38:38.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: Exactly.

00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:43.130 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of the things-- if
you multiply Yeshua and Horus,

00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:45.650 align:middle line:84%
it actually gives
you the number 2160,

00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:48.400 align:middle line:84%
which is something you can find
the name of Jesus, actually.

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:49.610 align:middle line:90%
So it's pretty interesting.

00:38:49.610 --> 00:38:51.735 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So again, it's
the numbers are tying back

00:38:51.735 --> 00:38:56.470 align:middle line:84%
all the myths, and are you
going to perhaps play around

00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:58.290 align:middle line:84%
with Mithras and
some of the others,

00:38:58.290 --> 00:39:02.650 align:middle line:84%
and see how their names
are relating to this.

00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:04.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: Yeah, the only
challenges with that is--

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:06.130 align:middle line:90%
you can look at it in English.

00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:08.005 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, also
the spelling has changed

00:39:08.005 --> 00:39:09.230 align:middle line:90%
so drastically through the--

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:10.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: Exactly.

00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:11.696 align:middle line:84%
That's the fundamental
problem you have.

00:39:11.696 --> 00:39:13.720 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I'm really
careful when I do that.

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:14.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
you'd have to go back

00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:16.040 align:middle line:90%
through every known spelling.

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:17.914 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: Yes, and then
you have to go to, OK,

00:39:17.914 --> 00:39:19.650 align:middle line:84%
was there a particular
spelling that

00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:22.220 align:middle line:84%
was made with a numeric
foundation in it.

00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:23.650 align:middle line:84%
We know in Hebrew
and Greek we can

00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:25.030 align:middle line:84%
do that because we
have the ciphers,

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:26.080 align:middle line:90%
and we have the original text.

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:28.538 align:middle line:84%
So we can say that, and we can
do that in English now, too.

00:39:28.538 --> 00:39:31.075 align:middle line:90%


00:39:31.075 --> 00:39:34.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In this,
you feel then that--

00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:37.890 align:middle line:84%
we're agreeing to agree
on this-- that math

00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:39.760 align:middle line:84%
is the language of
God, and I'm saying

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:42.160 align:middle line:84%
it's the organizing principle
of the language of God.

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:44.620 align:middle line:84%
It still gets us
to the same point--

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:51.370 align:middle line:84%
and that, in your view,
we're sleeping in this dream

00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:54.036 align:middle line:90%
somewhere, right?

00:39:54.036 --> 00:39:55.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: That's a
good metaphor for it,

00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:57.868 align:middle line:84%
I think, and it's a metaphor
that's used quite a bit.

00:39:57.868 --> 00:40:04.050 align:middle line:84%
It's the idea that we're asleep,
and the idea is to wake up.

00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:07.509 align:middle line:84%
Awake in English
gematria is 14135.

00:40:07.509 --> 00:40:08.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And what's that mean?

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:11.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: It's an
anagram for 31415.

00:40:11.650 --> 00:40:14.830 align:middle line:84%
You find the same
thing in Hebrew.

00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:18.762 align:middle line:84%
Genesis 1:1-- the
name of God is Elohim.

00:40:18.762 --> 00:40:20.470 align:middle line:84%
When you break this
down numerologically,

00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:22.553 align:middle line:84%
it actually gives you the
first five digits of pi,

00:40:22.553 --> 00:40:26.229 align:middle line:84%
as well, 3.415 So basically
you have the name of God.

00:40:26.229 --> 00:40:27.270 align:middle line:90%
All you do is basically--

00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:29.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So God
means to be awake.

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:32.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: Basically, as far as
I understand it, of course.

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You wake up to God.

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:37.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: You wake up to the
recognition of who you are,

00:40:37.610 --> 00:40:41.020 align:middle line:84%
what you're doing here, what
your absolute connection to God

00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:43.730 align:middle line:84%
is, and there's no question
in the center of your being

00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:44.530 align:middle line:90%
once you see it.

00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:47.610 align:middle line:90%


00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:48.940 align:middle line:90%
Then you look at--

00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:52.492 align:middle line:84%
like I said, the
idea of being awake--

00:40:52.492 --> 00:40:53.700 align:middle line:90%
that's exactly what it means.

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:55.909 align:middle line:84%
It's like waking up to the
recognition of who you are

00:40:55.909 --> 00:40:57.616 align:middle line:84%
and what you're doing
here kind of thing.

00:40:57.616 --> 00:40:58.770 align:middle line:90%
So the fact that you have--

00:40:58.770 --> 00:41:00.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I think we
all agreed that's the goal.

00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:01.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: I think so.

00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:04.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to me, that's what
human beings are here to do--

00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:06.430 align:middle line:90%
is to understand who you are.

00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:09.460 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to do that
without a study of theology

00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:12.760 align:middle line:84%
in my opinion, of
course, because, I mean,

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:14.090 align:middle line:90%
God has created everything.

00:41:14.090 --> 00:41:17.650 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
interesting things

00:41:17.650 --> 00:41:21.206 align:middle line:84%
about theological studies,
especially in philosophy,

00:41:21.206 --> 00:41:23.080 align:middle line:84%
and contemplative work,
and things like that,

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:27.160 align:middle line:84%
when you come into creation,
you're given no answers--

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:28.000 align:middle line:90%
none.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.000 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing here?

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.617 align:middle line:90%
What's the purpose of your life?

00:41:30.617 --> 00:41:31.450 align:middle line:90%
Where are you going?

00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:32.620 align:middle line:90%
What happens when you die?

00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:33.420 align:middle line:90%
What's the sun?

00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:33.630 align:middle line:90%
What's the moon?

00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:34.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I say we have a
black hood over our head.

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:36.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: Exactly right.

00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:39.414 align:middle line:84%
And so that is almost
imperative to me for you

00:41:39.414 --> 00:41:41.830 align:middle line:84%
to ask the questions, because
you don't give any answers--

00:41:41.830 --> 00:41:42.590 align:middle line:90%
you're not given any answers.

00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:44.680 align:middle line:84%
So you go out into this material
world, and you look out,

00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:46.150 align:middle line:84%
and you say, OK,
well, I better start

00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:48.483 align:middle line:84%
asking some questions to
figure out what I'm doing here.

00:41:48.483 --> 00:41:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that was
actually the purpose

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:53.835 align:middle line:90%
of my life in many respects.

00:41:53.835 --> 00:41:54.710 align:middle line:90%
What am I doing here?

00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:57.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm here to ask those questions
and find out those answers.

00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:01.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, especially in mystical
literature and stuff like that,

00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:03.785 align:middle line:84%
the answer is, even though
I'm talking about math,

00:42:03.785 --> 00:42:06.160 align:middle line:84%
it's not something that you
can actually just write down.

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:09.460 align:middle line:84%
It's something that must be
realized within the self.

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:13.756 align:middle line:84%
And so that's really, I think,
the crux of the whole thing.

00:42:13.756 --> 00:42:15.380 align:middle line:84%
Crux means cross, by
the way, which is,

00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:16.838 align:middle line:84%
of course,
multiplication and that.

00:42:16.838 --> 00:42:17.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:18.990 align:middle line:90%
And I always wonder.

00:42:18.990 --> 00:42:21.604 align:middle line:84%
It comes back down to
really kind of simple things

00:42:21.604 --> 00:42:23.020 align:middle line:84%
a lot of times in
my own mind when

00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:26.260 align:middle line:84%
you're looking at the purpose
of or the point of creation.

00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:27.730 align:middle line:90%
I look at the rose.

00:42:27.730 --> 00:42:30.100 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
rose, for example,

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:33.010 align:middle line:84%
yes there is a mathematical
component, right?

00:42:33.010 --> 00:42:35.380 align:middle line:84%
I assume there's probably
a geometrical component.

00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:39.460 align:middle line:84%
There's definitely the world of
all of the finer senses woven

00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:41.800 align:middle line:84%
into it and then the
notion of beauty,

00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:46.030 align:middle line:84%
and oftentimes mathematics
demonstrates what

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:47.717 align:middle line:90%
is classically known as beauty.

00:42:47.717 --> 00:42:48.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: Absolutely.

00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:51.008 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So why don't we talk
about that for a little bit,

00:42:51.008 --> 00:42:54.520 align:middle line:84%
because to me, a rose may or
may not be here to study itself,

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:57.740 align:middle line:84%
but it certainly is here
to inspire other species,

00:42:57.740 --> 00:42:59.990 align:middle line:90%
if not impress itself.

00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:04.420 align:middle line:84%
It exists for pure beauty,
the sake of pure beauty.

00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:06.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: And to communicate
to you something.

00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:06.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:43:06.910 --> 00:43:07.397 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:43:07.397 --> 00:43:08.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: So there's principles.

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:09.858 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about that.

00:43:09.858 --> 00:43:12.610 align:middle line:90%


00:43:12.610 --> 00:43:15.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: Let's go
back to Jesus Christ.

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:16.000 align:middle line:90%
You look at Christ.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.494 align:middle line:90%
You look at the Christ--

00:43:17.494 --> 00:43:18.910 align:middle line:84%
C-- this is in
English, of course.

00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:22.662 align:middle line:90%
C-H-R-I-S-T is the numbers 365--

00:43:22.662 --> 00:43:24.120 align:middle line:84%
of course, we all
know what 365 is,

00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:25.328 align:middle line:90%
number of days of solar year.

00:43:25.328 --> 00:43:26.392 align:middle line:90%
Then you have 567.

00:43:26.392 --> 00:43:27.850 align:middle line:84%
You multiply these
numbers across--

00:43:27.850 --> 00:43:32.170 align:middle line:84%
3 times 6 times 5 times 5
times 6 times 7 equals 18,900.

00:43:32.170 --> 00:43:37.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, you take the square root
of 18,900, and it's 137.47.

00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:39.620 align:middle line:84%
I know I'm throwing a
lot of math at you, but--

00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:40.745 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's all right.

00:43:40.745 --> 00:43:42.159 align:middle line:90%
Just translate.

00:43:42.159 --> 00:43:43.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: So look at this again.

00:43:43.450 --> 00:43:44.710 align:middle line:84%
Took the numbers of
Christ, multiplied it,

00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:45.835 align:middle line:90%
took the square root of it.

00:43:45.835 --> 00:43:46.840 align:middle line:90%
We get 137.47.

00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:49.846 align:middle line:84%
137.5 is the degree
of phyllotaxis.

00:43:49.846 --> 00:43:51.970 align:middle line:84%
The degree of phyllotaxis
is-- and you can actually

00:43:51.970 --> 00:43:53.920 align:middle line:84%
take a protractor, and
just go out in your lawn,

00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:56.470 align:middle line:84%
and see this yourself-- it's
the way that leaves will arrange

00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:58.928 align:middle line:84%
themselves around a plant so
they receive the optimal light

00:43:58.928 --> 00:44:02.500 align:middle line:90%
and rain so it grows.

00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:08.005 align:middle line:84%
So you don't need to know about
complex mathematics at all.

00:44:08.005 --> 00:44:09.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you don't even
have to be essentially

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:11.496 align:middle line:90%
smart to actually see, hey--

00:44:11.496 --> 00:44:12.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That works.

00:44:12.370 --> 00:44:13.929 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: --there's
a pattern there.

00:44:13.929 --> 00:44:15.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, how do I
identify that pattern.

00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:18.400 align:middle line:84%
How do I know that
that has a pattern?

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:21.250 align:middle line:84%
All I got to do is do a little
math, grab that protractor.

00:44:21.250 --> 00:44:23.630 align:middle line:84%
So to me, when you talk
about something that is--

00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:25.625 align:middle line:84%
of course, everything
is moving, and morphing,

00:44:25.625 --> 00:44:28.000 align:middle line:84%
and changing, so you're not
going to always get exactly--

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.560 align:middle line:90%
that's the whole point.

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:32.430 align:middle line:84%
Basically, you would have these
fundamental archetypes, phi,

00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:34.880 align:middle line:84%
pi, things like
this for phyllotaxis

00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:37.120 align:middle line:90%
that the creation moves through.

00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:39.920 align:middle line:84%
So we can actually see when
you see a plant growing--

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:42.397 align:middle line:84%
and it moves, and it
bends, and stuff like that,

00:44:42.397 --> 00:44:44.980 align:middle line:84%
but at the core of it, you can
see that there is design there.

00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:46.604 align:middle line:84%
And all it takes you
to do is just, oh,

00:44:46.604 --> 00:44:48.320 align:middle line:90%
that angle is the same there.

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:50.350 align:middle line:90%
Phyllotaxis is based on phi.

00:44:50.350 --> 00:44:52.355 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So back to
the rose, and back to

00:44:52.355 --> 00:44:54.429 align:middle line:84%
the saying a rose
by any other name.

00:44:54.429 --> 00:44:56.220 align:middle line:84%
So there's something
contained within that.

00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:59.880 align:middle line:84%
So there has to be the numerics
of that, the mathematics

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:01.290 align:middle line:90%
of that at the base of it.

00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And again, I go back
to the whole notion

00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:07.500 align:middle line:84%
of this esoteric
thing we call beauty.

00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:11.920 align:middle line:84%
Are there consistent
elements mathematically

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:14.850 align:middle line:84%
that contribute to
what we call beauty.

00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:18.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: I mean, the human form
is a perfect example of beauty,

00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:19.780 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:20.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
supposedly that form

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:22.060 align:middle line:90%
is throughout the universe.

00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:24.910 align:middle line:84%
It's a very common form
used for sentient beings

00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:26.402 align:middle line:90%
throughout the universes.

00:45:26.402 --> 00:45:29.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: Yes, and what's
interesting is that--

00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:31.107 align:middle line:84%
so let's talk about
phi here a second.

00:45:31.107 --> 00:45:32.440 align:middle line:90%
So we're talking about the rose.

00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:36.010 align:middle line:90%
Rose goes with phi, as well.

00:45:36.010 --> 00:45:38.320 align:middle line:90%
Phi is found in the pentagram.

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:40.630 align:middle line:84%
Draw a perfect pentagram,
and you get the smaller line

00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:43.600 align:middle line:84%
segment to the bigger
line segment is 1 to 1.68,

00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:45.910 align:middle line:90%
or 1 to 6.8, or 0.618--

00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:47.200 align:middle line:90%
excuse me.

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:50.510 align:middle line:84%
Phi-- well, OK, phi
is on your hand.

00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:53.230 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, you can actually
divide and actually

00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:55.080 align:middle line:84%
find the proportions
of phi on your hand.

00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:56.538 align:middle line:84%
Well, how many
fingers do you have?

00:45:56.538 --> 00:45:57.400 align:middle line:90%
You have five.

00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:01.232 align:middle line:84%
So you put that stamp down, and
you see, OK, there's a circle.

00:46:01.232 --> 00:46:02.440 align:middle line:90%
You put a circle around that.

00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:03.731 align:middle line:90%
You put the pentagram in there.

00:46:03.731 --> 00:46:05.717 align:middle line:84%
You find the ratio of
phi, and you say, OK,

00:46:05.717 --> 00:46:08.050 align:middle line:84%
well if this is here and then
I can look down on a plant

00:46:08.050 --> 00:46:09.633 align:middle line:84%
and see here that
means that something

00:46:09.633 --> 00:46:10.870 align:middle line:90%
between the plant and I--

00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:14.614 align:middle line:84%
there's an intelligence
right that grew both of them,

00:46:14.614 --> 00:46:16.030 align:middle line:84%
and so that that
allows you to see

00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:18.820 align:middle line:84%
that there is a perfection
in creation and design.

00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:21.085 align:middle line:84%
And when you see that, of
course, there's beauty.

00:46:21.085 --> 00:46:23.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What's your
experience of that in nature?

00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:26.590 align:middle line:84%
Your personal experience,
your mathematical relationship

00:46:26.590 --> 00:46:29.830 align:middle line:84%
to nature since this is your
primary language, I mean,

00:46:29.830 --> 00:46:32.380 align:middle line:84%
that you're studying,
you're loving.

00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:34.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: Alphabet of God--

00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:35.910 align:middle line:90%
alphabet of God is zero--

00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:36.710 align:middle line:90%
let's do it here.

00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:38.584 align:middle line:84%
Alphabet of God-- it's
right here, of course.

00:46:38.584 --> 00:46:41.830 align:middle line:84%
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, and 9.

00:46:41.830 --> 00:46:42.910 align:middle line:90%
You get to 10.

00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:44.480 align:middle line:90%
You can go 1 plus 0 is 1.

00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:46.510 align:middle line:90%
11-- 1 plus 1 is 2.

00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:50.470 align:middle line:84%
Those 10 digits can create
any other number in existence.

00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:53.712 align:middle line:84%
So that means that essentially
you have an alphabet of God.

00:46:53.712 --> 00:46:55.420 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what
you're talking about.

00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:57.880 align:middle line:84%
Those 10 numbers
are the letters that

00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:00.040 align:middle line:84%
create numeric words
that we can actually

00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:02.210 align:middle line:90%
find throughout creation.

00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:03.400 align:middle line:90%
So you've got that.

00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:08.350 align:middle line:84%
Now you say-- getting
back to nature,

00:47:08.350 --> 00:47:10.490 align:middle line:90%
the first time that I'd ever--

00:47:10.490 --> 00:47:12.990 align:middle line:84%
not the first time, but one of
the times it really struck me

00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:15.040 align:middle line:84%
that how connected
numbers were to nature,

00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:19.570 align:middle line:84%
I was walking in the woods by
myself, and walking in Oregon,

00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:22.120 align:middle line:84%
and they have the flower called
trillium-- tri meaning three,

00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:22.920 align:middle line:90%
of course--

00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:24.430 align:middle line:90%
which is a beautiful flower.

00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:27.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, the trillium is based on--
it's a central stalk or stem,

00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:30.150 align:middle line:84%
and there's three big leaves,
another layer of three

00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:32.740 align:middle line:84%
other leaves, and then
three petals at the top,

00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:35.740 align:middle line:84%
and so you actually have
three, three, and three.

00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:40.172 align:middle line:84%
And so you can actually look
at this as 123, 456, 789,

00:47:40.172 --> 00:47:41.130 align:middle line:90%
and where is that zero?

00:47:41.130 --> 00:47:43.720 align:middle line:84%
It's the thing that comes
out as we talked before.

00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:46.840 align:middle line:84%
From the nothingness,
sprang forth that idea.

00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:50.590 align:middle line:84%
So looking at the flower and
the beauty of the flower,

00:47:50.590 --> 00:47:53.260 align:middle line:84%
not actually contemplating
mathematics, but then seeing

00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:56.020 align:middle line:84%
the mathematics in
there, said, oh, no, no,

00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:57.450 align:middle line:90%
that's why it's beautiful.

00:47:57.450 --> 00:47:58.480 align:middle line:90%
You get that.

00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:01.390 align:middle line:84%
So that was one of the
first things that was ever--

00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:07.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So nature
feeds the upliftment

00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:11.900 align:middle line:84%
in our own sense of awareness
and opening to the divine.

00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:14.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: Rose is the
past tense of rise.

00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:15.937 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:48:15.937 --> 00:48:17.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: It's that idea
that you have that--

00:48:17.770 --> 00:48:20.061 align:middle line:84%
and especially when you look
at the chakra system, back

00:48:20.061 --> 00:48:21.090 align:middle line:90%
to the seven, of course.

00:48:21.090 --> 00:48:22.840 align:middle line:84%
You start at that
root, and it's the idea

00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:24.880 align:middle line:84%
of it's the lower
material world.

00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:25.970 align:middle line:90%
It's the eating.

00:48:25.970 --> 00:48:26.770 align:middle line:90%
It's the sex.

00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:27.742 align:middle line:90%
It's all of that stuff.

00:48:27.742 --> 00:48:29.950 align:middle line:84%
You want to take that energy
source that's within you

00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:31.450 align:middle line:90%
and rise up through.

00:48:31.450 --> 00:48:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, you
have the sacred Rosie cross--

00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:35.158 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Rosie
cross and all that.

00:48:35.158 --> 00:48:36.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: Rosicrucians,
of course.

00:48:36.670 --> 00:48:39.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it is
considered to be, I think,

00:48:39.170 --> 00:48:41.980 align:middle line:84%
a cipher, maybe helichrysum,
the highest frequency in terms

00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:43.840 align:middle line:90%
of the scent that it produces.

00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:46.720 align:middle line:84%
The actual essential oil is
one of the highest frequencies

00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:48.270 align:middle line:90%
of anything on the planet.

00:48:48.270 --> 00:48:49.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: Interesting.

00:48:49.970 --> 00:48:52.810 align:middle line:84%
There's also the sort of
duality of good and evil

00:48:52.810 --> 00:48:55.775 align:middle line:84%
in the rose, too, because you
have the thorns of the rose.

00:48:55.775 --> 00:48:56.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Protection.

00:48:56.650 --> 00:48:57.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: Exactly.

00:48:57.570 --> 00:48:58.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's own
self protection.

00:48:58.090 --> 00:49:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: And then you have
that blooming flower at the top

00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:01.116 align:middle line:90%
that smells beautiful.

00:49:01.116 --> 00:49:02.290 align:middle line:90%
It looks beautiful.

00:49:02.290 --> 00:49:04.270 align:middle line:84%
You can use it as a
perfume and all that stuff.

00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:06.565 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And as
a healing agent.

00:49:06.565 --> 00:49:08.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: And then
of course, I mean,

00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:10.150 align:middle line:84%
roses are all sorts of
colors, but a lot of times the

00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:10.950 align:middle line:90%
rose is red.

00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:13.480 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in esoteric,
it's always shown as red.

00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:14.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, then going
back to alchemy,

00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:17.320 align:middle line:84%
we can talk about the
negreto, the albedo,

00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:19.180 align:middle line:84%
and the rubedo,
which is the red,

00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:20.620 align:middle line:84%
and of course
that's the passion.

00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:22.690 align:middle line:84%
It's the passion that
you have towards finding

00:49:22.690 --> 00:49:24.100 align:middle line:90%
that divine within.

00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:25.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That would
be interesting.

00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:26.933 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, let me know what you find.

00:49:26.933 --> 00:49:29.080 align:middle line:84%
If you haven't played
with it yet specifically,

00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:31.390 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to know what
you find out about what's

00:49:31.390 --> 00:49:33.230 align:middle line:90%
embedded in the rose.

00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:34.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: Sure.

00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:35.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because to me, it's
symbolic of so many things--

00:49:35.830 --> 00:49:36.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: Yeah, it is.

00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:38.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --of a
more refined nature.

00:49:38.730 --> 00:49:41.890 align:middle line:84%
So in this whole
journey, I mean,

00:49:41.890 --> 00:49:46.630 align:middle line:84%
we can talk about math and such
probably for hours and hours,

00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:47.719 align:middle line:90%
but I really want to--

00:49:47.719 --> 00:49:48.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: I certainly can.

00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:49.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know you can.

00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:50.180 align:middle line:90%
I can't.

00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:51.460 align:middle line:90%
You can.

00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:53.050 align:middle line:90%
The human implication of it--

00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:56.260 align:middle line:84%
what has this mathematical
journey for you

00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:59.150 align:middle line:84%
really taught you about
yourself, your own life,

00:49:59.150 --> 00:50:01.915 align:middle line:84%
your own experience, your
own place in this universe.

00:50:01.915 --> 00:50:05.880 align:middle line:90%


00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:07.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: It's the thing
I was looking for.

00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:09.299 align:middle line:90%
I wanted proof.

00:50:09.299 --> 00:50:10.340 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want conjecture.

00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:10.770 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want opinion.

00:50:10.770 --> 00:50:11.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You
wanted proof of God?

00:50:11.540 --> 00:50:12.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: God.

00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:13.850 align:middle line:90%
I wanted proof of the divine.

00:50:13.850 --> 00:50:17.870 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't happy with some guru or
some new age person telling me

00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:18.830 align:middle line:90%
this is how it is.

00:50:18.830 --> 00:50:21.657 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't happy with what
modern science was peddling.

00:50:21.657 --> 00:50:23.240 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't happy with
any of that stuff.

00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:24.800 align:middle line:84%
There were no answers
that I was finding

00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:25.800 align:middle line:90%
in any of those things--

00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:29.830 align:middle line:90%
and in the organized religions.

00:50:29.830 --> 00:50:31.980 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really find any
answers there either.

00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:33.757 align:middle line:84%
So when I went and I
looked at this stuff,

00:50:33.757 --> 00:50:35.840 align:middle line:84%
but, like I said, through
the lens of mathematics,

00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:37.880 align:middle line:84%
that gave me that answer
that I was looking for.

00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:40.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not claiming that's
the answer for everybody else.

00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:43.334 align:middle line:10%
I'm just saying I just want
to share my journey with that

00:50:43.334 --> 00:50:44.750 align:middle line:10%
through all this
stuff with people

00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:48.320 align:middle line:10%
because it made so much sense
to me, and it's illuminated--

00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:51.330 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I don't think the
same as I did when I was 28.

00:50:51.330 --> 00:50:53.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I literally had
a break of consciousness

00:50:53.330 --> 00:50:56.120 align:middle line:84%
that was like I just saw
the world differently.

00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:58.600 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, it's just--
looking around this room,

00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:01.297 align:middle line:90%
it's seeing geometry everywhere.

00:51:01.297 --> 00:51:02.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And beauty everywhere.

00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:05.424 align:middle line:84%
You wanted empirical
truth that God exists,

00:51:05.424 --> 00:51:07.340 align:middle line:84%
and you're part of it,
and you're growing back

00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:09.057 align:middle line:90%
into this yourself.

00:51:09.057 --> 00:51:09.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LEEDS: Absolutely.

00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:11.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's the
point of the journey.

00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:11.840 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:14.089 align:middle line:84%
And that is the point--
you're right-- of all journeys

00:51:14.089 --> 00:51:16.430 align:middle line:84%
and that you found a language
that ties it all together.

00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:18.680 align:middle line:84%
It would make sense also
for a lot of other people

00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:21.520 align:middle line:84%
who are looking for that
one thing that brings

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:22.944 align:middle line:90%
it together as proof positive.

00:51:22.944 --> 00:51:24.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: Yeah, that's a
good way of saying it.

00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:27.016 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Any final
thoughts before we go?

00:51:27.016 --> 00:51:29.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LEEDS: No, I think we did
a good job of covering a lot.

00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:31.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I think we did, too.

00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:34.045 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much,
Claudia, Marty.

00:51:34.045 --> 00:51:36.530 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:39.650 align:middle line:84%
I hope this has been elucidating
to you and certainly all of you

00:51:39.650 --> 00:51:41.780 align:middle line:84%
that have a deep
understanding of mathematics

00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:43.280 align:middle line:84%
and where mathematics
speak to you.

00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:46.170 align:middle line:10%
Again, the title of the book is
"The Peacock's Tail" by Marty

00:51:46.170 --> 00:51:47.810 align:middle line:10%
Leeds, or Claudia Pavonis.

00:51:47.810 --> 00:51:52.150 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Open Minds.

00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:59.894 align:middle line:90%
