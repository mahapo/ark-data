>> Regina Meredith: As we stare
out into the cosmos at night,

00:00:31.297 --> 00:00:35.869 align:middle line:84%
gazing at the stars we feel
awe so small in contrast.

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:37.904 align:middle line:84%
If you were to look
at an atom, however,

00:00:37.904 --> 00:00:40.006 align:middle line:84%
it was much like
that solar system,

00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:42.442 align:middle line:84%
equally is vast are
the electron's distance

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:46.713 align:middle line:84%
from their central sun or
nucleus, each tiny solar system.

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:47.948 align:middle line:90%
How does this mean?

00:00:47.948 --> 00:00:51.284 align:middle line:84%
It means that we're a direct
reflection of the cosmos

00:00:51.284 --> 00:00:54.387 align:middle line:84%
in which we lived and are
inextricably intertwined.

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:56.890 align:middle line:84%
AT Mann has understood
this from the beginning

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.892 align:middle line:84%
of his career is
first an architect

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:00.327 align:middle line:90%
and later an astrologer.

00:01:00.327 --> 00:01:03.830 align:middle line:84%
He furthers this concept in
saying that our journey begins

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.334 align:middle line:84%
from our conception, not our
birth which is a unique view

00:01:07.334 --> 00:01:10.470 align:middle line:84%
of incarnation and
reincarnation.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.472 align:middle line:90%
Welcome and me I call you Ted?

00:01:12.472 --> 00:01:13.673 align:middle line:90%
>> AT Mann: Yes, please do.

00:01:13.673 --> 00:01:14.774 align:middle line:84%
>>Regina Meredith: I think
that's what your friends

00:01:14.774 --> 00:01:16.309 align:middle line:84%
and most people call
you that your official--

00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:18.044 align:middle line:90%
your literally name is AT.

00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:18.812 align:middle line:90%
>> AT Mann: Correct.

00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:20.013 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Mann.

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:22.883 align:middle line:84%
So I want to get into--
let's just launch into it,

00:01:22.883 --> 00:01:26.619 align:middle line:84%
you have a very complex
view of astrology as opposed

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.455 align:middle line:84%
to what most people
do and let's get

00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:32.425 align:middle line:84%
into your original influences of
gratif [phonetic] and so forth

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:34.394 align:middle line:84%
and in terms of this
whole notion

00:01:34.394 --> 00:01:37.464 align:middle line:84%
that our journey
begins at conception.

00:01:37.464 --> 00:01:39.633 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll talk
about factors around it.

00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:41.635 align:middle line:90%
>> AT Mann: Yes.

00:01:41.635 --> 00:01:44.604 align:middle line:84%
When I first came across
astrology, I was still working

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:48.041 align:middle line:84%
as an architect in New
York City and intrigued me

00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:49.142 align:middle line:90%
that everything I read

00:01:49.142 --> 00:01:53.246 align:middle line:84%
that astrology was
actually wrote, didn't.

00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:57.217 align:middle line:84%
It just felt very flat and
very one dimensional to me,

00:01:57.217 --> 00:02:01.955 align:middle line:84%
and so I resolved having been an
architect that I needed really

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:05.125 align:middle line:84%
to re-envision what
was really happening.

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:07.761 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that the
horoscope was really a place

00:02:07.761 --> 00:02:12.098 align:middle line:84%
to start, and I was fortunate
and then I had read the books

00:02:12.098 --> 00:02:15.502 align:middle line:84%
of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky
but particularly The Theory

00:02:15.502 --> 00:02:19.172 align:middle line:84%
of Celestial Influence by Rodney
Collin and in it he talked

00:02:19.172 --> 00:02:22.342 align:middle line:84%
about what he call the Long
Body of the Solar System

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:25.545 align:middle line:84%
and he said the sun doesn't sit
in space with planets revolving

00:02:25.545 --> 00:02:28.682 align:middle line:84%
around it but rather it's
moving in a phenomenal rate

00:02:28.682 --> 00:02:30.650 align:middle line:90%
around the galactic center.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.087 align:middle line:84%
And at this time in the
late 60s, early 70s,

00:02:34.087 --> 00:02:37.224 align:middle line:84%
that was a pretty
radical statement to make.

00:02:37.224 --> 00:02:40.193 align:middle line:84%
And so I eventually decided
that I would just try

00:02:40.193 --> 00:02:44.030 align:middle line:84%
to represent this myself which
I did and I made a diagram

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.765 align:middle line:90%
which you can see here

00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:49.669 align:middle line:84%
that actually shows the
central filament of the sun

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:51.538 align:middle line:84%
with planets spiraling
around it.

00:02:51.538 --> 00:02:56.176 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And it's interesting
because now, decades later,

00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:59.846 align:middle line:84%
people said Walter Cruttenden
was put an immense amount

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:01.381 align:middle line:84%
of research and time
and to money

00:03:01.381 --> 00:03:04.918 align:middle line:84%
and to exploring the thing you
saw then which was your theory

00:03:04.918 --> 00:03:08.822 align:middle line:84%
at that time was that the
sun is actually itself moving

00:03:08.822 --> 00:03:12.592 align:middle line:84%
around Sirius which Walter
Cruttenden calls the companion

00:03:12.592 --> 00:03:15.629 align:middle line:84%
star at which we are
a binary star system

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.299 align:middle line:84%
which I don't think that's being
acknowledged yet in the world

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:20.734 align:middle line:90%
of science per se is it?

00:03:20.734 --> 00:03:23.670 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: Well, Rodney Collin
have the same hypothesis.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.873 align:middle line:84%
He said it because of the
geometry of the solar system

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:31.144 align:middle line:84%
in the universe that he believe
that instead of a sun moving

00:03:31.144 --> 00:03:34.881 align:middle line:84%
around the galactic center that
our sun revolve around Sirius

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:37.050 align:middle line:84%
which revolve around
the galactic center.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.386 align:middle line:84%
But the gist of it is
that the sun moves close

00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:42.355 align:middle line:84%
to a million miles a
day and that the planets

00:03:42.355 --> 00:03:45.425 align:middle line:84%
around it are essentially
trails very much

00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:47.527 align:middle line:84%
like a flashlight
on a summer evening.

00:03:47.527 --> 00:03:49.362 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And your coffee
is not spilling.

00:03:49.362 --> 00:03:50.697 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: And the coffee
is not spilling

00:03:50.697 --> 00:03:53.165 align:middle line:84%
because of this phenomenon
called gravity.

00:03:53.165 --> 00:03:56.936 align:middle line:84%
But the idea was that I also
realized at the same time

00:03:56.936 --> 00:04:01.041 align:middle line:84%
that the spiraling solar system
actually is the same kind

00:04:01.041 --> 00:04:04.744 align:middle line:84%
of dynamic as the DNA spiral
that's within every cell.

00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:07.547 align:middle line:84%
And one of the axioms of
astrology is always been

00:04:07.547 --> 00:04:10.150 align:middle line:84%
since medieval times
that the macrocosm

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.284 align:middle line:90%
which is the outer world,

00:04:11.284 --> 00:04:14.554 align:middle line:84%
the large world reflects
the interworld

00:04:14.554 --> 00:04:18.191 align:middle line:84%
and this has been represented
in imagery for hundred of years.

00:04:18.191 --> 00:04:19.826 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Absolutely,
as above so below.

00:04:19.826 --> 00:04:20.627 align:middle line:90%
>> AM: Correct.

00:04:20.627 --> 00:04:21.928 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: And but I don't think

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:25.332 align:middle line:84%
that as a species we've been
really getting that until,

00:04:25.332 --> 00:04:29.669 align:middle line:84%
at least in this round of our
development until very recently.

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.771 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: Yeah, and the
reason basically is

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:35.575 align:middle line:84%
that obviously DNA was
discovered by Crick and Watson

00:04:35.575 --> 00:04:40.814 align:middle line:84%
in the 40s and as a result
earlier cultures going back

00:04:40.814 --> 00:04:43.717 align:middle line:84%
thousands of years had
principles and concept

00:04:43.717 --> 00:04:45.518 align:middle line:84%
of reincarnation
like the Egyptians

00:04:45.518 --> 00:04:47.587 align:middle line:90%
or the Chaldeans and so on.

00:04:47.587 --> 00:04:49.255 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: But it was
centered around Sirius.

00:04:49.255 --> 00:04:50.023 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: Well, they
weren't necessa--

00:04:50.023 --> 00:04:50.957 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Not the astrology--

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:51.591 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: Yeah, the
Egyptian religion.

00:04:51.591 --> 00:04:52.926 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:04:52.926 --> 00:04:54.327 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: was centered around
Sirius, yes, but it was very,

00:04:54.327 --> 00:04:57.764 align:middle line:84%
very interesting that there was
no concept for a transmission

00:04:57.764 --> 00:05:01.835 align:middle line:84%
of information from life to life
and so when DNA was discovered

00:05:01.835 --> 00:05:03.937 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not saying
that reincarnation

00:05:03.937 --> 00:05:05.538 align:middle line:90%
for example is all DNA

00:05:05.538 --> 00:05:08.708 align:middle line:84%
but rather there is a actually
a repository of information--

00:05:08.708 --> 00:05:10.110 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Absolutely.

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.878 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: -- in every cell and that
there's a communication going

00:05:11.878 --> 00:05:15.949 align:middle line:84%
on between the spiraling
solar system and the macrocosm

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:20.387 align:middle line:84%
and the genetic information
in every cell.

00:05:20.387 --> 00:05:22.222 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I find it
fascinating personally.

00:05:22.222 --> 00:05:25.592 align:middle line:84%
I mean when you begin looking
at how much we are, how every,

00:05:25.592 --> 00:05:29.229 align:middle line:84%
every single-- well as I
said in introducing you,

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:31.498 align:middle line:90%
down to the atomic model,

00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:34.000 align:middle line:84%
everything is reflected
in our cosmos.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.437 align:middle line:84%
And they're seeing some other
imagery recently that have to do

00:05:37.437 --> 00:05:40.440 align:middle line:90%
with neuro firing in the brain

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.344 align:middle line:84%
that completely mimics
similar patterns in the cosmos,

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:45.845 align:middle line:84%
that's what you're
talking about.

00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:48.181 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: Well, yeah, another
extension of that is an image

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:52.352 align:middle line:84%
that I saw recently which
showed the pattern of neurons

00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:55.054 align:middle line:84%
in the brain and how they
relate to each other--

00:05:55.054 --> 00:05:56.356 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:57.991 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: -- is very similar
to the way galaxies connect

00:05:57.991 --> 00:06:00.026 align:middle line:84%
to each other on that
macrocosmic level.

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:02.962 align:middle line:84%
So the connection between
what's above and what's below

00:06:02.962 --> 00:06:07.333 align:middle line:84%
or what's outside and what's
inside works via this process

00:06:07.333 --> 00:06:11.237 align:middle line:84%
physicist call, "Residence"
which is, it's really difficult

00:06:11.237 --> 00:06:14.207 align:middle line:84%
for people to imagine
because it's a transmission

00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:17.210 align:middle line:84%
of information that
happens outside of time.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.912 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Outside of time and
outside of destination.

00:06:18.912 --> 00:06:19.879 align:middle line:90%
>> AM: And across space.

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:20.947 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Across space so we'd had

00:06:20.947 --> 00:06:22.816 align:middle line:84%
to say it's beyond
the fourth dimension.

00:06:22.816 --> 00:06:23.383 align:middle line:90%
>> AM: Correct.

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:24.584 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: For sure.

00:06:24.584 --> 00:06:27.353 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have some of the
modeling you've worked

00:06:27.353 --> 00:06:31.090 align:middle line:84%
with reflects the resonance
project of Nassim Haramein.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:32.392 align:middle line:90%
>> AM: Absolutely,

00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:35.662 align:middle line:84%
when I discovered Nassim's
work a couple of years ago,

00:06:35.662 --> 00:06:40.700 align:middle line:84%
I was lecturing in Arizona
and the wife of the organizer

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.037 align:middle line:84%
who was not an astrologer
said she had seen this program

00:06:44.037 --> 00:06:47.640 align:middle line:84%
on late night television,
you know, not long before

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.843 align:middle line:84%
and that she thought I should
really have looked at it

00:06:49.843 --> 00:06:52.111 align:middle line:90%
and I was surprised because even

00:06:52.111 --> 00:06:55.114 align:middle line:84%
within the astrological
community, you know,

00:06:55.114 --> 00:06:56.783 align:middle line:90%
for 30 years I've been talking

00:06:56.783 --> 00:07:01.354 align:middle line:84%
to astrologers who's business
is time and planets and so on

00:07:01.354 --> 00:07:03.356 align:middle line:84%
and when I showed him
a spiraling diagram

00:07:03.356 --> 00:07:05.658 align:middle line:84%
of the solar system,
and say, "What is this?"

00:07:05.658 --> 00:07:09.028 align:middle line:84%
very few people are
able to say what it is.

00:07:09.028 --> 00:07:13.199 align:middle line:84%
But once you look at that model
it begins to explain all kinds

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:15.368 align:middle line:84%
of things which I think
are still in the process

00:07:15.368 --> 00:07:19.072 align:middle line:84%
of being discovered
in many ways.

00:07:19.072 --> 00:07:23.376 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: You said just a little
bit ago in this process

00:07:23.376 --> 00:07:26.779 align:middle line:84%
of discovery that you are
left unsatisfied in terms

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:30.817 align:middle line:84%
of the astrological information
that you had access to as--

00:07:30.817 --> 00:07:33.520 align:middle line:84%
really as a kid when you
became interested in all this,

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:37.690 align:middle line:84%
nothing was giving you that
connection between the all

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.826 align:middle line:90%
that is and what translates

00:07:39.826 --> 00:07:43.229 align:middle line:84%
into a unique expression
in each one of us.

00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:44.864 align:middle line:90%
Is it that it doesn't exist?

00:07:44.864 --> 00:07:48.468 align:middle line:84%
I mean wasn't-- were there
ancients systems of astrology

00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:51.704 align:middle line:84%
that actually did understand
this and some of that embodied

00:07:51.704 --> 00:07:54.440 align:middle line:90%
in what exist now or is it lost?

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.709 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: I like to-- I
like to make an analogy

00:07:56.709 --> 00:08:01.748 align:middle line:84%
between the revolution that
Einstein initiated of relativity

00:08:01.748 --> 00:08:04.017 align:middle line:84%
which is before Einstein
the universe was seen

00:08:04.017 --> 00:08:06.819 align:middle line:84%
as basically flat, the
sun sitting in space

00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:08.621 align:middle line:90%
and planets moving around it.

00:08:08.621 --> 00:08:11.257 align:middle line:84%
Once you acknowledge
the idea of relativity

00:08:11.257 --> 00:08:14.327 align:middle line:84%
of things then it opens up
a whole different dimension.

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:18.231 align:middle line:84%
And so my idea was basically
once you have this idea

00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:21.801 align:middle line:84%
of a spiral what you begin
to realize that a horoscope,

00:08:21.801 --> 00:08:24.537 align:middle line:84%
a person's birth
chart is only a slice

00:08:24.537 --> 00:08:26.806 align:middle line:90%
through that spiraling system,

00:08:26.806 --> 00:08:28.942 align:middle line:84%
your life as a whole
section of it.

00:08:28.942 --> 00:08:33.880 align:middle line:84%
So I began looking at a person's
life time as a process in time

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.248 align:middle line:84%
that evolves and I
suddenly realized also

00:08:36.248 --> 00:08:38.051 align:middle line:90%
that birth isn't the beginning

00:08:38.051 --> 00:08:41.955 align:middle line:84%
of this process rather
one's conception is.

00:08:41.955 --> 00:08:44.824 align:middle line:84%
And then even if you look at
the fact that we're conceived

00:08:44.824 --> 00:08:48.595 align:middle line:84%
from a sperm than an ovum,
it comes from our parents

00:08:48.595 --> 00:08:51.197 align:middle line:84%
and their parents and their
parents, their parents.

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:55.335 align:middle line:84%
So, in fact you know, you're
led to a conclusion which I came

00:08:55.335 --> 00:08:58.438 align:middle line:84%
to many decades ago which
is essentially the ovum

00:08:58.438 --> 00:09:02.375 align:middle line:84%
that we're conceived from
is essentially eternal

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:05.044 align:middle line:84%
because it's been passed from
mother to mother, to mother,

00:09:05.044 --> 00:09:10.083 align:middle line:84%
to mother since the first human
so we carry within us patterns

00:09:10.083 --> 00:09:13.753 align:middle line:84%
that are actually as
old as life is and.

00:09:13.753 --> 00:09:15.121 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Very much so.

00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:18.324 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting because
when you start doing an overlay

00:09:18.324 --> 00:09:21.160 align:middle line:84%
of reincarnation into
this you start seeing

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:25.531 align:middle line:84%
where genetics actually
are key in the process

00:09:25.531 --> 00:09:30.603 align:middle line:84%
of as a soul choosing to commit
to a particular blood line

00:09:30.603 --> 00:09:33.739 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, a particular
experience.

00:09:33.739 --> 00:09:34.874 align:middle line:90%
>> AM: Absolutely.

00:09:34.874 --> 00:09:38.711 align:middle line:84%
And not only that what
happens then is that,

00:09:38.711 --> 00:09:42.649 align:middle line:84%
we carry our collective
heritage inside and that

00:09:42.649 --> 00:09:46.519 align:middle line:84%
that collective heritage unfolds
from the time we're conceived

00:09:46.519 --> 00:09:47.954 align:middle line:90%
until the time we're born.

00:09:47.954 --> 00:09:50.623 align:middle line:84%
Most astrologers start looking
at your life from a time

00:09:50.623 --> 00:09:52.458 align:middle line:90%
of birth but, you know,

00:09:52.458 --> 00:09:56.162 align:middle line:84%
gestation itself is very
powerful because we evolve

00:09:56.162 --> 00:09:59.499 align:middle line:84%
into being human and passed
through the entire process

00:09:59.499 --> 00:10:00.667 align:middle line:90%
but highly compacted in time.

00:10:00.667 --> 00:10:02.068 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:10:02.068 --> 00:10:05.838 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: So when you take a look
at that, you begin to discover

00:10:05.838 --> 00:10:09.008 align:middle line:84%
that essentially we're carrying
this collective record which,

00:10:09.008 --> 00:10:10.877 align:middle line:84%
you know, the psychologist
Jung called the

00:10:10.877 --> 00:10:12.178 align:middle line:90%
Collective Unconscious.

00:10:12.178 --> 00:10:14.781 align:middle line:84%
Jung always look to see
where is it, you know,

00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:17.650 align:middle line:84%
where is this collective
unconscious stored.

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:19.852 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it's in
every single cell.

00:10:19.852 --> 00:10:20.820 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.021 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: And similarly,
Edgar Cayce

00:10:22.021 --> 00:10:25.258 align:middle line:84%
or the theosophist called
it the Akashic record

00:10:25.258 --> 00:10:28.327 align:middle line:84%
that made it looked like, and
in fact I have a little image

00:10:28.327 --> 00:10:30.396 align:middle line:90%
to show that represents that.

00:10:30.396 --> 00:10:33.599 align:middle line:84%
He makes it look like some kind
of cosmic library in the sky

00:10:33.599 --> 00:10:36.803 align:middle line:84%
that you know some gifted
individuals have access to it.

00:10:36.803 --> 00:10:38.204 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:10:38.204 --> 00:10:41.407 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: But the idea is that, of
course everyone alive has access

00:10:41.407 --> 00:10:43.710 align:middle line:84%
to this repository
of information

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:47.246 align:middle line:84%
which goes way back before
not only when you were born

00:10:47.246 --> 00:10:50.883 align:middle line:84%
or you were conceived but back
into the midst of history.

00:10:50.883 --> 00:10:52.652 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: It's the holographic
universe.

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:53.419 align:middle line:90%
>> AM: It is.

00:10:53.419 --> 00:10:54.620 align:middle line:90%
It's a holographic model.

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:55.722 align:middle line:90%
>> RM': Yes.

00:10:55.722 --> 00:10:56.923 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: And again I--
you know I met people

00:10:56.923 --> 00:10:58.725 align:middle line:84%
like Stan Grof [assumed
spelling] back in the 70s

00:10:58.725 --> 00:11:01.594 align:middle line:84%
and 80s and, you know,
and listening to models

00:11:01.594 --> 00:11:04.630 align:middle line:84%
like these I began realizing
of course that astrology,

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:07.900 align:middle line:84%
which is always looked at
as a kind of bastard child

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:11.738 align:middle line:84%
of the sciences was in fact
on of the original sciences

00:11:11.738 --> 00:11:13.206 align:middle line:90%
if not the original science.

00:11:13.206 --> 00:11:17.276 align:middle line:84%
And that-- you know one of my
missions as it were is to try

00:11:17.276 --> 00:11:21.380 align:middle line:84%
to bring to, you know,
to the world of educated

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:25.184 align:middle line:84%
and intelligent people the fact
that this is not gobbledygook,

00:11:25.184 --> 00:11:28.087 align:middle line:84%
it's not kind of a funny
way of looking at the world

00:11:28.087 --> 00:11:31.390 align:middle line:84%
but rather it actually is
beginning to fit into place

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:34.660 align:middle line:84%
with the way physics for
example is beginning to evolve.

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:35.962 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Absolutely.

00:11:35.962 --> 00:11:37.230 align:middle line:84%
And the nice thing is even
though-I mean there are baby

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:38.631 align:middle line:90%
steps to everything.

00:11:38.631 --> 00:11:41.367 align:middle line:84%
When you have your little one
liners in the paper everyday,

00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:43.970 align:middle line:84%
the newspaper everyday,
that's an entry point.

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:47.073 align:middle line:84%
That's where people can start
looking at it and you at least--

00:11:47.073 --> 00:11:49.142 align:middle line:84%
beginning to develop
a relationship

00:11:49.142 --> 00:11:52.245 align:middle line:84%
and may be even a relationship
of trust that it has any value

00:11:52.245 --> 00:11:55.381 align:middle line:84%
at all and then you're
the extreme end of that.

00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And I want to go into
an anecdote of yours,

00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:00.052 align:middle line:84%
if we may which we were
going to talk about later,

00:12:00.052 --> 00:12:02.955 align:middle line:84%
but I would rather go into
it right now before we get

00:12:02.955 --> 00:12:07.260 align:middle line:84%
into the meat of how you're
able to see what you can see

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.563 align:middle line:84%
in a chart because the
media has been the worse

00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:14.066 align:middle line:84%
at basically denigrating
the science of astrology.

00:12:14.066 --> 00:12:14.901 align:middle line:90%
>> AM: Correct.

00:12:14.901 --> 00:12:16.035 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: They have been terrible.

00:12:16.035 --> 00:12:18.137 align:middle line:84%
And many, many years ago
when you were just a kid

00:12:18.137 --> 00:12:21.808 align:middle line:84%
but fully led up in this
way, you were live on BBC.

00:12:21.808 --> 00:12:24.577 align:middle line:84%
You were telling me that was
your first live television show?

00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:26.112 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: Well, you
know, it's interesting

00:12:26.112 --> 00:12:28.314 align:middle line:84%
because when I began
doing astrology,

00:12:28.314 --> 00:12:31.184 align:middle line:84%
I really did not know any
other astrologers at all.

00:12:31.184 --> 00:12:35.888 align:middle line:84%
So I imagined that I wasn't
the only person to have gone

00:12:35.888 --> 00:12:36.956 align:middle line:90%
through this process

00:12:36.956 --> 00:12:40.026 align:middle line:84%
of re-envisioning the
way astrology work

00:12:40.026 --> 00:12:42.495 align:middle line:90%
in time and space.

00:12:42.495 --> 00:12:45.231 align:middle line:84%
My first book the Round Art was
called the astrology of time

00:12:45.231 --> 00:12:48.067 align:middle line:84%
and space and the gist of
it was that I, you know,

00:12:48.067 --> 00:12:51.804 align:middle line:84%
I've studied physics in
the University, at Cornell

00:12:51.804 --> 00:12:54.841 align:middle line:84%
and I began realizing
that what we were talking

00:12:54.841 --> 00:12:58.010 align:middle line:84%
about in astrology was
actually very much wedded

00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:00.813 align:middle line:84%
to the whole body of
ancient information.

00:13:00.813 --> 00:13:02.415 align:middle line:90%
And so I was invited to appear

00:13:02.415 --> 00:13:06.886 align:middle line:84%
on a BBC program called Brass
Tacks in 1980, I think it was

00:13:06.886 --> 00:13:10.323 align:middle line:90%
and Brass Tacks by definition

00:13:10.323 --> 00:13:13.492 align:middle line:84%
in England meant this
guy was a penetrating.

00:13:13.492 --> 00:13:14.794 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: He's going to nail you.

00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:15.995 align:middle line:90%
>> AM: Penetrating analyst--

00:13:15.995 --> 00:13:17.363 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:13:17.363 --> 00:13:18.965 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: -- who was going to nail
me because of the falsities

00:13:18.965 --> 00:13:20.867 align:middle line:90%
that he expected to see, right,

00:13:20.867 --> 00:13:23.436 align:middle line:84%
the kind of sun sign
astrology dynamic.

00:13:23.436 --> 00:13:26.973 align:middle line:84%
And so I actually, I saw what
was going to be happening

00:13:26.973 --> 00:13:29.942 align:middle line:84%
and they have filmed me doing
reading for a young woman

00:13:29.942 --> 00:13:35.248 align:middle line:84%
who I didn't know and it turned
out to be so absurdly accurate

00:13:35.248 --> 00:13:38.384 align:middle line:84%
that they were a bit
shocked and so I went live

00:13:38.384 --> 00:13:40.453 align:middle line:84%
on television prime
time in England

00:13:40.453 --> 00:13:45.157 align:middle line:84%
and he interviewed me face to
face but I asked the producer

00:13:45.157 --> 00:13:48.361 align:middle line:84%
who is a woman, I said,
"Please give me 15 minutes

00:13:48.361 --> 00:13:50.630 align:middle line:84%
with him just before
we go on the air.

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:54.033 align:middle line:84%
I just want to introduce him to
the way he's on astrology works.

00:13:54.033 --> 00:13:55.902 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Were you given his
birth data prior to this?

00:13:55.902 --> 00:13:58.304 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: I was given his correct
birth information, time,

00:13:58.304 --> 00:14:02.275 align:middle line:84%
date and place and I was able to
see by looking at this horoscope

00:14:02.275 --> 00:14:04.477 align:middle line:84%
that he was actually
illegitimate.

00:14:04.477 --> 00:14:08.114 align:middle line:84%
And this was really a bit of
a shocked to him because first

00:14:08.114 --> 00:14:11.050 align:middle line:84%
of all I have to say
really isn't the kind

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:14.787 align:middle line:84%
of thing you can say to someone
when you're not really sure

00:14:14.787 --> 00:14:15.788 align:middle line:90%
about what you're saying.

00:14:15.788 --> 00:14:17.490 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: And do it in live TV.

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:18.791 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: And I was
on-- well, no, no.

00:14:18.791 --> 00:14:19.558 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: I know this was prior--

00:14:19.558 --> 00:14:20.326 align:middle line:90%
>> AM: This wasn't filmed.

00:14:20.326 --> 00:14:21.327 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: That's what I said.

00:14:21.327 --> 00:14:22.395 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: This is a
private consultation.

00:14:22.395 --> 00:14:23.529 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: You weren't
going to sit down on TV.

00:14:23.529 --> 00:14:24.597 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: I could say in
that situation and I did

00:14:24.597 --> 00:14:26.465 align:middle line:90%
and I realized of course

00:14:26.465 --> 00:14:30.069 align:middle line:84%
that I was absolutely
spot-on and he realized it.

00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:33.005 align:middle line:84%
And that I was threatening
to actually expose him

00:14:33.005 --> 00:14:34.573 align:middle line:84%
by any stretch of
the imagination

00:14:34.573 --> 00:14:37.109 align:middle line:84%
but it really affected
him very deeply

00:14:37.109 --> 00:14:41.414 align:middle line:84%
and as a result he was
extremely apologetic, positive

00:14:41.414 --> 00:14:43.382 align:middle line:84%
and very good actually
in handling.

00:14:43.382 --> 00:14:45.251 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Which he supported
during the interview

00:14:45.251 --> 00:14:46.552 align:middle line:90%
from that point forward?

00:14:46.552 --> 00:14:47.553 align:middle line:90%
>> AM: Absolutely.

00:14:47.553 --> 00:14:48.721 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I see and
that's what it takes.

00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:51.791 align:middle line:84%
One interview, one
article, one book at a time

00:14:51.791 --> 00:14:54.694 align:middle line:84%
as people become exposed
to these theories.

00:14:54.694 --> 00:14:56.429 align:middle line:90%
Now, let's go into it directly.

00:14:56.429 --> 00:14:57.630 align:middle line:90%
>> AM: Right.

00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:00.099 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Let's talk about
what happens at conception

00:15:00.099 --> 00:15:04.670 align:middle line:84%
and the full story of what's
happening with the mother

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:08.007 align:middle line:84%
and the father and I want
to preface this with saying

00:15:08.007 --> 00:15:11.310 align:middle line:84%
that as I watch people and
I watch people's dynamics

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:14.146 align:middle line:84%
and their family, it
always seems to me

00:15:14.146 --> 00:15:18.918 align:middle line:84%
that you can see a higher
influence of one blood line

00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:21.954 align:middle line:84%
on that child or that
person then the other.

00:15:21.954 --> 00:15:23.789 align:middle line:84%
It's like they're
bringing through maybe more

00:15:23.789 --> 00:15:26.625 align:middle line:84%
of the father's lineage than the
mother's lineage though it does

00:15:26.625 --> 00:15:28.828 align:middle line:84%
absolutely take two to
give you an opportunity

00:15:28.828 --> 00:15:30.262 align:middle line:90%
to express anything.

00:15:30.262 --> 00:15:31.530 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:33.933 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: So the way it works
is that in the horoscope,

00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:36.569 align:middle line:84%
there's a particular point
which is a conception point

00:15:36.569 --> 00:15:40.206 align:middle line:84%
and it falls in the sign
of the zodiac, like if it's

00:15:40.206 --> 00:15:42.174 align:middle line:90%
in the sign Pisces, it means--

00:15:42.174 --> 00:15:44.744 align:middle line:84%
and you see it from your
mother's point of view

00:15:44.744 --> 00:15:48.581 align:middle line:84%
because the sexual act
happens within her as it were.

00:15:48.581 --> 00:15:51.751 align:middle line:90%
And so, with Pisces, it means

00:15:51.751 --> 00:15:54.020 align:middle line:84%
that it's an event
that happens to her.

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:57.623 align:middle line:84%
If it Aries then it means that
she initiates it probably.

00:15:57.623 --> 00:16:01.927 align:middle line:84%
So within that context, the sun
and the horoscope is your father

00:16:01.927 --> 00:16:03.596 align:middle line:90%
and your father's blood line

00:16:03.596 --> 00:16:06.599 align:middle line:84%
and your father's
genetic transmission,

00:16:06.599 --> 00:16:10.669 align:middle line:84%
in the same way the moon is your
mother, your emotional reality

00:16:10.669 --> 00:16:12.471 align:middle line:84%
and your mother side
of the family.

00:16:12.471 --> 00:16:14.607 align:middle line:84%
By seeing the relationship
between the sun,

00:16:14.607 --> 00:16:18.110 align:middle line:84%
and moon in your horoscope you
can see what was your parent's

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:20.379 align:middle line:84%
relationship like at the
moment you were conceived

00:16:20.379 --> 00:16:23.015 align:middle line:84%
and if there's an
opposition for example,

00:16:23.015 --> 00:16:25.718 align:middle line:84%
it means they were polar
opposites as people

00:16:25.718 --> 00:16:29.588 align:middle line:84%
that maybe your mother
resisted the conception itself

00:16:29.588 --> 00:16:32.491 align:middle line:84%
because she felt so
different from your father,

00:16:32.491 --> 00:16:36.595 align:middle line:84%
and what it also triggers in
you is a very deep pattern

00:16:36.595 --> 00:16:38.964 align:middle line:84%
that shows that you're
likely to be drawn to people

00:16:38.964 --> 00:16:40.599 align:middle line:90%
that are opposite to you.

00:16:40.599 --> 00:16:44.837 align:middle line:84%
Whether this is psychologically,
emotionally, spiritually,

00:16:44.837 --> 00:16:47.807 align:middle line:84%
even in terms of
religious sense or parents

00:16:47.807 --> 00:16:50.209 align:middle line:90%
but also it's fascinating

00:16:50.209 --> 00:16:54.613 align:middle line:84%
because the conception point is
a metaphor for your creativity,

00:16:54.613 --> 00:16:58.184 align:middle line:84%
the way in which the male and
female parts of you interact.

00:16:58.184 --> 00:17:01.520 align:middle line:84%
It's a metaphor for your
spiritual discovery process.

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.256 align:middle line:84%
It's also a metaphor
for your sexuality.

00:17:04.256 --> 00:17:07.426 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly
enough you discover a lot

00:17:07.426 --> 00:17:08.928 align:middle line:90%
of very powerful information

00:17:08.928 --> 00:17:12.565 align:middle line:84%
about people's not only their
sexuality on a literal level

00:17:12.565 --> 00:17:13.731 align:middle line:90%
but the way they perceive it.

00:17:13.731 --> 00:17:14.533 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Uh-hmm.

00:17:14.533 --> 00:17:15.668 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:17:15.668 --> 00:17:18.204 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: Meaning that if
your mother felt coerce

00:17:18.204 --> 00:17:21.673 align:middle line:84%
into this process then there's
an element of coercion that has

00:17:21.673 --> 00:17:24.176 align:middle line:84%
to do with not only
your sexuality

00:17:24.176 --> 00:17:25.745 align:middle line:90%
but also your creativity so.

00:17:25.745 --> 00:17:28.280 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And you see this playing
out as you do people's charts

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.049 align:middle line:90%
and have their choose--

00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:31.784 align:middle line:84%
reflected back to
you, validated.

00:17:31.784 --> 00:17:33.285 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: All the time,
all the time.

00:17:33.285 --> 00:17:34.420 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Very interesting.

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:36.088 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: In fact, it's a
metaphor that very much

00:17:36.088 --> 00:17:39.558 align:middle line:84%
like the initial idea, it's
a metaphor that resonates

00:17:39.558 --> 00:17:41.627 align:middle line:90%
because it is your conception.

00:17:41.627 --> 00:17:43.729 align:middle line:90%
It's your coming into the world.

00:17:43.729 --> 00:17:48.167 align:middle line:84%
And for example, talking to
a room full of astrologers

00:17:48.167 --> 00:17:51.737 align:middle line:84%
and psychologist, I'll often
say, "How many of you have tried

00:17:51.737 --> 00:17:54.907 align:middle line:84%
to reconstruct in your own mind
what happen when your mother

00:17:54.907 --> 00:17:56.809 align:middle line:84%
and father made love
to conceive you?"

00:17:56.809 --> 00:17:59.411 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people go, "Oh, God,
I can't even imagine them.

00:17:59.411 --> 00:18:00.546 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: How embarrassing.

00:18:00.546 --> 00:18:01.614 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: I can't imagine
them making love.

00:18:01.614 --> 00:18:02.882 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:18:02.882 --> 00:18:04.550 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: But the reality is
that, that was the moment

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:07.920 align:middle line:84%
that set a pattern of your whole
existence and it's interesting

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:12.124 align:middle line:84%
because the development of
chaos theory is something

00:18:12.124 --> 00:18:14.860 align:middle line:84%
that I've done talks about
chaos theory in astrology.

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:16.262 align:middle line:90%
And what's interesting is

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:21.433 align:middle line:84%
that in chaos theory any chaotic
system before it finds its own

00:18:21.433 --> 00:18:24.270 align:middle line:84%
internal order, it's
the initial--

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:26.872 align:middle line:84%
the initial impact
of that system

00:18:26.872 --> 00:18:29.775 align:middle line:84%
that creates the whole
life of the system

00:18:29.775 --> 00:18:34.046 align:middle line:84%
and in my analogy the conception
point sets some moment in time

00:18:34.046 --> 00:18:37.516 align:middle line:84%
which is your entrance into
that spiraling solar system

00:18:37.516 --> 00:18:41.654 align:middle line:84%
that leads to the set of
evolutionary processes

00:18:41.654 --> 00:18:44.123 align:middle line:84%
that everyone of us
have experienced.

00:18:44.123 --> 00:18:46.659 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: We were talking off
camera a little bit about this

00:18:46.659 --> 00:18:49.662 align:middle line:84%
and I-- I mentioned something
to you and I would love for you

00:18:49.662 --> 00:18:54.400 align:middle line:84%
to share how this process
effects us to the change

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.869 align:middle line:84%
of development in our
parent's own relationship.

00:18:56.869 --> 00:19:00.372 align:middle line:84%
As I mentioned to you, I
was conceived six weeks

00:19:00.372 --> 00:19:03.542 align:middle line:84%
after my parents were
married on Val-- and I--

00:19:03.542 --> 00:19:06.145 align:middle line:84%
I'm guessing on Valentines
Day 'cause I know my mom

00:19:06.145 --> 00:19:07.947 align:middle line:90%
like Valentines Day.

00:19:07.947 --> 00:19:12.585 align:middle line:84%
And my sister her birthday two
years later is only one day

00:19:12.585 --> 00:19:13.819 align:middle line:90%
apart from mine.

00:19:13.819 --> 00:19:17.156 align:middle line:84%
So I'm guessing my mom
wasn't frivolous per se,

00:19:17.156 --> 00:19:20.593 align:middle line:84%
we must have both been
Valentines Day babies

00:19:20.593 --> 00:19:23.829 align:middle line:84%
and if that's the case
can you talk about the day

00:19:23.829 --> 00:19:26.098 align:middle line:84%
in we're very different,
very, very different.

00:19:26.098 --> 00:19:28.834 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about what
happens with each child.

00:19:28.834 --> 00:19:31.503 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: Well, when I was
beginning to practice my system

00:19:31.503 --> 00:19:33.138 align:middle line:84%
in the early 70's
I moved to London

00:19:33.138 --> 00:19:34.540 align:middle line:90%
and I was just single parents

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:37.743 align:middle line:84%
so not only did I
get an opportunity,

00:19:37.743 --> 00:19:40.579 align:middle line:84%
in fact the unique
opportunity to see what it was

00:19:40.579 --> 00:19:43.182 align:middle line:84%
like essentially to be a
mother as well as a father

00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:45.784 align:middle line:84%
but also I began to
realize of course

00:19:45.784 --> 00:19:48.921 align:middle line:84%
about what family systems
meant and what they were about.

00:19:48.921 --> 00:19:53.292 align:middle line:84%
I knew the Psychiatrist Ronnie
Laing and I also knew a lot

00:19:53.292 --> 00:19:56.462 align:middle line:84%
of very, very, interesting
psychotherapist and people

00:19:56.462 --> 00:19:58.731 align:middle line:90%
that run such schools in the UK.

00:19:58.731 --> 00:20:02.268 align:middle line:84%
And what was interesting is that
Family Systems Therapy works

00:20:02.268 --> 00:20:06.372 align:middle line:84%
in such a way that-- that it's
an evolving system and so in--

00:20:06.372 --> 00:20:09.842 align:middle line:84%
in a series of brothers and
sisters that you may have,

00:20:09.842 --> 00:20:12.411 align:middle line:84%
each of-- each of family
member is the result

00:20:12.411 --> 00:20:15.080 align:middle line:84%
of a different stage of
your parent's relationship.

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.716 align:middle line:84%
So if they're madly in love
with the time you're conceived

00:20:17.716 --> 00:20:20.786 align:middle line:84%
and you're the first child maybe
then the southern moon often

00:20:20.786 --> 00:20:23.555 align:middle line:84%
have a very loving
relationship within you.

00:20:23.555 --> 00:20:28.394 align:middle line:84%
If-- If the mother and father
are some years later doing their

00:20:28.394 --> 00:20:31.797 align:middle line:84%
own things and gradually
drifting apart then you get a

00:20:31.797 --> 00:20:35.701 align:middle line:84%
situation were the mother or the
father may want to conceive you

00:20:35.701 --> 00:20:38.003 align:middle line:84%
as a child as a way
bridging the two.

00:20:38.003 --> 00:20:41.340 align:middle line:84%
So you end up living your life
as a bridge between mother

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:44.276 align:middle line:84%
and father who were
essentially separate or later

00:20:44.276 --> 00:20:46.945 align:middle line:84%
on in the relationship, they're
actually at war with each other

00:20:46.945 --> 00:20:49.882 align:middle line:84%
and you have a situation were
the southern moon are squared

00:20:49.882 --> 00:20:53.152 align:middle line:84%
or an opposition, you've got
a situation were, you know,

00:20:53.152 --> 00:20:55.454 align:middle line:90%
that child acts out, the split

00:20:55.454 --> 00:20:57.289 align:middle line:84%
that happens between
the parents.

00:20:57.289 --> 00:21:00.726 align:middle line:84%
So in a way we all carry,
we have the same parents,

00:21:00.726 --> 00:21:01.994 align:middle line:90%
the same mother and father.

00:21:01.994 --> 00:21:03.062 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: It's just
the dynamic of play.

00:21:03.062 --> 00:21:04.997 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: It's just a
dynamic of when we enter

00:21:04.997 --> 00:21:09.668 align:middle line:84%
that system is a profound,
determining factor in terms

00:21:09.668 --> 00:21:12.705 align:middle line:84%
of how you live through
your life and the issues

00:21:12.705 --> 00:21:15.774 align:middle line:84%
that you need to deal
within your own life.

00:21:15.774 --> 00:21:17.776 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Is that the
primary factor

00:21:17.776 --> 00:21:21.380 align:middle line:84%
when you start doing the
typology of that order of birth?

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:23.749 align:middle line:84%
Would that be the primary
factor in for example,

00:21:23.749 --> 00:21:28.220 align:middle line:84%
a lot of times you'll find
that CEOs, presidents of co--

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:32.324 align:middle line:84%
dictators of small nations
alike are often firstborn,

00:21:32.324 --> 00:21:35.160 align:middle line:84%
is there a type of thing,
is there a type of dynamic

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:39.164 align:middle line:84%
that sets the firstborn
into position

00:21:39.164 --> 00:21:43.001 align:middle line:84%
of maybe feeling more
pressure or more empowered or--

00:21:43.001 --> 00:21:44.803 align:middle line:90%
what is it about firstborns?

00:21:44.803 --> 00:21:47.172 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: Well there a lot of very
complex factors because first

00:21:47.172 --> 00:21:49.808 align:middle line:84%
of all your mother presumably
has never had a child before.

00:21:49.808 --> 00:21:51.076 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: So you're the experiment.

00:21:51.076 --> 00:21:54.947 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: So you're a kind of
experiment that has to do

00:21:54.947 --> 00:21:58.050 align:middle line:84%
with her discovering really who
she is and what her role is.

00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:02.454 align:middle line:84%
Second of all, it
does follow the path

00:22:02.454 --> 00:22:05.424 align:middle line:84%
of many psychological
schools which explore the idea

00:22:05.424 --> 00:22:07.693 align:middle line:84%
of the first and subsequent
children that, you know,

00:22:07.693 --> 00:22:09.194 align:middle line:90%
the first child is the only one

00:22:09.194 --> 00:22:12.231 align:middle line:84%
to get the parent's complete
attention and you know,

00:22:12.231 --> 00:22:14.466 align:middle line:84%
and these are all very
significant factors

00:22:14.466 --> 00:22:16.201 align:middle line:90%
which you can see in horoscope.

00:22:16.201 --> 00:22:21.407 align:middle line:84%
And so we had this planets that
are embedded in this time scale

00:22:21.407 --> 00:22:25.177 align:middle line:84%
as I call it and-- and
whenever such planets register,

00:22:25.177 --> 00:22:28.580 align:middle line:84%
if it's in gestation it means
events happening to your mother

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:32.684 align:middle line:84%
that her significant to her
maybe telling her parents

00:22:32.684 --> 00:22:35.521 align:middle line:84%
or maybe moving from one
place to another or whatever

00:22:35.521 --> 00:22:37.189 align:middle line:90%
that are embedded in your body

00:22:37.189 --> 00:22:39.925 align:middle line:84%
which is created during
gestation and through the rest

00:22:39.925 --> 00:22:42.027 align:middle line:90%
of your life planets register

00:22:42.027 --> 00:22:45.397 align:middle line:84%
that signify particular
developmental stages

00:22:45.397 --> 00:22:47.199 align:middle line:90%
like say your parents split up.

00:22:47.199 --> 00:22:50.436 align:middle line:84%
That's a very significant
stage because the male

00:22:50.436 --> 00:22:54.973 align:middle line:84%
and female icons within you
undergo with different process.

00:22:54.973 --> 00:22:56.375 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And you would see
that in reading that chart.

00:22:56.375 --> 00:22:58.010 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: And you definitely
see these kinds

00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:00.813 align:middle line:84%
of influences happening
at significant ages.

00:23:00.813 --> 00:23:03.082 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And like the man who
turns out with the legitimate,

00:23:03.082 --> 00:23:04.383 align:middle line:90%
you could see that clearly.

00:23:04.383 --> 00:23:05.350 align:middle line:90%
>> AM: Correct.

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:06.752 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And the dynamic
in history.

00:23:06.752 --> 00:23:07.886 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: That-- That's your event
that's likely to repeat itself

00:23:07.886 --> 00:23:10.122 align:middle line:84%
and it actually did at
the exact opposite point

00:23:10.122 --> 00:23:13.759 align:middle line:84%
across this horoscope, 24
years later after he was--

00:23:13.759 --> 00:23:15.627 align:middle line:90%
after he was born so-- so--

00:23:15.627 --> 00:23:17.529 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Then he had illegitimate
child you're saying.

00:23:17.529 --> 00:23:18.897 align:middle line:90%
>> AM: Correct.

00:23:18.897 --> 00:23:21.233 align:middle line:84%
So-- so there's-- there's a
kind of resonance that happens

00:23:21.233 --> 00:23:23.402 align:middle line:90%
through your life time.

00:23:23.402 --> 00:23:26.839 align:middle line:84%
The difference is that when it
happens in the very beginning,

00:23:26.839 --> 00:23:30.042 align:middle line:84%
you're developing, you
know, a developing embryo

00:23:30.042 --> 00:23:32.845 align:middle line:84%
within your mother during
childhood, you're as five

00:23:32.845 --> 00:23:36.315 align:middle line:84%
or four, five or six year old
child during your teenage years,

00:23:36.315 --> 00:23:38.217 align:middle line:90%
you're a typical teenager and--

00:23:38.217 --> 00:23:40.752 align:middle line:84%
and later on you're a
parent or a grandparent.

00:23:40.752 --> 00:23:43.622 align:middle line:84%
So-- So the thing is that
patterns remain the same

00:23:43.622 --> 00:23:47.693 align:middle line:84%
but we have to re-invasion them
as we recognized that we go

00:23:47.693 --> 00:23:49.361 align:middle line:84%
through this whole
process of life.

00:23:49.361 --> 00:23:54.233 align:middle line:84%
And I-- I talk to people about
how to navigate the process

00:23:54.233 --> 00:23:57.603 align:middle line:84%
of their life and that
process continues all the way

00:23:57.603 --> 00:23:58.971 align:middle line:90%
through to the end.

00:23:58.971 --> 00:24:01.907 align:middle line:84%
And of course as we were talking
before about reincarnation,

00:24:01.907 --> 00:24:03.775 align:middle line:84%
it goes all the way
back to the beginning.

00:24:03.775 --> 00:24:06.912 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: OK, now before we get
into that, the cyclical nature

00:24:06.912 --> 00:24:10.282 align:middle line:84%
of it and at what point we live,
at what point we come back.

00:24:10.282 --> 00:24:13.051 align:middle line:84%
Are we bringing that same
imprint and so fort back?

00:24:13.051 --> 00:24:15.521 align:middle line:84%
If you wouldn't mind sharing
about your own experience

00:24:15.521 --> 00:24:18.957 align:middle line:84%
in life because it was unique,
it is unique to these times,

00:24:18.957 --> 00:24:21.560 align:middle line:84%
it was not unique in
the time you were born.

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:23.862 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: Right, yes, I was born
during the second world war

00:24:23.862 --> 00:24:26.899 align:middle line:84%
and my father went off
to war very shortly

00:24:26.899 --> 00:24:29.368 align:middle line:84%
after I was conceived
and he was a--

00:24:29.368 --> 00:24:31.637 align:middle line:84%
a bomber pilot in the
air force in Europe

00:24:31.637 --> 00:24:36.074 align:middle line:84%
and he unfortunately
were shutdown and died

00:24:36.074 --> 00:24:38.010 align:middle line:84%
in a German prison
of war hospital.

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:43.148 align:middle line:84%
And of course this all happen,
first of all he left just

00:24:43.148 --> 00:24:46.051 align:middle line:84%
after I was conceived and
the sun registers there

00:24:46.051 --> 00:24:48.720 align:middle line:84%
and the sun is your father
and it's in square merge.

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:49.922 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: It doesn't show
that it was really.

00:24:49.922 --> 00:24:51.857 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: Which indicates
a soldier--

00:24:51.857 --> 00:24:52.891 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: And merrily.

00:24:52.891 --> 00:24:53.959 align:middle line:90%
>> AM: [Inaudible] Southern

00:24:53.959 --> 00:24:55.794 align:middle line:84%
to the sun shows a
separation from father.

00:24:55.794 --> 00:24:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And then my mother, of
course, went through a period

00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:02.234 align:middle line:84%
of months were she was
very unsure where he was,

00:25:02.234 --> 00:25:03.502 align:middle line:90%
what was going on because

00:25:03.502 --> 00:25:06.071 align:middle line:84%
of the communication
issues in those days.

00:25:06.071 --> 00:25:08.440 align:middle line:84%
And so, when I began
doing astrology,

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:11.610 align:middle line:84%
I realized after having
come up with this idea

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:14.146 align:middle line:84%
of the gestation period
being significant.

00:25:14.146 --> 00:25:18.183 align:middle line:84%
I realized I had to discover
it because it was the only way

00:25:18.183 --> 00:25:21.587 align:middle line:84%
to decode probably the most
significant event in my life.

00:25:21.587 --> 00:25:27.159 align:middle line:84%
So, in away I'm experiencing
that search for father.

00:25:27.159 --> 00:25:30.295 align:middle line:84%
Maybe in me, maybe that
is me at this point.

00:25:30.295 --> 00:25:32.197 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of synonymous
with who I am

00:25:32.197 --> 00:25:34.633 align:middle line:90%
but that search for origins.

00:25:34.633 --> 00:25:37.436 align:middle line:84%
And so that kind of
journey has really led me

00:25:37.436 --> 00:25:41.907 align:middle line:84%
through a very complex series of
development which I have to say,

00:25:41.907 --> 00:25:43.108 align:middle line:90%
it's not always been easy

00:25:43.108 --> 00:25:47.079 align:middle line:84%
because I've often tracked
these discoveries down

00:25:47.079 --> 00:25:49.081 align:middle line:84%
and researched them
and so on, on my ow,

00:25:49.081 --> 00:25:52.818 align:middle line:84%
but over the years
having done six or seven

00:25:52.818 --> 00:25:55.087 align:middle line:84%
or eight thousand
readings for people.

00:25:55.087 --> 00:25:59.324 align:middle line:84%
I now very positive as
most of my clients are

00:25:59.324 --> 00:26:03.161 align:middle line:84%
that there's a wisdom to it and
there's a very profound message

00:26:03.161 --> 00:26:06.832 align:middle line:84%
about it that, you know,
actually is really begging

00:26:06.832 --> 00:26:09.935 align:middle line:84%
to be expressed to
the wide public.

00:26:09.935 --> 00:26:13.171 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Would you say that
the lost of your father

00:26:13.171 --> 00:26:18.343 align:middle line:84%
in that subconscious seeking
that fatherly influenced

00:26:18.343 --> 00:26:21.580 align:middle line:84%
through out your
life was a big part

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:24.016 align:middle line:84%
of you putting these
pieces together?

00:26:24.016 --> 00:26:25.917 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: I think so I
needed to understand.

00:26:25.917 --> 00:26:27.319 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:26:27.319 --> 00:26:30.222 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: And I love architecture
and I still, still do, however,

00:26:30.222 --> 00:26:32.624 align:middle line:84%
architecture didn't look
like it was likely to lead me

00:26:32.624 --> 00:26:34.026 align:middle line:90%
to that particular goal.

00:26:34.026 --> 00:26:35.160 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:36.561 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: And so it led me
into doing other things.

00:26:36.561 --> 00:26:39.731 align:middle line:84%
I mean I wrote eventually a book
about sacred architecture and--

00:26:39.731 --> 00:26:40.932 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Beautiful book.

00:26:40.932 --> 00:26:42.234 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: A book about sacred
landscapes and so on.

00:26:42.234 --> 00:26:45.771 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, I think we do
have a particular function

00:26:45.771 --> 00:26:49.341 align:middle line:84%
in life in that we need
to respect the path

00:26:49.341 --> 00:26:51.243 align:middle line:90%
that we discover within.

00:26:51.243 --> 00:26:55.247 align:middle line:84%
And I've-- as friends of mine
would well be able to tell you

00:26:55.247 --> 00:26:58.183 align:middle line:84%
that I've certainly stayed with
this path through thick and thin

00:26:58.183 --> 00:27:02.120 align:middle line:84%
and it's not a very-- it's very
difficult in many ways because--

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:03.789 align:middle line:90%
these ideas are not accepted

00:27:03.789 --> 00:27:06.958 align:middle line:84%
by the academic establishment
for example.

00:27:06.958 --> 00:27:10.328 align:middle line:84%
However, these things
are changing dramatically

00:27:10.328 --> 00:27:10.829 align:middle line:90%
and I think--

00:27:10.829 --> 00:27:12.030 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:13.231 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: -- a lot of these
new discoveries so people

00:27:13.231 --> 00:27:16.301 align:middle line:84%
like Nassim Haramein or
the physicist Garrett Lisi

00:27:16.301 --> 00:27:18.170 align:middle line:84%
and a whole group of
other people are beginning

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:19.871 align:middle line:90%
to shed light on the fact

00:27:19.871 --> 00:27:23.742 align:middle line:84%
that these principles are
very relevant to our discovery

00:27:23.742 --> 00:27:25.711 align:middle line:90%
about where we all come from?

00:27:25.711 --> 00:27:27.079 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah, absolutely.

00:27:27.079 --> 00:27:30.382 align:middle line:84%
Let's take that little
further now and let's go

00:27:30.382 --> 00:27:31.650 align:middle line:90%
into a reincarnations cycle.

00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:33.952 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about your
father for example,

00:27:33.952 --> 00:27:38.156 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's often been
thought sterically

00:27:38.156 --> 00:27:40.892 align:middle line:84%
that a person leaves
their body if its

00:27:40.892 --> 00:27:44.996 align:middle line:84%
through a natural progression
of aging, natural progression

00:27:44.996 --> 00:27:48.533 align:middle line:84%
of having the full cycle
of life to complete

00:27:48.533 --> 00:27:50.335 align:middle line:90%
that there maybe a break,

00:27:50.335 --> 00:27:53.038 align:middle line:84%
a little break before
coming back again.

00:27:53.038 --> 00:27:54.139 align:middle line:90%
Whereas oftentimes

00:27:54.139 --> 00:27:56.041 align:middle line:84%
when someone's life
has been more cut short

00:27:56.041 --> 00:27:58.410 align:middle line:84%
through a violent act
or a quick act like that

00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:00.345 align:middle line:84%
that they tend to--
kind of comeback

00:28:00.345 --> 00:28:02.414 align:middle line:84%
into this cycle a
little more quickly.

00:28:02.414 --> 00:28:07.319 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if your astrology
reflects any of this or not.

00:28:07.319 --> 00:28:10.856 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: Well, I mean obviously
it's a very dodgy issue simply

00:28:10.856 --> 00:28:14.226 align:middle line:84%
because it has to do
with theories that--

00:28:14.226 --> 00:28:16.628 align:middle line:84%
by definition don't
have a proof.

00:28:16.628 --> 00:28:20.899 align:middle line:84%
However, I also I realize
what set me on the track

00:28:20.899 --> 00:28:24.636 align:middle line:84%
that I headed on is
the fact that I began--

00:28:24.636 --> 00:28:27.239 align:middle line:84%
if the conception point is--
in a certain point, the ninth,

00:28:27.239 --> 00:28:30.709 align:middle line:84%
husband, in the horoscope, I
began noticing certain horoscope

00:28:30.709 --> 00:28:33.278 align:middle line:90%
where for example, it look

00:28:33.278 --> 00:28:36.114 align:middle line:84%
like a traumatic event
happen just before a person

00:28:36.114 --> 00:28:37.215 align:middle line:90%
was conceived.

00:28:37.215 --> 00:28:39.484 align:middle line:84%
Now, that shouldn't
really show up because--

00:28:39.484 --> 00:28:40.719 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:28:40.719 --> 00:28:41.953 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: -- if you start
existing at the conception,

00:28:41.953 --> 00:28:43.155 align:middle line:90%
how are you going to see it.

00:28:43.155 --> 00:28:45.924 align:middle line:84%
But I notice things like
Pluto represents tragedies

00:28:45.924 --> 00:28:47.192 align:middle line:90%
and whatever.

00:28:47.192 --> 00:28:49.961 align:middle line:84%
And a number of cases I
mentioned it to people who said,

00:28:49.961 --> 00:28:54.766 align:middle line:84%
"My mother had a miscarriage
just before I was born,

00:28:54.766 --> 00:28:56.601 align:middle line:90%
I mean before I was conceived"

00:28:56.601 --> 00:29:00.639 align:middle line:84%
and they actually named the
child because it was so immanent

00:29:00.639 --> 00:29:02.174 align:middle line:90%
when she have the miscarriage

00:29:02.174 --> 00:29:04.776 align:middle line:84%
and become pregnant
again they named me

00:29:04.776 --> 00:29:06.444 align:middle line:90%
after the child that they lost.

00:29:06.444 --> 00:29:08.747 align:middle line:90%
So, I began thinking well--

00:29:08.747 --> 00:29:10.081 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: It could be
the same entity?

00:29:10.081 --> 00:29:12.717 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: Maybe there's a path
going back before conception

00:29:12.717 --> 00:29:15.020 align:middle line:90%
that we also carry and.

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:18.924 align:middle line:84%
Freud's idea which is quite
brilliant about, well,

00:29:18.924 --> 00:29:22.694 align:middle line:84%
its ontogeny recapitulates
phylogeny which is that the life

00:29:22.694 --> 00:29:24.663 align:middle line:90%
of each individual recapitulates

00:29:24.663 --> 00:29:27.432 align:middle line:84%
or reacts the whole
life of the species.

00:29:27.432 --> 00:29:30.268 align:middle line:84%
So, when we're children,
we'd go through stages

00:29:30.268 --> 00:29:35.240 align:middle line:84%
of life becoming aware, learning
how to speak, learning language,

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:38.476 align:middle line:84%
learning about the structure of
the family then in seven, eight,

00:29:38.476 --> 00:29:42.547 align:middle line:84%
nine we begin individuating,
we form relationship.

00:29:42.547 --> 00:29:44.916 align:middle line:84%
This is a pattern that
all humanities follow.

00:29:44.916 --> 00:29:49.054 align:middle line:84%
And I basically took the same
geometry of the astrology

00:29:49.054 --> 00:29:52.591 align:middle line:84%
which is logarithmic progression
and flipped it in time

00:29:52.591 --> 00:29:55.794 align:middle line:84%
because in our life the
early stages are short

00:29:55.794 --> 00:29:57.729 align:middle line:84%
and they get longer
and longer as your age

00:29:57.729 --> 00:30:01.333 align:middle line:84%
but in history the early
stages are vastly long,

00:30:01.333 --> 00:30:03.935 align:middle line:84%
tens of thousands of years
and as we come closer

00:30:03.935 --> 00:30:05.237 align:middle line:84%
to the present time
it accelerates.

00:30:05.237 --> 00:30:10.876 align:middle line:84%
So, I basically tested a few
models and ended up just,

00:30:10.876 --> 00:30:15.213 align:middle line:84%
you know, using a 50,000 year of
cycle of two equinoctial cycles

00:30:15.213 --> 00:30:19.217 align:middle line:84%
and figured the mathematics out
and began checking the planets

00:30:19.217 --> 00:30:23.889 align:middle line:84%
and certain people's horoscopes
like Mercury is how you think.

00:30:23.889 --> 00:30:27.092 align:middle line:84%
And it should correspond to
the time in history when--

00:30:27.092 --> 00:30:29.728 align:middle line:84%
everyone thought the
way you think now.

00:30:29.728 --> 00:30:33.098 align:middle line:84%
Or Venus, can be your static
life or Mars is the warrior

00:30:33.098 --> 00:30:36.468 align:middle line:84%
in you or Jupiter is
your religious beliefs.

00:30:36.468 --> 00:30:37.869 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: OK.

00:30:37.869 --> 00:30:40.705 align:middle line:84%
We were also talk-- on that note
we were also talking off camera

00:30:40.705 --> 00:30:44.676 align:middle line:84%
about an individual who had
a particular area of study

00:30:44.676 --> 00:30:47.512 align:middle line:84%
in history and what
you started seeing

00:30:47.512 --> 00:30:49.247 align:middle line:84%
when they started
asking certain question.

00:30:49.247 --> 00:30:52.250 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about that because
again they were really coming

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:56.354 align:middle line:84%
very close what I think
was pegging themselves.

00:30:56.354 --> 00:30:58.890 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: Well, in a very
interesting way I discovered

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:04.329 align:middle line:84%
this in a very roundabout method
because, you know I was born

00:31:04.329 --> 00:31:05.931 align:middle line:84%
and raised in upstate
New York and went

00:31:05.931 --> 00:31:09.134 align:middle line:84%
to Cornell Architecture
School, worked in New York

00:31:09.134 --> 00:31:14.339 align:middle line:84%
as an architect but in '68, '69
I worked in Rome as an architect

00:31:14.339 --> 00:31:15.840 align:middle line:84%
for the Architects'
Collaborative,

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:18.710 align:middle line:84%
and while I was there I
went to a particular place,

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:21.346 align:middle line:84%
it was called Campo de'
Fiori, the flower market.

00:31:21.346 --> 00:31:25.984 align:middle line:84%
And whenever I went there I felt
the sense of terrorist somehow

00:31:25.984 --> 00:31:28.486 align:middle line:84%
and I thought it
was like paranoia

00:31:28.486 --> 00:31:31.990 align:middle line:84%
and I wasn't quite sure exactly
what it was about and I was,

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:35.226 align:middle line:84%
you know, smoking various things
as people did in those days.

00:31:35.226 --> 00:31:37.329 align:middle line:90%
And I thought maybe that was it

00:31:37.329 --> 00:31:39.764 align:middle line:84%
but I had this very
strong feeling.

00:31:39.764 --> 00:31:43.234 align:middle line:84%
I looked around the piazza and I
didn't see anything significant.

00:31:43.234 --> 00:31:46.137 align:middle line:84%
Well, when I developed the time
scale I took my own ascendant

00:31:46.137 --> 00:31:48.707 align:middle line:84%
which is six degrees
of Sagittarius.

00:31:48.707 --> 00:31:51.242 align:middle line:84%
And Sagittarius is
about long journeys,

00:31:51.242 --> 00:31:54.546 align:middle line:90%
it's about renaissance, ideas,

00:31:54.546 --> 00:31:58.116 align:middle line:84%
and in fact in my system
it's the time from 1500

00:31:58.116 --> 00:31:59.951 align:middle line:90%
to 1700 approximately.

00:31:59.951 --> 00:32:03.688 align:middle line:84%
So my ascendant registered
in 1588 and I realized

00:32:03.688 --> 00:32:07.726 align:middle line:84%
that spontaneously in 70s
when I moved to London,

00:32:07.726 --> 00:32:12.564 align:middle line:84%
I was drown to thinkers, to
philosophers, to magicians

00:32:12.564 --> 00:32:17.268 align:middle line:84%
like Robert Fludd or
Giordano Bruno or John Dee

00:32:17.268 --> 00:32:19.938 align:middle line:90%
who were around at that time.

00:32:19.938 --> 00:32:23.141 align:middle line:84%
I also realized when I went
to architectures school

00:32:23.141 --> 00:32:26.945 align:middle line:84%
that when I first went to Europe
in the 60s and went to places

00:32:26.945 --> 00:32:29.881 align:middle line:84%
like Florence and Rome,
I knew the buildings.

00:32:29.881 --> 00:32:31.850 align:middle line:84%
I knew how to navigate
around the city--

00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:32.684 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:32:32.684 --> 00:32:34.052 align:middle line:90%
>> AM: -- without needing a map.

00:32:34.052 --> 00:32:37.489 align:middle line:84%
And I realized when I first read
the books of Giordano Bruno,

00:32:37.489 --> 00:32:42.427 align:middle line:84%
who is-- who had cosmos--
cosmological idea like the one

00:32:42.427 --> 00:32:44.529 align:middle line:90%
that I'm describing today.

00:32:44.529 --> 00:32:46.664 align:middle line:84%
You know, he talked about
our son being a star

00:32:46.664 --> 00:32:48.433 align:middle line:90%
like every other star.

00:32:48.433 --> 00:32:51.669 align:middle line:84%
And as result he was burned
at the stake at the stake

00:32:51.669 --> 00:32:57.075 align:middle line:84%
by the inquisition in Campo
de Fiori inn 1588 which was

00:32:57.075 --> 00:32:58.877 align:middle line:90%
in few-- within a few years

00:32:58.877 --> 00:33:01.346 align:middle line:84%
of how I dated my
ascendant astrologically.

00:33:01.346 --> 00:33:05.717 align:middle line:84%
So I suddenly realized that
for people who are engaged

00:33:05.717 --> 00:33:09.721 align:middle line:84%
in history whether you're
an author or a historian

00:33:09.721 --> 00:33:15.627 align:middle line:84%
or a person who collects art or
someone like Picasso has a lot

00:33:15.627 --> 00:33:19.497 align:middle line:84%
of tourist planet which
relate back to the time

00:33:19.497 --> 00:33:22.634 align:middle line:84%
of the earth mother calls
and the cave paintings.

00:33:22.634 --> 00:33:26.171 align:middle line:84%
Think about cubism and
the relationship of cubism

00:33:26.171 --> 00:33:29.240 align:middle line:84%
to the fragmented
art of Picasso.

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.341 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:33:30.341 --> 00:33:33.011 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: And the cave art
of 25,000 years ago.

00:33:33.011 --> 00:33:35.747 align:middle line:84%
A common quality in
the astrology of many

00:33:35.747 --> 00:33:39.617 align:middle line:84%
of cubist painters is that they
have planet in the sun Taurus.

00:33:39.617 --> 00:33:40.985 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Interesting.

00:33:40.985 --> 00:33:46.124 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: So, these historical
influences are carried within us

00:33:46.124 --> 00:33:48.660 align:middle line:84%
but of course when we see
something in our lives

00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:51.429 align:middle line:90%
that evokes them, we step on it.

00:33:51.429 --> 00:33:54.899 align:middle line:84%
We move there, we travel
there, we think of Egypt

00:33:54.899 --> 00:33:57.702 align:middle line:84%
which is a Leo time
in history, you know,

00:33:57.702 --> 00:33:59.204 align:middle line:84%
people who had planets
in the sign.

00:33:59.204 --> 00:34:03.475 align:middle line:84%
Leo are very associated with
Egypt when the sun god was king,

00:34:03.475 --> 00:34:06.544 align:middle line:84%
not accidentally or the
Cancerian time before

00:34:06.544 --> 00:34:09.146 align:middle line:84%
that which is about, you
know, the moon rules cancer.

00:34:09.146 --> 00:34:14.018 align:middle line:84%
That's the time when the nuclear
family originated in history.

00:34:14.018 --> 00:34:16.087 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So, in your
chart as you explained,

00:34:16.087 --> 00:34:18.590 align:middle line:84%
now if you were looking
at another person's chart.

00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:21.726 align:middle line:84%
And for example I have those
experiences you're talking about

00:34:21.726 --> 00:34:25.630 align:middle line:84%
and in a couple cities in
Europe and one of them, is--

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:30.300 align:middle line:84%
was outside of Paris in
France and I mean chill--

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:32.570 align:middle line:84%
in my 20s chills
running through me.

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:35.807 align:middle line:84%
It was like my feet had walked
this cobblestones before

00:34:35.807 --> 00:34:38.009 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't know
about any of this.

00:34:38.009 --> 00:34:41.713 align:middle line:84%
Could you look in a chart
for example and say were

00:34:41.713 --> 00:34:47.385 align:middle line:84%
that influence may have been in
time potentially for that soul

00:34:47.385 --> 00:34:49.119 align:middle line:90%
that they're revisiting from.

00:34:49.119 --> 00:34:51.723 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: You can tell, you
can tell when it happened

00:34:51.723 --> 00:34:55.527 align:middle line:84%
and also you can tell because
of the planet involved what kind

00:34:55.527 --> 00:34:57.896 align:middle line:84%
of incarnation it would
have been like if it's Mars,

00:34:57.896 --> 00:34:59.531 align:middle line:84%
it would have been-- you
had been a warrior or--

00:34:59.531 --> 00:35:00.965 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:35:00.965 --> 00:35:03.067 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: -- Saturn is
someone who's more kind

00:35:03.067 --> 00:35:05.870 align:middle line:84%
of scientifically
inclined or more analytical

00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:08.506 align:middle line:84%
or more business oriented
and things like this,

00:35:08.506 --> 00:35:11.643 align:middle line:84%
the moon is about your feelings
emotionally, and so, you know,

00:35:11.643 --> 00:35:14.212 align:middle line:84%
someone with like I have Aries
moon which is kind of funny.

00:35:14.212 --> 00:35:15.313 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: You all fire something.

00:35:15.313 --> 00:35:16.648 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: because it's so
far back in history.

00:35:16.648 --> 00:35:18.049 align:middle line:90%
It's like I'm a cave woman.

00:35:18.049 --> 00:35:22.120 align:middle line:84%
The woman in me is a cave
woman and so the idea is

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:28.193 align:middle line:84%
that we carry these historical
periods of time in our minds

00:35:28.193 --> 00:35:31.629 align:middle line:84%
and in our psyches and
it's often only when we go

00:35:31.629 --> 00:35:33.331 align:middle line:90%
to such a place or read about it

00:35:33.331 --> 00:35:36.367 align:middle line:84%
that we suddenly realized,
this is where it was.

00:35:36.367 --> 00:35:37.735 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:35:37.735 --> 00:35:39.137 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: You know, because by
knowing the time doesn't mean

00:35:39.137 --> 00:35:42.407 align:middle line:84%
where on the earth that actually
happened but once you associate

00:35:42.407 --> 00:35:43.942 align:middle line:90%
with a certain place in time--

00:35:43.942 --> 00:35:45.210 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Then your
emotions can kick

00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:47.378 align:middle line:84%
in if you've had the
experience to have been there?

00:35:47.378 --> 00:35:48.213 align:middle line:90%
>> AM: Correct.

00:35:48.213 --> 00:35:50.515 align:middle line:90%
So a novelist like Thomas Mann,

00:35:50.515 --> 00:35:53.985 align:middle line:84%
the great German noble prize
winning novelist wrote a series

00:35:53.985 --> 00:35:56.921 align:middle line:84%
of historical novels
throughout his lifetime.

00:35:56.921 --> 00:35:59.757 align:middle line:84%
And when you check his
horoscope, they all happened

00:35:59.757 --> 00:36:02.427 align:middle line:84%
at times when planets in
his horoscope registered.

00:36:02.427 --> 00:36:05.697 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote a book called
Joseph and His Brothers that is

00:36:05.697 --> 00:36:06.965 align:middle line:90%
in the Leo time in history

00:36:06.965 --> 00:36:09.033 align:middle line:84%
because it's early
Jewish history.

00:36:09.033 --> 00:36:10.268 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:36:10.268 --> 00:36:11.970 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: And what's interesting
is that in the book,

00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:15.773 align:middle line:84%
Thomas Mann gives Joseph's
horoscope in Persian.

00:36:15.773 --> 00:36:18.877 align:middle line:84%
The sun is Shamash and
the moon is Ishtar.

00:36:18.877 --> 00:36:21.512 align:middle line:84%
And so I had a friend
tracked it down for me

00:36:21.512 --> 00:36:25.149 align:middle line:84%
and I created Joseph's horoscope
in the book and I, you know,

00:36:25.149 --> 00:36:26.651 align:middle line:90%
it's a rough sketch

00:36:26.651 --> 00:36:29.587 align:middle line:84%
but I included it while I
read these three volume novel

00:36:29.587 --> 00:36:32.123 align:middle line:84%
that Thomas Mann wrote and
I found out years later

00:36:32.123 --> 00:36:34.459 align:middle line:84%
that it was Thomas
Mann's horoscope.

00:36:34.459 --> 00:36:35.426 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:36:35.426 --> 00:36:36.628 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: So he had
used his horoscopes

00:36:36.628 --> 00:36:38.596 align:middle line:90%
for Joseph's in the book.

00:36:38.596 --> 00:36:39.864 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:36:39.864 --> 00:36:41.633 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: And that-- I also
began to realize with a shock

00:36:41.633 --> 00:36:46.537 align:middle line:84%
that actually Thomas Mann's life
echoed and mirrored Joseph's.

00:36:46.537 --> 00:36:47.605 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Amazing.

00:36:47.605 --> 00:36:49.040 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: The coat of
many colors associated

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:54.245 align:middle line:84%
with a noble prize advising a
pharaoh, Thomas Mann advised FTR

00:36:54.245 --> 00:36:56.414 align:middle line:90%
about the Second World War.

00:36:56.414 --> 00:36:58.416 align:middle line:84%
And so there were
so many parallels

00:36:58.416 --> 00:37:01.953 align:middle line:84%
that I began realizing that,
you know, looking at novelist

00:37:01.953 --> 00:37:04.856 align:middle line:84%
like Robert Graves and
I, Claudius, you know,

00:37:04.856 --> 00:37:07.058 align:middle line:84%
that he has like
Mercury, Jupiter.

00:37:07.058 --> 00:37:08.526 align:middle line:90%
Mercury is how do you think,

00:37:08.526 --> 00:37:11.763 align:middle line:84%
Jupiter is your religious
beliefs register on the time

00:37:11.763 --> 00:37:14.565 align:middle line:84%
of Claudius the Roman
Emperor into the Virgo time.

00:37:14.565 --> 00:37:16.267 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yes and, you know,
this has been tracked.

00:37:16.267 --> 00:37:18.336 align:middle line:84%
These experiences
have been tracked.

00:37:18.336 --> 00:37:20.605 align:middle line:84%
The work of Carol Bowman,
Children's Past Lives

00:37:20.605 --> 00:37:23.942 align:middle line:84%
for example where they'll go
to a home and say, go there.

00:37:23.942 --> 00:37:24.976 align:middle line:90%
Look under the stairs.

00:37:24.976 --> 00:37:26.311 align:middle line:90%
My little truck is--

00:37:26.311 --> 00:37:28.680 align:middle line:84%
that's where I put my
little truck or, whatever.

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:33.818 align:middle line:84%
So were seeing that kind of
on a ground examples of it,

00:37:33.818 --> 00:37:36.587 align:middle line:84%
but you're saying you
can see that within

00:37:36.587 --> 00:37:37.889 align:middle line:90%
that person's chart as well.

00:37:37.889 --> 00:37:40.391 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder did you
ever have the advantage

00:37:40.391 --> 00:37:42.727 align:middle line:84%
of knowing your father's
birth information.

00:37:42.727 --> 00:37:45.363 align:middle line:84%
For example, my idea, I've
incarnated a long time ago.

00:37:45.363 --> 00:37:47.031 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: Well, I do
but the issue--

00:37:47.031 --> 00:37:51.402 align:middle line:84%
the funny thing about it
is that I am very lucky

00:37:51.402 --> 00:37:52.603 align:middle line:90%
and that I know a lot of people

00:37:52.603 --> 00:37:54.973 align:middle line:84%
that have a quite an
elevated sense of history.

00:37:54.973 --> 00:37:56.174 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:37:56.174 --> 00:37:57.508 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: But nowadays, there
aren't a lot of people

00:37:57.508 --> 00:38:00.044 align:middle line:84%
that know much about
history per se

00:38:00.044 --> 00:38:03.214 align:middle line:84%
and that severely limits the
kind of residents they're going

00:38:03.214 --> 00:38:04.549 align:middle line:90%
to be experiencing with--

00:38:04.549 --> 00:38:05.483 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:38:05.483 --> 00:38:06.617 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: -- with particular
places.

00:38:06.617 --> 00:38:07.952 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:38:07.952 --> 00:38:10.421 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: I mean, certainly,
you know, I know Egyptologist

00:38:10.421 --> 00:38:13.291 align:middle line:84%
who have lots of Leo planets and
therefore they're very likely

00:38:13.291 --> 00:38:17.028 align:middle line:84%
to be connected to Chaldea
or Egypt in mythologies

00:38:17.028 --> 00:38:18.763 align:middle line:90%
that are associated with that.

00:38:18.763 --> 00:38:21.265 align:middle line:84%
You know, and similarly
before Leo time which is

00:38:21.265 --> 00:38:23.401 align:middle line:90%
around 300 B.C. which is one

00:38:23.401 --> 00:38:26.671 align:middle line:84%
of the first historical
individuals started showing up.

00:38:26.671 --> 00:38:28.539 align:middle line:84%
Before that it's
all mythological

00:38:28.539 --> 00:38:31.109 align:middle line:84%
and there's been a whole
movement in astrology

00:38:31.109 --> 00:38:32.710 align:middle line:90%
in recent years

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:36.881 align:middle line:84%
of mythological-psychological
astrology and most of the people

00:38:36.881 --> 00:38:40.952 align:middle line:84%
who practice it tend to have
planets in the first four signs,

00:38:40.952 --> 00:38:43.654 align:middle line:84%
Aries, Taurus, Gemini
and Cancer.

00:38:43.654 --> 00:38:44.756 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Interesting.

00:38:44.756 --> 00:38:47.325 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: You know, so
that they really looked

00:38:47.325 --> 00:38:49.961 align:middle line:84%
to the earlier history
which is very mythic--

00:38:49.961 --> 00:38:51.295 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:38:51.295 --> 00:38:53.031 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: -- rather than later
history which is more linear

00:38:53.031 --> 00:38:56.834 align:middle line:84%
and more connected into
our prevailing view

00:38:56.834 --> 00:38:59.637 align:middle line:90%
of development and so on.

00:38:59.637 --> 00:39:02.140 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's a
very interesting kind

00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:03.141 align:middle line:90%
of principle to look at.

00:39:03.141 --> 00:39:04.509 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: I do too.

00:39:04.509 --> 00:39:08.112 align:middle line:84%
And as you're talking about
this, I'm thinking in my gen--

00:39:08.112 --> 00:39:12.283 align:middle line:84%
I'm part of the Leo generation,
so much emphasis in research

00:39:12.283 --> 00:39:13.951 align:middle line:90%
and study in the area of Egypt.

00:39:13.951 --> 00:39:15.787 align:middle line:90%
So many people coming forth

00:39:15.787 --> 00:39:18.890 align:middle line:84%
with the incarnations they
feel were from Egyptian times.

00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:19.757 align:middle line:90%
So that would be--

00:39:19.757 --> 00:39:20.892 align:middle line:90%
>> AM: That would be--

00:39:20.892 --> 00:39:22.727 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: -- indicative of
the cycle of coming back

00:39:22.727 --> 00:39:23.995 align:middle line:90%
from these previous times.

00:39:23.995 --> 00:39:25.329 align:middle line:90%
>> AM: Correct.

00:39:25.329 --> 00:39:28.166 align:middle line:84%
In the same way that when
AIDS became common knowledge,

00:39:28.166 --> 00:39:31.836 align:middle line:84%
Pluto 'cause we're the
Pluto and Leo generation.

00:39:31.836 --> 00:39:35.540 align:middle line:84%
Pluto was in the sign
Scorpio which is the time

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:37.408 align:middle line:90%
when the plaques happened.

00:39:37.408 --> 00:39:38.476 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:39:38.476 --> 00:39:40.711 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: The Black Death
was ripe in Europe

00:39:40.711 --> 00:39:42.413 align:middle line:90%
and it decimated the population.

00:39:42.413 --> 00:39:47.718 align:middle line:84%
So anyone in that Pluto and
Scorpio generation are likely

00:39:47.718 --> 00:39:50.021 align:middle line:84%
to experience the
impact of AIDS,

00:39:50.021 --> 00:39:53.925 align:middle line:84%
the impact of transmitted
diseases

00:39:53.925 --> 00:39:55.827 align:middle line:84%
that last long periods
of times and so on.

00:39:55.827 --> 00:39:57.161 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Very interesting.

00:39:57.161 --> 00:39:59.397 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: So you know, you can
actually a historical study

00:39:59.397 --> 00:40:02.500 align:middle line:84%
of these things and what
you discover actually is

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:04.902 align:middle line:84%
that it really does
tie in very closely

00:40:04.902 --> 00:40:07.138 align:middle line:84%
to the whole sequence
of things happening.

00:40:07.138 --> 00:40:09.307 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So let's talk about
an individual leaving one

00:40:09.307 --> 00:40:11.142 align:middle line:84%
incarnation with--
at a certain--

00:40:11.142 --> 00:40:13.177 align:middle line:84%
you're conceived
at a certain time.

00:40:13.177 --> 00:40:15.813 align:middle line:84%
You leave the planet
at a certain time.

00:40:15.813 --> 00:40:18.749 align:middle line:90%
And how those cycles imprint?

00:40:18.749 --> 00:40:21.519 align:middle line:84%
Do you essentially
where you left off?

00:40:21.519 --> 00:40:24.689 align:middle line:84%
Are you setting yourself up
for the next incarnation?

00:40:24.689 --> 00:40:27.859 align:middle line:84%
And does that start reflecting
itself when you come back in?

00:40:27.859 --> 00:40:31.162 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: Yeah, again all I can
do is hypothesize about that--

00:40:31.162 --> 00:40:32.497 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I understand and
that's what we're doing.

00:40:32.497 --> 00:40:33.264 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: -- because I don't--
'cause I don't really know.

00:40:33.264 --> 00:40:34.665 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:40:34.665 --> 00:40:37.368 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: But all I can say is that
having had certain experiences

00:40:37.368 --> 00:40:43.374 align:middle line:84%
where I felt like I was
traveling in time, I have to say

00:40:43.374 --> 00:40:46.177 align:middle line:84%
that the model and I've
written a number of books

00:40:46.177 --> 00:40:49.380 align:middle line:84%
about reincarnation, one of
them is called the Divine Plot

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:51.749 align:middle line:84%
but also one called
Elements of Reincarnation

00:40:51.749 --> 00:40:55.186 align:middle line:84%
and in the Elements book I
really looked at a number

00:40:55.186 --> 00:40:57.455 align:middle line:84%
of different cultures
views of reincarnation.

00:40:57.455 --> 00:41:00.725 align:middle line:84%
And the Tibetan Buddhist
model to me is the one

00:41:00.725 --> 00:41:05.096 align:middle line:84%
that seems most useful as it
were, you know, or most viable

00:41:05.096 --> 00:41:08.499 align:middle line:84%
in the sense that Tibetan
Buddhist lamas are very often

00:41:08.499 --> 00:41:10.034 align:middle line:90%
are able to die at will,

00:41:10.034 --> 00:41:13.871 align:middle line:84%
are able to choose their next
incarnations and the point is

00:41:13.871 --> 00:41:17.875 align:middle line:84%
that once we experience
the death process

00:41:17.875 --> 00:41:20.144 align:middle line:84%
which in my astrology
is coincident

00:41:20.144 --> 00:41:23.514 align:middle line:84%
with your conception
point that what happens is

00:41:23.514 --> 00:41:29.020 align:middle line:84%
that the physical body steps
away and dies and deteriorates.

00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:32.690 align:middle line:84%
The soul or the spirit
survives and but

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:34.625 align:middle line:84%
yet it enters a different
dimension.

00:41:34.625 --> 00:41:37.628 align:middle line:84%
It leaves that three-dimensional
time and space

00:41:37.628 --> 00:41:41.599 align:middle line:84%
of our body living in that
spiraling solar system

00:41:41.599 --> 00:41:43.000 align:middle line:90%
and we enter eternity.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And in eternity,
there's no linearity.

00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:48.739 align:middle line:84%
There's no way of knowing
whether you're entering directly

00:41:48.739 --> 00:41:52.009 align:middle line:84%
back in again or whether
a 1000 years evolved.

00:41:52.009 --> 00:41:55.146 align:middle line:84%
Rudolf Steiner had very
complex theories about this

00:41:55.146 --> 00:41:57.448 align:middle line:90%
but the interesting thing is

00:41:57.448 --> 00:42:00.918 align:middle line:84%
that what the Tibetans
believe is that after you--

00:42:00.918 --> 00:42:05.690 align:middle line:84%
after that soul or spirit
enters eternity as it were

00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:10.061 align:middle line:84%
that when it reincarnates again,
you're drawn to a womb meaning,

00:42:10.061 --> 00:42:14.065 align:middle line:84%
you're-- a mother and father
make love somewhere and because

00:42:14.065 --> 00:42:16.934 align:middle line:84%
of your karma and your
unfulfilled potential--

00:42:16.934 --> 00:42:17.902 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:42:17.902 --> 00:42:19.503 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: You're drawn
to the causes

00:42:19.503 --> 00:42:23.708 align:middle line:84%
that initiate a conception
and that at very early stage

00:42:23.708 --> 00:42:26.711 align:middle line:84%
of that gestation process,
your spirit is drawn

00:42:26.711 --> 00:42:30.381 align:middle line:84%
into that developing
embryo in the womb.

00:42:30.381 --> 00:42:34.552 align:middle line:84%
And once that happens, we're
confined and constraint,

00:42:34.552 --> 00:42:37.388 align:middle line:84%
of course by the laws of
the spiraling solar system

00:42:37.388 --> 00:42:40.224 align:middle line:84%
which is we have a body,
we have to maintain it,

00:42:40.224 --> 00:42:42.893 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be in that
body until we die and so on.

00:42:42.893 --> 00:42:45.463 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that
process happens again

00:42:45.463 --> 00:42:47.665 align:middle line:90%
and again and again and again.

00:42:47.665 --> 00:42:51.268 align:middle line:84%
I'll add just one last
thing via the reincarnation,

00:42:51.268 --> 00:42:56.540 align:middle line:84%
in this 50,000 year period,
going back to the first humans,

00:42:56.540 --> 00:43:00.311 align:middle line:84%
first Cro-Magnon
humans, 50,000 years ago.

00:43:00.311 --> 00:43:04.081 align:middle line:84%
Arnold Toynbee the
famous British historian,

00:43:04.081 --> 00:43:06.951 align:middle line:84%
estimated that the number of
people alive on the planet

00:43:06.951 --> 00:43:10.321 align:middle line:84%
in the last 50,000 years
are all here right now.

00:43:10.321 --> 00:43:11.288 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right, right.

00:43:11.288 --> 00:43:12.390 align:middle line:90%
I understand--

00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:14.558 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: So in a funny
way that there's a kind

00:43:14.558 --> 00:43:16.360 align:middle line:84%
of accumulation happening
right now,

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:19.030 align:middle line:84%
whereas all of these
incarnations are happening

00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:20.331 align:middle line:90%
faster and faster.

00:43:20.331 --> 00:43:21.732 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:43:21.732 --> 00:43:24.335 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: So it may will be more
of the case now than ever before

00:43:24.335 --> 00:43:27.605 align:middle line:84%
that people are being born back
into the space time continuum.

00:43:27.605 --> 00:43:29.440 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I wonder too
about that is you hear

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:32.143 align:middle line:84%
about the philosophies
surrounding the whole 2012

00:43:32.143 --> 00:43:35.546 align:middle line:84%
period going through the
galactic center times adding the

00:43:35.546 --> 00:43:38.282 align:middle line:84%
four dimension time in this
planet is actually moving

00:43:38.282 --> 00:43:42.119 align:middle line:84%
up into a fourth
dimensional density

00:43:42.119 --> 00:43:44.388 align:middle line:90%
and so forth then time changes.

00:43:44.388 --> 00:43:46.557 align:middle line:84%
Time is altered and
time is speeding up.

00:43:46.557 --> 00:43:47.892 align:middle line:90%
>> AM: Correct.

00:43:47.892 --> 00:43:49.694 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So that would make sense
even from the philosophies

00:43:49.694 --> 00:43:51.062 align:middle line:90%
of various quantum physicists.

00:43:51.062 --> 00:43:51.829 align:middle line:90%
>> AM: Well, it does.

00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:53.197 align:middle line:90%
I'm working on a book now

00:43:53.197 --> 00:43:57.068 align:middle line:84%
that the provisional title is
Why Time Flies and the gist

00:43:57.068 --> 00:44:01.205 align:middle line:84%
of it is really that I believe
that apart from bing a astrology

00:44:01.205 --> 00:44:04.241 align:middle line:84%
which I obviously believe is
a very valuable thing to know

00:44:04.241 --> 00:44:09.280 align:middle line:84%
about one self is that I
think in understanding of--

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:11.449 align:middle line:84%
understanding time the
ways I've talked about it

00:44:11.449 --> 00:44:14.585 align:middle line:84%
or the way we've talked about
it is immensely valuable.

00:44:14.585 --> 00:44:17.154 align:middle line:84%
It's connected to
metabolism or it's--

00:44:17.154 --> 00:44:19.990 align:middle line:84%
were continually modulating
our own time sense, you know,

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:21.859 align:middle line:84%
when you-- when you
take stimulants,

00:44:21.859 --> 00:44:24.929 align:middle line:84%
you're becoming younger or when
you take things that slow you

00:44:24.929 --> 00:44:27.031 align:middle line:84%
down like any depressants
or alcohol,

00:44:27.031 --> 00:44:29.433 align:middle line:84%
you're getting older
essentially.

00:44:29.433 --> 00:44:31.836 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of a
fascinating idea

00:44:31.836 --> 00:44:36.540 align:middle line:84%
that by understanding how time
works in the universe and for us

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:39.710 align:middle line:84%
as individuals, it gives us a
whole different kind of wisdom

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:41.912 align:middle line:90%
about how to run our lives.

00:44:41.912 --> 00:44:44.181 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yes, OK I want to
go back now where our--

00:44:44.181 --> 00:44:47.151 align:middle line:84%
it was a little bit ago, I'm
asking you this very linear kind

00:44:47.151 --> 00:44:50.988 align:middle line:84%
of direct sequences so do you
leave a life, you have imprinted

00:44:50.988 --> 00:44:54.425 align:middle line:84%
with as you say, a certain
amount of unfulfilled potential

00:44:54.425 --> 00:44:56.160 align:middle line:90%
and fulfilled potential.

00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:57.128 align:middle line:90%
>> AM: Right.

00:44:57.128 --> 00:44:58.395 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: We know that
there's from one

00:44:58.395 --> 00:45:00.431 align:middle line:84%
of our conversations is
indicating there is a DNA factor

00:45:00.431 --> 00:45:03.300 align:middle line:84%
that is going to be
beneficial for you to continue--

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:04.168 align:middle line:90%
>> AM: Right.

00:45:04.168 --> 00:45:05.102 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: -- and experience
through.

00:45:05.102 --> 00:45:07.037 align:middle line:84%
And I believe it's
the rosicrucian

00:45:07.037 --> 00:45:09.540 align:middle line:84%
so don't crucify me
if I'm wrong on that.

00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:11.275 align:middle line:84%
I thinks it's the--
rosicrucian believe

00:45:11.275 --> 00:45:15.312 align:middle line:84%
that the time you exit one
life is the time essentially

00:45:15.312 --> 00:45:18.849 align:middle line:84%
that you enter again and
maybe it has more to do

00:45:18.849 --> 00:45:21.051 align:middle line:84%
with conception than
an actual birth time.

00:45:21.051 --> 00:45:24.155 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that there are
literal cycles like that

00:45:24.155 --> 00:45:26.657 align:middle line:84%
where you live off and
come back almost literally?

00:45:26.657 --> 00:45:28.225 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: Well I think--
I think it does

00:45:28.225 --> 00:45:32.229 align:middle line:84%
because it makes a lot more
sense to me to believe that we,

00:45:32.229 --> 00:45:34.999 align:middle line:84%
you know, in Tibetan Buddhism
they believe that karma

00:45:34.999 --> 00:45:37.168 align:middle line:84%
at the moment of the
death is really--

00:45:37.168 --> 00:45:39.804 align:middle line:84%
it's unfulfilled causes
that you initiated.

00:45:39.804 --> 00:45:41.205 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:45:41.205 --> 00:45:42.873 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: -- or what the karma you
carry from one life to another

00:45:42.873 --> 00:45:46.343 align:middle line:84%
and that-- and that it
makes a lot more sense to me

00:45:46.343 --> 00:45:48.879 align:middle line:90%
that that process is being coded

00:45:48.879 --> 00:45:50.447 align:middle line:84%
at the conception
point or shortly--

00:45:50.447 --> 00:45:51.849 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:45:51.849 --> 00:45:53.651 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: -- afterwards rather than
a birth when you're already--

00:45:53.651 --> 00:45:54.919 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Right, it makes sense,
it makes sense to me too.

00:45:54.919 --> 00:45:56.253 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: -- develops essentially
you're already there--

00:45:56.253 --> 00:45:57.354 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:45:57.354 --> 00:45:58.489 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: -- especially
since they're been study

00:45:58.489 --> 00:46:01.592 align:middle line:84%
in recent years about,
you know, about children

00:46:01.592 --> 00:46:04.495 align:middle line:84%
in the womb actually having
very vivid experiences

00:46:04.495 --> 00:46:06.330 align:middle line:90%
as that they can remember and--

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:07.164 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Absolutely.

00:46:07.164 --> 00:46:08.432 align:middle line:90%
>> AM: -- bring into the world.

00:46:08.432 --> 00:46:10.501 align:middle line:84%
And also, you know, in
psychedelic research, you know,

00:46:10.501 --> 00:46:12.970 align:middle line:84%
people like we're often
so long, but, you know,

00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:15.306 align:middle line:84%
when your metabolism
accelerates faster

00:46:15.306 --> 00:46:16.907 align:middle line:90%
than it was when you were born.

00:46:16.907 --> 00:46:19.243 align:middle line:84%
I really believe that
with things like LSD

00:46:19.243 --> 00:46:22.046 align:middle line:84%
that you actually
travel back into the womb

00:46:22.046 --> 00:46:24.448 align:middle line:84%
and experience the
things that happened

00:46:24.448 --> 00:46:27.651 align:middle line:84%
when your mother was carrying
you like being immersed

00:46:27.651 --> 00:46:29.353 align:middle line:90%
in the collective unconscious.

00:46:29.353 --> 00:46:30.754 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:46:30.754 --> 00:46:32.223 align:middle line:84%
I went back to-- in Stan Grof's
went back into that process--

00:46:32.223 --> 00:46:33.390 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: That exactly what
happens with it, yeah.

00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:34.592 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: -- and into the womb

00:46:34.592 --> 00:46:36.727 align:middle line:84%
and there are very clear
recollections and feelings

00:46:36.727 --> 00:46:38.963 align:middle line:84%
and notions about do I
want to do this or not.

00:46:38.963 --> 00:46:39.730 align:middle line:90%
Am I ready--

00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:40.731 align:middle line:90%
>> AM: That's right.

00:46:40.731 --> 00:46:42.132 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: -- for this
or not this time?

00:46:42.132 --> 00:46:44.134 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: Well it's all-- it's part
of that holographic paradigm--

00:46:44.134 --> 00:46:45.169 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:46:45.169 --> 00:46:47.071 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: -- but to me
once again, it's--

00:46:47.071 --> 00:46:50.975 align:middle line:84%
it's a lot of my ideas
that I've expressed

00:46:50.975 --> 00:46:54.678 align:middle line:84%
on the books I have written
really do or they really are

00:46:54.678 --> 00:46:58.716 align:middle line:84%
about how you combine all of
these, you know, cosmic issues,

00:46:58.716 --> 00:47:03.754 align:middle line:84%
issues of physics, issues of
astronomy, issues of psychology,

00:47:03.754 --> 00:47:06.457 align:middle line:84%
issues of spiritual
development and evolution,

00:47:06.457 --> 00:47:07.725 align:middle line:90%
issues of reincarnation.

00:47:07.725 --> 00:47:10.127 align:middle line:84%
It's a very complex,
mixed of things.

00:47:10.127 --> 00:47:13.797 align:middle line:84%
But I really believed that, you
know, that really is valuable

00:47:13.797 --> 00:47:16.800 align:middle line:84%
and important for us to
follow these particular cells.

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.569 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I agree, I
mean if we understand

00:47:18.569 --> 00:47:19.737 align:middle line:90%
that this is what we do.

00:47:19.737 --> 00:47:21.138 align:middle line:90%
This is a circle of life.

00:47:21.138 --> 00:47:22.540 align:middle line:90%
>> AM: That's right.

00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:23.874 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: It's certainly would be
nice to start setting yourself

00:47:23.874 --> 00:47:26.810 align:middle line:84%
up for the next one while
you're still here instead

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:28.245 align:middle line:90%
of just kind of bumbling along.

00:47:28.245 --> 00:47:29.980 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, waiting
to see what happens

00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:32.049 align:middle line:90%
to you next so to speak.

00:47:32.049 --> 00:47:33.183 align:middle line:90%
>> AM: That's right.

00:47:33.183 --> 00:47:34.885 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, in the
'70s, I was very lucky

00:47:34.885 --> 00:47:37.288 align:middle line:84%
because I knew a number
of women that founded

00:47:37.288 --> 00:47:39.490 align:middle line:84%
and ramped the active
birth movement.

00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:43.560 align:middle line:84%
And I was-- I was able to give
lecture to groups of midwives

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:47.731 align:middle line:84%
but also to groups of
pregnant women to basically--

00:47:47.731 --> 00:47:50.401 align:middle line:84%
and this is something that
wasn't really talked about a lot

00:47:50.401 --> 00:47:54.104 align:middle line:84%
but that obviously if you place
a lot of importance on gestation

00:47:54.104 --> 00:47:58.576 align:middle line:84%
which I did and do, obviously
it matters a lot the choices you

00:47:58.576 --> 00:48:00.844 align:middle line:84%
make as a mother
while you're pregnant.

00:48:00.844 --> 00:48:02.313 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Absolutely.

00:48:02.313 --> 00:48:04.281 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: You know, like a water
birth attracts Neptune's here

00:48:04.281 --> 00:48:07.585 align:middle line:84%
kids descendant which
maybe is spirituality

00:48:07.585 --> 00:48:12.122 align:middle line:84%
but it also might be of
attraction to water or to drugs.

00:48:12.122 --> 00:48:13.490 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Sure, yeah, or to drugs.

00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:16.293 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: You know, so it's, you
know, but it's good to know,

00:48:16.293 --> 00:48:18.829 align:middle line:84%
I believe going through
the life process,

00:48:18.829 --> 00:48:21.098 align:middle line:84%
most of my clients have
very well educated.

00:48:21.098 --> 00:48:22.199 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:48:22.199 --> 00:48:23.600 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: They're very
aware they're developed

00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:27.738 align:middle line:84%
to quite a high level and at the
same time, we all need to engage

00:48:27.738 --> 00:48:30.107 align:middle line:84%
in a dialog about where
we're headed in our lives.

00:48:30.107 --> 00:48:31.275 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Absolutely.

00:48:31.275 --> 00:48:33.577 align:middle line:84%
OK. So let's talk
about what happens now.

00:48:33.577 --> 00:48:35.245 align:middle line:90%
We-- you say that the--

00:48:35.245 --> 00:48:39.283 align:middle line:84%
so it starts making its imprint
upon the developing fetus

00:48:39.283 --> 00:48:40.684 align:middle line:90%
about seven weeks and--

00:48:40.684 --> 00:48:42.086 align:middle line:90%
>> AM: Right.

00:48:42.086 --> 00:48:43.754 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: -- let's talk about what
happens to the mother in this--

00:48:43.754 --> 00:48:46.657 align:middle line:84%
the circumstance
where a mother is ill

00:48:46.657 --> 00:48:48.892 align:middle line:84%
in the entire time
they're carrying the baby

00:48:48.892 --> 00:48:51.628 align:middle line:84%
versus another mother who
doesn't have even a moment

00:48:51.628 --> 00:48:55.566 align:middle line:84%
of a morning sickness, lack
of sleep, or discomfort.

00:48:55.566 --> 00:48:57.134 align:middle line:90%
What's going on between the two?

00:48:57.134 --> 00:48:59.403 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: Well it's interesting
because in the beginning

00:48:59.403 --> 00:49:01.271 align:middle line:84%
when I was again
exploring this territory,

00:49:01.271 --> 00:49:03.173 align:middle line:90%
not being woman obviously.

00:49:03.173 --> 00:49:06.677 align:middle line:84%
It was-- it wasn't something I'd
experienced myself, however I,

00:49:06.677 --> 00:49:10.247 align:middle line:84%
you know, a lot of my early
clients were women and majority

00:49:10.247 --> 00:49:11.882 align:middle line:90%
of them over the years.

00:49:11.882 --> 00:49:13.884 align:middle line:84%
But of course it's
interesting 'cause you can see

00:49:13.884 --> 00:49:15.386 align:middle line:90%
on the horoscope what was going

00:49:15.386 --> 00:49:17.721 align:middle line:84%
on with your mother
while she's carrying you.

00:49:17.721 --> 00:49:21.258 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, you
know, some women find

00:49:21.258 --> 00:49:22.192 align:middle line:90%
out that they're pregnant

00:49:22.192 --> 00:49:23.594 align:middle line:84%
because they get
morning sickness.

00:49:23.594 --> 00:49:26.930 align:middle line:84%
Others, you know, think they're
ill and go to a doctor who says

00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:28.432 align:middle line:84%
"No, you're not ill,
you're pregnant"

00:49:28.432 --> 00:49:32.770 align:middle line:84%
or there are high emotional
pressures and you know,

00:49:32.770 --> 00:49:37.074 align:middle line:84%
like for example back
in the '50s or '60s kind

00:49:37.074 --> 00:49:42.146 align:middle line:84%
of pre-abortion eras you often
see what look like the thought

00:49:42.146 --> 00:49:44.715 align:middle line:84%
of not wanting to
have this child.

00:49:44.715 --> 00:49:45.783 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:49:45.783 --> 00:49:46.917 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: Integral in
that child's horoscope.

00:49:46.917 --> 00:49:49.987 align:middle line:84%
The mother isn't
likely to tell you that.

00:49:49.987 --> 00:49:51.388 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: After you're
there, right-- right.

00:49:51.388 --> 00:49:53.924 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: After you're
there, however,

00:49:53.924 --> 00:49:57.494 align:middle line:84%
that also has a whole
series of influences

00:49:57.494 --> 00:49:59.430 align:middle line:90%
that it's very valuable to know

00:49:59.430 --> 00:50:01.432 align:middle line:84%
like you might have
difficult relationships

00:50:01.432 --> 00:50:02.666 align:middle line:90%
in women in general.

00:50:02.666 --> 00:50:05.569 align:middle line:84%
You know, women who have
that happened often feel

00:50:05.569 --> 00:50:08.038 align:middle line:84%
like their mother
somehow is sabotaging them

00:50:08.038 --> 00:50:13.043 align:middle line:84%
or isn't really an ally and
they pull away from other women.

00:50:13.043 --> 00:50:14.178 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:50:14.178 --> 00:50:16.180 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: Or men who have
that happened pull away

00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:17.448 align:middle line:90%
from women in general.

00:50:17.448 --> 00:50:22.486 align:middle line:84%
So it-- it's fascinating
because as a child in the womb,

00:50:22.486 --> 00:50:25.389 align:middle line:84%
you're obviously experiencing
everything your mother feels,

00:50:25.389 --> 00:50:27.191 align:middle line:90%
thinks, senses into us.

00:50:27.191 --> 00:50:29.460 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And you know if you're
making her sick literally.

00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:30.928 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: Is she married
to your father?

00:50:30.928 --> 00:50:32.329 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:50:32.329 --> 00:50:33.864 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: You know, is, you know,
is that bringing up a whole set

00:50:33.864 --> 00:50:35.999 align:middle line:84%
of issues that she's
responsible for.

00:50:35.999 --> 00:50:40.237 align:middle line:84%
And if you-- if you take all
these things on as a part

00:50:40.237 --> 00:50:44.875 align:middle line:84%
of your being and your journey
in life, it becomes very rich

00:50:44.875 --> 00:50:49.880 align:middle line:84%
but also a lot people don't know
about them in this ways simply

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:52.750 align:middle line:84%
because the things that
are most important for you

00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:55.185 align:middle line:84%
to know are very often to
one things that your mother

00:50:55.185 --> 00:50:56.320 align:middle line:90%
or father will never tell you.

00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:57.788 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: It will never
tell you exactly.

00:50:57.788 --> 00:50:59.022 align:middle line:90%
>> AM: So--

00:50:59.022 --> 00:51:00.424 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: When I was kid, I
was always intrigued with it

00:51:00.424 --> 00:51:03.093 align:middle line:84%
because my mother was sick from
the day one with me all the way

00:51:03.093 --> 00:51:05.629 align:middle line:84%
through and I was
gestated on soda crackers.

00:51:05.629 --> 00:51:08.866 align:middle line:84%
And my son conversely when
I was pregnant was exactly

00:51:08.866 --> 00:51:09.800 align:middle line:90%
the opposite.

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:12.603 align:middle line:84%
It was-- I felt better
than ever,

00:51:12.603 --> 00:51:15.973 align:middle line:84%
fabulous the entire
time right up to the end

00:51:15.973 --> 00:51:18.175 align:middle line:84%
and I often wonder
what causes that,

00:51:18.175 --> 00:51:19.877 align:middle line:90%
it can't be purely chemical.

00:51:19.877 --> 00:51:22.279 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: Well yeah, I think at
one level, it may be chemical,

00:51:22.279 --> 00:51:25.482 align:middle line:84%
it may be about, you
know, different lineages.

00:51:25.482 --> 00:51:29.786 align:middle line:84%
Biologically it may be about,
you know, underlying issues

00:51:29.786 --> 00:51:31.622 align:middle line:84%
and parents relationship,
I mean people fall

00:51:31.622 --> 00:51:32.523 align:middle line:90%
in love and get pregnant.

00:51:32.523 --> 00:51:33.857 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah, that's right.

00:51:33.857 --> 00:51:36.727 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: You know and they don't
really plan on this being,

00:51:36.727 --> 00:51:39.062 align:middle line:84%
you know, a significant
connection

00:51:39.062 --> 00:51:41.565 align:middle line:90%
but again it turns out to be so.

00:51:41.565 --> 00:51:45.602 align:middle line:84%
So it-- it's a kind of a
fascinating dynamics simply

00:51:45.602 --> 00:51:48.805 align:middle line:84%
because it's-- you often get
a certain kind of insight

00:51:48.805 --> 00:51:51.942 align:middle line:84%
about what it might have been
by looking at the horoscope--

00:51:51.942 --> 00:51:53.076 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:51:53.076 --> 00:51:54.411 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: -- but unless you
have the mother's kind

00:51:54.411 --> 00:51:56.513 align:middle line:84%
of awareness then it's very
difficult to know for sure.

00:51:56.513 --> 00:51:57.881 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:51:57.881 --> 00:51:59.650 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: But I have to say that
even getting people thinking

00:51:59.650 --> 00:52:04.354 align:middle line:84%
about it, it exposes
the idea of what kind

00:52:04.354 --> 00:52:06.924 align:middle line:84%
of potential illnesses
are you carrying.

00:52:06.924 --> 00:52:07.758 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:52:07.758 --> 00:52:10.127 align:middle line:90%
>> AM: Like-- like for example,

00:52:10.127 --> 00:52:13.864 align:middle line:84%
a book I wrote years ago called
Astrology in the Art of Healing,

00:52:13.864 --> 00:52:15.566 align:middle line:84%
it's like the moon
is your mother

00:52:15.566 --> 00:52:19.069 align:middle line:84%
but it also your digestive
tract, your stomach.

00:52:19.069 --> 00:52:21.471 align:middle line:84%
And if you're a cancer for
example, or have planets

00:52:21.471 --> 00:52:25.342 align:middle line:84%
in cancer then-- then intensely
emotional experiences are

00:52:25.342 --> 00:52:27.778 align:middle line:90%
difficult for you to digest.

00:52:27.778 --> 00:52:30.514 align:middle line:84%
So if you find emotional
experiences difficult

00:52:30.514 --> 00:52:34.918 align:middle line:84%
to digest then when an intense
emotion happened around you,

00:52:34.918 --> 00:52:36.453 align:middle line:84%
your stomach has
going to misfire.

00:52:36.453 --> 00:52:37.788 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:52:37.788 --> 00:52:39.990 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: And you're more prone
to ulcers or stomach decease

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:42.059 align:middle line:90%
or stomach cancer or whatever.

00:52:42.059 --> 00:52:45.696 align:middle line:84%
Or like for example the
throat is about communication.

00:52:45.696 --> 00:52:47.931 align:middle line:90%
Freud died of throat cancer.

00:52:47.931 --> 00:52:51.301 align:middle line:84%
You know, so you have to-- you
have to be aware of the fact

00:52:51.301 --> 00:52:52.502 align:middle line:90%
that there were certain things

00:52:52.502 --> 00:52:55.672 align:middle line:84%
that he felt he was
expressing that were taboos.

00:52:55.672 --> 00:52:56.373 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:52:56.373 --> 00:52:57.007 align:middle line:90%
>> AM: You know--

00:52:57.007 --> 00:52:58.141 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: It isn't--

00:52:58.141 --> 00:52:59.977 align:middle line:84%
it is interesting though
that cycle being setup

00:52:59.977 --> 00:53:02.512 align:middle line:84%
from so long ago as you say
throughout your own lineage,

00:53:02.512 --> 00:53:03.880 align:middle line:84%
your mother-- your
mother's mother,

00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:05.682 align:middle line:90%
your mother's, mother's, mother.

00:53:05.682 --> 00:53:10.087 align:middle line:84%
OK. Let's talk just for a
moment about what happens

00:53:10.087 --> 00:53:11.922 align:middle line:84%
when you enter the
world after you've been

00:53:11.922 --> 00:53:17.694 align:middle line:84%
in this wonderfully circular
warm fluidic environment,

00:53:17.694 --> 00:53:20.397 align:middle line:84%
not always pleasant depending
on what mother is going through.

00:53:20.397 --> 00:53:23.166 align:middle line:84%
And now you're entering
into a much drier,

00:53:23.166 --> 00:53:24.668 align:middle line:90%
more linear kind of world.

00:53:24.668 --> 00:53:25.902 align:middle line:84%
What happens to each
of one of us?

00:53:25.902 --> 00:53:27.671 align:middle line:84%
I look at it as coming
from circles

00:53:27.671 --> 00:53:30.607 align:middle line:84%
to squares including
the hospital room.

00:53:30.607 --> 00:53:32.576 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: Well I mean you're
experiencing the effects

00:53:32.576 --> 00:53:35.312 align:middle line:84%
of gravity for one thing, you
know, going from an environment

00:53:35.312 --> 00:53:38.415 align:middle line:84%
where you, you know, you're not
really breathing in the womb

00:53:38.415 --> 00:53:42.052 align:middle line:84%
and you're not subject to
gravity, you're in free fall

00:53:42.052 --> 00:53:45.122 align:middle line:84%
in a way and, you know, there
have been many therapist

00:53:45.122 --> 00:53:47.057 align:middle line:84%
like re-birthing
where Stan Grof's

00:53:47.057 --> 00:53:48.158 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:53:48.158 --> 00:53:50.227 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: -- theories that
really do allow you

00:53:50.227 --> 00:53:52.296 align:middle line:84%
to really re-experience
that birth.

00:53:52.296 --> 00:53:54.097 align:middle line:84%
I just reconnected
with an old friend

00:53:54.097 --> 00:53:56.466 align:middle line:90%
of mine in May in the summer.

00:53:56.466 --> 00:53:58.935 align:middle line:84%
And he-- Tom Myers [assumed
spelling] is his name

00:53:58.935 --> 00:54:00.070 align:middle line:90%
and he was a rolfer [phonetic],

00:54:00.070 --> 00:54:02.706 align:middle line:84%
he rolf [phonetic] me
back in the early '80s.

00:54:02.706 --> 00:54:05.876 align:middle line:84%
And it was interesting because
when you're rolfed, you know,

00:54:05.876 --> 00:54:09.112 align:middle line:84%
certain pressure in your mid
section in particular invoked

00:54:09.112 --> 00:54:11.381 align:middle line:90%
in for you to experiences.

00:54:11.381 --> 00:54:13.850 align:middle line:90%
So you feel actually what's it

00:54:13.850 --> 00:54:16.787 align:middle line:84%
like to be very young
again but in an adult body.

00:54:16.787 --> 00:54:19.189 align:middle line:84%
And he did a workshop
back on those days

00:54:19.189 --> 00:54:22.059 align:middle line:84%
where everyone essentially
in the course of a day went

00:54:22.059 --> 00:54:25.462 align:middle line:84%
from being-- being born
essentially on the floor.

00:54:25.462 --> 00:54:29.366 align:middle line:84%
And not being able to lift
your limps to really the idea

00:54:29.366 --> 00:54:31.735 align:middle line:84%
of lifting an arm
was like a big deal.

00:54:31.735 --> 00:54:34.338 align:middle line:84%
And you felt overcoming
gravity was

00:54:34.338 --> 00:54:36.006 align:middle line:84%
like a major part
of this process.

00:54:36.006 --> 00:54:36.973 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Very interesting.

00:54:36.973 --> 00:54:38.208 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: And-- and
after while you're--

00:54:38.208 --> 00:54:40.977 align:middle line:84%
you know, we're only allowed
to crawl on the floor.

00:54:40.977 --> 00:54:42.245 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:54:42.245 --> 00:54:43.480 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: And you know, we would
do this for half an hour

00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:45.782 align:middle line:84%
until you're thinking I want
to get up off the ground

00:54:45.782 --> 00:54:48.919 align:middle line:84%
and it's very interesting
because in our early life,

00:54:48.919 --> 00:54:50.220 align:middle line:90%
we go through that process.

00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:54.124 align:middle line:84%
We gradually become mobile
and we gradually step up out

00:54:54.124 --> 00:54:55.425 align:middle line:90%
into the world and begin

00:54:55.425 --> 00:54:58.628 align:middle line:84%
to express those kind
of qualities and--

00:54:58.628 --> 00:55:00.364 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And-- and the thing
that keeps coming back

00:55:00.364 --> 00:55:03.900 align:middle line:84%
to me is the notion that we come
into such a linear construct.

00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:07.237 align:middle line:84%
And then we come in to even
the geometry, even the geometry

00:55:07.237 --> 00:55:10.907 align:middle line:84%
of space which of course you're
very wedded to the notion.

00:55:10.907 --> 00:55:13.043 align:middle line:84%
And when we look at a lot
of the ancient cultures

00:55:13.043 --> 00:55:14.544 align:middle line:84%
when you are born,
you may have been born

00:55:14.544 --> 00:55:16.947 align:middle line:84%
into an environment
that was around us.

00:55:16.947 --> 00:55:18.081 align:middle line:90%
>> AM: Absolutely.

00:55:18.081 --> 00:55:19.516 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Some of the
indigenous people's homes

00:55:19.516 --> 00:55:24.421 align:middle line:84%
for example compared to being
born into a sterile square room.

00:55:24.421 --> 00:55:26.623 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: But, you know, a lot
of-- a lot of, you know,

00:55:26.623 --> 00:55:28.558 align:middle line:84%
women's movement has
really been about that,

00:55:28.558 --> 00:55:31.895 align:middle line:84%
about a whole revolution in
terms of building, I mean,

00:55:31.895 --> 00:55:35.332 align:middle line:84%
building in terms of
birthing ideas and processes.

00:55:35.332 --> 00:55:38.535 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you know, it
is every interesting going to,

00:55:38.535 --> 00:55:41.905 align:middle line:84%
you know, I traveled a lot in
North Africa, in India and so

00:55:41.905 --> 00:55:45.275 align:middle line:84%
on back in the this-- in the
late '60s or early '70s and,

00:55:45.275 --> 00:55:47.477 align:middle line:84%
you know, I saw women give
birth on the dirge, you know,

00:55:47.477 --> 00:55:50.514 align:middle line:84%
and it is actually very
interesting because we come

00:55:50.514 --> 00:55:53.717 align:middle line:84%
into this world which is,
you know, created by humanity

00:55:53.717 --> 00:55:56.953 align:middle line:84%
and it's not a very
friendly place in many ways.

00:55:56.953 --> 00:55:59.856 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's the whole
movement of the '60s, you know,

00:55:59.856 --> 00:56:01.892 align:middle line:84%
going back to the earth
in a way is something

00:56:01.892 --> 00:56:04.027 align:middle line:84%
that I think it's
coming back again now.

00:56:04.027 --> 00:56:06.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's gaining
a bit of attraction.

00:56:06.430 --> 00:56:08.765 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And you have
also spend time,

00:56:08.765 --> 00:56:12.002 align:middle line:84%
you read a book regarding
astrology and healing

00:56:12.002 --> 00:56:15.205 align:middle line:84%
which we only have about four or
five minutes left but let's talk

00:56:15.205 --> 00:56:16.406 align:middle line:90%
about that just for a moment.

00:56:16.406 --> 00:56:18.208 align:middle line:84%
You already said that
you can peg or certain

00:56:18.208 --> 00:56:20.811 align:middle line:84%
of your illnesses come
from looking at a chart.

00:56:20.811 --> 00:56:26.349 align:middle line:84%
Can you also peg the best
scenarios, the best environments

00:56:26.349 --> 00:56:28.885 align:middle line:90%
and times in which to heal?

00:56:28.885 --> 00:56:31.755 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: Well you know, in a
way astrology is cyclical,

00:56:31.755 --> 00:56:34.090 align:middle line:84%
it's the series of cycles
that are always happening

00:56:34.090 --> 00:56:38.528 align:middle line:84%
and so we're always for
example it's like, you know,

00:56:38.528 --> 00:56:41.098 align:middle line:84%
the moon every month goes
around the whole horoscope

00:56:41.098 --> 00:56:42.399 align:middle line:90%
and the sun does every year.

00:56:42.399 --> 00:56:46.036 align:middle line:84%
So your gestation period's
been triggered all the time.

00:56:46.036 --> 00:56:50.273 align:middle line:84%
And so gestations means not only
gestating as being an infant

00:56:50.273 --> 00:56:52.943 align:middle line:84%
but it also is about
ideas gestating--

00:56:52.943 --> 00:56:54.077 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:56:54.077 --> 00:56:55.612 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: -- making films
like some of my clients

00:56:55.612 --> 00:56:58.515 align:middle line:84%
at the moment are
documentary film makers.

00:56:58.515 --> 00:57:01.218 align:middle line:84%
And of course with
planets moving slowly

00:57:01.218 --> 00:57:03.687 align:middle line:84%
through their gestation
period, they're likely

00:57:03.687 --> 00:57:06.623 align:middle line:84%
to create films that
have a subtext.

00:57:06.623 --> 00:57:08.225 align:middle line:90%
That's very personal to them.

00:57:08.225 --> 00:57:09.559 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes:

00:57:09.559 --> 00:57:11.895 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: In a way they're working
out a stage of their life

00:57:11.895 --> 00:57:13.597 align:middle line:90%
through a film, film making-- .

00:57:13.597 --> 00:57:14.931 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: So healing is perpetual

00:57:14.931 --> 00:57:17.434 align:middle line:84%
or opportunity depending
cyclicly.

00:57:17.434 --> 00:57:19.369 align:middle line:84%
There's a perpetual
opportunity to be healing,

00:57:19.369 --> 00:57:21.438 align:middle line:84%
not as a major response
to decease.

00:57:21.438 --> 00:57:22.706 align:middle line:90%
>> AM: Correct, so-- so--

00:57:22.706 --> 00:57:24.808 align:middle line:84%
so the whole point of view
that I take is, you know,

00:57:24.808 --> 00:57:28.044 align:middle line:84%
you can wait until you're
in the operating room

00:57:28.044 --> 00:57:30.780 align:middle line:84%
but then there's no
margin of error there.

00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:32.983 align:middle line:84%
And that it's much
better to have some sense

00:57:32.983 --> 00:57:35.519 align:middle line:84%
of what you're likely
to be subject to

00:57:35.519 --> 00:57:38.388 align:middle line:84%
and really learn the
right techniques and ideas

00:57:38.388 --> 00:57:41.992 align:middle line:84%
to actually heal that before
it becomes a major issue

00:57:41.992 --> 00:57:45.362 align:middle line:84%
like if stomach is an issue
then something like meditation

00:57:45.362 --> 00:57:47.898 align:middle line:84%
and learning to be a
little less reactive

00:57:47.898 --> 00:57:50.300 align:middle line:84%
to emotional situations
is something

00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:52.235 align:middle line:84%
that you can develop
a habit of doing.

00:57:52.235 --> 00:57:57.374 align:middle line:84%
And it actually has the affect
of helping you get on top this.

00:57:57.374 --> 00:57:59.342 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not pretending to
be a doctor or I'm not --

00:57:59.342 --> 00:58:00.377 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right, of course.

00:58:00.377 --> 00:58:01.311 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: Intending to
cure people but --

00:58:01.311 --> 00:58:02.245 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: This is not
medical advised.

00:58:02.245 --> 00:58:03.547 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: This is not
medical advised.

00:58:03.547 --> 00:58:04.214 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: This is not to begin
student's med science.

00:58:04.214 --> 00:58:05.048 align:middle line:90%
>> AM: Exactly, so--

00:58:05.048 --> 00:58:06.416 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: There's our disclaimer.

00:58:06.416 --> 00:58:08.818 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: But there is-- there
is of course a lot of insight

00:58:08.818 --> 00:58:11.321 align:middle line:84%
that could be gained through
both understanding the

00:58:11.321 --> 00:58:12.722 align:middle line:90%
psychology of your early life

00:58:12.722 --> 00:58:15.058 align:middle line:84%
but also the physical
conditions of it.

00:58:15.058 --> 00:58:17.494 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And so once you're able
to see what your subject to

00:58:17.494 --> 00:58:21.097 align:middle line:84%
or likely to develop or there's
a propensity toward then you can

00:58:21.097 --> 00:58:21.665 align:middle line:90%
start --

00:58:21.665 --> 00:58:22.966 align:middle line:90%
>> AM: Correct.

00:58:22.966 --> 00:58:24.134 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: -- count-- you can
start countering that really

00:58:24.134 --> 00:58:25.535 align:middle line:90%
from that moment forward.

00:58:25.535 --> 00:58:26.736 align:middle line:90%
>> AM: Yeah.

00:58:26.736 --> 00:58:28.038 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I mean like it
become a healing process.

00:58:28.038 --> 00:58:29.506 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: Of course and also
of course in early medicine

00:58:29.506 --> 00:58:31.675 align:middle line:84%
in most cultures that
was about herbalism

00:58:31.675 --> 00:58:33.109 align:middle line:90%
which is coming back into play.

00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:34.477 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:58:34.477 --> 00:58:37.080 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: And so you, you know,
herbs will always dispense based

00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:39.082 align:middle line:84%
on horoscopes and
planets that were--

00:58:39.082 --> 00:58:40.116 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Oh really.

00:58:40.116 --> 00:58:41.017 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: -- associated
with those herbs.

00:58:41.017 --> 00:58:42.018 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Is that now?

00:58:42.018 --> 00:58:43.553 align:middle line:84%
Does that-- does
Steiner works takes them

00:58:43.553 --> 00:58:44.888 align:middle line:90%
to [inaudible] continuation.

00:58:44.888 --> 00:58:46.656 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: Steiner's work does
that to a certain extent but,

00:58:46.656 --> 00:58:51.695 align:middle line:84%
you know, Nicholas Culpeper,
you know, in the '1700s,

00:58:51.695 --> 00:58:56.600 align:middle line:84%
his books of flower remedies
basically associated each one

00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:58.802 align:middle line:84%
of these remedies with a
particular planets so --

00:58:58.802 --> 00:59:00.003 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Paracelsus as well.

00:59:00.003 --> 00:59:02.172 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: Paracelsus also was
also was an astrologer.

00:59:02.172 --> 00:59:03.440 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:05.041 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: So they're basically
saying that you want

00:59:05.041 --> 00:59:06.910 align:middle line:84%
to find a whole set
of corresponds.

00:59:06.910 --> 00:59:09.512 align:middle line:84%
It can be certain
kinds of food you eat.

00:59:09.512 --> 00:59:12.315 align:middle line:84%
It can certain herbs you
take, be things you drink,

00:59:12.315 --> 00:59:15.919 align:middle line:84%
it can be colors you wear
fabrics that are around you.

00:59:15.919 --> 00:59:18.989 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And the planets
indicate these things directly

00:59:18.989 --> 00:59:20.957 align:middle line:84%
if you were looking
at someone's chart.

00:59:20.957 --> 00:59:22.292 align:middle line:90%
>> AM: That's right.

00:59:22.292 --> 00:59:25.095 align:middle line:84%
So if you're drawn to red
which triggers adrenal glands

00:59:25.095 --> 00:59:27.931 align:middle line:84%
and is associated with
anger and things like this,

00:59:27.931 --> 00:59:29.532 align:middle line:84%
if you wear a lot of
red, you're likely

00:59:29.532 --> 00:59:31.768 align:middle line:84%
to be a more inflammatory
person.

00:59:31.768 --> 00:59:33.036 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:59:33.036 --> 00:59:34.571 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: But that's what
wearing red is about isn't it?

00:59:34.571 --> 00:59:36.906 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yes, and what
planet goes with that?

00:59:36.906 --> 00:59:37.574 align:middle line:90%
>> AM: Mars.

00:59:37.574 --> 00:59:38.108 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Mars.

00:59:38.108 --> 00:59:39.409 align:middle line:90%
>> AM: Mars.

00:59:39.409 --> 00:59:41.878 align:middle line:84%
Jupiter is blue, it's much
more placid and tranquil --

00:59:41.878 --> 00:59:42.445 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:59:42.445 --> 00:59:42.979 align:middle line:90%
>> AM: -- and --

00:59:42.979 --> 00:59:44.247 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:59:44.247 --> 00:59:45.315 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: -- optimistic and
Libra is very loving in green

00:59:45.315 --> 00:59:47.717 align:middle line:90%
and St. Patrick's Day is green.

00:59:47.717 --> 00:59:48.718 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:59:48.718 --> 00:59:49.853 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: It's all about
those energies.

00:59:49.853 --> 00:59:52.088 align:middle line:84%
And the point is most
people are oblivious--

00:59:52.088 --> 00:59:53.490 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:59:53.490 --> 00:59:55.692 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: -- to the energies that
they're continually attracting,

00:59:55.692 --> 00:59:57.093 align:middle line:90%
creating, and reinforcing.

00:59:57.093 --> 01:00:00.163 align:middle line:84%
But the more you know about
them, the more you begin

01:00:00.163 --> 01:00:04.601 align:middle line:84%
to really learn to engage in
your world in your environment.

01:00:04.601 --> 01:00:07.404 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I know you're a very busy
man and you're very prolific

01:00:07.404 --> 01:00:10.140 align:middle line:84%
as a writer as well but do
you actually still do charts

01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:11.207 align:middle line:90%
for people?

01:00:11.207 --> 01:00:12.275 align:middle line:84%
>> AM: Absolutely,
acceptable all the time.

01:00:12.275 --> 01:00:13.476 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Oh wonderful,
that's good to know.

01:00:13.476 --> 01:00:15.578 align:middle line:84%
Hey, I felt that
about two years ago

01:00:15.578 --> 01:00:18.348 align:middle line:84%
because my husband had had a
chart done that's where I found

01:00:18.348 --> 01:00:19.983 align:middle line:90%
out about your theory--

01:00:19.983 --> 01:00:21.317 align:middle line:90%
>> AM: Fascinating.

01:00:21.317 --> 01:00:22.619 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: -- that it starts at
conception and I found it's

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:24.587 align:middle line:84%
so fascinating, it's only
taken about eight more years

01:00:24.587 --> 01:00:28.058 align:middle line:84%
to meet you and I'm
so glad to have.

01:00:28.058 --> 01:00:29.726 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
do this again.

01:00:29.726 --> 01:00:30.427 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:00:30.427 --> 01:00:31.394 align:middle line:90%
>> AM: Good, terrific.

01:00:31.394 --> 01:00:32.796 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Ted is going
to come back.

01:00:32.796 --> 01:00:34.764 align:middle line:84%
We're going to speak next time
about one my favorite topics.

01:00:34.764 --> 01:00:38.468 align:middle line:84%
Trees, based on his book the
Sacred Language of Trees.

01:00:38.468 --> 01:00:42.472 align:middle line:84%
And tell then you can connect
with this work at ATMann.net

01:00:42.472 --> 01:00:44.140 align:middle line:84%
and learn about his
deep astrology,

01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:46.242 align:middle line:90%
sacred landscapes and much more.

01:00:46.242 --> 01:00:50.346 align:middle line:84%
