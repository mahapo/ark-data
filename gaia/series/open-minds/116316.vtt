>>REGINA MEREDITH: In
my last conversation

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.280 align:middle line:10%
with Carl Lehrburger,
we looked at evidence

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.690 align:middle line:10%
throughout Colorado
and the West that

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.730 align:middle line:10%
pegged our ancient
American history

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.490 align:middle line:10%
to the presence of cultures
from the Celts to the Sumerians.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.680 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're going to discuss
that plus the Hebrew East

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.850 align:middle line:84%
Indian Mesoamerican influences
in our American ancient past.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.220 align:middle line:90%
This is a whole new history.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.650 align:middle line:90%
I loved our last conversation.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:49.360 align:middle line:90%
It was packed.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.568 align:middle line:84%
I think people probably had
to stop it, go back, look

00:00:51.568 --> 00:00:53.560 align:middle line:84%
at the images, go
to the Internet.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.239 align:middle line:90%
This is a full course of study--

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:56.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL LEHRBURGER: It is.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --talking with you.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And now, where we're
going to pick it up,

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.600 align:middle line:84%
I just want to
make quick comment.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.840 align:middle line:84%
The work of Ralph Ellis,
who I have interviewed

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.820 align:middle line:84%
who also does some
revisionist history,

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.880 align:middle line:84%
he speaks quite a bit about
Scota, the Celtic queen

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.800 align:middle line:90%
with her roots from Egypt.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And so, in his work, he has
created this evidence base

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.880 align:middle line:84%
for the notion that
the Celts were also

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.580 align:middle line:90%
connected with the Egyptians.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.600 align:middle line:84%
And I only bring it
up because of where

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.750 align:middle line:84%
we're going next, which
is a Celtic cave featuring

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.100 align:middle line:84%
Anubis, right, in the
Oklahoma panhandle?

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.850 align:middle line:10%
>>LEHRBURGER: Yes.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.450 align:middle line:10%
And, as a background,
it's a great point

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.930 align:middle line:10%
to know that we might think
of the Celts coming over,

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.130 align:middle line:10%
or the Phoenicians coming
over, or the Egyptians coming,

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.010 align:middle line:10%
but what's likely
that happened is

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.740 align:middle line:10%
we had multicultural crews that
spoke many different languages

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.750 align:middle line:10%
and had many
different religions.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.270 align:middle line:84%
So the Anubis Cave, which
is located in the Oklahoma

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.080 align:middle line:84%
panhandle, not so far from Crack
Cave that we were discussing,

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.580 align:middle line:84%
is an instance where
we find not only Celtic

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.567 align:middle line:90%
writing but Egyptian imagery--

00:02:05.567 --> 00:02:06.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.555 align:middle line:90%


00:02:06.555 --> 00:02:08.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: --to complement
exactly what you're saying.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --what Anubis
is, and this happens

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.360 align:middle line:90%
at a certain time of the day.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: So
the Anubis Caves

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:22.570 align:middle line:84%
are six caves in sandstone
found in the Oklahoma panhandle.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.430 align:middle line:84%
Diffusionist scholar,
Gloria Farley,

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.320 align:middle line:84%
was led there by
a local rancher.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:36.840 align:middle line:84%
And she noted that there was
a dog-like petroglyph that

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:44.180 align:middle line:84%
had a kind of a stick or a
sceptre coming out of its back,

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.140 align:middle line:84%
very akin to exactly the imagery
of the Egyptian God, Anubis,

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.190 align:middle line:84%
the Lord of Night,
the God of Death.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.220 align:middle line:84%
And the Anubis Caves
represents, perhaps,

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.850 align:middle line:84%
the most definitive
evidence that the Celts

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:10.170 align:middle line:84%
were here and really
reveals insights

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.340 align:middle line:84%
into Old World religion
that you don't even

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.470 align:middle line:84%
find in the Old World
because they were

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.590 align:middle line:90%
destroyed by the Christians.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And we have some of
the Old World Mithraic

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.950 align:middle line:84%
traditions, which was a
Persian sun god that became,

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.480 align:middle line:84%
later, a part of the Roman
belief system of Mithras,

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.280 align:middle line:90%
the slayer of the bull.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.800 align:middle line:84%
What we find, the mythology
and the cosmology of Mithras

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.410 align:middle line:84%
and the religion in Oklahoma,
it's quite phenomenal.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, this particular
image in this cave is,

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.870 align:middle line:84%
as I recall in
your book, is said

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.850 align:middle line:84%
to be illuminated
around sunset each day.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: Unlike
the Crack Cave, which

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:58.180 align:middle line:84%
is a equinox sunrise alignment,
the many different alignments

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.090 align:middle line:90%
in Anubis Cave occur at sunset.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just one alignment
but multiple alignments.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.630 align:middle line:84%
But the most famous
alignment which

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:13.510 align:middle line:84%
was named by William McGlone and
Phil Leonard who did the most

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.180 align:middle line:84%
thorough research on
this as the Silent Opera

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.250 align:middle line:84%
because many of the
most amazing alignments

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.740 align:middle line:84%
are not just a sun or a
shadow striking a circle.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.020 align:middle line:84%
But you actually see the
shadows moving and telling

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.181 align:middle line:90%
a story, almost like--

00:04:32.181 --> 00:04:33.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I love that
imagery in the book.

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.221 align:middle line:90%
>>LEHRBURGER: --silent picture.

00:04:35.221 --> 00:04:36.340 align:middle line:90%
Yes, a Silent Opera.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it creates
an image of its own.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.390 align:middle line:84%
Depending on the time of day,
it's a whole different image.

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: Well, what we're
seeing is it's an art form.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.150 align:middle line:84%
It's the language
of the ancients.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.024 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And tell us
the name of that again,

00:04:48.024 --> 00:04:49.620 align:middle line:90%
the word that is used for that.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: Well, these are
called heliolithic animations.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Heliolithic.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: It was named at
Anubis Cave the Silent Opera,

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.460 align:middle line:84%
but these heliolithic animations
and the archaeoastronomy

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.500 align:middle line:84%
that we see encoded
in these rocks

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.590 align:middle line:84%
are the language
of the ancients.

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And you can readily see why
archaeologists have missed this

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.580 align:middle line:84%
for so many decades, looking
down and digging, not really

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.970 align:middle line:84%
taking into account the position
of the sun on special days

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.500 align:middle line:84%
or how this structure
was built, oriented

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.660 align:middle line:90%
towards a particular direction.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we
as archaeoastronomers

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.520 align:middle line:84%
look for because it's
an important part

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.890 align:middle line:84%
of the story, an important
part of the language.

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, at Anubis Cave, the
most remarkable animation,

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.190 align:middle line:84%
the Silent Opera, has two
main petroglyphic characters.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.390 align:middle line:84%
One is the sun god who
McGlone and Leonard have

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.650 align:middle line:84%
identified as Mithras, the
Persian and later day Roman sun

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:51.320 align:middle line:90%
god.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And the second
character is Anubis,

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.960 align:middle line:90%
this Egyptian God of the Dead.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And what we find, as the
sun sets on the equinox

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.680 align:middle line:84%
as the sun god goes
into shadow, we

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:09.420 align:middle line:84%
see the dog or Jekyll-like god,
Anubis, illuminated in light

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:14.520 align:middle line:84%
above him, representing that
with the illumination in light

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.040 align:middle line:84%
Anubis now carries on
as the Lord of the Night

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.090 align:middle line:84%
while Anubis the sun
god goes into shadow.

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's fascinating.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And it would take such
patient observation.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: And it's
not just that we're

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:35.800 align:middle line:84%
talking about a
day or a holiday,

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.540 align:middle line:84%
but we're talking about a
cosmology of an ancient people.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And when you realize that the
ancient Mithraeums in Europe,

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:46.910 align:middle line:84%
most of them have been
destroyed, and few, if any,

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:51.990 align:middle line:84%
have the type of symbology that
is encoded at Anubis Caves.

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:57.700 align:middle line:84%
It's a remarkable discovery
that we're actually finding out

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.490 align:middle line:84%
about an Old World
religion in the New World

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.810 align:middle line:84%
because the evidence
has been destroyed.

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.840 align:middle line:84%
Some of the other fascinating
aspects of the Anubis Cave

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.230 align:middle line:84%
is it's not just the
sun god masculine deity,

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:13.480 align:middle line:84%
but we also see feminine
deities, for example,

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:21.520 align:middle line:84%
the Sheela-na-gig, a popular
feminine deity fertility

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.300 align:middle line:84%
goddess is represented
in Anubis Caves

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:32.320 align:middle line:84%
as well as many petroglyphs
representing the sky positions

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.450 align:middle line:90%
and the constellations.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:38.520 align:middle line:84%
So, in addition to the many
archaeoastronomy alignments

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.740 align:middle line:84%
that are set for
the equinox sunset,

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:47.190 align:middle line:84%
we have multiple petroglyphs
representing Old World deities.

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:52.190 align:middle line:84%
And, most importantly, we
find extensive Ogham script

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:57.890 align:middle line:84%
that defines and describes
these alignments.

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:01.350 align:middle line:84%
One script talks
about equinox being

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:03.300 align:middle line:90%
equal day and equal night.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is a Ogham language
that is read in Celtic.

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:11.030 align:middle line:84%
So it's really telling
us what's going on,

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:13.830 align:middle line:84%
how to prepare for
these celebrations,

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:17.140 align:middle line:84%
and it's clear evidence
that the Celts were here,

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:20.000 align:middle line:84%
left their mark in
stone describing

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.020 align:middle line:84%
the most important parts of
their cosmology still encoded

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.700 align:middle line:90%
for us to see and learn.

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:33.260 align:middle line:84%
Regrettably, even though
"60 Minutes" and other media

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:38.580 align:middle line:84%
outlets have done stories on
it, and Bill McGlone and Phil

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:42.030 align:middle line:84%
Leonard have done extensive
research published in journals

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:44.730 align:middle line:84%
and their book, "Ancient
American Inscriptions,"

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:47.770 align:middle line:84%
the Anubis Cave is not
given any credibility

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:50.140 align:middle line:90%
by the archaeological community.

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's shocking to think
that, while every summer we

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:58.160 align:middle line:84%
have scores, if not hundreds,
of archaeologists and graduate

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:03.060 align:middle line:84%
students scouring the American
Four Corners area looking

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:06.870 align:middle line:84%
at Anasazi Ruins and kind of
going over a lot of what's

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:09.090 align:middle line:84%
already been
discovered, you rarely

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:13.906 align:middle line:84%
find any archaeologist at
these handful of Celtic sites.

00:09:13.906 --> 00:09:14.864 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What a shame.

00:09:14.864 --> 00:09:15.572 align:middle line:90%
What a loss.

00:09:15.572 --> 00:09:16.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LEHRBURGER: It's a tragedy.

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:19.805 align:middle line:84%
And, as a result, we still
have this overarching paradigm

00:09:19.805 --> 00:09:22.100 align:middle line:84%
that Columbus
discovered America,

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:25.500 align:middle line:84%
and how could the Celts
have possibly gotten

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:26.270 align:middle line:90%
into the Americas?

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:29.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, as I remember,
it's approximately that site

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:31.780 align:middle line:84%
they're dating back a couple
thousand years anyway--

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:31.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LEHRBURGER: Yes.

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:32.656 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:09:32.656 --> 00:09:35.659 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: The dating of
these sites is very difficult.

00:09:35.659 --> 00:09:36.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.050 align:middle line:90%


00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:42.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: But from
both experimental studies

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:46.960 align:middle line:84%
of the patina or dating of
the petroglyphs themselves

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:50.930 align:middle line:84%
and from looking at the
cosmology in the star

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.600 align:middle line:84%
patterns represented
in these cases,

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.860 align:middle line:84%
we surmise that
the Anubis Cave is

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:59.060 align:middle line:90%
approximately 2,000 years old.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:09:59.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:02.540 align:middle line:84%
And, going on with the Egyptian
theme, what about the Sun

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:03.405 align:middle line:90%
Temple?

00:10:03.405 --> 00:10:04.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
that is Egyptian,

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:06.030 align:middle line:90%
but they did have them.

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:07.830 align:middle line:90%
The Sun Temple in Colorado?

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:10.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: Well, you're
hitting the great sites

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:14.090 align:middle line:84%
in the Ogham corridor, beginning
with Crack Cave in Picture

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:19.430 align:middle line:84%
Canyon, nearby Anubis Cave
in the Oklahoma panhandle,

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:21.520 align:middle line:90%
both being equinox sites.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.540 align:middle line:84%
The Sun Temple in
southeastern Colorado

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.112 align:middle line:90%
is a cross-quarter day site.

00:10:26.112 --> 00:10:26.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:29.164 align:middle line:90%
>>LEHRBURGER: And it is imagery

00:10:29.164 --> 00:10:30.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And a
Celtic site, yeah?

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:34.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: --related to
the cross-quarter day known

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:39.170 align:middle line:84%
by the Celts as Lughnasa or
the celebration of the sun god,

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:40.440 align:middle line:90%
Lugh.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:45.990 align:middle line:84%
Lugh was one of the most
popular of the Celtic gods.

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And when the Romans captured
and took over the Celts,

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:58.100 align:middle line:84%
there was a statue to Lugh
in almost every cross corner

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:01.324 align:middle line:84%
of the highway
systems of the Celts.

00:11:01.324 --> 00:11:03.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, these, of course, all
disappeared and been destroyed.

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.323 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
did Lugh represent?

00:11:05.323 --> 00:11:05.360 align:middle line:90%


00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.693 align:middle line:90%
>>LEHRBURGER: Lugh is a sun god.

00:11:06.693 --> 00:11:08.440 align:middle line:84%
He's known as "Lugh
of the Long Arm."

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:14.630 align:middle line:84%
And the celebration of Lughnasa
is a harvest festival and also

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:17.680 align:middle line:90%
a time of doing the sports.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:22.040 align:middle line:84%
So what we find
in the Sun Temple

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:25.680 align:middle line:84%
is a very unique alignment
as well as imagery.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:33.040 align:middle line:84%
And the alignment is the sun
rising on the cross-quarter day

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:38.140 align:middle line:84%
and fitting in a notch
on the horizon created

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:41.670 align:middle line:90%
by a mountain and the horizon.

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's just on that
cross-quarter day

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:46.780 align:middle line:84%
that the sun, as it
rises, fits right

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:51.130 align:middle line:84%
in the notch if you have
your head positioned

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:52.840 align:middle line:90%
in a pecked circle.

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.530 align:middle line:84%
They would peck those circles
probably with metal tools,

00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:57.091 align:middle line:90%
and they would have a--

00:11:57.091 --> 00:11:58.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just chip
out little dots.

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:00.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: Chip out
little dots in the rock.

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:03.990 align:middle line:84%
And there is an
Ogham inscription

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:10.110 align:middle line:84%
that tells the reader
using shoulder and circle

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:14.100 align:middle line:84%
to look toward the
horizon between the hill--

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How genius, to make
sure you're aligned perfectly.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:21.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: So the
book pictures a young boy

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:25.250 align:middle line:84%
who, I believe, was one
of the rancher's kids

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:29.370 align:middle line:84%
putting his head in the circle
and looking toward the horizon.

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And then we see
the sun coming up.

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And this alignment
has been documented

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:41.560 align:middle line:84%
by keen Scott Monahan, who's
site, archaeoastronomy.com, has

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.810 align:middle line:84%
actual videos of this
alignment as well as some

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:46.650 align:middle line:90%
of the imagery of Crack Cave.

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:48.570 align:middle line:84%
So, in addition
to the alignment,

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:51.690 align:middle line:84%
we find, again,
Ogham inscriptions

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:53.690 align:middle line:84%
talking about the
harvest festival,

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:57.180 align:middle line:84%
talking about a time
for summer sports--

00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:01.470 align:middle line:84%
again, Ogham that can be
read in a Celtic language.

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:07.520 align:middle line:84%
So, in these three
sites, sunrise equinox

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:11.570 align:middle line:84%
alignment at Crack Cave, the
equinox alignments at Anubis

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:15.720 align:middle line:84%
Cave, and then the cross-quarter
day alignment of Lughnasa

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:21.500 align:middle line:84%
at Sun Temple, we have some of
the greatest examples of proof

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.310 align:middle line:84%
that the Celts were
here and made it

00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:27.690 align:middle line:84%
to the interior leaving
not only their language

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:33.940 align:middle line:84%
and their imagery but their
cosmology for this generation

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:38.630 align:middle line:84%
and future generations to
learn from if we preserve it.

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:40.694 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And if
we acknowledge it.

00:13:40.694 --> 00:13:41.590 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLE]

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:44.040 align:middle line:84%
If we preserve it and-- I
mean, as I'm listening to you,

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:47.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, wow, this brings
up an entirely new industry.

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:50.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, parents throwing their
kids in the four-wheel drive

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:53.090 align:middle line:84%
and starting to search
these amazing sites.

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:55.782 align:middle line:84%
Now, are most of
them accessible?

00:13:55.782 --> 00:13:56.490 align:middle line:90%
If someone's in--

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:57.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: No,
they really aren't.

00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:57.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:58.923 align:middle line:90%
See, now, that's a bummer.

00:13:58.923 --> 00:14:00.400 align:middle line:90%
I was thinking--

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:04.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: Now, part
of it is that we all

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:09.500 align:middle line:84%
walk a very thin line because we
have to preserve the heritage.

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.280 align:middle line:90%
We have to preserve these sites.

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:16.300 align:middle line:84%
So many of the sites,
certainly the ones that

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.130 align:middle line:84%
weren't on public
lands, I did my best

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:19.890 align:middle line:90%
not to reveal where they are.

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:22.560 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I've received
a lot of criticism

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:26.200 align:middle line:84%
from archaeologists for even
mentioning some of these sites.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And, although I don't mention
their name or their location,

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:32.100 align:middle line:84%
they're very critical of
me for bringing them up

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:35.257 align:middle line:84%
because they don't want
anyone there to destroy them--

00:14:35.257 --> 00:14:37.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, high praise
to you for doing this.

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:37.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LEHRBURGER: Yes.

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:39.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's an important
part of our history.

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And we hope that the thrust
of this work and all the work

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:48.210 align:middle line:84%
by diffusionists really is aimed
at preservation, preserving

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:50.930 align:middle line:84%
this for future
generations because,

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:54.570 align:middle line:84%
as extensive as the research
that Bill McGlone and Phil

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:56.325 align:middle line:84%
Leonard did it at
Anubis Caves, there

00:14:56.325 --> 00:14:57.700 align:middle line:90%
is more discoveries there.

00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And until we get
epigraphers, archaeologists,

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:07.700 align:middle line:84%
anthropologists,
archaeoastronomers

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:10.700 align:middle line:84%
to acknowledge the
importance of these sites

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:14.570 align:middle line:84%
and continue the research
of these pioneers,

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:16.850 align:middle line:84%
we are, as you say,
going to continue

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:19.860 align:middle line:84%
to be in the dark
about our own history

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:23.080 align:middle line:84%
and understanding who
was the first explorers,

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:24.330 align:middle line:90%
and what were they doing here?

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:25.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
right now, we've just

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:26.410 align:middle line:90%
been talking about the Celts.

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And we're about to end our Ogham
trail journey, so to speak.

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:34.010 align:middle line:84%
And now when we get over to the
West, to California and Nevada,

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:36.740 align:middle line:84%
it says here that
that is the largest

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:39.930 align:middle line:84%
repository of ancient
petroglyphs in the world,

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:43.330 align:middle line:84%
is happening between
California and Nevada.

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:46.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's talk about that
and some of the cultures

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:48.260 align:middle line:90%
we'll be represented there.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: Well, we're
talking about the Great Basin.

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:56.370 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that moderns
have a hard time grasping

00:15:56.370 --> 00:16:00.270 align:middle line:84%
is not only the capabilities
of the ancients--

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:02.470 align:middle line:84%
because, you know,
they're savages--

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:04.840 align:middle line:90%
but the lay of the land.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And, thousands of years ago
when this history was unfolding,

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:15.000 align:middle line:84%
the American West looked very
different than it does now.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.700 align:middle line:84%
Now we have a lot of
desert, like Nevada

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:20.190 align:middle line:90%
is just almost all desert.

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:24.560 align:middle line:84%
But, going back 2,000 years
ago and 3,000 years ago,

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.097 align:middle line:84%
a good part, if not most,
of Nevada was lakes--

00:16:27.097 --> 00:16:27.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:27.980 align:middle line:90%
This is important.

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:29.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: --and
the oceans and really

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:36.650 align:middle line:84%
were much more accessible
and much closer to Las Vegas,

00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:37.560 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:43.310 align:middle line:84%
So it was a much more
greener environment.

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:43.810 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:45.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There are
petrified forests.

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:47.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LEHRBURGER: Well, there are--

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.859 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
green, evergreen.

00:16:49.859 --> 00:16:51.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: Well,
there were lakes.

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:52.191 align:middle line:90%
There were forests.

00:16:52.191 --> 00:16:53.730 align:middle line:90%
There was an abundance of game.

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And, accompanying that,
there was an abundance

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:01.030 align:middle line:84%
of different cultures that
lived in the Great Basin

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:06.540 align:middle line:84%
because, unlike today,
those were great times.

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:12.869 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of game, and
it was a very great place

00:17:12.869 --> 00:17:13.660 align:middle line:90%
for habitation.

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:17.560 align:middle line:84%
So you have many, many
different thousands

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:22.150 align:middle line:84%
of different sites in the
Great Basin that were occupied,

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:25.920 align:middle line:84%
and these ancient cultures
left their petroglyphs.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:29.670 align:middle line:84%
This would be an important
time to make the point

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:33.950 align:middle line:84%
that, while there are
thousands of petroglyph sites

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:36.510 align:middle line:84%
and, perhaps,
hundreds of thousands

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:39.640 align:middle line:84%
or millions of petroglyphs,
nearly all of these,

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.040 align:middle line:84%
we believe, were
done by the ancestors

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.740 align:middle line:90%
to the Native Americans.

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:46.650 align:middle line:84%
It's very rare to
come across instances

00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:50.080 align:middle line:84%
like we've described with Crack
Cave, Anubis Cave, and the Sun

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:54.540 align:middle line:84%
Temple where we have a very
clear connection to the Old

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:57.000 align:middle line:84%
World through the
writing, or the epigraphy,

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.050 align:middle line:84%
or through the symbols
represented in the stone.

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:03.350 align:middle line:84%
So let's be clear
from the outset

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:07.630 align:middle line:84%
that most of the Great
Basin petroglyphs are--

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:08.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Are Native American.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.588 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: --from
the Native American.

00:18:10.588 --> 00:18:11.490 align:middle line:90%
However--

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:13.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about Mojave North.

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:15.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LEHRBURGER: Yes.

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:17.490 align:middle line:84%
Encoded in these
petroglyphs, though,

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:22.460 align:middle line:84%
are some ancient traditions
that some probably

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:25.810 align:middle line:84%
did come from
transpacific cultures.

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And I've previously noted
an example of the swastika

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:32.670 align:middle line:84%
as a symbol that it
has come down to some

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:34.260 align:middle line:90%
of the Native American tribes.

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:37.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is an ancient,
ancient symbol from India.

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:43.070 align:middle line:84%
So, through diffusion, we
find some of the symbols.

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:48.920 align:middle line:84%
Through diffusion, we find
actual words from Afghanistan,

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:53.090 align:middle line:84%
and Indo-Turkey, and some of
the Native American tribes.

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:59.120 align:middle line:84%
But the clearest example
of a transpacific culture

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:02.960 align:middle line:84%
that left their mark
in stone that I've

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.680 align:middle line:84%
come across and
documented in the book

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:09.810 align:middle line:84%
is at a site on the eastern
Sierras in central California

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:12.140 align:middle line:90%
that I call Mojave North.

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:18.800 align:middle line:84%
And I named it that because
it's part of the Mojave Desert,

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:22.610 align:middle line:84%
but that I sought to disguise
its location because the site

00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:25.590 align:middle line:90%
is so vulnerable to damage.

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:28.330 align:middle line:84%
Just about every
petroglyph has some damage.

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:31.540 align:middle line:84%
30% of the petroglyphs
have been destroyed.

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:36.190 align:middle line:84%
And it is in dire
need of protection.

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And this particular site has
been cited as a typical Great

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:47.170 align:middle line:84%
Basin petroglyph site, that
is, by the archaeologist who

00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:49.840 align:middle line:84%
claimed it along with
the Native Americans,

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:53.250 align:middle line:84%
that Mojave North petroglyphs
were created by the ancestors

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:54.800 align:middle line:90%
to the Native Americans.

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:59.780 align:middle line:84%
However, what a colleague,
Dorian Taddei, and myself

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:03.050 align:middle line:84%
have discovered is
that this is probably

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:06.370 align:middle line:84%
the clearest evidence of
a greater Indus Valley

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:10.950 align:middle line:90%
presence in North America.

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And we can surmise that they
came to the California coast

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:19.810 align:middle line:84%
and then hiked inland as
part of a mining expedition

00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:21.410 align:middle line:90%
because, of course, the gold--

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:22.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:22.880 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.740 align:middle line:84%
Which was very necessary
to their culture.

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:28.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: Certainly,
these are big expeditions.

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps the
earlier ones were even

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:35.390 align:middle line:84%
accompanied by elephants that
they brought along with them.

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:37.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to
get into that in a minute.

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:41.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: But Mojave
North is a remarkable site.

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:45.420 align:middle line:84%
We've documented at least
13 different alignments

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:49.140 align:middle line:84%
that occur on the
equinoxes, on the solstices,

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:50.690 align:middle line:90%
on the cross-quarter days.

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:55.000 align:middle line:84%
And we've even documented
some very sophisticated lunar

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.130 align:middle line:84%
alignments that were
likely used to predict

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:07.710 align:middle line:84%
the different calendars
of the chakra cycle

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:10.450 align:middle line:84%
and the saros cycle, which were
important to the Indus Valley

00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:11.300 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:18.640 align:middle line:84%
And so this all is found in
a very compact, less than one

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:19.920 align:middle line:90%
acre, site.

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:23.210 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, there is a
lot of damage to the site.

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And most of the
petroglyphs are not

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:31.060 align:middle line:84%
able to even be read
throughout most of the day

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.380 align:middle line:84%
because they are
so worn or damaged.

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:36.750 align:middle line:84%
However, the remarkable
aspects of this site

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:41.880 align:middle line:84%
include a cross-quarter
day alignment

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:47.510 align:middle line:84%
that we find a character
very akin to Lugh

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:52.440 align:middle line:84%
or, perhaps, Hercules that
is part of a animation that

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:56.970 align:middle line:84%
documents both the
fertility of the god

00:21:56.970 --> 00:21:59.560 align:middle line:84%
on the feminine
cross-quarter days.

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:03.060 align:middle line:84%
That is Samhain, which
has now come down

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:07.300 align:middle line:84%
to us as Halloween or
Imbolc-- I should say,

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:10.920 align:middle line:84%
and Imbolc-- which is the
celebration of the Celtic

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:12.260 align:middle line:90%
goddess Brigid.

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:17.830 align:middle line:84%
But the same image,
this god-like character

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:21.980 align:middle line:84%
that resembles Lugh,
also has a alignment

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:24.700 align:middle line:84%
on the masculine
cross-quarter days,

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:27.290 align:middle line:90%
which is Beltane and Lughnasa.

00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:32.460 align:middle line:84%
So the same god-like character
has two different alignments

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:35.480 align:middle line:84%
on it, one representing
the fertility

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:38.000 align:middle line:84%
for the cross-quarter
days of the feminine

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.420 align:middle line:84%
and the other
alignment representing

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:44.450 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual
evolution of the deity

00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:47.950 align:middle line:84%
on the masculine
cross-quarter days.

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:52.610 align:middle line:84%
So this is among some
of the amazing rock art

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:55.610 align:middle line:84%
and petroglyphs that
were left at this site.

00:22:55.610 --> 00:23:00.110 align:middle line:84%
Another, I think, noteworthy
alignment of Mojave North

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:04.900 align:middle line:84%
is a series of concentric
circles on a rock.

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And, on the equinox
as the sun comes up,

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:13.850 align:middle line:84%
we have a light dagger or an
image of a serpent in light

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:14.410 align:middle line:90%
that--

00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:14.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:15.553 align:middle line:90%
I like these images.

00:23:15.553 --> 00:23:16.374 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:16.374 --> 00:23:18.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: --by a
kind of light and shadow.

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And, through the first
hour as the sun comes up,

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:27.940 align:middle line:84%
this light serpent, if you
will, moves across the rock art

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:28.750 align:middle line:90%
panel.

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And, as it's open jaws approach
the concentric circles,

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:38.600 align:middle line:84%
it literally encompasses
the inner circle

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:42.720 align:middle line:84%
on the day of the equinox,
representing a serpent

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.260 align:middle line:90%
engulfing an egg or a disk.

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:49.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, why this is so important is
because we have the exact same

00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:53.090 align:middle line:84%
imagery at The
Great Serpent Mound,

00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:55.510 align:middle line:84%
the largest earthwork
in North America,

00:23:55.510 --> 00:24:00.570 align:middle line:84%
where we have over 1,000-foot
long serpent three feet high,

00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:02.410 align:middle line:90%
20 feet wide.

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:06.440 align:middle line:84%
And what is in the mouth of
this giant earthwork serpent?

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:07.110 align:middle line:90%
A disk.

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:09.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
located where?

00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:11.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LEHRBURGER: In Ohio.

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:11.980 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:13.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting, yes.

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:13.890 align:middle line:90%


00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:15.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: --at
a different time,

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:17.720 align:middle line:84%
but we have a petroglyphic
image in California.

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:20.430 align:middle line:84%
And then, at the
Serpent Mound, we

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:25.110 align:middle line:84%
have a monumental image
of the same serpent

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:27.020 align:middle line:90%
with a disk in its mouth.

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:29.540 align:middle line:10%
So, again, here we
can begin to see

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:34.910 align:middle line:10%
how, perhaps, diffusion
of these stories and myths

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:37.180 align:middle line:10%
go throughout the Americas.

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:40.769 align:middle line:84%
And this brings up another
very important point

00:24:40.769 --> 00:24:41.560 align:middle line:90%
about diffusionism.

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:46.550 align:middle line:84%
And it is encompassed in the
term called hermetic drift.

00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:48.470 align:middle line:84%
And the concept
of hermetic drift

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:53.070 align:middle line:84%
is that originally some of
these symbols-- for example,

00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:59.300 align:middle line:84%
the swastika-- arrived in
the Americas from Egypt.

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:04.380 align:middle line:84%
But, as time goes on and the
Old World peoples are no longer

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:08.110 align:middle line:84%
here, the ancestors to
the Native Americans

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:10.230 align:middle line:90%
continue using these symbols.

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And, even though the
symbols may stay the same,

00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:16.650 align:middle line:84%
the concept behind
them begins to drift.

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:20.990 align:middle line:84%
And some of the ancient
meanings may have been altered.

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:23.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and I
think a lot of our viewers

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:26.900 align:middle line:84%
are already aware of
the loot, essentially

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:29.010 align:middle line:84%
that was found-- the
Egyptian artifacts-- that

00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:30.760 align:middle line:84%
were found in the Grand
Canyon at the turn

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:31.850 align:middle line:90%
of the last century.

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:33.720 align:middle line:84%
So we have a little
understanding

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:37.540 align:middle line:84%
that this was a not very
accessible cave either

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:39.090 align:middle line:84%
where these
artifacts were found.

00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:41.852 align:middle line:84%
So somehow these things
were spirited away long ago,

00:25:41.852 --> 00:25:43.560 align:middle line:84%
and then they've since
been spirited away

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:45.900 align:middle line:84%
by some of our
esteemed institutions

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:47.885 align:middle line:84%
and are denied their
existence at all.

00:25:47.885 --> 00:25:49.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: Well, that's
part of the great cover-up.

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:51.038 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
the great cover-up,

00:25:51.038 --> 00:25:53.300 align:middle line:84%
so we know Egyptian
stuff was here.

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:55.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, going again to
the Indus Valley,

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:58.340 align:middle line:90%
what about the Shiva stone?

00:25:58.340 --> 00:25:59.910 align:middle line:84%
At full moon
rising, you have lot

00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:01.364 align:middle line:90%
of wonderful imagery of this.

00:26:01.364 --> 00:26:02.280 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:04.540 align:middle line:90%
And that's Mojave North II?

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:06.384 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: No,
it's the same side.

00:26:06.384 --> 00:26:08.330 align:middle line:90%
This is a very compact site.

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And we must begin
the story by talking

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:15.020 align:middle line:90%
about what a Shiva linga is.

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And this is usually
a representative

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:26.580 align:middle line:84%
of the male power in
the form of a phallus.

00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:28.990 align:middle line:84%
But most Shiva
lingas also integrate

00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:32.610 align:middle line:84%
the power of the feminine
in the form of a basin.

00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:34.502 align:middle line:84%
So, throughout
India, there are--

00:26:34.502 --> 00:26:35.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, when
you go to-- yes.

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:36.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER:
--tens of thousands

00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:37.804 align:middle line:90%
of Shiva lingas everywhere.

00:26:37.804 --> 00:26:39.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And, in the
afternoon, they do the rights,

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:42.790 align:middle line:84%
and the milk pouring in,
and it's quite a ceremony.

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:45.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: Well, in
the center of Mojave North

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:55.510 align:middle line:84%
is a stone complex that is very
akin to a giant Shiva linga.

00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:58.270 align:middle line:90%
It has a very warm basin in it.

00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:00.770 align:middle line:90%
And it is in a prominent place.

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:03.950 align:middle line:84%
It actually has a
rock in front of it

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:07.260 align:middle line:84%
that could actually be
visualized as being testicles.

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:10.450 align:middle line:84%
It is so obvious that
nobody's ever really seen it

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:17.670 align:middle line:84%
until Dorian Taddei, about five
or six years ago, noted it.

00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:21.270 align:middle line:84%
And I concur that
there's a central Shiva

00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:26.520 align:middle line:84%
linga at this site surrounded by
numerous different petroglyphic

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:32.040 align:middle line:84%
panels that some of them
deal with these alignments,

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:36.040 align:middle line:84%
but others seem to be maps or,
perhaps, alchemetical formulas.

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:37.380 align:middle line:90%
So there's a huge--

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:39.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is there any
script accompanying this?

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:43.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: There are scripts,
but they're very controversial.

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:48.310 align:middle line:84%
Barry Fell waded in on
this particular site,

00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:52.280 align:middle line:84%
claiming that one of the
scripts was Arabic Kufic.

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:53.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:55.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: I've
kind of researched that

00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:57.010 align:middle line:90%
and described in the book.

00:27:57.010 --> 00:28:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And I believe this is where
one of the mistakes Barry made.

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:03.630 align:middle line:84%
First of all, he
didn't visit the site,

00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:06.940 align:middle line:84%
and he was relying on
drawings and photographs

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:08.450 align:middle line:90%
from other researchers.

00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And he was taking
different photographs

00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:14.260 align:middle line:84%
and putting them
into a composite.

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:21.160 align:middle line:84%
So I seriously doubt that the
main epigraphy at the site

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:22.460 align:middle line:90%
is Kufic.

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:25.960 align:middle line:84%
Dorian Taddei, a
co-collaborator,

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:29.020 align:middle line:84%
has researched it and claims
that it's ancient Samaritan.

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:32.930 align:middle line:84%
That is, the Samaritan
of the Northern Kingdom--

00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:35.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we can
see the images of this.

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:36.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER:
However, this has been

00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:38.840 align:middle line:90%
disputed by Samaritan scholars.

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.890 align:middle line:84%
However, the Samaritan
scholars, for the most part,

00:28:41.890 --> 00:28:45.290 align:middle line:84%
are not familiar with this
Proto-Hebrew non-block

00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:46.100 align:middle line:90%
lettering.

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:51.840 align:middle line:84%
So I still think there is a very
good indication that, in fact,

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.500 align:middle line:90%
this is ancient Samaritan.

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:59.310 align:middle line:84%
But this really
encourages us to note that

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:01.530 align:middle line:84%
without professional
archaeologists,

00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:03.180 align:middle line:84%
without professional
epigraphers,

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:06.280 align:middle line:84%
and anthropologists who
are willing to come,

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.590 align:middle line:84%
willing to look at,
willing to research,

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:12.180 align:middle line:84%
willing to say what it is
and what it isn't, we're

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:16.140 align:middle line:84%
not going to be able to
conclusively say what it is.

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:21.990 align:middle line:84%
So part of the new history
for America is calling forth

00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:29.010 align:middle line:84%
fair-minded evaluation of these
sites that seem to show the Old

00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:31.720 align:middle line:84%
World peoples from both the
Atlantic and the Pacific

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:32.570 align:middle line:90%
were here.

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And, until we can
get the professionals

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:37.180 align:middle line:84%
to take the blinders
off and to have

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:40.760 align:middle line:84%
a fair-minded
investigation, they're

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:44.330 align:middle line:84%
going to continue to dispute
the Old World origins

00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:45.250 align:middle line:90%
of these sites.

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:46.625 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
and they're going

00:29:46.625 --> 00:29:49.090 align:middle line:84%
to have problems with things
like depictions of elephants.

00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:51.510 align:middle line:84%
So let's go back to
that image for a moment.

00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:55.320 align:middle line:84%
So we touched on it
for just a moment.

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:59.217 align:middle line:84%
How do you suppose
elephants landed in America?

00:29:59.217 --> 00:30:00.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LEHRBURGER: Well--

00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:01.425 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
quite a journey.

00:30:01.425 --> 00:30:02.922 align:middle line:90%


00:30:02.922 --> 00:30:05.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: The motif
of an elephant in America

00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:09.210 align:middle line:84%
is not unique to this
particular discussion.

00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And Gunnar Thompson
and many others

00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:15.330 align:middle line:84%
have noted the elephant
motif in Central America

00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:17.620 align:middle line:90%
in Mayan sculptures.

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:21.200 align:middle line:84%
But at a site known as
Crimes Point, Nevada,

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:24.240 align:middle line:84%
which is certainly one of
the older petroglyphic sites

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:27.330 align:middle line:84%
in North America going back
at least 5,000, or 6,000,

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:33.270 align:middle line:84%
or 7,000 years ago, we
find a very worn imagery.

00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And one of these images is
a elephant with a rider.

00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:41.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, the elephant is
not depicted with tusks,

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:47.033 align:middle line:84%
so we can surmise that
it's a Indian elephant, not

00:30:47.033 --> 00:30:50.840 align:middle line:90%
a elephant from Africa.

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:55.040 align:middle line:84%
But it begs the question, what
were elephants doing here,

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:57.304 align:middle line:90%
and who drew the petroglyphs?

00:30:57.304 --> 00:30:57.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:57.970 --> 00:31:03.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: So our theory
is that these ancient miners

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:07.030 align:middle line:84%
from Indus Valley or
Indo-Turkey-- what is now

00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:12.980 align:middle line:84%
Afghanistan and Turkey-- they
arrived on the California coast

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:15.750 align:middle line:90%
as part of mining expeditions.

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:21.820 align:middle line:84%
And they needed elephants
as part of their entourage

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:23.930 align:middle line:90%
to do the heavy lifting.

00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:28.540 align:middle line:84%
This goes back to the
story of the Columbus ships

00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:30.962 align:middle line:84%
and how relatively small
and primitive they were.

00:31:30.962 --> 00:31:32.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These required
a veritable ark.

00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:35.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LEHRBURGER: That's correct.

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:38.040 align:middle line:84%
These ancient ships, they
were not little, dinky ships

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:39.580 align:middle line:90%
that held 30 or 40 people.

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:43.390 align:middle line:84%
No, they have
hundreds of people.

00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:49.650 align:middle line:84%
And these ships from the
East were noted as recently

00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:52.850 align:middle line:84%
by Marco Polo as being able
to carry hundreds of people.

00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:55.900 align:middle line:84%
But, certainly, these
mining expedition ships

00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:59.190 align:middle line:84%
that used the ocean currents
to arrive in America

00:31:59.190 --> 00:32:05.350 align:middle line:84%
probably timed with lunar
cycles, and with the equinoxes,

00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:10.480 align:middle line:84%
and the solstices
for their journey

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:13.880 align:middle line:84%
incorporated giant
expeditions and giant ships

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:17.520 align:middle line:84%
and probably included some
elephants in those expeditions.

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:22.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the structures
in the Indus Valley date back,

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:24.599 align:middle line:84%
I think, reasonably
about 10,000 years?

00:32:24.599 --> 00:32:25.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LEHRBURGER: They go way back.

00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:27.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, how
far back do you

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:31.390 align:middle line:84%
think their travels may
have dated, in terms of some

00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:32.550 align:middle line:90%
of what we're seeing here?

00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:35.040 align:middle line:84%
You said maybe several
thousand years.

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:36.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LEHRBURGER: Well, I--

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:36.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I
know it's tricky.

00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:38.040 align:middle line:90%
Dating is tricky.

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:40.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: Dating
these objects is probably

00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:45.490 align:middle line:84%
the most controversial area
of diffusionist research.

00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:46.055 align:middle line:90%
And, again--

00:32:46.055 --> 00:32:48.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But is it possible
it's several, several thousand

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:49.420 align:middle line:90%
years?

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:51.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LEHRBURGER: Oh, many.

00:32:51.510 --> 00:32:58.670 align:middle line:84%
I think that the imagery
that we see in Mojave North

00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:02.570 align:middle line:84%
is at least 1,000, if not 2,000,
years before the imagery we

00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:04.800 align:middle line:84%
see at Crack Cave
and Anubis Caves,

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:08.460 align:middle line:84%
which would put it back at
least 3,000 or 4,000 years.

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:13.580 align:middle line:84%
So, until we really have more
scientific dating methods,

00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:15.710 align:middle line:84%
and until we really
bring in professionals

00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:18.710 align:middle line:84%
to debate, discover,
and investigate,

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:21.360 align:middle line:84%
we're really not going to
be able to pin it down.

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:25.910 align:middle line:84%
But, clearly, these are
many, 3,000, 4,000 years

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:27.550 align:middle line:90%
before Columbus.

00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:28.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:31.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're going to the Red
Canyon and the Standing Man

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:35.180 align:middle line:84%
petroglyph now, which is very
similar to the Pathfinder

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:37.630 align:middle line:90%
glyphs that are in Colorado.

00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:40.060 align:middle line:84%
So tell us about what
we're seeing here.

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:43.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: Well, this
particular petroglyph

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:51.710 align:middle line:84%
comes from Little Petroglyph
Canyon in California,

00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:53.960 align:middle line:84%
in the Great Basin
of California.

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And it is not
necessarily-- we don't

00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:01.040 align:middle line:84%
want to say it's necessarily
from the Old World.

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:04.120 align:middle line:84%
It's quite likely and probable
that most of the glyphs

00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:08.699 align:middle line:84%
and the extensive petroglyphs
in Little Petroglyph Canyon

00:34:08.699 --> 00:34:12.989 align:middle line:84%
are all from the ancestors
to the Native Americans.

00:34:12.989 --> 00:34:15.659 align:middle line:84%
But what we do see in
some of the imagery

00:34:15.659 --> 00:34:20.909 align:middle line:84%
is similarities to symbols that
we do find in the Old World

00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:24.550 align:middle line:84%
and, perhaps, some
of the cosmologies

00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:26.449 align:middle line:90%
that we find in the Old World.

00:34:26.449 --> 00:34:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And one of these is a
petroglyph of a very large

00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:33.679 align:middle line:84%
anthropomorphic man, a
stick-like character,

00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:38.639 align:middle line:84%
that I would describe as
very similar to da Vinci's

00:34:38.639 --> 00:34:39.969 align:middle line:90%
divine man.

00:34:39.969 --> 00:34:43.170 align:middle line:84%
He's standing with his
arms stretched out.

00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And I was fortunate
enough to be there

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:49.449 align:middle line:84%
at noon on an equinox
looking at this

00:34:49.449 --> 00:34:55.070 align:middle line:84%
and noticed that the
outstretched arms were holding

00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:57.990 align:middle line:84%
a triangle of light
that came to the point

00:34:57.990 --> 00:35:00.530 align:middle line:90%
of the anthropomorph's head.

00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:04.810 align:middle line:84%
So literally on the equinox
what the symbology is telling

00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:08.150 align:middle line:84%
us is that the perfect
balance of holding

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:10.590 align:middle line:84%
that triangle, that
symbol of the divine,

00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:13.380 align:middle line:84%
kind of the outstretched
arms like this.

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:16.360 align:middle line:84%
And it was so precise that
the fingers themselves

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:18.950 align:middle line:84%
were counting marks, so
that you could actually,

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:21.059 align:middle line:84%
again, like many of
these ancient calendars--

00:35:21.059 --> 00:35:22.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Count the days.

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:22.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LEHRBURGER: --count the days.

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:23.503 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:35:23.503 --> 00:35:26.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: Now, when I was
there and looking at this,

00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:29.460 align:middle line:84%
I only noticed this
particular petroglyph,

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:32.190 align:middle line:90%
which was the masculine deity.

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:35.920 align:middle line:84%
But when I got back home,
and I looked at my film

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:40.000 align:middle line:84%
and photographs, I was able to
see behind it a feminine glyph

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.160 align:middle line:84%
that was very
descriptive of fertility

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:48.170 align:middle line:84%
and of almost
insemination, very similar

00:35:48.170 --> 00:35:53.440 align:middle line:84%
to what we see at the Pathfinder
site with a dagger of light

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:55.847 align:middle line:90%
inseminating a first mother.

00:35:55.847 --> 00:35:56.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:59.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: And we see
that same kind of imagery.

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:04.300 align:middle line:84%
And this reinforces the
notion of the divine feminine

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:07.050 align:middle line:84%
as well as the
divine masculine that

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:10.200 align:middle line:84%
was included and
integrated into whether it

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:15.610 align:middle line:84%
be the ancient Native
Americans or the ancients

00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:19.020 align:middle line:84%
who came from across the
Pacific and Atlantic.

00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:22.214 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, certainly one
of the more revered glyphs,

00:36:22.214 --> 00:36:24.630 align:middle line:84%
definitely in the southwestern
part of the United States--

00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:27.490 align:middle line:84%
you can find them everywhere
in Sedona-- is Kokopelli.

00:36:27.490 --> 00:36:29.799 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
story of Kokopelli.

00:36:29.799 --> 00:36:31.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: Well,
as you point out,

00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:34.440 align:middle line:84%
the Kokopelli is one of
the most common glyphs

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:37.030 align:middle line:84%
throughout certainly
the Great Basin.

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And it has been adopted
by the Native Americans

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:45.660 align:middle line:84%
as, I guess you would
say, a fertility glyph,

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:49.980 align:middle line:84%
as a fertility deity that is
represented by what people

00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:54.040 align:middle line:84%
think is a flute is often
represented as a hunchback

00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:59.090 align:middle line:84%
man or a hunchback grasshopper
with a sack on its back.

00:36:59.090 --> 00:37:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And the Native
American myths talk

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:04.520 align:middle line:84%
about Kokopelli
coming to the tribe,

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:09.270 align:middle line:84%
and spreading seeds, and
playing music, and getting

00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:10.362 align:middle line:90%
the women pregnant--

00:37:10.362 --> 00:37:12.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where
did he come from?

00:37:12.130 --> 00:37:17.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: Well, we
today can't say for sure

00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:19.310 align:middle line:90%
where Kokopelli comes from.

00:37:19.310 --> 00:37:22.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But like Quetzalcoatl
and other deified beings,

00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:26.220 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, they came
from supposedly elsewhere

00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:29.690 align:middle line:84%
and seeded them-- no pun
intended-- with knowledge seeds

00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:30.792 align:middle line:90%
and so forth, right?

00:37:30.792 --> 00:37:32.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: Well,
Dennis Matlock,

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:35.420 align:middle line:84%
in his book, "India
Once Ruled America,"

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:38.080 align:middle line:84%
he notes the
similarity of Kokopelli

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:42.680 align:middle line:84%
with a fertility god
of India, Kubera,

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:44.510 align:middle line:90%
and their very similar aspects.

00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And he makes the connection
between the Indus Valley god

00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:52.710 align:middle line:90%
and coming to America.

00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:58.210 align:middle line:84%
My colleague, Dorian
Taddei, makes the point

00:37:58.210 --> 00:38:01.980 align:middle line:84%
that what is considered to
be a flute by just about

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:04.220 align:middle line:84%
everyone-- that Kokopelli
is playing a flute--

00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:11.880 align:middle line:84%
is, in fact, a blowpipe used to
heat up fires for metallurgy.

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:14.460 align:middle line:84%
And so he talks about
Kokopelli as being

00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:19.150 align:middle line:90%
kind of the god of the miners.

00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:22.240 align:middle line:84%
What we can say is
consistent with the notion

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:26.210 align:middle line:84%
of hermetic drift where we
have a symbol, a petroglyph,

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:29.510 align:middle line:84%
or a story show up
as it's repeated

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:31.430 align:middle line:90%
from generation to generation.

00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:33.740 align:middle line:90%
The symbol may remain the same.

00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:38.130 align:middle line:84%
However, the understanding
of what it originally

00:38:38.130 --> 00:38:44.000 align:middle line:84%
was is not-- I believe that
the Kokopelli imagery is really

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.840 align:middle line:84%
the story of the
sun god as he makes

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:50.060 align:middle line:90%
his journey around the world.

00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:54.160 align:middle line:84%
So we all have a different
take on Kokopelli.

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:58.830 align:middle line:84%
Many diffusionists could argue
that it comes from India,

00:38:58.830 --> 00:39:03.280 align:middle line:84%
but it's not really something
we can document as clearly as we

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:06.160 align:middle line:84%
can, for example, a
symbol like the swastika

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:11.210 align:middle line:84%
or the many symbols from
Mesoamerica and the Mayans

00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:14.517 align:middle line:84%
that seem to have an
origin in Asia and China.

00:39:14.517 --> 00:39:15.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:19.307 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to get to that
toward the end of this hour,

00:39:19.307 --> 00:39:20.140 align:middle line:90%
as a matter of fact.

00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:21.640 align:middle line:84%
But, first, let's
go to the Midwest,

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:23.182 align:middle line:84%
and we want to go
to Monks Mound.

00:39:23.182 --> 00:39:23.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LEHRBURGER: Oh.

00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:25.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
quite anomalous.

00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:26.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LEHRBURGER: Yes.

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:26.940 align:middle line:90%
And this is--

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:29.074 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
this is massive.

00:39:29.074 --> 00:39:30.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: More
material than it took

00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:33.550 align:middle line:90%
to build the Great Pyramid.

00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:37.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And, yet, most
no one's heard of it.

00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: Well, again,
it's something that's

00:39:40.890 --> 00:39:43.250 align:middle line:90%
a mystery about our history.

00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:45.880 align:middle line:84%
I think we can talk
about how America has

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:48.304 align:middle line:90%
become a historical Society.

00:39:48.304 --> 00:39:49.720 align:middle line:84%
It's like we're
so in the present,

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:55.014 align:middle line:84%
and we're so into making
money and advancing that we

00:39:55.014 --> 00:39:56.180 align:middle line:90%
kind of have lost sight of--

00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:59.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You'd think this
would be a major tourist site.

00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:03.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: And it really
is, relatively speaking,

00:40:03.590 --> 00:40:04.830 align:middle line:90%
to some of the history.

00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:08.670 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think we
want to suggest that

00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:10.429 align:middle line:84%
and Old World
culture built that.

00:40:10.429 --> 00:40:10.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:12.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm just saying what is this?

00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:16.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: This
is a monument that

00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:21.700 align:middle line:84%
is the scope of the size
of some of the largest

00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:24.570 align:middle line:84%
pyramids from Israel
America and from Egypt.

00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:29.590 align:middle line:84%
It reinforces the notion
of the organization

00:40:29.590 --> 00:40:32.300 align:middle line:84%
of a highly advanced
civilization that

00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:38.860 align:middle line:84%
was able to put together
not only the labor force

00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:44.040 align:middle line:84%
but have the building
skills to construct

00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:47.460 align:middle line:84%
something so significant
that still is here today.

00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:51.450 align:middle line:84%
We do think that
the top of the mound

00:40:51.450 --> 00:40:56.740 align:middle line:84%
had an archaeoastronomical
alignment associated with it.

00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:58.170 align:middle line:90%
There's still posts there.

00:40:58.170 --> 00:41:03.720 align:middle line:84%
But these all go back to the
mysteries of our history.

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:08.170 align:middle line:84%
This is probably one of the
center of a civilization.

00:41:08.170 --> 00:41:10.424 align:middle line:84%
And it still stands
today for us to explore.

00:41:10.424 --> 00:41:12.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What are some of
the artifacts surrounding

00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:14.630 align:middle line:90%
that area, to give us some hint?

00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:17.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: These
are the mount people.

00:41:17.530 --> 00:41:20.150 align:middle line:84%
And for many, many
generations and

00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:24.550 align:middle line:84%
for many, many different
thousands of years,

00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:28.070 align:middle line:84%
we have different
generations of mound builders

00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:33.710 align:middle line:84%
that have built mounds and
had a significant culture

00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:36.860 align:middle line:84%
probably based on
agriculture that

00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:40.360 align:middle line:84%
spread out from the
Mississippi through

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:41.580 align:middle line:90%
the different tributaries.

00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:45.150 align:middle line:84%
So this is just part of
the remaining landscape

00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:49.570 align:middle line:84%
of our ancestors
in America, noting

00:41:49.570 --> 00:41:52.500 align:middle line:84%
that when this was built, there
was nothing like it in Europe.

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:56.280 align:middle line:84%
It was relatively
primitive in Europe

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:58.910 align:middle line:84%
compared to what was
going on in the New World.

00:41:58.910 --> 00:42:02.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And, back in that
part of the United States

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:05.180 align:middle line:84%
in the Midwest, there are a lot
of different kinds of mounds,

00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:06.781 align:middle line:90%
as well throughout.

00:42:06.781 --> 00:42:07.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LEHRBURGER: Yes.

00:42:07.530 --> 00:42:09.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Also,
there's some belief

00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:14.334 align:middle line:84%
that the ancient Hebrews built
some of the mounds in Ohio.

00:42:14.334 --> 00:42:15.000 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LEHRBURGER: Well, there is--

00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:20.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They discovered a
Ten Commandments stone, right?

00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:24.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: There
are indications

00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:28.570 align:middle line:84%
of a Hebrew presence
in the Midwest,

00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:33.030 align:middle line:84%
but I don't think anyone would
ascribe the Hebrews to building

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:34.320 align:middle line:90%
these mounds.

00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:39.770 align:middle line:84%
I would say that these were
really the native people who

00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:41.280 align:middle line:90%
built most of these amounts.

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:46.560 align:middle line:84%
But the question is, who
built the original ones,

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:48.650 align:middle line:84%
and what influence,
if any, do we

00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:50.140 align:middle line:90%
have from Old World cultures?

00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:52.479 align:middle line:90%


00:42:52.479 --> 00:42:54.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These are
built throughout Russia

00:42:54.270 --> 00:42:55.240 align:middle line:90%
and many other places.

00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:55.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LEHRBURGER: Yes.

00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:56.840 align:middle line:90%
It's not just here.

00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:57.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:42:57.550 --> 00:42:58.560 align:middle line:90%
Dolmens.

00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:00.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: So
when Cyrus Thomas,

00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:03.330 align:middle line:84%
who was one of the
first researchers

00:43:03.330 --> 00:43:07.110 align:middle line:84%
for the Smithsonian, and
undertook a exhaustive study

00:43:07.110 --> 00:43:13.160 align:middle line:84%
of the mounds under the
management of John Wesley

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:17.680 align:middle line:84%
Powell-- who was really
the first director

00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:19.620 align:middle line:84%
of the Smithsonian
at that time--

00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:25.310 align:middle line:84%
both Powell and Thomas
strongly believed

00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:28.410 align:middle line:84%
that all the mounds were
built by Native Americans.

00:43:28.410 --> 00:43:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And they both went on to
say in their own words that,

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:36.950 align:middle line:84%
even though artifacts
of European origin

00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:39.360 align:middle line:84%
were found in the mounds,
that they were not

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:41.840 align:middle line:84%
going to talk about
them or address them.

00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:45.730 align:middle line:84%
So we really find the
beginning of a cover-up

00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:48.500 align:middle line:84%
as early as the birth
of the Smithsonian.

00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:49.189 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:43:49.189 --> 00:43:50.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's where
I wanted to go next,

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:53.370 align:middle line:84%
is John Wesley-- we
started out with Columbus,

00:43:53.370 --> 00:43:57.500 align:middle line:84%
but John Wesley Powell has his
part in obscuring the story,

00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:58.427 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:43:58.427 --> 00:43:59.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LEHRBURGER: He certainly does.

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And, up to the point of
Thomas and John Wesley Powell,

00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:09.220 align:middle line:84%
because of the interest
in history by Americans,

00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:11.630 align:middle line:84%
by the farmers, by the
historical societies,

00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:14.820 align:middle line:84%
by the colonists, there
was a strong belief

00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:18.790 align:middle line:84%
that Old World peoples had
populated the Americas.

00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And this was right up to the
time of Thomas Jefferson who

00:44:23.490 --> 00:44:27.570 align:middle line:84%
instructed Lewis and Clark to
look for the remnants of Prince

00:44:27.570 --> 00:44:31.750 align:middle line:84%
Madoc, the Welsh prince
who was supposed to have

00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:34.600 align:middle line:90%
come to America in the 1100s.

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And, subsequently,
there has been

00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:42.250 align:middle line:84%
found evidence of what could
be some of his fortifications.

00:44:42.250 --> 00:44:46.730 align:middle line:84%
But Thomas Jefferson as well
as other colonists strongly

00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:49.710 align:middle line:84%
believed that the
history of America

00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:53.540 align:middle line:84%
included people
coming from Europe.

00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:58.650 align:middle line:84%
But, with the proclamation
by Cyrus Thomas

00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:03.470 align:middle line:84%
that of these European
artifacts found in the mounds,

00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:06.430 align:middle line:84%
we will not talk of
them, ever since then,

00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:09.270 align:middle line:84%
the archaeological
paradigm has been

00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:12.960 align:middle line:84%
that all the mounds were
built by Native Americans, end

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:14.070 align:middle line:90%
of story.

00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:17.300 align:middle line:84%
I think that there are
influences of the Old World

00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:23.000 align:middle line:84%
peoples that out of these
mounds have come relics that

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:28.900 align:middle line:84%
demonstrate a connection,
whether it be trade

00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:31.710 align:middle line:84%
or whether it be actual
the origins of these.

00:45:31.710 --> 00:45:34.640 align:middle line:90%
And this is part of that story.

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And it includes
some artifacts that

00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:45.690 align:middle line:84%
are attributed to the Hebrews,
including a decalogue stone

00:45:45.690 --> 00:45:49.770 align:middle line:84%
that has the Ten Commandments
on it as an artifact

00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:53.720 align:middle line:84%
and has a picture of what
is claimed to be Moses.

00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:57.750 align:middle line:84%
But, again, it's very
hard to verify these

00:45:57.750 --> 00:46:00.670 align:middle line:84%
as being legitimate
at this time.

00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And, until we get more
researchers involved,

00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:07.760 align:middle line:84%
and interested, and excited,
and willing to explore,

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:12.260 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be very
much of a mystery

00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:16.690 align:middle line:84%
of how much influence Old
World cultures had on the mound

00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:17.326 align:middle line:90%
builders.

00:46:17.326 --> 00:46:18.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we're
not done yet, OK?

00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:20.977 align:middle line:90%
Just a couple more here.

00:46:20.977 --> 00:46:22.560 align:middle line:84%
Speaking of the
Hebrews-- I mean there

00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:24.830 align:middle line:84%
was evidence in the
Bible, you wrote,

00:46:24.830 --> 00:46:27.950 align:middle line:84%
that as of almost
1,000 years BC,

00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:30.710 align:middle line:84%
they had the ability
to also navigate

00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:32.290 align:middle line:90%
the waters of the world.

00:46:32.290 --> 00:46:34.187 align:middle line:90%
They had ships.

00:46:34.187 --> 00:46:35.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LEHRBURGER: Well--

00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:37.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there
is this evidence

00:46:37.150 --> 00:46:38.830 align:middle line:84%
sprinkled throughout
the United States.

00:46:38.830 --> 00:46:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And one of them that you
write about in the book

00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:45.720 align:middle line:84%
is a Roman-Jewish society
near Tucson, Arizona.

00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:47.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: Isn't
that incredible?

00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:48.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, talk
about that a little bit.

00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:50.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: Well, let's
go back a little bit.

00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:51.045 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:46:51.045 --> 00:46:55.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: And,
although scant,

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.170 align:middle line:84%
there is evidence that the
Hebrews were in America.

00:46:59.170 --> 00:47:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's quite likely
that they were here

00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:04.120 align:middle line:90%
at different periods of time.

00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:06.990 align:middle line:84%
We know this from some
Hebrew coins that were found.

00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And we know it from
some alleged artifacts

00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:11.180 align:middle line:90%
from the mound building era.

00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:13.730 align:middle line:84%
But what I discovered the
most significant evidence

00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:20.590 align:middle line:84%
of the Hebrews is a location
in New Mexico, south

00:47:20.590 --> 00:47:23.760 align:middle line:84%
of Albuquerque, known
as Hidden Mountain.

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And, at Hidden Mountain on
a very, very large stone,

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:30.050 align:middle line:84%
we have the Ten
Commandments written out

00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:32.830 align:middle line:90%
in a Proto-Hebrew script.

00:47:32.830 --> 00:47:38.450 align:middle line:84%
That is before the block
Hebrew language was developed.

00:47:38.450 --> 00:47:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And it is a recitation
of the Ten Commandments.

00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And we also have other
Hebrew writing on this site.

00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And, wow, like
every artifact that

00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:55.270 align:middle line:84%
seems to have a beginning
with Old World peoples,

00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:58.620 align:middle line:84%
this is fiercely debated
by the archaeal priesthood

00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:03.610 align:middle line:84%
in the archaeological community
who claim that the Hidden

00:48:03.610 --> 00:48:07.570 align:middle line:84%
Mountain decalogue
stone was a hoax created

00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:09.240 align:middle line:84%
in the last couple
hundred years.

00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:12.650 align:middle line:84%
But there's compelling
evidence to suggest

00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:18.230 align:middle line:84%
that this is a legitimate
Hebrew site, a legitimate Hebrew

00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:21.440 align:middle line:84%
artifact that,
based on some star

00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:26.800 align:middle line:84%
charts on the
site, that could be

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:30.310 align:middle line:90%
aligned with a specific date.

00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:34.220 align:middle line:90%
This goes at least 1,500 years.

00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:34.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:37.292 align:middle line:84%
And they say the one in
Tucson may be 1,000 years?

00:48:37.292 --> 00:48:38.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LEHRBURGER: No.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:38.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No?

00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:40.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LEHRBURGER: No.

00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:46.940 align:middle line:84%
What we find is south of Hidden
Mountain in southern Arizona

00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:55.010 align:middle line:84%
near Tucson around the
beginning of the 20th century,

00:48:55.010 --> 00:48:59.240 align:middle line:84%
32 artifacts were dug
out of the desert sand.

00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And these were
religious artifacts.

00:49:04.090 --> 00:49:10.480 align:middle line:84%
But, most notably, they
were large lead crosses

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:14.730 align:middle line:84%
that were inscribed
in Latin as well as

00:49:14.730 --> 00:49:17.390 align:middle line:90%
imageries from the Bible.

00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And the Latin, although
not that well constructed,

00:49:21.070 --> 00:49:23.780 align:middle line:90%
was easily read.

00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:28.690 align:middle line:84%
And the story that
emerges from these crosses

00:49:28.690 --> 00:49:36.570 align:middle line:84%
is the voyage of a group
of Hebrews around 765

00:49:36.570 --> 00:49:41.090 align:middle line:90%
AD coming from Europe.

00:49:41.090 --> 00:49:42.770 align:middle line:90%
They were Roman citizens.

00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And they don't describe how
they got here or why they came,

00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:49.940 align:middle line:84%
but we are presuming they
were escaping persecution

00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:56.730 align:middle line:84%
or, perhaps, looking to
colonize a community in an area.

00:49:56.730 --> 00:50:01.100 align:middle line:84%
Quite likely, they sailed to the
Americas via the Gulf of Mexico

00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:02.760 align:middle line:90%
and up the Rio Grande.

00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:08.200 align:middle line:84%
And, according to
the Latin writing,

00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:13.040 align:middle line:84%
the history of the colony of
Calalus began at around 765.

00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:15.400 align:middle line:84%
They record the different
kings that ruled it,

00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:18.210 align:middle line:90%
including Israel I, Israel II.

00:50:18.210 --> 00:50:25.700 align:middle line:84%
And the writing has Hebrew
writing in it, Hebrew symbols.

00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:29.800 align:middle line:84%
But what's so phenomenal
about the writing

00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:34.120 align:middle line:84%
itself is that it's a
blend of early Christianity

00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:35.600 align:middle line:90%
with Hebrew influences.

00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:45.770 align:middle line:84%
So, in addition to
the large crosses that

00:50:45.770 --> 00:50:53.470 align:middle line:84%
are inscribed in Latin, we
have religious implements

00:50:53.470 --> 00:50:55.240 align:middle line:90%
that were used in ceremonies.

00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:58.110 align:middle line:84%
And they're quite
phenomenally done.

00:50:58.110 --> 00:51:04.370 align:middle line:84%
The colony seems to have
ceased to exist around 900 AD.

00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And the story that is
written on these crosses

00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:12.570 align:middle line:84%
tells of the war
between the natives

00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:15.342 align:middle line:84%
and between the colonists
that go back and forth.

00:51:15.342 --> 00:51:19.130 align:middle line:84%
And, finally at the end, the
natives get the upper hand.

00:51:19.130 --> 00:51:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And the individual who
is writing the story down

00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:32.930 align:middle line:84%
is talking about the
end of the Calalus

00:51:32.930 --> 00:51:37.280 align:middle line:84%
society, the end of the
community and kind of bemoaning

00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:39.960 align:middle line:84%
that he hasn't recorded it
well enough because there

00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:40.847 align:middle line:90%
was so much going on.

00:51:40.847 --> 00:51:42.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --he left what he did.

00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:43.054 align:middle line:90%
>>LEHRBURGER: He did.

00:51:43.054 --> 00:51:45.380 align:middle line:90%
Now, these artifacts do exist.

00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:48.480 align:middle line:90%
They are stored in a museum.

00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:50.070 align:middle line:90%
They are not on display.

00:51:50.070 --> 00:51:51.660 align:middle line:90%
I was able to view them.

00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And, like every artifact,
they're very controversial.

00:51:57.290 --> 00:51:59.880 align:middle line:84%
Most archaeologists that
are familiar with them

00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:02.140 align:middle line:84%
and certainly the archael
archaeo-priesthood

00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:06.270 align:middle line:84%
thinks they were
fakes done by locals.

00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:10.250 align:middle line:84%
Most diffusionists who
have looked at them

00:52:10.250 --> 00:52:12.350 align:middle line:84%
believe that they
were legitimate

00:52:12.350 --> 00:52:16.050 align:middle line:84%
and they were actually
a Roman-Jewish colony.

00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:19.940 align:middle line:84%
I had an opportunity to
examine the artifacts.

00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:24.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a expert in the
metallurgy or anything,

00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:27.190 align:middle line:84%
but I would say
that they certainly

00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:31.250 align:middle line:84%
seem to be consistent with
something of that era.

00:52:31.250 --> 00:52:34.020 align:middle line:84%
And, again, it really
points to the need

00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:37.580 align:middle line:84%
of involving a
professional epigraphers,

00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:44.090 align:middle line:84%
or professional archaeologists,
anthropologist to settle

00:52:44.090 --> 00:52:48.550 align:middle line:90%
the debate of its legitimacy.

00:52:48.550 --> 00:52:53.310 align:middle line:84%
I write in the book that
this is a legitimate series

00:52:53.310 --> 00:52:57.380 align:middle line:84%
of artifacts that demonstrated
that the Romans were here

00:52:57.380 --> 00:53:00.790 align:middle line:84%
in the New World
right up to 900 AD.

00:53:00.790 --> 00:53:01.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:01.899 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:53:01.899 --> 00:53:03.510 align:middle line:90%
Now, we're about out of time.

00:53:03.510 --> 00:53:07.340 align:middle line:84%
We never even got to the
Asian artistic motives

00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:08.950 align:middle line:90%
in Mesoamerica.

00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:13.050 align:middle line:84%
But, for anybody that wants
to take a look at that,

00:53:13.050 --> 00:53:15.740 align:middle line:84%
I did do an interview with
Raymond Tarpey on some of that.

00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:18.230 align:middle line:84%
So you can look at at least
the linguistic connections

00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:20.070 align:middle line:90%
that support that, as well.

00:53:20.070 --> 00:53:23.220 align:middle line:84%
There's another person that's
digging around as you are.

00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:26.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: And I just want
to note that Gunnar Thompson has

00:53:26.890 --> 00:53:30.470 align:middle line:84%
written extensively
about these symbols

00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:36.270 align:middle line:84%
that he says comes right around
between 200 BC up to about 200

00:53:36.270 --> 00:53:38.660 align:middle line:90%
AD.

00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:40.480 align:middle line:84%
Many different symbols
coming from Asia

00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:44.020 align:middle line:84%
found their way into
the Central America

00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:46.730 align:middle line:84%
and into the Mayan
culture, specifically

00:53:46.730 --> 00:53:49.070 align:middle line:84%
like the vision serpent
is a great example of one.

00:53:49.070 --> 00:53:49.571 align:middle line:90%
So many--

00:53:49.571 --> 00:53:50.611 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's out there.

00:53:50.611 --> 00:53:52.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: --have
documented this, as has--

00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:58.580 align:middle line:84%
I write about Ganapati Sthapati
a Tamil temple builder who

00:53:58.580 --> 00:54:01.640 align:middle line:84%
believes that the Mayan
civilization was actually

00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:08.720 align:middle line:84%
founded by Maaya, M-A-A-Y-A,
who was a historical figure from

00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:10.560 align:middle line:90%
India.

00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:11.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:12.000 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, are you working
on another book?

00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:17.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is taking
you a long time to create.

00:54:17.380 --> 00:54:18.530 align:middle line:90%
And it's quite a body.

00:54:18.530 --> 00:54:21.090 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of
our people watching

00:54:21.090 --> 00:54:24.110 align:middle line:84%
this are going to be purchasing
this book and, if not

00:54:24.110 --> 00:54:26.120 align:middle line:84%
going on field trips,
at least in the mind.

00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:29.050 align:middle line:84%
You've opened up a lot
or new doorways for us.

00:54:29.050 --> 00:54:31.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LEHRBURGER: Well, thank you.

00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:33.770 align:middle line:84%
My passion these days
is renewable energy.

00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:35.780 align:middle line:84%
So I continue to work
in that, professionally.

00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:38.320 align:middle line:84%
One of the great things
about writing the book,

00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:42.190 align:middle line:84%
and giving little talks, and
having interviews like this

00:54:42.190 --> 00:54:45.390 align:middle line:84%
is being contacted by
people with their stories,

00:54:45.390 --> 00:54:48.010 align:middle line:84%
and their artifacts,
and their references.

00:54:48.010 --> 00:54:52.090 align:middle line:84%
And we've got to make the
point that no one person can

00:54:52.090 --> 00:54:53.640 align:middle line:90%
write a new history of America.

00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:57.940 align:middle line:84%
And, as much work
as I put into it,

00:54:57.940 --> 00:55:00.300 align:middle line:84%
most of the
references in the book

00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:01.730 align:middle line:90%
come from previous researchers.

00:55:01.730 --> 00:55:06.820 align:middle line:84%
So I stand on the shoulders
of those who came before me.

00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:09.170 align:middle line:10%
My hope in writing
the book was really

00:55:09.170 --> 00:55:13.040 align:middle line:10%
to break through the paradigm
that all diffusionists have

00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:16.290 align:middle line:10%
really tried to do
beginning with debunking

00:55:16.290 --> 00:55:18.680 align:middle line:10%
the myth of Columbus
and really pointing

00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:24.710 align:middle line:10%
to a new history of America
as an important aspect

00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:28.205 align:middle line:10%
of the evolving
American culture.

00:55:28.205 --> 00:55:29.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you
for your dedication

00:55:29.830 --> 00:55:31.070 align:middle line:90%
and your persistence.

00:55:31.070 --> 00:55:32.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LEHRBURGER: It's
been so much fun.

00:55:32.570 --> 00:55:33.190 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:55:33.190 --> 00:55:34.648 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, as
you can imagine,

00:55:34.648 --> 00:55:37.240 align:middle line:84%
we've barely scratched the
surface of Carl's profound work

00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:39.810 align:middle line:84%
and, again, standing on the
shoulders of others, as well.

00:55:39.810 --> 00:55:42.150 align:middle line:10%
To dig deeper into
America's true history,

00:55:42.150 --> 00:55:44.170 align:middle line:10%
you can pick up a copy
of his book, "Secrets

00:55:44.170 --> 00:55:46.790 align:middle line:10%
of Ancient America"
at major booksellers.

00:55:46.790 --> 00:55:49.570 align:middle line:10%
Along this line of thinking, you
might also enjoy my interview

00:55:49.570 --> 00:55:51.520 align:middle line:10%
with Richard Dewhurst
on the subject

00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:53.410 align:middle line:10%
of ancient giants in America.

00:55:53.410 --> 00:55:58.280 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
