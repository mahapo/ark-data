00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.750 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
OK, everyone, we're

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.300 align:middle line:10%
going to have an incredible
journey with author Miguel

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.090 align:middle line:10%
Connor, tripping through
the life of Elvis Presley.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.580 align:middle line:10%
Though he was and still
is a global phenomenon,

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.400 align:middle line:10%
I had no idea who the man was.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.590 align:middle line:84%
A cultural game changer
internationally,

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.300 align:middle line:84%
and inspiration for countless
recording artists and a highly

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.110 align:middle line:90%
advanced magician and healer.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.830 align:middle line:84%
Yet he couldn't integrate his
divinity with his earth life.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.000 align:middle line:10%
Miguel, welcome.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.370 align:middle line:10%
I've been so waiting
for this conversation.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.345 align:middle line:10%
I just ate your book
up with a big spoon.

00:00:49.345 --> 00:00:50.568 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:50.568 --> 00:00:52.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MIGUEL CONNER:
Glad you enjoyed it.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I loved it.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.620 align:middle line:84%
Before we even
get going on this,

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.880 align:middle line:84%
it's such a rich book going in
to all of the mystery history

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.180 align:middle line:90%
around Elvis.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's been written
about here and there,

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.910 align:middle line:84%
but you put the whole thing
together so beautifully.

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.925 align:middle line:10%
And most people don't
know this about him.

00:01:07.925 --> 00:01:09.300 align:middle line:10%
You know, they've
seen the movies

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.110 align:middle line:10%
where he studied a
little bit of Yogananda,

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.820 align:middle line:10%
but that's about
as far as it goes.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.020 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, how did you
get yourself in a situation

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.640 align:middle line:90%
to be writing about Elvis?

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.900 align:middle line:10%
And I know it has to do
with a little journey work.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.970 align:middle line:10%
>>CONNER: [LAUGHS] Yeah, I wish
I could say I have a vision

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.990 align:middle line:10%
that nobody has,
but that's not true.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.460 align:middle line:10%
We all have a purpose.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.840 align:middle line:10%
We all have a calling.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.140 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's calling is more
important than anybody else's.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.470 align:middle line:84%
But I was honestly called to
this, and I was surprised.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.250 align:middle line:84%
All my life I was
a Beatles person.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's right.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:39.917 align:middle line:90%
You weren't a Presley fan.

00:01:39.917 --> 00:01:41.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: I never
listened to Presley.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.000 align:middle line:90%
My parents didn't like him.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.230 align:middle line:90%
I thought he was OK.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.890 align:middle line:84%
And there was a time I
respect, as I got older,

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.110 align:middle line:84%
for his influence
on rock and roll

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.470 align:middle line:84%
and like people, I had read
about his eccentricities, again,

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.840 align:middle line:84%
Yogananda, meditation,
some UFO, but I just

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.610 align:middle line:84%
thought he was just another
eccentric rock star, right?

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.590 align:middle line:84%
Whether you're David Bowie or
Ronald Reagan or you know--

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.130 align:middle line:84%
we all think that our stars are
supposed to be eccentric and be

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.057 align:middle line:84%
into the esoteric, and then
we shelve it and, like--

00:02:11.057 --> 00:02:13.265 align:middle line:84%
Well, as long as they're
giving us the entertainment.

00:02:13.265 --> 00:02:14.065 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:14.065 --> 00:02:17.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: And the same with
the Beatles and Hinduism.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.460 align:middle line:90%
That's all I thought of him.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:24.930 align:middle line:84%
But it was a 2022, I started
having these strange Elvis sings

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.950 align:middle line:84%
and it could be
something on my podcast.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.210 align:middle line:10%
I remember
interviewing a lady who

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.300 align:middle line:10%
mentioned she had dated David
Stanley, Elvis's stepbrother,

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.590 align:middle line:10%
after Vernon remarried
after Gladys's death,

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.520 align:middle line:10%
while Elvis was in the Army.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.980 align:middle line:84%
They had dated and
they'd done this film,

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.030 align:middle line:84%
and she mentioned some of
his supernatural things

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.820 align:middle line:84%
and there was a spark
because I remember

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.290 align:middle line:84%
hearing about this
10 years earlier,

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.120 align:middle line:90%
and this time it stuck with me.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, this is
amazing, but why didn't it

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.010 align:middle line:90%
stick with me then?

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.550 align:middle line:90%
Why is it sticking to me now?

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.990 align:middle line:10%
Then there'd be all
these other signs.

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.860 align:middle line:10%
Suddenly, you know, I
would go out at a store

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.630 align:middle line:10%
and Elvis is playing.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:05.510 align:middle line:90%
Things like that.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:06.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.920 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: It culminated--
I went back to my homeland

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.550 align:middle line:90%
in Lisbon, Portugal.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.470 align:middle line:10%
My uncle is the patriarch of
the Santo Daime Church, which

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.810 align:middle line:10%
is a mystical Christian
group from Brazil,

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.760 align:middle line:10%
from the Amazon that does
ayahuasca combined with very

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.740 align:middle line:10%
esoteric Christian thought.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.090 align:middle line:10%
And I did two works,
as they call them.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.890 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Journeys?

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:27.807 align:middle line:10%
>>CONNER: Eight hours.

00:03:27.807 --> 00:03:31.150 align:middle line:10%
Yes, brutal journeys,
ego death, astral

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.300 align:middle line:10%
travel, but very therapeutic.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.890 align:middle line:90%
Therapy can be brutal.

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:36.765 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, Yeah.

00:03:36.765 --> 00:03:38.925 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: Our egos don't
like to be challenged.

00:03:38.925 --> 00:03:40.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, true.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: But it was a
great, great experience.

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.130 align:middle line:90%
I loved doing these.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.830 align:middle line:84%
But after that, the
floodgate would open.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.980 align:middle line:84%
It was like I couldn't
stop listening to Elvis.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.820 align:middle line:84%
I would do things like I
would walk into the house

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.410 align:middle line:84%
and my aunt would be
like, what about Elvis?

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:55.330 align:middle line:90%
And I'd be like, ah!

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.120 align:middle line:10%
And I realized she was
looking at Baz Luhrmann's

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.470 align:middle line:10%
movie on the TV and
she was just asking me,

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.670 align:middle line:10%
have you watched the movie?

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:02.980 align:middle line:90%
But it was all--

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was coming at
you from every direction.

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:05.453 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: Every direction.

00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:07.630 align:middle line:90%
Dreams, voices in my head.

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:08.830 align:middle line:90%
Halloween.

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.910 align:middle line:90%
I don't dress up for Halloween.

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:11.900 align:middle line:90%
I have young kids.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:12.980 align:middle line:90%
It's their time.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.860 align:middle line:84%
I had this strange kick
of dressing up like Elvis.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:16.730 align:middle line:90%
I have a podcast.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.089 align:middle line:84%
I was doing my podcast in
October dressed as Elvis,

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:22.040 align:middle line:84%
and my audience thought
I'd lost my mind,

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.210 align:middle line:90%
and it just kept saying--

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.320 align:middle line:84%
and this idea of the
occultism, of the missing life,

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.080 align:middle line:84%
it just kept getting
stronger and stronger.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And I knew there was a book
there, but at the same time,

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.730 align:middle line:84%
I was like, I'm
not a biographer.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.070 align:middle line:90%
It kept getting worse.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.100 align:middle line:84%
By January, I was having
really bad hip problems.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.290 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't eat, I could
barely walk my dogs.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.045 align:middle line:90%
I was like, even with that bill.

00:04:44.045 --> 00:04:45.420 align:middle line:10%
And I kept saying,
oh my god, I'm

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.045 align:middle line:10%
going to have to get
a hip replacement.

00:04:47.045 --> 00:04:49.940 align:middle line:84%
And then I went, oh
my god, hip, pelvis.

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.950 align:middle line:84%
I said, I know exactly
what you're doing.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.420 align:middle line:84%
So on February 1, 2023, I sat
down in the middle of the cold,

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:00.200 align:middle line:90%
11:00 at night, kids are in bed.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:05.550 align:middle line:84%
One biography of Elvis by my
side and I started writing it.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.050 align:middle line:90%
The pain went away.

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.150 align:middle line:90%
The book came out.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.490 align:middle line:10%
Three months later I had
finished the first draft.

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.945 align:middle line:10%
Six months later it was
signed by the publisher.

00:05:13.945 --> 00:05:17.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That is really fast
too, for a project like that.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.590 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't normally
happen that way.

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And so also we're going to find
out later in the conversation.

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.350 align:middle line:10%
Elvis did approach a lot
of people after death.

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:29.942 align:middle line:10%
He was in a lot of
people's lives and dreams.

00:05:29.942 --> 00:05:31.400 align:middle line:10%
And when he wanted
to fix something

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.990 align:middle line:10%
or do something or have someone
do something, it got done.

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.310 align:middle line:84%
He was as powerful after his
passing as he was in his life.

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.240 align:middle line:10%
Let's just get into some of the
mystery starting with his mom.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.480 align:middle line:10%
She was in a Pentecostal
type of church

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.530 align:middle line:10%
and she was a bit of a seer.

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.170 align:middle line:10%
She was moving to the
Pentecostal music.

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:52.010 align:middle line:10%
She was trancing out a
lot, and he was in utero

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:53.660 align:middle line:10%
when she was trancing out.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:54.570 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: Very much.

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.040 align:middle line:90%
I think Priscilla's right.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.760 align:middle line:84%
She said, there was no way
Elvis was going to be saved.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.500 align:middle line:84%
There was a demons or a
curse on that family, that

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.760 align:middle line:90%
included his mother, Gladys.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.140 align:middle line:90%
And you can call it demons.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:11.270 align:middle line:10%
We call it witch blood,
a power, a second sight.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.460 align:middle line:10%
It's not an easy thing to have.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.060 align:middle line:10%
But it starts with his mother.

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.710 align:middle line:10%
Probably goes up the line.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.510 align:middle line:90%
She could see shadow people.

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:19.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.320 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: She had premonitions.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.147 align:middle line:84%
They were so poor that
sometimes if Elvis got sick,

00:06:24.147 --> 00:06:25.855 align:middle line:84%
like with a fever,
they would do healing.

00:06:25.855 --> 00:06:26.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:27.512 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: And they would do it.

00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:31.740 align:middle line:84%
But yes, she was a
very avid Pentecostal.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And as I write in the book,
Pentecostalism, as scholars

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.506 align:middle line:90%
have seen, is shamanistic.

00:06:37.506 --> 00:06:38.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:39.970 align:middle line:84%
But she also passed
this on to him.

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:40.770 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: Mm-hmm.

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:44.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so let's talk
about-- let's kind of move

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.740 align:middle line:90%
on toward his birth.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
don't know that she

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:50.850 align:middle line:90%
was pregnant with twins.

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:55.440 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the
eerie kind of environment

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.050 align:middle line:84%
surrounding his birth
that scared the poo out

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:59.180 align:middle line:90%
of Vernon, his father.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:06:59.530 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: [LAUGHS]

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So to set it up--
tee it up, let's talk about it.

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:02.877 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: It started before.

00:07:02.877 --> 00:07:06.360 align:middle line:84%
She didn't know she was going to
have twins when she was pregnant

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.140 align:middle line:84%
and she was having
bad premonition.

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.720 align:middle line:84%
She was going to church
every night for hours.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.280 align:middle line:10%
And again, Pentecostalism,
it was almost

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.780 align:middle line:10%
as Jesus is getting too close
to sex because in the South

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:20.740 align:middle line:10%
you would go into an
altered state of mind.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.550 align:middle line:10%
So she was there all
night, moving sometimes

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:24.350 align:middle line:10%
out in the fields.

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:25.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:26.360 align:middle line:90%
Kind of like static movement.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.193 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: Very much.

00:07:27.193 --> 00:07:29.817 align:middle line:84%
Instead of being
possessed by Dionysus,

00:07:29.817 --> 00:07:31.400 align:middle line:84%
you'd be possessed
by the Holy Spirit.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:31.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.137 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: But it
was kind of that.

00:07:33.137 --> 00:07:36.820 align:middle line:84%
And she was going every night,
but she was having twins.

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:41.200 align:middle line:84%
As research tells us,
twins hear the noise.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.750 align:middle line:10%
They hear the music when
they're in the womb.

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.270 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, think of doing
that eight hours a day.

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:49.450 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, she
went into labor.

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:52.300 align:middle line:84%
They were so poor back
in Tupelo, Mississippi,

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.890 align:middle line:84%
that they couldn't
afford a doctor.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:57.460 align:middle line:84%
Had to be done with midwives
in their little house,

00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.980 align:middle line:84%
that it was a shack
with an outhouse.

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.830 align:middle line:10%
Things didn't go well.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:06.250 align:middle line:10%
Elvis's brother, Jesse, was
born and he was born stillborn.

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:10.210 align:middle line:10%
35 minutes, Elvis
comes out and it was--

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:12.850 align:middle line:10%
and before that, as
you said, premonition.

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:15.700 align:middle line:84%
While Gladys is having
a terrible labor,

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.410 align:middle line:90%
he goes out to have a cigarette.

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:19.860 align:middle line:84%
This blue light
comes over the house

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.560 align:middle line:90%
and it floods the entire house.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.270 align:middle line:84%
Vernon said the coyotes
stopped howling.

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:26.320 align:middle line:90%
You can hear the trees.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.278 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Dead silence.

00:08:27.278 --> 00:08:30.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: And he was so
freaked out, he ran in,

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:34.150 align:middle line:84%
but he ran into a tragedy,
so he forgot about it.

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:36.159 align:middle line:90%
Later, they would revisit this.

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:37.870 align:middle line:90%
Elvis would bring it up.

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:39.220 align:middle line:90%
We can talk about that.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now
we would assume

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.700 align:middle line:84%
there was some other
presence there,

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.950 align:middle line:84%
perhaps an extraterrestrial
presence at his birth.

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:47.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: And this
followed him most

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:49.450 align:middle line:90%
of his life in different ways.

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:51.010 align:middle line:90%
He had many experiences.

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:52.480 align:middle line:90%
And also there's a story.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.780 align:middle line:84%
There was two dolls
on top of the shelf

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:57.260 align:middle line:90%
and during Gladys's labor.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.460 align:middle line:90%
One doll fell.

00:08:58.460 --> 00:08:59.385 align:middle line:90%
There was this omen.

00:08:59.385 --> 00:09:00.185 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:00.185 --> 00:09:03.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: But right
there that was a tragedy

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:05.840 align:middle line:84%
and the supernatural were
right there with Elvis

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.650 align:middle line:90%
'cause imagine how horrible.

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:11.805 align:middle line:84%
It was a terrible
shock, a terrible shock.

00:09:11.805 --> 00:09:15.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when
she lost Jesse,

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:20.030 align:middle line:84%
it really became the
focus of her life to save,

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:21.260 align:middle line:90%
to protect Elvis.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.153 align:middle line:84%
And this became obsessive
to a ridiculous extent.

00:09:24.153 --> 00:09:25.320 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: It became abusive.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.570 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: It became abusive.

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:27.915 align:middle line:10%
She just wouldn't let him live.

00:09:27.915 --> 00:09:29.780 align:middle line:10%
>>CONNER: Lethal enmeshment.

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:31.305 align:middle line:10%
We call it helicopter parenting.

00:09:31.305 --> 00:09:32.105 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:09:32.105 --> 00:09:34.580 align:middle line:10%
>>CONNER: But it's actually
a form of psychosis.

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:37.160 align:middle line:84%
You can't blame her because
she went to the hospital.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.350 align:middle line:84%
They told her she could
not conceive anymore.

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:40.220 align:middle line:90%
So all she had--

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:41.205 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everything
was on Elvis.

00:09:41.205 --> 00:09:42.163 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: Little Elvis.

00:09:42.163 --> 00:09:46.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And Elvis was aware
from an early age about Jesse,

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:51.070 align:middle line:84%
his brother, and he always lived
alongside him, it sounds like.

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:54.680 align:middle line:84%
He was almost like a spirit
guide to Elvis, Jesse was.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:56.517 align:middle line:84%
And that's how
Elvis perceived him.

00:09:56.517 --> 00:09:57.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: Very much.

00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:59.150 align:middle line:90%
He was a voice in his head.

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:00.890 align:middle line:90%
He appeared in dreams.

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:02.090 align:middle line:90%
He appeared in visions.

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:04.510 align:middle line:84%
He was like his
consciousness or I

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:06.660 align:middle line:84%
call him his daemon,
his sort of higher self.

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:07.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:08.175 align:middle line:10%
>>CONNER: Guardian angel.

00:10:08.175 --> 00:10:08.680 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.330 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: It became--
just as Elvis

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:14.440 align:middle line:84%
became Gladys's obsession,
Jesse became Elvis's obsession

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:19.750 align:middle line:84%
because twinless survivors,
as research shows us,

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:21.920 align:middle line:90%
are very much broken already.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:25.880 align:middle line:84%
They live full of guilt.
It's like, why did he die

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:26.840 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't die?

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:29.110 align:middle line:10%
We were together in
this wonderful lagoon

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:31.100 align:middle line:10%
and my soulmate's gone.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.110 align:middle line:10%
And it haunted Elvis.

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:35.290 align:middle line:10%
But it also made
him want to seek

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:36.675 align:middle line:10%
the bigger questions in life.

00:10:36.675 --> 00:10:38.600 align:middle line:90%
You know, why did this happen?

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.130 align:middle line:90%
Why did I grow up poor?

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:41.963 align:middle line:84%
If we'd been in a
hospital, Jesse probably--

00:10:41.963 --> 00:10:43.463 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Maybe he
would have lived.

00:10:43.463 --> 00:10:46.120 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: And this guilt.
And twinless survivors

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:50.060 align:middle line:84%
are very spiritual,
very self-destructive,

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:54.580 align:middle line:84%
addictive prone, hard at making
connections, workaholics.

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And you see this in history
from Liberace, Philip K Dick.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.840 align:middle line:84%
Other figures who lost
their twins at birth

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.410 align:middle line:84%
have this same
trajectory as Elvis.

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:05.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
hard even when they

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.650 align:middle line:90%
lose their twin later in life.

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:10.800 align:middle line:84%
I have someone I'm very close
to and kind of lost his bearings

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:11.775 align:middle line:90%
after his twin died.

00:11:11.775 --> 00:11:12.060 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: Mhm.

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:14.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just was not
sure who was thinking.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:14.920 align:middle line:90%
Was this him?

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:15.970 align:middle line:90%
Was it his twin?

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't even
understand how enmeshed

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:19.780 align:middle line:90%
they were until he was gone.

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:21.455 align:middle line:90%
And he became pretty much lost.

00:11:21.455 --> 00:11:22.260 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: Yeah.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:22.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:23.855 align:middle line:90%
Emotionally lost.

00:11:23.855 --> 00:11:24.590 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: Regardless.

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:25.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Regardless.

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:25.967 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: --your twin.

00:11:25.967 --> 00:11:27.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now
she's on a mission.

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:30.550 align:middle line:84%
Nothing's going to happen
to Elvis on her watch.

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And Elvis, let's talk about him
a little bit as a little guy.

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:37.902 align:middle line:84%
Because what I loved were the
stories of his sensitivity.

00:11:37.902 --> 00:11:38.860 align:middle line:90%
He was a little blonde.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:40.325 align:middle line:90%
First of all, Elvis was blonde.

00:11:40.325 --> 00:11:41.040 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: He was a blonde.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We will get
into that in a minute.

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:43.810 align:middle line:90%
And you can tell that story.

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:46.090 align:middle line:90%
He loved comic books.

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:49.670 align:middle line:10%
Captain Marvel Jr. was his hero
and who he fashioned his life

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:50.470 align:middle line:10%
after, right?

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:51.303 align:middle line:10%
>>CONNER: Very much.

00:11:51.303 --> 00:11:55.800 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: But talk about him as
a person and just his generosity

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.516 align:middle line:10%
was just so--

00:11:57.516 --> 00:11:58.316 align:middle line:10%
divine.

00:11:58.316 --> 00:11:59.260 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: Yeah.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:00.570 align:middle line:90%
And say what you want about--

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:02.680 align:middle line:84%
Gladys and Vernon
were very good.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.560 align:middle line:84%
They always taught
Elvis we are all equal--

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:04.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:06.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: --under
the eyes of God.

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:07.540 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's better.

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:09.130 align:middle line:90%
Money doesn't make you better.

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:12.130 align:middle line:90%
All races and creeds have value.

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:13.900 align:middle line:90%
And Elvis grew up with that.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And they were so poor, some
nights all they could eat

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.090 align:middle line:90%
was cornbread and water.

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:20.050 align:middle line:90%
They were homeless.

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:20.495 align:middle line:90%
We're talking--

00:12:20.495 --> 00:12:21.537 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, homeless.

00:12:21.537 --> 00:12:24.220 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: Southern people
and the depression,

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:26.040 align:middle line:90%
it was bad in Mississippi.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.290 align:middle line:90%
And he was still so giving.

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:31.960 align:middle line:84%
One time, his parents finally
were able to afford a bicycle.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.680 align:middle line:84%
They gave it to Elvis and
he gave it away that day

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:35.860 align:middle line:90%
on Christmas.

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:37.270 align:middle line:90%
He gave it to a neighbor.

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:38.770 align:middle line:90%
That's how kind he was.

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:41.080 align:middle line:90%
And he was always helping out.

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:45.630 align:middle line:84%
He was just a wonderful, curious
and spiritually curious boy

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:46.690 align:middle line:90%
at a very young age.

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:47.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:49.000 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's not normal.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.130 align:middle line:84%
If you're so poor and
you have so little,

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:52.680 align:middle line:84%
most kids will do
anything to hang on

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.280 align:middle line:84%
to it that he
would just freely--

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:56.950 align:middle line:84%
but that remained a trait
throughout his entire life.

00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:59.652 align:middle line:84%
It actually remained a
trait after his life,

00:12:59.652 --> 00:13:01.110 align:middle line:84%
giving of his
energy, because we're

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:03.120 align:middle line:84%
going to get into what
he did with energy.

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.300 align:middle line:90%
What a master.

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:07.860 align:middle line:10%
So now let's talk a little
bit about his obsession

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:09.850 align:middle line:10%
with comic books
and Captain Marvel,

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:12.122 align:middle line:10%
and how he developed his
look and his uniqueness.

00:13:12.122 --> 00:13:13.830 align:middle line:10%
He didn't care what
other people thought,

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:15.340 align:middle line:10%
his unique way of dressing.

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:16.480 align:middle line:10%
Let's get into that a bit.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:17.050 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: No, no.

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:18.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one thing
about Elvis, Elvis

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:19.870 align:middle line:90%
did what Elvis wanted to do.

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:21.005 align:middle line:84%
Especially when
it came to style.

00:13:21.005 --> 00:13:21.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:23.080 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: And he was way ahead.

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:25.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, yes, he loved comic
books because, as you mentioned,

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:29.070 align:middle line:84%
Captain Marvel Jr. was
a handicapped boy, who

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:30.910 align:middle line:90%
would turn into a superhero.

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And Elvis always said,
where's this magic, where

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:36.360 align:middle line:84%
this poor lost
boy in Mississippi

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.830 align:middle line:90%
can become a hero to others?

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:41.770 align:middle line:84%
And you look at his
Vegas outfits, of course,

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:43.580 align:middle line:84%
they're straight out
of Captain Marvel.

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:44.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: His cape.

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:46.570 align:middle line:10%
>>CONNER: The lightning
bolt, Captain Marvel,

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:50.800 align:middle line:10%
Captain Marvel Jr. So Captain
Marvel was a huge influence

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.310 align:middle line:10%
on Elvis as a dreamer.

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:53.977 align:middle line:84%
And he likes science
fiction in general.

00:13:53.977 --> 00:13:54.777 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:54.777 --> 00:13:56.150 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: He loved Gospel music.

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:57.175 align:middle line:90%
He loved African American music.

00:13:57.175 --> 00:13:57.765 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:57.765 --> 00:13:58.550 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: He was--

00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:59.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It moved him.

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:00.645 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: Yeah,
as a teenager, he

00:14:00.645 --> 00:14:03.930 align:middle line:84%
was already dressing up as
the latest Black fashion.

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:04.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:06.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: Of course,
that got him in trouble.

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:09.010 align:middle line:84%
People would call him
the N word at school.

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:11.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, he'd go
to Black congregations

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.510 align:middle line:84%
just to be part of it and feel
the energy, feel the music.

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:16.802 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was probably one
of his greatest influences.

00:14:16.802 --> 00:14:17.602 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: Yeah.

00:14:17.602 --> 00:14:18.620 align:middle line:10%
And he was at the back.

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:19.220 align:middle line:10%
It was like--

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:19.490 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:20.448 align:middle line:10%
>>CONNER: --all Blacks.

00:14:20.448 --> 00:14:21.895 align:middle line:10%
And then the whites
got a little--

00:14:21.895 --> 00:14:23.178 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Just reverse.

00:14:23.178 --> 00:14:24.220 align:middle line:10%
>>CONNER: He didn't care.

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:25.130 align:middle line:10%
He didn't care.

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:25.930 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Mm-mm.

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:29.165 align:middle line:84%
So then he ultimately-- well,
how old was when he started?

00:14:29.165 --> 00:14:30.790 align:middle line:84%
When he dyed his hair
black and started

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:33.460 align:middle line:84%
doing that wave and everything
to take on the appearance?

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:35.065 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: Pretty
early, in his teens.

00:14:35.065 --> 00:14:36.023 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In his teens.

00:14:36.023 --> 00:14:37.960 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: Yeah, shoe
Polish and all that.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And again, that look,
people said, well,

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:41.750 align:middle line:84%
he's trying to
imitate Tony Curtis.

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:43.432 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, Captain Marvel.

00:14:43.432 --> 00:14:44.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Captain--
Captain Marvel.

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:48.045 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: That was his great
god or hero, if you would.

00:14:48.045 --> 00:14:49.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about how

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:52.090 align:middle line:84%
music started coming
into his life in terms

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:54.890 align:middle line:84%
of his ability, his
singing, for example.

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:56.350 align:middle line:84%
Where he started
performing first?

00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:57.993 align:middle line:84%
When people started
realizing there

00:14:57.993 --> 00:14:59.910 align:middle line:84%
was something different
and special about him?

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:01.760 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: I don't
think anybody did.

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.080 align:middle line:90%
He loved singing.

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.930 align:middle line:84%
It was almost--
but as a hobby, he

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:08.080 align:middle line:84%
was into football and all
that, but strangely, he

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:10.250 align:middle line:84%
started sort of hanging
out at Sun Records.

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:11.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:14.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: And he kept telling
the secretary there, well,

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:17.480 align:middle line:84%
I just want to make
a tape for my mama,

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.780 align:middle line:84%
even though Gladys
didn't have a--

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:20.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Gospel?

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:21.670 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: Yeah, yeah.

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:22.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, Gospel.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.162 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: But she didn't
have a recorder at home.

00:15:24.162 --> 00:15:26.890 align:middle line:84%
So it was very strange, but
he kept hanging out there

00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:28.250 align:middle line:90%
and one thing led to another.

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:29.540 align:middle line:90%
He did the tape.

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And then Sam Phillips
was making a supergroup.

00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:36.760 align:middle line:84%
And the secretary, she needs
to get a lot of credit,

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:39.380 align:middle line:84%
was like, well, why don't
you put this Elvis kid?

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:40.835 align:middle line:90%
He's good looking.

00:15:40.835 --> 00:15:41.635 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:15:41.635 --> 00:15:43.260 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: He'd make
a nice album cover.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:44.150 align:middle line:10%
>>CONNER: There you go.

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:45.050 align:middle line:10%
That's it, that's it.

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:45.540 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Even if he can't sing.

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:47.420 align:middle line:10%
>>CONNER: And he
auditioned all day,

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:49.018 align:middle line:10%
and he bombed the whole day.

00:15:49.018 --> 00:15:50.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I love this part.

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:53.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: And Sam Phillips was
like, ah, and he couldn't do it.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:57.810 align:middle line:84%
And Sam Phillips went
over here to lock up,

00:15:57.810 --> 00:15:59.190 align:middle line:90%
and Elvis said, oh my god.

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:00.830 align:middle line:10%
And Elvis came out
with one of the,

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:05.600 align:middle line:10%
back then, most of the raciest
or fringe song, which was That's

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.820 align:middle line:10%
All Right, Mama, a
rhythm and blues song

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:10.170 align:middle line:10%
that no white folk would play.

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:14.090 align:middle line:10%
And Elvis, just on a
whim, decided to play that

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:16.613 align:middle line:10%
and suddenly started doing--
the real Elvis came out.

00:16:16.613 --> 00:16:18.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He started
channeling himself.

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:19.850 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: Yes, he
started shaking.

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And Sam Phillips was
on the room and said,

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.810 align:middle line:84%
this is the sound I've been
looking for all my life.

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:28.620 align:middle line:84%
This is a sound that transcends
white, Black, country.

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:30.667 align:middle line:84%
And he just signed
Elvis on the spot.

00:16:30.667 --> 00:16:33.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In your book, you
say there was a quote there.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.245 align:middle line:84%
He said, Elvis,
let the devil out.

00:16:35.245 --> 00:16:36.360 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: Yes, yes.

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.450 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: Exactly, because
that's what was missing.

00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:43.170 align:middle line:10%
Elvis was so into Gospel, but,
you know, that generation,

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:45.270 align:middle line:10%
they wanted a little
darkness in their life.

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:48.450 align:middle line:10%
They wanted some of that
blues and that trickster,

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:50.880 align:middle line:10%
devilish music, that edginess.

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And Elvis brought it out
with That's All Right, Mama.

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, she loved
the way it electrified

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.630 align:middle line:90%
everyone in the room.

00:16:57.630 --> 00:16:59.285 align:middle line:84%
And he was like, they'd
never heard this before.

00:16:59.285 --> 00:17:00.085 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: Right.

00:17:00.085 --> 00:17:03.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it transcended
even the Black Gospel music

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.100 align:middle line:84%
and blues music that he'd
been playing, listening to,

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:06.900 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:09.650 align:middle line:84%
There was something,
some Je ne sais quoi

00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:11.266 align:middle line:84%
that no one had
seen before, right?

00:17:11.266 --> 00:17:13.099 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: Yeah, I would
say Elvis was always

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:13.689 align:middle line:90%
at the crossroads--

00:17:13.689 --> 00:17:14.489 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:14.489 --> 00:17:17.700 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: --to talk about
the trickster, the devil.

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:20.690 align:middle line:84%
Not like the Christian,
but the devil of the blues

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:24.530 align:middle line:84%
and the African mythologies,
that liminal Bardo space

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:28.200 align:middle line:84%
where even Elvis said, I
carry heaven and hell with me.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.720 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: And I
have to be careful.

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And he was at that Robert
Johnson, the father

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:36.600 align:middle line:84%
of modern blues, who
went to the crossroads,

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.510 align:middle line:84%
and he made a deal
with the devil.

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:40.920 align:middle line:84%
He actually died on the
same day Elvis died.

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:41.870 align:middle line:90%
Strange, but--

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:42.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I didn't know that.

00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: Yeah, so I
always say Elvis was always

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:45.690 align:middle line:90%
in this crossroads.

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:48.610 align:middle line:84%
Even Memphis back
then was seeing--

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:51.360 align:middle line:84%
they used to call it the
crossroad of North and South.

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.860 align:middle line:84%
In Egyptian times,
Memphis, I think,

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:55.810 align:middle line:90%
means the city and the border.

00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:57.180 align:middle line:90%
There's all these things.

00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:58.630 align:middle line:90%
Elvis was in the middle.

00:17:58.630 --> 00:17:59.795 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He was
living between worlds.

00:17:59.795 --> 00:18:00.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: There you go.

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.130 align:middle line:90%
What do shamans do?

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:04.620 align:middle line:84%
They're in between the
worlds and they bring back

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:05.570 align:middle line:90%
the art, the medicine.

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:06.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:07.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: The dangerous thing.

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:10.250 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the Prometheus,
the fire will burn you.

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:12.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The people
in the Black churches

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.120 align:middle line:84%
were not happy about this
because that music was not

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:16.090 align:middle line:90%
accepted.

00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:19.050 align:middle line:10%
Whether you were Black or white,
they did not like the blues.

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:19.410 align:middle line:10%
>>CONNER: They hated the blues.

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:20.940 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: They hated the
blues because they thought

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:22.300 align:middle line:10%
it was the devil's music.

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:25.380 align:middle line:10%
And he was taking the blues
to a whole new level [LAUGHS]

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:28.633 align:middle line:10%
gyrating, losing control,
you know, pelvis gyrating.

00:18:28.633 --> 00:18:29.925 align:middle line:10%
>>CONNER: That's it, that's it.

00:18:29.925 --> 00:18:32.680 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So let's
get into the times,

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:34.680 align:middle line:10%
because this part
is really critical

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:38.175 align:middle line:10%
that he chose to be born at
a time with the emergence

00:18:38.175 --> 00:18:38.975 align:middle line:10%
of television.

00:18:38.975 --> 00:18:39.460 align:middle line:10%
>>CONNER: Mm.

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:41.130 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I love
that part of the book

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:44.380 align:middle line:10%
that it set the whole
thing up, that as a soul,

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:45.820 align:middle line:10%
it was kind of a setup.

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:46.620 align:middle line:10%
>>CONNER: Mm-hmm.

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:48.120 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: He came
in at a time where

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:52.410 align:middle line:10%
it was possible to be exposed
to millions upon millions

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:54.370 align:middle line:10%
of people that hadn't
been possible before.

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:58.130 align:middle line:10%
So set it up for us how
television was rolling out.

00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:00.110 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: Not just
television, mass media.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:01.565 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mass media and radio.

00:19:01.565 --> 00:19:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: Yeah, nobody
did it better than Elvis.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:07.290 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like he
was born to exploit--

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:08.710 align:middle line:90%
Again, I call him a trickster.

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:10.690 align:middle line:84%
They say, well, he
stole Black music.

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:12.190 align:middle line:84%
What do you expect
from a trickster?

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:13.300 align:middle line:90%
He exploited mess.

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:14.470 align:middle line:90%
What do you expect?

00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:15.850 align:middle line:90%
He was a thief in the night.

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:17.890 align:middle line:90%
He's the Pied Piper.

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:20.950 align:middle line:84%
And again, talking
about the crossroads,

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:23.230 align:middle line:84%
America was at a
huge crossroads.

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:27.400 align:middle line:84%
We had gone from the depression
to World War II to post-war.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.070 align:middle line:10%
And suddenly, out of the
ashes of World War II,

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:32.230 align:middle line:10%
this mighty empire came out.

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:37.780 align:middle line:10%
This empire of satellites,
atomic bombs, mass media,

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:38.830 align:middle line:10%
highways.

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And it was a whole
different world.

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And it was a psychic
shock for boomers

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:46.030 align:middle line:84%
and the silent generation,
because the world had

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:49.720 align:middle line:84%
never-- if you look at
technology, how it goes,

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:52.400 align:middle line:84%
you go humanity,
technology goes like this,

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.500 align:middle line:84%
and then it pops up with
the Sumerians, right?

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:55.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:55.300 --> 00:20:00.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: And then we're
chugging along, 1948, humanity

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:02.810 align:middle line:90%
has never seen how we advance.

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:05.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, whatever arguments
you want to say,

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:09.080 align:middle line:84%
Nazis, extraterrestrials,
ingenuity, it doesn't matter.

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:10.530 align:middle line:90%
But this world was--

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:13.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We were seeded with
technologies of all kinds that

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.360 align:middle line:84%
were used in many different
ways, and one of them

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:19.200 align:middle line:84%
became mass media,
transistors, et cetera.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: But it was such a hard
thing on the psyche of America.

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:26.330 align:middle line:84%
Elvis, as I say, rock and
roll was a spiritual form.

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:29.290 align:middle line:10%
It was this fusion
of blues and Gospel

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:35.150 align:middle line:10%
that prepared a new generation
to handle this high technology,

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:37.900 align:middle line:10%
these enemies on the
other side of the world,

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:42.280 align:middle line:10%
this huge change in the American
psyche, Eisenhower's America,

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:48.220 align:middle line:10%
and Elvis led the youth to this,
and he tapped into technology

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:50.230 align:middle line:10%
to be able to go into
everybody's living

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:52.550 align:middle line:10%
room, everybody's car.

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And he brought this medicine,
the shamanistic medicine,

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:58.920 align:middle line:84%
healing, which we
call rock and roll.

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:02.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And at that time, now
we're looking at September 9,

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:06.490 align:middle line:84%
1956, he was on The
Ed Sullivan Show,

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:09.230 align:middle line:84%
and no one had seen
anything like this.

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:12.200 align:middle line:84%
But we have to understand
the reach of that show,

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.310 align:middle line:90%
by that time.

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:15.410 align:middle line:10%
I think you said--
tell me if I'm wrong--

00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:21.070 align:middle line:10%
I think you said that 82% of
households in America by 1956

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:25.785 align:middle line:10%
had television sets, and his
share of the audience was?

00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:28.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: I think 2/3 of the
country was watching about that.

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:29.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:34.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: 2/3 of the US was
watching Elvis emerge doing--

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:36.290 align:middle line:90%
what-- not Heartbreak Hotel.

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:37.570 align:middle line:84%
I know he did-- and one
of them You Ain't Nothing

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:38.210 align:middle line:90%
But a Hound Dog.

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:39.225 align:middle line:90%
What was the first one he did?

00:21:39.225 --> 00:21:40.760 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: I thought
it was Hound Dog.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:41.560 align:middle line:10%
I'm pretty sure.

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:42.860 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK, OK.

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:44.840 align:middle line:10%
Well, so this happens.

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.628 align:middle line:90%
Now, something else happens.

00:21:46.628 --> 00:21:48.170 align:middle line:84%
And you and I were
talking off camera

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:49.650 align:middle line:90%
and you used the right word.

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:52.970 align:middle line:84%
It was almost as though
there was a teenage

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:58.700 align:middle line:84%
and beyond Kundalini
awakening in the populace.

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:02.540 align:middle line:10%
I mean, people swooned over
Frank Sinatra a little bit,

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:04.170 align:middle line:10%
but not like this.

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:05.760 align:middle line:10%
They were losing their minds.

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:06.600 align:middle line:10%
They were screaming.

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.700 align:middle line:10%
They were having
ecstatic experiences.

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:10.405 align:middle line:10%
The girls could not
control themselves.

00:22:10.405 --> 00:22:13.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: No, it was like a
bacchanalia with the Maenads.

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:14.080 align:middle line:90%
It was seriously.

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:14.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.760 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: There was a
time where Elvis said--

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.510 align:middle line:90%
somebody throws me their keys.

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:21.170 align:middle line:84%
They can go-- he almost
got killed by the audience.

00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:25.050 align:middle line:84%
In the Baz Luhrmann movie, that
scene when he's doing Baby,

00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:26.060 align:middle line:90%
Let's Play House.

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:26.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:27.485 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: It was like that.

00:22:27.485 --> 00:22:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And as I write, it's not
like he awoken the Kundalini

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:32.430 align:middle line:90%
in the female population.

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:33.630 align:middle line:90%
Not even sexual, but power.

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:34.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Power.

00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:34.925 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: That psychic--

00:22:34.925 --> 00:22:35.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Electricity.

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:36.510 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: --feminine power.

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:37.310 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:40.100 align:middle line:10%
And women suddenly
could see themselves

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:43.560 align:middle line:10%
as independent
beings of agency who

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:45.910 align:middle line:10%
had their own power
and independence.

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:48.570 align:middle line:84%
He did so much and same
with-- and men could suddenly

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:51.150 align:middle line:84%
see themselves, you
know, I can be vulnerable

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:52.300 align:middle line:90%
and sort of softer.

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:53.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:54.070 align:middle line:90%
He was interesting.

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:58.020 align:middle line:84%
He had this very smooth skin
and large lips, blue eyes,

00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:03.176 align:middle line:84%
very kind of sweet countenance,
almost, like very sensual.

00:23:03.176 --> 00:23:04.300 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: Very much.

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:05.500 align:middle line:90%
And men could see that.

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.150 align:middle line:90%
They say, I can have style.

00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:10.470 align:middle line:84%
Then they could see, you
know, Elvis is opening doors

00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:13.980 align:middle line:84%
to all these different forbidden
things like Black music

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:15.737 align:middle line:84%
and Italian opera
and different things.

00:23:15.737 --> 00:23:17.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Women getting
whipped up sexually.

00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:18.430 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: Yeah, yeah.

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:18.785 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And their energy.

00:23:18.785 --> 00:23:19.585 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: Yeah.

00:23:19.585 --> 00:23:22.710 align:middle line:10%
And it really opened
the floodgates

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:27.090 align:middle line:10%
and also helped people navigate
this new world of mass media

00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:28.750 align:middle line:10%
and technology.

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:32.130 align:middle line:84%
It gave him a sense of
independence and power, both men

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:33.040 align:middle line:90%
and women.

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And it brought a huge light into
minority music and so much more.

00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:39.733 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was a
huge psychic change.

00:23:39.733 --> 00:23:41.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There was
nothing else like it

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:43.660 align:middle line:84%
at that time anywhere
in the world.

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:45.550 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he was a force.

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:49.080 align:middle line:10%
So you say in the
book also that this

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:50.790 align:middle line:10%
became the beginning
of what we would

00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:53.460 align:middle line:10%
call an independent
group of individuals

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:56.680 align:middle line:10%
called teenagers, because
before people go to school,

00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:58.180 align:middle line:10%
they try to get
through high school,

00:23:58.180 --> 00:23:59.800 align:middle line:10%
get married or get a job.

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:03.130 align:middle line:10%
There was none of this
rebellious teenage stuff.

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:05.543 align:middle line:10%
And roughly till that
era until he came about.

00:24:05.543 --> 00:24:07.835 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: The word teenager
didn't exist until the 50s.

00:24:07.835 --> 00:24:08.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Isn't
that interesting?

00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:10.670 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: You either
went from kid to adult.

00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:11.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:13.810 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: Suddenly this group
comes out and says, look,

00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:16.240 align:middle line:90%
our parents have money.

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:18.130 align:middle line:84%
This is a world,
is freaking us out.

00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:22.060 align:middle line:84%
We want more, the old churches
and literature and art,

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:23.290 align:middle line:90%
it ain't working.

00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:26.650 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to survive
what's coming down the pipe.

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:27.760 align:middle line:90%
We want more.

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And again, Elvis became
the manifestation

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:36.080 align:middle line:84%
of their desires and hopes and
what they wanted out of life.

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:36.880 align:middle line:90%
He was it.

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:39.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And his
appearance with that number

00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:43.585 align:middle line:84%
of people watching was not
eclipsed until the Apollo moon

00:24:43.585 --> 00:24:44.385 align:middle line:90%
landing, right?

00:24:44.385 --> 00:24:46.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: But then his
Aloha special, I think,

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:47.940 align:middle line:90%
topped it in the early 70s.

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:48.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes!

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:51.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: He wasn't going to
be second place for too long.

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:53.230 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: But it
also kind set up

00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:55.610 align:middle line:10%
a divide between
parents and teenagers.

00:24:55.610 --> 00:24:56.410 align:middle line:10%
>>CONNER: Yes.

00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:57.660 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: This became a thing.

00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:58.970 align:middle line:10%
And so he was really forbidden.

00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:02.230 align:middle line:10%
A lot of parents did not want
their kids watching or listening

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:05.240 align:middle line:10%
to Elvis Presley because he was
leading them down a dark path.

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.040 align:middle line:10%
>>CONNER: Yes.

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:06.470 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:07.140 align:middle line:10%
In their opinion.

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:07.940 align:middle line:10%
>>CONNER: Yes.

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:09.680 align:middle line:84%
Call it independence
and finding--

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:11.380 align:middle line:90%
yeah, his own pastor denouncing.

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:13.420 align:middle line:90%
Billy Graham was public.

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:14.750 align:middle line:90%
People in the government.

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:17.670 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, he was a threat
to the status quo.

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:18.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:19.680 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: A real threat.

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:22.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But for
him, didn't he feel

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:24.130 align:middle line:84%
like he was sending
all his light

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:25.940 align:middle line:84%
and healing energy
into the audience?

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:29.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, didn't he just
love being there for them?

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:31.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure he loved the
energy coming back at him,

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:34.730 align:middle line:84%
but it was also that he loved
projecting that out to people.

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:35.530 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: Yes.

00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:37.760 align:middle line:84%
As we talked, the
lightning bolt, he said,

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.080 align:middle line:90%
there's an electricity.

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:42.340 align:middle line:84%
When I'm with my audience,
we go back and forth.

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:46.220 align:middle line:10%
Again, I call it shamanism
or mystery school religion.

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:48.140 align:middle line:10%
You and I have been to concerts.

00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:50.120 align:middle line:10%
We know we're not there
for entertainment.

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:51.118 align:middle line:10%
We're there to heal.

00:25:51.118 --> 00:25:52.660 align:middle line:10%
We're there because
that person shows

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:54.950 align:middle line:10%
us something about
ourselves we haven't seen.

00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:56.720 align:middle line:90%
And we heal with the audience.

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:57.718 align:middle line:90%
We feel we belong.

00:25:57.718 --> 00:26:00.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We wanna be swept into
it with a feeling of it all.

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:02.010 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: It doesn't
matter if it's Taylor

00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:03.230 align:middle line:90%
Swift or the Grateful Dead.

00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:06.110 align:middle line:84%
Your mileage may vary,
but as I keep saying,

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:09.050 align:middle line:84%
rock music was never a
form of entertainment.

00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:10.070 align:middle line:90%
It's a religion.

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:11.840 align:middle line:90%
It's a form of spirituality.

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:12.832 align:middle line:90%
We've forgotten that.

00:26:12.832 --> 00:26:14.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
he was still quite

00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:16.947 align:middle line:90%
young at this time, what, 1920?

00:26:16.947 --> 00:26:17.780 align:middle line:90%
Something like that.

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:20.990 align:middle line:90%
20 years old, and his mom dies.

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:24.580 align:middle line:84%
They were inextricably
intertwined psychically

00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:27.410 align:middle line:84%
to a point that was
actually unhealthy.

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:28.940 align:middle line:90%
So what happened?

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:31.070 align:middle line:84%
Because everything
became about his mom.

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:33.885 align:middle line:84%
This influenced his sex
life and everything else.

00:26:33.885 --> 00:26:36.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: He cannot have
relations with mothers.

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:39.710 align:middle line:10%
If you had had a child,
it was off the table.

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:41.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, he was very messed up.

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:43.350 align:middle line:90%
Also, it was so sudden.

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:45.630 align:middle line:90%
He didn't care about the money.

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:48.423 align:middle line:84%
He just made the money so
his mom wouldn't be worried.

00:26:48.423 --> 00:26:50.090 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah because
he wanted to make

00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:52.610 align:middle line:10%
sure she had a decent
life because she

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:53.700 align:middle line:10%
had a rough go of it.

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:54.490 align:middle line:10%
>>CONNER: Yeah, and
his whole family.

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:55.460 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: The whole family.

00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:56.270 align:middle line:10%
>>CONNER: And suddenly that--

00:26:56.270 --> 00:26:57.660 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And everybody
around him, actually.

00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:58.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: Yeah, Yeah.

00:26:58.020 --> 00:26:59.100 align:middle line:90%
And that was gone.

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:01.800 align:middle line:90%
And, again, it was very sudden.

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.220 align:middle line:10%
The Army only gave
him two weeks to mourn

00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:06.290 align:middle line:10%
and they shipped
him off to Germany.

00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:08.850 align:middle line:10%
No therapy, no counseling.

00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:11.760 align:middle line:10%
So that really broke him.

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:16.070 align:middle line:10%
In fact, when he went to
Germany, he was so depressed,

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:20.700 align:middle line:10%
so down, when he started
discovering Esoterica,

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:22.830 align:middle line:10%
he realized the Bible's
not working for me.

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:25.200 align:middle line:10%
This book used to work
and no longer works.

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And he remembered he'd
had a girlfriend that read

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:29.970 align:middle line:90%
the prophet by Kahlil Gibran.

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:32.278 align:middle line:84%
He thought about it
and he got a copy.

00:27:32.278 --> 00:27:34.070 align:middle line:10%
And he really read it,
and he started doing

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:35.910 align:middle line:10%
aromatherapy, martial arts.

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:38.540 align:middle line:10%
That was the beginning
between the pastors

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:41.435 align:middle line:10%
and the Christian's turning on
him and the death of his mother.

00:27:41.435 --> 00:27:42.235 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:27:42.235 --> 00:27:44.250 align:middle line:10%
>>CONNER: That's when he
pivoted to the occult.

00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And the thing with his mother
is that almost that was part

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:50.010 align:middle line:84%
of the curse, because he was
always going to be broken,

00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:51.290 align:middle line:90%
because without Gladys--

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:55.460 align:middle line:84%
again, lost Gladys, Jesse,
but he had this obsession

00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:57.390 align:middle line:90%
about women that had her eyes.

00:27:57.390 --> 00:27:58.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:58.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: Priscilla.

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:00.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Priscilla
had his mom's eyes.

00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:03.190 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: And when somebody
looked like his mother, Elvis,

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:03.990 align:middle line:90%
that was it.

00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:06.980 align:middle line:90%
He was her slave.

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:08.065 align:middle line:90%
Madame Blavatsky.

00:28:08.065 --> 00:28:08.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:11.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: He saw a picture
of HP Blavatsky and said,

00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:12.505 align:middle line:90%
she is my new teacher.

00:28:12.505 --> 00:28:13.760 align:middle line:90%
Daya Mata.

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:15.900 align:middle line:84%
It's like, if you
look like his mother,

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:18.800 align:middle line:84%
Elvis was going to worship
you and not leave you alone.

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.592 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and
that did happen.

00:28:20.592 --> 00:28:22.800 align:middle line:84%
And there were complications
that went along with it.

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:23.850 align:middle line:90%
And he went pretty far.

00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:28.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, like you say, the
films and such, his karate.

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:31.200 align:middle line:84%
He ended up eighth degree
black belt or something.

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: He had like
three or four black belts.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:36.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Very high level of
black belt. And he'd use it.

00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:37.710 align:middle line:90%
He'd use it.

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:39.060 align:middle line:84%
If they got in fights
somewhere, he'd

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:40.420 align:middle line:90%
pull it out every now and then.

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting part is,
though, he was refining himself

00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:47.170 align:middle line:84%
and such a seeker on
an esoteric level,

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:50.743 align:middle line:84%
he was not above a good
brawl in the streets.

00:28:50.743 --> 00:28:52.660 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about that
part of his personality.

00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:54.235 align:middle line:84%
He'd come unglued
and just go for it.

00:28:54.235 --> 00:28:55.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: Yeah, yeah.

00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:58.840 align:middle line:10%
Remember, I mean, you can
go to YouTube and watch him.

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:00.395 align:middle line:10%
His hands were a deadly weapon.

00:29:00.395 --> 00:29:00.750 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:01.290 align:middle line:10%
>>CONNER: So were his feet.

00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:01.750 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:03.708 align:middle line:10%
>>CONNER: But he was
always armed to the teeth.

00:29:03.708 --> 00:29:06.070 align:middle line:10%
He was a true
American, like, cowboy.

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:10.890 align:middle line:10%
But back in the 50s and 60s,
even 70s martial arts was

00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:12.740 align:middle line:10%
considered like a
forbidden thing.

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:13.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:16.615 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: But he really opened
the door to Bruce Lee and Chuck

00:29:16.615 --> 00:29:17.415 align:middle line:90%
Norris--

00:29:17.415 --> 00:29:18.215 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:29:18.215 --> 00:29:21.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: --and all these guys
because he popularized it.

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:25.230 align:middle line:84%
He started learning in the
50s because jealous boyfriends

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:26.615 align:middle line:90%
and husbands would attack him.

00:29:26.615 --> 00:29:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, well,
I can't shoot him.

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:30.580 align:middle line:84%
So he'd have to find
a better way to--

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:31.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:32.922 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: --without
killing somebody.

00:29:32.922 --> 00:29:35.290 align:middle line:84%
And he got into it because
it helped his mind.

00:29:35.290 --> 00:29:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And he got his first black
belt in the late 50s,

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:43.060 align:middle line:84%
and he was one out of 100,000
Americans with a black belt.

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:43.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:44.730 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:48.130 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: Now, today you've got
tens, hundreds of thousands.

00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:50.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and he
was seriously dedicated

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:51.550 align:middle line:90%
in a time when it wasn't cool.

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:52.350 align:middle line:10%
>>CONNER: Yeah.

00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:55.410 align:middle line:10%
And he opened the floodgates and
made it acceptable for Americans

00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:57.670 align:middle line:10%
to embrace martial arts.

00:29:57.670 --> 00:30:01.560 align:middle line:10%
So it was a-- yeah,
and again, there

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:04.200 align:middle line:10%
was the famous one
where he's driving

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:07.740 align:middle line:10%
in his limo in Wisconsin, and
he sees two guys beating up

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:10.440 align:middle line:10%
some gas station
attendant, and he

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:12.900 align:middle line:10%
gets out and takes him outdoor.

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:15.330 align:middle line:84%
I know there was a
fight, and the guy

00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:17.190 align:middle line:84%
tried to stand up
to him, and the guy

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:20.980 align:middle line:84%
had a cigarettes in his pocket,
and he was, let me show you.

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And he does a kick and he
knocks down his cigarettes

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:26.130 align:middle line:84%
and the guy's like, if he can
do that to my cigarettes, what

00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:27.340 align:middle line:90%
he can do to my face?

00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:30.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he would break
boards and walls.

00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:33.470 align:middle line:90%
He liked his martial arts.

00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:35.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and he knew how
to control energy and master

00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:36.770 align:middle line:90%
energy.

00:30:36.770 --> 00:30:39.560 align:middle line:84%
So what we're going to do, we'll
hopscotch forward a little bit

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:42.410 align:middle line:84%
because we want to get
into his esoteric training

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:44.460 align:middle line:84%
and then how he
started using it.

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:46.767 align:middle line:84%
His generosity continued
through his lifetime,

00:30:46.767 --> 00:30:47.600 align:middle line:90%
let's just say that.

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:52.650 align:middle line:84%
As he had massive amounts of
money at certain points in life,

00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:54.900 align:middle line:84%
he would just pay
off people's houses.

00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:56.010 align:middle line:90%
It was nothing to him.

00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:58.560 align:middle line:84%
Anyone that needed someone
that was part of his tribe,

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:00.480 align:middle line:84%
if he needed a new
kidney, it didn't matter,

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:02.210 align:middle line:84%
elvis would take
care of it for you.

00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:03.488 align:middle line:90%
Very generous soul.

00:31:03.488 --> 00:31:04.530 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: Oh, incredible.

00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:07.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so now
he's starting to really

00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:10.280 align:middle line:84%
ensconce himself into
esoteric materials

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:13.730 align:middle line:84%
like you said Blavatsky,
Yogananda, Manly P.

00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:15.360 align:middle line:90%
Hall, and so forth.

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And this was kind of threatening
to the people around him.

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:22.110 align:middle line:10%
Let's talk about that for a
moment because at one point,

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:24.800 align:middle line:10%
as you stated in the book,
he really at one point

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:27.980 align:middle line:10%
wanted to leave the world
behind and immerse himself

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:30.630 align:middle line:10%
in these areas he felt
more comfortable in.

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:33.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: Yeah, he wanted to
become a Buddhist or a monk

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:36.950 align:middle line:84%
and the Yogananda
ashram in California.

00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:40.270 align:middle line:84%
Another time he wanted
to be a Christian monk,

00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:42.940 align:middle line:84%
but he was talked out
of it because the Daya

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:45.690 align:middle line:84%
Mata, yogananda's successor,
was like-- you know.

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:47.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's what a
lot of Eastern people

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:50.320 align:middle line:84%
say, what have you Americans
got to go to the top

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:51.450 align:middle line:90%
to be the lonely guy in--

00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:52.250 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:54.200 align:middle line:84%
Don't run away
from your problems.

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:55.820 align:middle line:90%
You got to live the world.

00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:57.680 align:middle line:84%
Spiritual bypassing,
I think is the term.

00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:58.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And so he stayed and
continued on with his career.

00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:04.010 align:middle line:84%
But he was not happy
with a lot of it.

00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:06.550 align:middle line:84%
So a lot has been
written about and said

00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:10.550 align:middle line:84%
and in movies, it's portrayed,
about Tom Parker, his manager.

00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:14.070 align:middle line:84%
So Tom Parker really propelled
him into the world stage

00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:14.870 align:middle line:90%
in his career.

00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:17.200 align:middle line:84%
But also what
happened is he knew

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:20.180 align:middle line:84%
he was a money making machine
and he had his own demons.

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:21.072 align:middle line:90%
He was a gambler.

00:32:21.072 --> 00:32:22.280 align:middle line:90%
He was losing a lot of money.

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:24.465 align:middle line:84%
He was taking a lot
of money from Elvis.

00:32:24.465 --> 00:32:25.840 align:middle line:10%
Elvis wasn't really
aware of what

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:28.257 align:middle line:10%
was going on because he didn't
care that much about money,

00:32:28.257 --> 00:32:30.280 align:middle line:10%
as long as he had his
cars and guns and buddies.

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:32.950 align:middle line:84%
He started signing
him up with the studio

00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:34.315 align:middle line:90%
to do all these cheesy movies.

00:32:34.315 --> 00:32:35.115 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: Mm-hmm.

00:32:35.115 --> 00:32:37.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And Elvis was starting
at this point to get depressed.

00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:41.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is after he
went into the Military.

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.280 align:middle line:90%
He's already married now.

00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:45.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, at some point, he
became married to Priscilla.

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:47.360 align:middle line:84%
They dated for a
long, long time.

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:51.320 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, and so his spirit seemed
to start breaking a bit when he

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:52.665 align:middle line:10%
had to do these cheesy films.

00:32:52.665 --> 00:32:54.290 align:middle line:10%
He was getting tired
of being portrayed

00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:56.725 align:middle line:10%
as a sex symbol
with no real talent

00:32:56.725 --> 00:32:57.850 align:middle line:10%
to the scripts or anything.

00:32:57.850 --> 00:32:58.725 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: Yeah, yeah.

00:32:58.725 --> 00:33:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And even Quentin Tarantino
said he was a talented actor.

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:05.710 align:middle line:84%
He just was not getting the
Marlon Brando, Steve McQueen

00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:06.510 align:middle line:90%
roles.

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:08.200 align:middle line:84%
But regardless, he
was just miserable.

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:09.325 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He was miserable.

00:33:09.325 --> 00:33:12.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: The material
life, the fame, the women,

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:15.180 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't doing it for him.

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And so he was getting really
angry and feeling empty.

00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And as they say, when
the student is ready,

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:22.470 align:middle line:90%
the master will come.

00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And by a circumstance, he met
Larry Geller, who cut his hair.

00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:29.802 align:middle line:84%
Larry Geller was very
versed at all types of--

00:33:29.802 --> 00:33:30.635 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Esoterica.

00:33:30.635 --> 00:33:31.885 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: Esoteric traditions.

00:33:31.885 --> 00:33:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And Elvis became his student
and Elvis embraced everything.

00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:39.880 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter if it's
Kabbalah, Gnosticism, Taoism.

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:42.880 align:middle line:84%
Elvis embraced these
books, these teachings.

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:45.540 align:middle line:84%
Then he met Daya
Mata, and he just

00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:48.640 align:middle line:84%
became a walking,
talking mystic,

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:49.770 align:middle line:90%
for lack of better words.

00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:50.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:52.982 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: It's like this is what
he wanted because he finally

00:33:52.982 --> 00:33:54.970 align:middle line:90%
had purpose in his life.

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:57.010 align:middle line:90%
He wanted to understand God.

00:33:57.010 --> 00:33:58.830 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to understand
his role to be

00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:01.120 align:middle line:90%
a healer, a even bigger healer.

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:03.450 align:middle line:90%
And he was a very--

00:34:03.450 --> 00:34:05.008 align:middle line:84%
it's like he felt
he had purpose.

00:34:05.008 --> 00:34:07.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He would even
carry as many as a couple

00:34:07.050 --> 00:34:09.330 align:middle line:84%
hundred books with him
when he went on tour.

00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:09.630 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: Always.

00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:11.213 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So he had
access to anything

00:34:11.213 --> 00:34:13.150 align:middle line:84%
that his mind needed
to do that day.

00:34:13.150 --> 00:34:15.429 align:middle line:90%
And he meditated.

00:34:15.429 --> 00:34:18.547 align:middle line:10%
And so let's talk about
some of the healing

00:34:18.547 --> 00:34:20.130 align:middle line:10%
attributes that
started coming through

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:23.820 align:middle line:10%
and people started being witness
to because this man had energy

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:27.150 align:middle line:10%
and he understood
how to use the mind

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:29.110 align:middle line:10%
to be able to direct
the blue light.

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:31.467 align:middle line:10%
For him, it was the
blue light in the hands,

00:34:31.467 --> 00:34:33.050 align:middle line:10%
just like the blue
light in the cabin.

00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:34.080 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: Bingo!

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:35.542 align:middle line:90%
That blue light followed him.

00:34:35.542 --> 00:34:37.625 align:middle line:84%
When you start looking at
his songs and costumes--

00:34:37.625 --> 00:34:38.375 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Blue everywhere.

00:34:38.375 --> 00:34:39.639 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: Blue everywhere.

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:41.969 align:middle line:84%
And he and Geller would
use this tradition

00:34:41.969 --> 00:34:43.960 align:middle line:90%
of the blue light for healing.

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And again, Priscilla's
biography talks about,

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:51.429 align:middle line:84%
if she had a headache,
it was just like this.

00:34:51.429 --> 00:34:54.870 align:middle line:84%
Minnie Mae's grandmother
cured her arthritis.

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:57.220 align:middle line:90%
People would have nausea.

00:34:57.220 --> 00:35:00.660 align:middle line:10%
There was a singer,
her name was Shemwell

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:04.880 align:middle line:10%
from The Sweet Inspirations,
he cured her cancer one time.

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:05.680 align:middle line:10%
Broken legs.

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:06.597 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he was doing--

00:35:06.597 --> 00:35:08.615 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: People watched
him heal broken legs.

00:35:08.615 --> 00:35:10.270 align:middle line:84%
You know, knitting
bones back together.

00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:11.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: Yes.

00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And whenever I write
something in the book,

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:15.085 align:middle line:90%
there was lots of witnesses.

00:35:15.085 --> 00:35:15.885 align:middle line:90%
It was never--

00:35:15.885 --> 00:35:16.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:17.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: You'll
never find me writing

00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:19.050 align:middle line:90%
about doing something alone.

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:19.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:21.400 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: There were witnesses.

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:23.020 align:middle line:90%
But Elvis's life was so crazy.

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:25.530 align:middle line:84%
It's like people just, oh,
it's Elvis being Elvis.

00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:27.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He didn't
make a deal out of it.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:28.150 align:middle line:90%
He just knew how to do it.

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:29.380 align:middle line:90%
It's just like, OK, honey.

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And he just take care
of it, and you're done.

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:33.880 align:middle line:84%
He was generous with
his energy, just

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:35.320 align:middle line:90%
as he was with everything else.

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:36.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: Well,
like I said, he came

00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:38.410 align:middle line:84%
from the line of
Pentecostals where

00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:40.490 align:middle line:90%
you're supposed to heal others.

00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:41.710 align:middle line:90%
It's what you do.

00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And he began to get
telekinetic powers

00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:48.950 align:middle line:84%
where he could change the
weather or move clouds,

00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:51.110 align:middle line:84%
move objects like
bushes and all that.

00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:54.628 align:middle line:84%
And he always thought from
Yogananda that Yogananda always

00:35:54.628 --> 00:35:56.420 align:middle line:84%
said, look, if you're
going to do miracles,

00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:58.460 align:middle line:84%
it means you're
getting closer to God.

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:00.440 align:middle line:84%
Don't get caught
on the miracles.

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:01.720 align:middle line:10%
Get closer.

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:04.280 align:middle line:10%
So he was very humble about
it, just became part of it.

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And some were
funny, like the time

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:08.470 align:middle line:84%
that he was with
Linda Thompson and he

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:10.885 align:middle line:84%
bought a brand new Pantera
luxury car and it wouldn't

00:36:10.885 --> 00:36:11.685 align:middle line:90%
start.

00:36:11.685 --> 00:36:12.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:14.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: And he got out
and he took out his gun

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:17.780 align:middle line:84%
and he shot the car three times,
got in and the car started.

00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:20.810 align:middle line:84%
Linda Thompson's like, even
the car's scared of Elvis.

00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:23.150 align:middle line:84%
But he did these
things all the time.

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:25.940 align:middle line:84%
These magic healings,
astral travel.

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:28.360 align:middle line:84%
He would sit outside
and he would tell people

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:32.330 align:middle line:84%
how to fly into the
star, even as a teenager.

00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And when he was
younger, he'd tell,

00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:36.430 align:middle line:84%
my mama told me
not to tell anybody

00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:38.600 align:middle line:84%
or we'll get kicked
out of the church.

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:39.920 align:middle line:90%
It was like a gift.

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:41.890 align:middle line:84%
But then later on, he
would try to teach people

00:36:41.890 --> 00:36:44.830 align:middle line:84%
how to astral travel, and
he'd go to the planets

00:36:44.830 --> 00:36:45.800 align:middle line:90%
in different places.

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:49.245 align:middle line:84%
He could read minds,
predict the future.

00:36:49.245 --> 00:36:50.120 align:middle line:90%
It's all in the book.

00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:51.593 align:middle line:90%
And it's pretty startling.

00:36:51.593 --> 00:36:53.260 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: People have
to read this book.

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:56.395 align:middle line:10%
And very polite, always
very polite and kind.

00:36:56.395 --> 00:36:57.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: Yes, sir.

00:36:57.410 --> 00:36:57.610 align:middle line:90%
No, sir.

00:36:57.610 --> 00:36:59.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --trying to kick
someone's butt in a parking lot

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:00.590 align:middle line:90%
if challenged.

00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:02.480 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, he was
generally a very polite--

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:04.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: But then he let you
take pictures and give you

00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:04.850 align:middle line:90%
autographs.

00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:05.650 align:middle line:90%
He felt bad.

00:37:05.650 --> 00:37:06.820 align:middle line:90%
Like, sorry about that.

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:07.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sorry, buddy.

00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:08.555 align:middle line:90%
You want a picture with me?

00:37:08.555 --> 00:37:09.620 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir.

00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:13.910 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] So his life
now at this point,

00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:16.190 align:middle line:84%
he couldn't really live
the life he wanted to live.

00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:19.190 align:middle line:84%
The only way he knew to
continue was with Parker

00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:21.850 align:middle line:84%
and everybody around him was
keep doing the Elvis gig.

00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:23.990 align:middle line:84%
Now it wasn't working
for him anymore.

00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And he had various
prescription drugs.

00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:27.440 align:middle line:90%
It was interesting.

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.630 align:middle line:10%
He was kind of
anti-drugs, street drugs.

00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:30.430 align:middle line:10%
>>CONNER: Yeah.

00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:32.940 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: But he took all
kinds of prescription stuff.

00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:34.180 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: He didn't
drink alcohol either.

00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:35.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:37.250 align:middle line:84%
But these prescription
drugs were really

00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:38.925 align:middle line:90%
taking him down fast.

00:37:38.925 --> 00:37:40.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's talk about
what happens afterward.

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:44.010 align:middle line:84%
So he kind of falls down
in popularity a bit.

00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:46.080 align:middle line:84%
Beatles, everybody
else are up there.

00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:49.440 align:middle line:84%
Then he comes back for
this one grand resurgence.

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:51.030 align:middle line:90%
So I saw that show.

00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:52.130 align:middle line:10%
It was beautiful.

00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:53.090 align:middle line:10%
Beautiful.

00:37:53.090 --> 00:37:54.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:56.120 align:middle line:84%
They've done a
documentary on it.

00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:56.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: Yeah.

00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:59.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And so he's come back.

00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:02.870 align:middle line:84%
He's kind of at the
top again, but it's not

00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:03.960 align:middle line:90%
working for him anymore.

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:05.820 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of over.

00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:06.750 align:middle line:90%
He's had a baby.

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:10.620 align:middle line:10%
I mean, Lisa Marie is there,
but life isn't working for him

00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:12.592 align:middle line:10%
and the drugs are starting
to have an effect.

00:38:12.592 --> 00:38:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And you can't get that high
anymore if you can't go and get

00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:16.650 align:middle line:84%
the real high that
he really wants,

00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:19.285 align:middle line:84%
which is to be in
his more divine self.

00:38:19.285 --> 00:38:20.090 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: Yeah.

00:38:20.090 --> 00:38:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And I think, again, he
was doomed from the start.

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:25.520 align:middle line:84%
And I try to offer
different reasons

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:27.090 align:middle line:90%
why he couldn't shake it.

00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:30.530 align:middle line:84%
And we all know that
recovery, the mystic path

00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:31.770 align:middle line:90%
is not a straight line.

00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:32.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:33.210 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: It's a labyrinth.

00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:34.070 --> 00:38:34.987 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: And we fall.

00:38:34.987 --> 00:38:35.972 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:35.972 --> 00:38:37.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: But with
Elvis, I think

00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:41.180 align:middle line:84%
he was broken by the blue
alien light and the visitations

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:41.980 align:middle line:90%
that he had.

00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:42.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:45.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: The death
of Jesse, Gladys.

00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:46.230 align:middle line:90%
Poverty, too.

00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:47.030 align:middle line:90%
We have to forget.

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:49.170 align:middle line:84%
Poverty, as we're
finding out, is traumatic

00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:50.070 align:middle line:90%
and it is epigenetic.

00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:50.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:53.470 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: And he grew up in,
like, North Korean like--

00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:54.385 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:38:54.385 --> 00:38:57.120 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: All these things, and
then the death of his mother,

00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:00.860 align:middle line:84%
divorced with Priscilla-- just
all these things were too much,

00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:02.735 align:middle line:84%
in a time where he
just didn't have the--

00:39:02.735 --> 00:39:03.568 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Resources.

00:39:03.568 --> 00:39:05.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: We're lucky
today we have a lot more.

00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:07.800 align:middle line:84%
He didn't have those
choices back then.

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:11.010 align:middle line:84%
He had a persona, so
that started breaking.

00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:13.820 align:middle line:84%
But as I write in the book,
there's a concept called

00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:14.725 align:middle line:90%
"the wounded healer."

00:39:14.725 --> 00:39:15.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:19.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: And the most powerful
shamans, magician and healers

00:39:19.370 --> 00:39:20.470 align:middle line:90%
are the broken ones.

00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:21.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:22.820 align:middle line:10%
>>CONNER: As children
in these tribes

00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:25.640 align:middle line:10%
either had a near-death
experience or a disease

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:29.430 align:middle line:10%
or some trauma opened the
channels of communication,

00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:31.990 align:middle line:10%
and they become the
shaman of the tribe,

00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:35.410 align:middle line:10%
and they heal not in
spite of the wounds,

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:36.940 align:middle line:10%
but because of their wounds.

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:39.460 align:middle line:10%
They're in so much pain they
understand the pain of others.

00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:40.260 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:44.290 align:middle line:10%
>>CONNER: And they address them,
but it eventually destroys them

00:39:44.290 --> 00:39:47.100 align:middle line:10%
and there's traditions
in circumpolar

00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:50.830 align:middle line:10%
shaman tribe's, shamans
in north and south,

00:39:50.830 --> 00:39:52.300 align:middle line:10%
they end up like Elvis.

00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:55.370 align:middle line:84%
They end up as fat drug
addicts, sick people.

00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:56.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:39:56.170 --> 00:39:57.610 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: Just there.

00:39:57.610 --> 00:40:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And the tribe's like,
well, that's your job.

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:03.440 align:middle line:84%
You're the one who has to heal
us and entertain us and advise

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:04.240 align:middle line:90%
us.

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And the shaman is like,
I know, that's my job.

00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:07.800 align:middle line:90%
And they die.

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And Elvis was
carrying that burden.

00:40:09.610 --> 00:40:12.400 align:middle line:84%
He was a wounded
healer, a shaman.

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:14.050 align:middle line:90%
And I have other theories.

00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:16.360 align:middle line:84%
I try to approach
it from Jungian,

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:18.610 align:middle line:90%
alchemical, different theories.

00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:19.420 align:middle line:90%
We'll never know.

00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:20.230 align:middle line:90%
It's a mystery.

00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:22.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: One thing that
seems to me to be clear,

00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:23.650 align:middle line:90%
he was an avatar.

00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:26.710 align:middle line:84%
He came to this planet
to transform the times.

00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:27.790 align:middle line:90%
And he did.

00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:28.990 align:middle line:90%
He transformed the times.

00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:31.680 align:middle line:84%
He transformed music, he
transformed this group

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:34.600 align:middle line:84%
of people that are in these
middle years called teenagers.

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:36.340 align:middle line:90%
And he was a great healer.

00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:38.970 align:middle line:10%
And anyone who was able
to go and connect with him

00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:43.600 align:middle line:10%
live, he felt their energy that
it would radiate off of him.

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:45.390 align:middle line:10%
And so he died young.

00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:46.330 align:middle line:10%
He died young.

00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:49.630 align:middle line:10%
Let's move on past all
that to a few of the things

00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:51.520 align:middle line:10%
because we're
almost out of time.

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:54.720 align:middle line:10%
I know, it just flies
when you're having fun.

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:57.420 align:middle line:10%
A few of the incidences--
because there's one

00:40:57.420 --> 00:40:59.880 align:middle line:10%
I remember that I just
really loved-- of the people

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:01.890 align:middle line:10%
he reached out to
from beyond the grave.

00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:04.150 align:middle line:84%
All these people say,
I saw Elvis, this.

00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:06.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, some of them are
actually seeing Elvis.

00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:09.930 align:middle line:10%
Elvis, he could manifest
into this dimension

00:41:09.930 --> 00:41:13.300 align:middle line:10%
and he came repeatedly
into people's dreams.

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:14.290 align:middle line:90%
He didn't stop.

00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:15.280 align:middle line:90%
He hasn't stopped.

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:18.880 align:middle line:84%
He wanted you to tell this
story in its complete form.

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:23.110 align:middle line:84%
So just to wrap it up, how do
you feel having taken this on?

00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And do you still have a
relationship with Elvis?

00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:26.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: Yes.

00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:29.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, again, I was not an
Elvis fan, so I had an event--

00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:32.090 align:middle line:84%
but I felt as I
write in the book,

00:41:32.090 --> 00:41:33.800 align:middle line:84%
it's like friend
asks you for a favor.

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:34.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:36.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CONNER: Says, look,
people don't know my story.

00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:38.780 align:middle line:90%
I want people to know the truth.

00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:39.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm still around.

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:41.122 align:middle line:90%
Do you mind doing this for me?

00:41:41.122 --> 00:41:42.080 align:middle line:10%
And I said, I'll do it.

00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:43.743 align:middle line:10%
Except he's very demanding.

00:41:43.743 --> 00:41:45.160 align:middle line:10%
He's just like in
the book, 'cause

00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:48.200 align:middle line:10%
I would wake up in the morning
and I'd feel this presence.

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:50.367 align:middle line:10%
I was like, Elvis, it's
6:00 in the morning.

00:41:50.367 --> 00:41:51.200 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I'm tired.

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:53.095 align:middle line:10%
>>CONNER: Can I please sleep?

00:41:53.095 --> 00:41:55.270 align:middle line:10%
And I'd have to get up
and start typing because I

00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:57.850 align:middle line:10%
felt if I didn't type this--

00:41:57.850 --> 00:42:01.580 align:middle line:10%
like, the spirits,
they demand from Elvis.

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:03.290 align:middle line:90%
And so he was like a friend.

00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:05.180 align:middle line:84%
I remember writing
the first draft

00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:06.920 align:middle line:84%
and I started crying
because I was like,

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:08.270 align:middle line:90%
I want to see my friend.

00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:09.710 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
be with my friend.

00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:10.730 align:middle line:90%
I miss him already.

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:13.370 align:middle line:84%
And then I did the second
draft and everything.

00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:15.830 align:middle line:84%
So it was doing a
favor for a friend.

00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:18.325 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the
best thing we can do.

00:42:18.325 --> 00:42:19.700 align:middle line:84%
Like, we go back
to his kindness.

00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:21.920 align:middle line:10%
He was doing favors
for his friends.

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:24.170 align:middle line:10%
He was always approachable.

00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:27.510 align:middle line:10%
Even if you wanted to
talk about relationship,

00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:29.930 align:middle line:10%
even if he was high, he
would sit there, all right,

00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:30.800 align:middle line:10%
let's talk.

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:31.430 align:middle line:10%
You need money?

00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:32.263 align:middle line:10%
I'll give you money.

00:42:32.263 --> 00:42:33.230 align:middle line:10%
You need a Coke?

00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:38.230 align:middle line:10%
He'd see a woman in the rain,
he'd take off his $30,000, here,

00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:39.447 align:middle line:10%
and just walk away.

00:42:39.447 --> 00:42:40.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What a beautiful soul.

00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:41.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: He was.

00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:42.280 align:middle line:90%
He was just, uh--

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:44.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I just
want to thank you so much.

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:46.193 align:middle line:90%
So thoroughly enjoyed this book.

00:42:46.193 --> 00:42:47.360 align:middle line:90%
I've told everyone about it.

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:49.130 align:middle line:10%
I'm doing a book club
featuring your book,

00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:51.950 align:middle line:10%
and you've been kind enough to
say you'll come on live with us.

00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:52.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: I can't wait.

00:42:52.690 --> 00:42:53.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:54.380 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNER: And I can't wait.

00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:56.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everybody's
so excited about it.

00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:58.670 align:middle line:84%
So that's coming up
sometime in the summer.

00:42:58.670 --> 00:43:02.260 align:middle line:10%
And I just-- again, thank you
for allowing yourself to be,

00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:05.430 align:middle line:10%
well, invaded by
and guided by Elvis.

00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:07.190 align:middle line:10%
>>CONNER: Oh, thank
you for having me.

00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:08.180 align:middle line:10%
It was my pleasure.

00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:09.880 align:middle line:10%
And it's my pleasure to Elvis.

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:11.230 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Thank you, Elvis.

00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:13.750 align:middle line:84%
Again, the title of
this fascinating book

00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:15.170 align:middle line:90%
is The Occult Elvis.

00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:18.790 align:middle line:84%
And it makes us wonder, how many
more spiritual avatars are there

00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:20.210 align:middle line:90%
among the stars?

00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:21.380 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:24.340 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining
us here on Open Minds.
