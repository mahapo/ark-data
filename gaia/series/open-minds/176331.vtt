00:00:17.774 --> 00:00:20.190 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: Sheila
Gillette and the THEO Group are

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.260 align:middle line:10%
back with us by popular demand.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.360 align:middle line:10%
This time, however,
you're going to be meeting

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.090 align:middle line:10%
the other half of the
equation, Sheila's soul

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.040 align:middle line:10%
partner and husband Marcus.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.020 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be talking
about relationships

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.630 align:middle line:84%
and love today in all
its forms and nuances.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.390 align:middle line:84%
And I know you're both excited
to talk about this, right?

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:36.820 align:middle line:90%
>> MARCUS GILLETTE: We are

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.194 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEILA GILLETTE:
Very much so.

00:00:38.194 --> 00:00:42.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, and the nice
thing is you were able to bring

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.144 align:middle line:84%
into your lives your true
match for this lifetime, right?

00:00:47.144 --> 00:00:48.060 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEILA: Absolutely.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.220 align:middle line:84%
You know, there is
love at first sight.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:57.390 align:middle line:10%
And when we met through a mutual
friend, when Marcus walked up

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.820 align:middle line:10%
to the table, he literally
took my breath away.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And I knew he knew
more about me than I

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.740 align:middle line:84%
knew about him because,
he'd read my first book.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.460 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't talk.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.990 align:middle line:90%
He had such an impact on me.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And I thought who
is this person?

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.130 align:middle line:10%
And why am I having
this experience?

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.250 align:middle line:84%
Because it was more than
being attracted to somebody,

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.547 align:middle line:90%
it was larger than that.

00:01:19.547 --> 00:01:20.880 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It was a recognition.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.410 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEILA: It was
a soul recognition.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:23.055 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:01:23.055 --> 00:01:23.640 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEILA: For sure.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, that's
her half of the story.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.115 align:middle line:90%
What's your half, Marcus?

00:01:26.115 --> 00:01:27.630 align:middle line:84%
>> MARCUS: Probably a little
bit slower on the uptake--

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.630 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You're a guy.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.400 align:middle line:84%
>> MARCUS: You know,
as a guy, right.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.300 align:middle line:90%
I was a fan.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.530 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I'd read her book.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.420 align:middle line:10%
We had a mutual
friend that, you know,

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.878 align:middle line:10%
said would you like
to meet Sheila?

00:01:37.878 --> 00:01:39.750 align:middle line:84%
She's coming to town
to channel THEO.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.340 align:middle line:84%
And I know we're going
to go to the channeling,

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.600 align:middle line:84%
but would you like to
meet her beforehand?

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.740 align:middle line:90%
I said absolutely.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.620 align:middle line:90%
And so we had a chance to meet.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.650 align:middle line:84%
We were at the Phoenician
in Paradise Valley, Arizona.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And all I can remember
was thinking, wow,

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.600 align:middle line:84%
she's really
beautiful in person.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.596 align:middle line:84%
>> MARCUS: And wasn't at
that time thinking anything

00:01:56.596 --> 00:01:58.867 align:middle line:84%
romantic, just
because I was a fan.

00:01:58.867 --> 00:02:00.200 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, you were a fan.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.560 align:middle line:84%
You weren't thinking
in that way.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.200 align:middle line:84%
>> MARCUS: I was kind of a
student of THEO too and, you

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.000 align:middle line:90%
know, Sheila.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.600 align:middle line:84%
So I was really
happy to be there.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.910 align:middle line:84%
And then things got
much more interesting.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
yeah, and that's true.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.362 align:middle line:90%
Sheila is so beautiful--

00:02:12.362 --> 00:02:14.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm not meaning to
talk behind your back,

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.570 align:middle line:84%
because you're right
in front of me,

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.260 align:middle line:84%
but-- is so beautiful
energetically it comes through.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.860 align:middle line:84%
As beautiful as you
look in pictures,

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.420 align:middle line:90%
you're more beautiful in person.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.190 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, I can see where that
radiance just totally lit you

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.990 align:middle line:90%
up.

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.590 align:middle line:90%
>> MARCUS: It did.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.464 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so then
you went on a journey.

00:02:27.464 --> 00:02:29.280 align:middle line:90%
And it's been interesting.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.320 align:middle line:84%
Such a broad swath of experience
that came into your lives

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.690 align:middle line:84%
by finally connecting
with someone that you're

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.229 align:middle line:90%
meant to be with.

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that's the holy grail

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.850 align:middle line:84%
for a lot of people
that never have

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.830 align:middle line:90%
that opportunity in a given--

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.450 align:middle line:90%
that don't in a given lifetime.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.700 align:middle line:84%
But again, they're
lifetimes after lifetimes.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And we're working
on different things

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.960 align:middle line:84%
and experiencing different
things in each time.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And I just want
you to comment on

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.310 align:middle line:84%
that about not every time you're
going to be with that soul

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.220 align:middle line:90%
mate, twin flame person.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.510 align:middle line:90%
But that's OK.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.640 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEILA: It is OK, because the
soul chooses perfectly what it

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.140 align:middle line:84%
wants to learn from and work
with and whom to work with.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.250 align:middle line:84%
For THEO talks about that
groups incarnate together

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.590 align:middle line:90%
to support each other's growth.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.230 align:middle line:90%
And so we get in relationships.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.620 align:middle line:84%
Where do we learn most
but in relationships.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.770 align:middle line:84%
THEO said, if you live alone
you can always be right.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.930 align:middle line:84%
You have nobody to
give you the contrast

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.180 align:middle line:90%
of a different opinion.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.590 align:middle line:84%
So of course, when we
come into an incarnation,

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.000 align:middle line:90%
it's to be involved with others.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.060 align:middle line:90%
You know, humans are animals.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.110 align:middle line:90%
They're herd animals.

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.680 align:middle line:84%
They want to be together
in community and family

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.650 align:middle line:84%
and have that interaction,
because the learning is

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.330 align:middle line:90%
emotions.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.395 align:middle line:90%
And that's where we best learn.

00:03:53.395 --> 00:03:54.270 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's true.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.645 align:middle line:84%
And we may come into
a relationship that

00:03:57.645 --> 00:04:00.270 align:middle line:84%
is a soul agreement, though our
conscious mind doesn't know it.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.760 align:middle line:84%
We think it's all
about love and bliss

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.350 align:middle line:84%
and happily ever
after, you know,

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.870 align:middle line:84%
when you were first starting
out and often even when we're

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.230 align:middle line:90%
getting married to someone.

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.650 align:middle line:84%
But in fact what we've
come together for on a soul

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.260 align:middle line:84%
level is entirely different
and to be revealed over time.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.060 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEILA: Yes.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And a lot of times
people come together really

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:22.470 align:middle line:84%
as a soul relationship to
bring other souls in as family

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.410 align:middle line:84%
and provide a safe,
growth-oriented experience

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.250 align:middle line:84%
for those other
people or not, right?

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.050 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEILA: True.

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.100 align:middle line:90%
True.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.100 align:middle line:84%
You know, we learn
most with the contrast.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And so at times when we
come in and, you know,

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.450 align:middle line:84%
the people say I want
to be with my soul mate.

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, soul family or soul
mate, you know, our soul mate

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.040 align:middle line:90%
could be our greatest teacher.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's not always
roses and happiness.

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.260 align:middle line:84%
It is challenge because
challenge is how we grow best.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.550 align:middle line:84%
If it's all roses
and wonderfulness,

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.240 align:middle line:84%
there's no contrast for us to
grow and expand and understand

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.871 align:middle line:84%
the human experience, which
our soul truly wants to have.

00:05:03.871 --> 00:05:05.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, and
that makes sense too,

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.180 align:middle line:84%
because if you're with someone
that your soul has really this

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.460 align:middle line:84%
deep commitment to finding,
hunting down, and being with,

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.860 align:middle line:84%
there is also a level of
intensity in it would keep you

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.350 align:middle line:84%
together long enough to go
through these really intense

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.030 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.380 align:middle line:90%
>> MARCUS: Well, exactly.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.262 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, THEO has
quoted the Dalai Lama

00:05:27.262 --> 00:05:28.720 align:middle line:84%
by saying that some
of these people

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.150 align:middle line:90%
are our sacred friends as well.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.400 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones that are
the catalyst for the highest

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.200 align:middle line:90%
growth.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.310 align:middle line:84%
And we choose, our soul does,
these different experiences

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.527 align:middle line:84%
for growth that can
be really intense.

00:05:41.527 --> 00:05:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And then you look back at them,
and you say, what in the world

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.860 align:middle line:84%
did I sign up for
that class for, right?

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.651 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you wouldn't
in your conscious mind

00:05:47.651 --> 00:05:49.535 align:middle line:84%
choose to have such a
challenging situation.

00:05:49.535 --> 00:05:50.826 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It could be abusive.

00:05:50.826 --> 00:05:53.920 align:middle line:84%
You could have entered the most
intense relationship that you

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.630 align:middle line:90%
absolutely just cannot avoid.

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.190 align:middle line:84%
It just keeps driving
you back to it.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.670 align:middle line:84%
It might be also your
most abusive relationship.

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:02.650 align:middle line:84%
And that is a really
hard pill for someone

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.050 align:middle line:84%
to swallow often
times, because that

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.360 align:middle line:84%
is the one thing that is
going to give you the most

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.850 align:middle line:90%
rapid opportunity for growth.

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.308 align:middle line:84%
>> MARCUS: Well, and not to
judge yourself for choosing it.

00:06:11.308 --> 00:06:12.490 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:13.490 align:middle line:90%
That's a big one.

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.323 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEILA: Well, and
in that growth process,

00:06:15.323 --> 00:06:17.860 align:middle line:84%
we get to learn how to
hold our boundaries,

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.810 align:middle line:90%
how to love ourselves.

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.870 align:middle line:84%
You know, that whole saying,
love yourself and then others

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.190 align:middle line:90%
as yourself.

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:25.070 align:middle line:90%
That's hard to do.

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:26.650 align:middle line:84%
That's been a
saying, that's been

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.430 align:middle line:84%
a teaching around for century
after century after century.

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.880 align:middle line:84%
But now is the time that
we get to really express

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:39.160 align:middle line:84%
that and learn about it, because
the relationship that we must

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.900 align:middle line:90%
have is with ourself first.

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:46.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we are with each
other, to mirror to each other

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.180 align:middle line:90%
that difference of opinion.

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:53.110 align:middle line:10%
Or even as you said, it could be
a most abusive and challenging

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.805 align:middle line:10%
relationship, because we have
to stand in our own integrity

00:06:56.805 --> 00:06:58.690 align:middle line:10%
and authenticity.

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And the gift we give
others in our lives

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:08.320 align:middle line:84%
is our truth and our ability to
know that we are divine master

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.690 align:middle line:84%
beings having this
human experience,

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:12.610 align:middle line:90%
being in these human bodies.

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:16.360 align:middle line:84%
And when we get that,
things changed dramatically.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.120 align:middle line:84%
The trajectory of
our life changes.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.470 align:middle line:84%
And then our
relationships change.

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:22.480 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.280 align:middle line:90%
Very true.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And now, I said the word
nuance in the very beginning.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:26.620 align:middle line:90%
This is nuance.

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.620 align:middle line:84%
You can end up in a
profound relationship,

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.780 align:middle line:84%
say, that's abusive,
that's meant

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:36.010 align:middle line:84%
to be for you to learn about
sovereignty and boundaries

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:38.170 align:middle line:84%
and standing up for
yourself and the like.

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And there's sometimes
just through patterning,

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.970 align:middle line:84%
subconscious, or
weakness of will,

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:44.980 align:middle line:84%
you keep tripping
into the same thing.

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:45.695 align:middle line:84%
>> MARCUS: But it's
an old patterning.

00:07:45.695 --> 00:07:46.940 align:middle line:90%
It's an old way of being.

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:47.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's
an old patterning.

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:49.498 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessarily-- I'm
not saying everyone that's

00:07:49.498 --> 00:07:51.260 align:middle line:84%
in that kind of
intense situation

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.950 align:middle line:84%
that that's your soul
partner and your soul friend.

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:57.469 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it just has to do
with subconscious repetition.

00:07:57.469 --> 00:08:00.010 align:middle line:84%
>> MARCUS: Well, and a lot of
people continue to repeat those

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:03.580 align:middle line:84%
pairings until they realize they
don't have to do that anymore.

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:05.770 align:middle line:84%
They realize the core
circumstance that

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:08.530 align:middle line:84%
created whatever that
need is that they think

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:11.090 align:middle line:84%
is going to be filled
by someone else.

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:12.730 align:middle line:84%
So THEO talks about
the new paradigm

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:15.880 align:middle line:84%
being relationships of need
are no longer fruitful for us

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.290 align:middle line:90%
at all, but rather preference.

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:19.240 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Preference,
exactly, because, say,

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.150 align:middle line:84%
you've been in this pattern,
you know a negative pattern

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:24.989 align:middle line:84%
in relationships, and
you finally have the aha.

00:08:24.989 --> 00:08:27.280 align:middle line:84%
You stand up for yourself
and say hey, what am I doing?

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.710 align:middle line:90%
I don't need this anymore.

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:30.400 align:middle line:90%
And you start saying no to that.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And then it allows
perhaps the possibility

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:35.500 align:middle line:84%
for a different kind of
soul mate to come in.

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.590 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't mean
the lessons are over.

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:38.390 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEILA: No.

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:38.659 align:middle line:90%
>> MARCUS: Never.

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:40.230 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEILA: No, it doesn't.

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:41.380 align:middle line:90%
But they're different.

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:42.770 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They're different.

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:44.150 align:middle line:90%
They may not be as painful.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:45.430 align:middle line:90%
It might be more subtle.

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:48.010 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEILA: Well, we have
different lenses to view life

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:49.660 align:middle line:90%
through when that happens.

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:52.240 align:middle line:84%
You know THEO talks
about soul integration

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.820 align:middle line:90%
and releasing limiting beliefs.

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And what you're talking
about are these patterns

00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:59.860 align:middle line:84%
in relationship that
come from a belief

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:01.630 align:middle line:84%
that we're not
worthy or good enough

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:04.870 align:middle line:84%
to have an unconditional,
loving relationship.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:08.290 align:middle line:10%
When we get that
revelation, that aha,

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:14.740 align:middle line:10%
that we are worthy of having
a loving, unconditional loving

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:18.190 align:middle line:10%
relationship, then it changes.

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:21.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's in that
beliefs can be changed.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.500 align:middle line:90%
History won't be changed.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.020 align:middle line:90%
Events happen.

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:28.510 align:middle line:84%
They're the same, but our
perception of them changes.

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And our perception
about ourselves change.

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens, we
draw into our life experience

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:39.670 align:middle line:84%
relationships that will
reflect that change.

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:42.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Right, and then
you're learning at that level.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:42.370 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEILA: Yes.

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:45.070 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that might be
a much more comfortable level

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:46.120 align:middle line:90%
in a lot of ways.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.450 align:middle line:84%
But it might be that it
takes almost more courage,

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:52.900 align:middle line:84%
because now you have to dig
down into the profound, subtle

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:55.060 align:middle line:84%
things that aren't going
to beat you over the head,

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:56.724 align:middle line:84%
but nevertheless
cause pain within us.

00:09:56.724 --> 00:09:58.640 align:middle line:84%
>> MARCUS: Yeah, but it
can be a lot more fun.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.181 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But you
can have more fun.

00:10:00.181 --> 00:10:01.390 align:middle line:90%
You can have more love.

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:03.849 align:middle line:84%
You can have all of the
support along the way.

00:10:03.849 --> 00:10:05.890 align:middle line:84%
>> MARCUS: And you can
have spiritual and psychic

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:09.820 align:middle line:84%
experiences together, which
really augment the physical

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:11.770 align:middle line:84%
attraction, or whatever
the attraction may be.

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:13.603 align:middle line:84%
And now you're having
these experiences that

00:10:13.603 --> 00:10:16.840 align:middle line:84%
are multidimensional, soul
level experiences together,

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.744 align:middle line:84%
you know, collapsing
time and space,

00:10:18.744 --> 00:10:20.160 align:middle line:84%
for instance, and
having past life

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.860 align:middle line:84%
recalls simultaneously
together, which happened.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.434 align:middle line:90%
On our first date it happened.

00:10:24.434 --> 00:10:26.100 align:middle line:84%
So those are the kinds
of things that we

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:30.270 align:middle line:84%
want to inspire people to know
are possible in relationship.

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:33.180 align:middle line:84%
Because if you intend it and
believe it and just start

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:36.580 align:middle line:84%
having fun with it-- and we go
into meditation after we began

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:37.380 align:middle line:90%
dating--

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:40.420 align:middle line:84%
actually, we weren't
even really dating.

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:42.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I asked her what she
wanted to do on the second day.

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:44.055 align:middle line:90%
And she said, I don't date.

00:10:44.055 --> 00:10:46.690 align:middle line:90%
So we got engaged.

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:49.740 align:middle line:84%
But to know that you
have the opportunity

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.360 align:middle line:84%
to have those kinds
of connections

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.390 align:middle line:84%
and those kinds of
spiritual, what we call,

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:56.819 align:middle line:84%
peak spiritual experiences
is so much fun.

00:10:56.819 --> 00:10:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of a new
paradigm in relationships.

00:10:58.860 --> 00:10:59.660 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It is.

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:01.534 align:middle line:84%
And still, even with
that-- and I keep

00:11:01.534 --> 00:11:03.450 align:middle line:84%
pounding this home for
a reason because people

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:05.700 align:middle line:84%
need to not beat
themselves up over what

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.100 align:middle line:84%
we've drawn into our lives
regarding relationships.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.870 align:middle line:84%
There's always a
chance for renewal.

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:12.780 align:middle line:90%
But there's always the chance--

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:16.592 align:middle line:84%
the responsibility
for growth as well.

00:11:16.592 --> 00:11:18.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even with you
two, you can't just

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.665 align:middle line:84%
sit back and be
lazy all of a sudden

00:11:19.665 --> 00:11:21.330 align:middle line:84%
and say, I've got
this one dialed in.

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:22.590 align:middle line:84%
>> MARCUS: We're
learning all the time.

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:23.590 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEILA: All the time.

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:25.500 align:middle line:84%
>> MARCUS: We are each
other's best teachers.

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:26.510 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: There you go.

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:27.070 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEILA: Yes.

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:27.890 align:middle line:90%
>> MARCUS: We are.

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:28.890 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEILA: But it's fun.

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:32.730 align:middle line:84%
It's not that, oh, my god,
I can't do this anymore.

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:36.240 align:middle line:84%
It's like waking up having
gratitude for that opportunity

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.000 align:middle line:84%
and saying, what are we
going to learn today?

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.760 align:middle line:84%
You know, looking forward
to the opportunities

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.550 align:middle line:84%
of learning rather
than resisting them

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:47.190 align:middle line:90%
and being afraid of them.

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:52.920 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And having a partner
that understands the beauty

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:57.540 align:middle line:84%
in growth, just the beauty
and the necessity to continue

00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:59.400 align:middle line:90%
growing and expanding.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's something--
for me, that's

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:04.320 align:middle line:84%
taken quite a long time in my
lifetime to get to the point

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.350 align:middle line:84%
where I didn't find
the process of growth

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:10.920 align:middle line:84%
on some level at least a
little painful, you know,

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.810 align:middle line:84%
and crawl back into
my little hidey hole,

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:15.030 align:middle line:84%
like the little kitten
under the porch, you know.

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:17.430 align:middle line:84%
Much more comfortable
to hide, rather than

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:21.482 align:middle line:84%
have to be fully vulnerable
and reveal yourself to someone.

00:12:21.482 --> 00:12:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And we're all afraid
of being vulnerable.

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:25.356 align:middle line:84%
But once you begin that
process and the other person

00:12:25.356 --> 00:12:28.714 align:middle line:84%
is still standing
there with you,

00:12:28.714 --> 00:12:31.130 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there's anything
more sacred on this planet,

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:33.660 align:middle line:84%
even if that is
a little painful.

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:35.500 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEILA: I totally agree.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.860 align:middle line:84%
I totally agree with
that, because that's

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:39.850 align:middle line:84%
how we're meant to
be with each other,

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:43.430 align:middle line:84%
in our primary relationship,
but in all relationships.

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:47.040 align:middle line:84%
You know, THEO talks about the
new paradigm of relationship

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:51.570 align:middle line:84%
being preferential, not needy,
because the old way of being

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:53.250 align:middle line:90%
is the woundedness.

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And one person was attracted
to the woundedness in another

00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:01.020 align:middle line:84%
with the subconscious belief
that if I take care of you,

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:02.340 align:middle line:90%
you'll take care of me.

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And that never works, because
it's an inside out job.

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:10.530 align:middle line:84%
We have to do the inner work,
the inner process of realizing

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:13.710 align:middle line:84%
that we're worthy of the
love we're seeking and being

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:17.650 align:middle line:84%
of that vibrational
frequency to attract it.

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:18.682 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:13:18.682 --> 00:13:19.890 align:middle line:90%
No, that makes perfect sense.

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:21.896 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise you have
two wounded lovers

00:13:21.896 --> 00:13:24.270 align:middle line:84%
just kind of stabbing around
in the dark hoping something

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:25.170 align:middle line:90%
decent will happen.

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:26.350 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEILA: And reacting.

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:28.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Reacting,
just constantly reactive.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.680 align:middle line:84%
>> MARCUS: And repeating old
patterns over and over again.

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.044 align:middle line:84%
And drawing unto
yourself that which you--

00:13:34.044 --> 00:13:35.460 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the
day, you're only

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:38.070 align:middle line:84%
going to draw to yourself that
which you believe you deserve.

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:38.700 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>> MARCUS: So once you start
to shift those worthiness,

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:42.598 align:middle line:84%
those beliefs of not
being worthy enough,

00:13:42.598 --> 00:13:43.680 align:middle line:90%
not being loved enough--

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.900 align:middle line:84%
and this is what THEO soul
integration process is all

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:46.700 align:middle line:90%
about--

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:49.170 align:middle line:84%
in moving into empowered
beliefs about the self

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:50.580 align:middle line:84%
and loving the
self, you'll start

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.480 align:middle line:84%
to attract those kinds
of relationships.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.401 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And then it becomes
a choice, like you say.

00:13:55.401 --> 00:13:57.150 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEILA: And it's
not just, like I said,

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:58.500 align:middle line:90%
the primary relationship.

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:02.220 align:middle line:84%
You'll notice your
relationships, friendships,

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:04.440 align:middle line:84%
work relationships,
all relationships

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:08.010 align:middle line:84%
are affected by
that as we realize

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:11.730 align:middle line:84%
that we are divine
master beings worthy

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:14.744 align:middle line:84%
of unconditional,
loving relationships.

00:14:14.744 --> 00:14:15.660 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:18.270 align:middle line:84%
>> MARCUS: And you really
establish and maintain healthy

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:21.480 align:middle line:84%
boundaries, so that there's
that owning the power,

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.870 align:middle line:84%
not giving your power away
for acceptance sake of others.

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:24.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:26.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean for me
personally that's

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:29.160 align:middle line:84%
been the thing my whole life
is just kind of coming in

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.420 align:middle line:90%
with almost no boundaries.

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And it really has taken a long
time to develop boundaries.

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:38.035 align:middle line:84%
You know, you'd
think it would be--

00:14:38.035 --> 00:14:40.410 align:middle line:84%
you'd think someone would
teach you those things for one.

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:42.750 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEILA: Well, we've
been taught the opposite.

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:46.590 align:middle line:84%
We've been taught to give our
power away to someone else.

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:48.340 align:middle line:90%
Be nice.

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:51.440 align:middle line:90%
Don't make waves.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.720 align:middle line:84%
The perfect example is it's
not what we say to somebody,

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.520 align:middle line:90%
it's how we say it.

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:59.100 align:middle line:90%
You know, in a reactive state--

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:01.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to use the example
about going to dinner.

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:02.970 align:middle line:90%
You're with friends.

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And somebody says,
I would really

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:08.850 align:middle line:90%
like to go for Chinese food.

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And you really don't
like Chinese food.

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:15.370 align:middle line:84%
In the past, you see people
go, I hate Chinese food.

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:16.500 align:middle line:90%
Do we have to do that?

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.430 align:middle line:90%
That kind of attitude.

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:20.380 align:middle line:84%
Instead of saying,
well, that wouldn't

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:22.510 align:middle line:90%
be my first preference.

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:24.460 align:middle line:84%
Could we maybe
decide on something

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:27.430 align:middle line:90%
that we all could enjoy?

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:29.530 align:middle line:84%
It's such a different
thing, but that's

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:35.650 align:middle line:84%
coming from a response
rather than a reactive place.

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:38.290 align:middle line:84%
Because it's these
little parts of ourselves

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:43.270 align:middle line:84%
that have belief we're not
worthy that begin reacting

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:47.140 align:middle line:84%
from that kind of
angry, somebody

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:50.560 align:middle line:84%
is doing something to
me attitude and when

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:55.300 align:middle line:84%
we find in ourselves that
center point in ourselves where

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:58.340 align:middle line:90%
we can respond and not react.

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:00.550 align:middle line:84%
>> MARCUS: Or you just
acquiescence and say sure even

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:02.980 align:middle line:90%
though you don't want to do it.

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:04.510 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I'm,
yes person, right.

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:08.020 align:middle line:84%
So I think, I
don't want Chinese,

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:10.570 align:middle line:84%
but there has to be
something on the menu.

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:11.470 align:middle line:90%
I do like broccoli.

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:13.594 align:middle line:84%
I'll find something with
broccoli and make it work.

00:16:13.594 --> 00:16:15.720 align:middle line:84%
And you just make it
work all the time, right?

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:16.520 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEILA: Right.

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:19.054 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you
know, on one level--

00:16:19.054 --> 00:16:20.470 align:middle line:84%
there are different
levels of that

00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:22.330 align:middle line:84%
in terms of just
being accommodating

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:23.920 align:middle line:84%
versus actually not
having self-worth

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.740 align:middle line:84%
and thinking you don't deserve
a say in the situation.

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And again, that's very kind
of nuanced in its breakdown

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:31.030 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:34.930 align:middle line:84%
So well, OK, on this
note, what I'd like to do,

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:37.990 align:middle line:84%
if you're ready to go,
is we'll go to THEO.

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:42.160 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of crazy
questions to ask them

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.980 align:middle line:84%
about love and a lot
of different forms

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:47.700 align:middle line:84%
and historical patterns
of love and such.

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And I think this
time, Marcus, you're

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:51.729 align:middle line:84%
going to jump in with a
couple of questions too.

00:16:51.729 --> 00:16:53.770 align:middle line:84%
>> MARCUS: I'm going to
follow your lead and look

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:55.320 align:middle line:84%
for opportunities to
expand the information.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:55.900 align:middle line:90%
That's what we'll do.

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:57.970 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, so we'll both
talk to THEO for a little

00:16:57.970 --> 00:16:58.330 align:middle line:90%
while.

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:00.246 align:middle line:84%
And we'll save a little
bit of time at the end

00:17:00.246 --> 00:17:04.250 align:middle line:84%
so we can come back and
debrief and see you again.

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:05.500 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEILA: Oh, I'd love that.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.869 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So we're going
to just take a moment.

00:17:07.869 --> 00:17:10.329 align:middle line:84%
And then when we
come back, Sheila

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:12.238 align:middle line:84%
will be connected
with the THEO group.

00:17:12.238 --> 00:17:15.660 align:middle line:90%


00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.880 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: It is the
beginning, is it not?

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It is.

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:21.660 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: We are appreciative
of the opportunity to be

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:23.010 align:middle line:90%
of service onto you.

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:24.150 align:middle line:90%
You may ask.

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:25.275 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thank you, THEO.

00:17:25.275 --> 00:17:27.420 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for coming
here on this day of love

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:28.860 align:middle line:90%
and relationship.

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:32.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of the confusing
things that often happens

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:33.630 align:middle line:84%
to people when
they meet, they'll

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:38.160 align:middle line:84%
feel this big charge of
recognition that may not

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.290 align:middle line:84%
be signaling that you're
to be together now,

00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:42.780 align:middle line:84%
but maybe you've been
together in the past.

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:44.770 align:middle line:90%
And people become very confused.

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:46.520 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you're even
married to other people.

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:48.840 align:middle line:84%
It's like, ah, I
know this person.

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.910 align:middle line:84%
I feel like we're
supposed to be together.

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:52.742 align:middle line:84%
When that's not really
the soul agreement.

00:17:52.742 --> 00:17:54.450 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
this whole phenomenon?

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:56.980 align:middle line:84%
Because we've had so many
lives in our soul tribes

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:57.780 align:middle line:90%
with each other.

00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:01.390 align:middle line:84%
We've been married to each
other, parents to each other.

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:02.980 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: Yes, that's true.

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:04.170 align:middle line:90%
And there is a recognition.

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:07.410 align:middle line:84%
If you think in
terms of a lifetime

00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:11.370 align:middle line:84%
and the tens of thousands of
people you cross paths with,

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:14.250 align:middle line:84%
how many are you
truly attracted to?

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:18.280 align:middle line:84%
Very few compared
to the numbers.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:21.270 align:middle line:84%
So when there is an attraction,
as you speak about it,

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:23.010 align:middle line:90%
there is a soul recognition.

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:25.850 align:middle line:90%


00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:31.430 align:middle line:84%
But many will immediately think
I must be with this person,

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:36.860 align:middle line:84%
rather than allowing it
to evolve into a fuller

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:41.570 align:middle line:90%
recognition of that connection.

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:44.420 align:middle line:90%
So it's mindfulness, isn't it?

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:48.320 align:middle line:84%
Being aware, being centered
in self, soul centered

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:51.290 align:middle line:90%
that allows that reflection.

00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:53.630 align:middle line:84%
For now in this time
of relationship--

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:55.340 align:middle line:90%
the old paradigm was need.

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:58.280 align:middle line:90%
The new, preferential.

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And males and females
can be friends.

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:07.040 align:middle line:84%
Does not mean they have
to be in relationship

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:10.010 align:middle line:90%
committed to each other.

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:13.790 align:middle line:84%
They can be friends
in that commitment

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:16.920 align:middle line:90%
and expressing as friends do.

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:17.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:18.740 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:21.255 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes that
that recognition is so,

00:19:21.255 --> 00:19:22.880 align:middle line:84%
and especially in
the New Age movement,

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.690 align:middle line:84%
like, oh I know,
this is my soul mate.

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:25.490 align:middle line:90%
I can feel.

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:26.699 align:middle line:90%
I can feel it.

00:19:26.699 --> 00:19:28.490 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was your
husband in your last time

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:30.090 align:middle line:90%
or your wife or your child.

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:33.680 align:middle line:84%
And what would you
suggest to people

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.930 align:middle line:84%
to guide them through
that process of awareness

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:39.530 align:middle line:84%
or recognition so you just
jump the gun and sabotage

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:41.990 align:middle line:84%
your existing life to be with
this person you've simply

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:43.980 align:middle line:90%
recognized?

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:47.900 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: So again, being aware.

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:49.100 align:middle line:90%
Fully being aware.

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:50.600 align:middle line:90%
And at times that can happen.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And the other one will not
respond in that same way.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.760 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.020 align:middle line:90%
That does occur as well.

00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:01.850 align:middle line:84%
But there's confusion
about soul mates.

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:05.230 align:middle line:90%
Humans romanticize them.

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:07.490 align:middle line:84%
Soul mates, or
soul family, are on

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:10.460 align:middle line:90%
the same vibrational frequency.

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:13.910 align:middle line:84%
Meaning you're
aligned vibrationally,

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:16.070 align:middle line:84%
which allows you to
have conversations

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:21.630 align:middle line:84%
at a particular level of
availability and understanding.

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:22.457 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:20:22.457 --> 00:20:23.830 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm, hm.

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:27.980 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: And allowing it
to develop, as it would,

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:31.655 align:middle line:90%
naturally, not to be forced.

00:20:31.655 --> 00:20:33.110 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That makes sense.

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:35.740 align:middle line:84%
Yet in our old
programming in this world,

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:37.230 align:middle line:90%
often times people--

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:39.750 align:middle line:84%
say, you're in a relationship
with someone else

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:41.690 align:middle line:84%
and not when you're
single, you can

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:43.199 align:middle line:90%
see that a little more easily.

00:20:43.199 --> 00:20:45.240 align:middle line:84%
But say you're in relationship
with someone else.

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And one of these wonderful
people comes into your life

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:48.770 align:middle line:84%
that you've known,
wonderful in that

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:51.270 align:middle line:84%
you have that vibrational
connection with each other,

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:52.070 align:middle line:90%
comes along.

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And you just feel compelled,
you must spend time together

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:55.520 align:middle line:90%
and be friends.

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:57.436 align:middle line:84%
And the other person
feels threatened by that.

00:20:57.436 --> 00:20:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And jealousies and
such start popping in,

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:02.150 align:middle line:84%
because this is pretty
common in this world.

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:04.080 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: It is common.

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:07.490 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we're
saying, take a deep breath

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:10.580 align:middle line:90%
and get a sense about self.

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:15.380 align:middle line:84%
Most often those that jump
are ready to jump anyway.

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:17.420 align:middle line:90%
They're not being fulfilled.

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And they're looking for that
kind of electric experience

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:24.740 align:middle line:90%
and recognition.

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:25.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:26.660 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:28.400 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: And that's
all external.

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:35.210 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: So what we would
impress upon you is to go

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:39.890 align:middle line:84%
inside and ask the
questions, is this true?

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:42.060 align:middle line:90%
Where is this coming from?

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:47.180 align:middle line:84%
Is it coming from need
rather than preference?

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:51.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Very good
deciding factor.

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:55.640 align:middle line:84%
What about the notion of
some lineages of thought

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:58.250 align:middle line:84%
believe that we only
incarnate as one sex

00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:00.050 align:middle line:84%
throughout our
incarnation history.

00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:01.850 align:middle line:84%
Others believe
that we dominantly

00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:06.530 align:middle line:84%
choose one sex over the other
on Earth life in particular,

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:08.420 align:middle line:84%
that we dominantly
incarnate through,

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:11.210 align:middle line:84%
but then have some
experiences of the other sex.

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And some believe that you're
back and forth all over.

00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:16.100 align:middle line:84%
From your point of
view or what you

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:18.680 align:middle line:84%
see, what are our
patterns in terms

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:20.735 align:middle line:90%
of choosing male versus female?

00:22:20.735 --> 00:22:23.990 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: It depends on the soul.

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:26.810 align:middle line:84%
One cannot judge another soul's
path for you know not what

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:29.840 align:middle line:84%
they're greater
learning is to be.

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:33.680 align:middle line:84%
So the soul chooses
how they are going

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:40.980 align:middle line:84%
to navigate from what
gender upon this planet.

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And so choosing, you
see, for that embodiment,

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:50.780 align:middle line:84%
some would be
predominate male, some.

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:52.510 align:middle line:90%
Others female.

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:58.550 align:middle line:84%
Or some would choose to do
both at different times.

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:02.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So there's
no set path to that?

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:03.676 align:middle line:84%
Every soul is different
in whether it--

00:23:03.676 --> 00:23:04.475 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: Yes.

00:23:04.475 --> 00:23:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: To have a dominant
incarnation kind of trajectory

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:08.580 align:middle line:90%
sexually.

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:09.740 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: Correct.

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:13.340 align:middle line:84%
>> MARCUS: THEO, let's go kind
of to the foundation of all

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:14.140 align:middle line:90%
this.

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And that is your
teachings on really loving

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:19.750 align:middle line:84%
yourself first and everything
emanating from the self-love.

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:21.040 align:middle line:90%
And how important is it?

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And how do we get to
that place of self-love?

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:29.830 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: It is by recognition
of these patterns that keep

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:35.010 align:middle line:84%
repeating in one's life at
recognizing the fragmented

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:40.030 align:middle line:84%
aspects of the soul, the
little orphans we call them,

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:43.770 align:middle line:84%
that are reactive to life
situations and circumstance

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:49.260 align:middle line:84%
by beliefs that have been
adopted or created in certain

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:52.700 align:middle line:90%
times for survival sake.

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:59.630 align:middle line:84%
So when one has a
revelation within that

00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:03.320 align:middle line:84%
through their
reactivity communicating

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:07.280 align:middle line:84%
with that part of self or
being revealed the situation

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:10.970 align:middle line:84%
circumstance that occurred
for a belief of not being

00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:16.790 align:middle line:90%
worthy or lovable came forth.

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:19.585 align:middle line:84%
Then the higher
self, the adult self,

00:24:19.585 --> 00:24:24.860 align:middle line:84%
can sooth, comfort, and love
that part of self that holds

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:26.244 align:middle line:90%
that belief and change it.

00:24:26.244 --> 00:24:28.910 align:middle line:84%
>> MARCUS: And these are beliefs
that have been adopted that are

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:31.107 align:middle line:84%
really not true and not
our own, aren't they?

00:24:31.107 --> 00:24:31.907 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: Correct.

00:24:31.907 --> 00:24:34.549 align:middle line:90%


00:24:34.549 --> 00:24:36.840 align:middle line:84%
>> MARCUS: And there's
something interesting too, THEO,

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:39.180 align:middle line:84%
that you've said recently,
frequently actually.

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And that is it
for us not to love

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:42.630 align:middle line:90%
ourselves is to be arrogant.

00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:44.715 align:middle line:90%
Can you speak to that?

00:24:44.715 --> 00:24:49.500 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: If, in fact, you
are a divine master being,

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:52.960 align:middle line:84%
it is arrogant to think
you are lesser than that.

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.460 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Most people would
think it's the other way around

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.150 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:24:57.150 --> 00:24:58.980 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: Of course.

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:01.680 align:middle line:84%
But one is not
greater than another.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.870 align:middle line:90%
And you talk of your oneness.

00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:06.590 align:middle line:90%
It is lip service, isn't it?

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:08.940 align:middle line:90%
But it is true.

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:12.390 align:middle line:90%
You are one with source.

00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:17.400 align:middle line:84%
You are the emanation in earthly
plane, physical structure,

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:22.940 align:middle line:84%
but you are connected and
vibrating as one with source.

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:27.890 align:middle line:84%
Force, god, whatever you
wish to speak of it as.

00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:34.220 align:middle line:84%
Even you speak I am when you
speak your name, do you not?

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:39.840 align:middle line:84%
The I am is god, the
god of you expressing

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:42.200 align:middle line:90%
in this human experience.

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:43.550 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's very well put.

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:47.210 align:middle line:84%
It makes it really
visceral for people.

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:50.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to continue by asking
a few of the kind of nuances

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:53.840 align:middle line:84%
that have happened to us in
terms of masculine feminine

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:56.390 align:middle line:84%
and relationships and how
they've become distorted

00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:57.720 align:middle line:90%
along the way.

00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:00.380 align:middle line:84%
And one of them that I
find kind of fascinating

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:02.510 align:middle line:84%
is that through
history, because we've

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:08.670 align:middle line:84%
had this penchant for violence
and war and destruction,

00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:12.620 align:middle line:84%
many men throughout history
have been cloistered, thrown

00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:17.480 align:middle line:84%
together with other men in very
traumatic situations, lifetime

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:20.210 align:middle line:84%
after lifetime,
really depriving them

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:23.790 align:middle line:84%
of the feminine
influence in their lives.

00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:25.820 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about what
the net effect of that

00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:29.480 align:middle line:84%
has been on the
males that dominantly

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:33.050 align:middle line:90%
incarnate as males on humanity?

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:37.640 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: Then it is all
about control, isn't it?

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And who can lead and
who's in charge, yes?

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:49.880 align:middle line:84%
So there is that alpha
feeling that you speak about,

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:54.000 align:middle line:84%
of the strongest will
control the masses.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And there's a competition
for that role.

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:01.710 align:middle line:84%
All animals have
had that, have they

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:07.310 align:middle line:84%
are not in a male
dominated energy?

00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:14.670 align:middle line:84%
But what is occurring now
is a balance within that.

00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:17.000 align:middle line:84%
But in that male
dominance, there

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.880 align:middle line:84%
has been this fuller expression
of violence and control,

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:26.540 align:middle line:84%
or survival of the
fittest, you might say.

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:30.050 align:middle line:84%
And as you watch the
animals of the Earth, that

00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:32.260 align:middle line:90%
has been true as well, yes?

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:34.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm, hm.

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And along the way
what happens is

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:39.220 align:middle line:84%
that the women become more
of a notion of property

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:44.290 align:middle line:84%
or a possession under that
control dominated paradigm.

00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And you've come into
many ancient cultures,

00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:49.510 align:middle line:84%
for example, where a
man had a lot of wives.

00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:52.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've heard this
spoken of through past life

00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:55.430 align:middle line:84%
reflections in many ways
of what that world looked

00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:56.230 align:middle line:90%
like at that time.

00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:57.760 align:middle line:84%
It still exists in
this world today.

00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:58.619 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: It does.

00:27:58.619 --> 00:28:00.910 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so can you
talk about that a little bit,

00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:05.350 align:middle line:84%
the notion of having
multiple wives?

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:08.440 align:middle line:90%


00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:11.042 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: So that was
procreation as well, yes?

00:28:11.042 --> 00:28:12.460 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm, hm.

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:15.880 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: And to be cared for.

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:22.670 align:middle line:84%
And so the women in the tribe
became a unit to themselves.

00:28:22.670 --> 00:28:23.800 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:29.940 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, they controlled
more than the men thought,

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:32.300 align:middle line:90%
interestingly enough.

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:34.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, there was
strength in numbers there.

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:36.980 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: There was, yes.

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:40.980 align:middle line:84%
However, the control from
the male to the women

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:44.590 align:middle line:84%
was because of their
size and strength.

00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:49.725 align:middle line:84%
And therein you had that threat
that they would be harmed.

00:28:49.725 --> 00:28:52.230 align:middle line:90%


00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:55.320 align:middle line:84%
However, the women
taking it upon themselves

00:28:55.320 --> 00:29:01.380 align:middle line:84%
to be quite intuitive
would use their intuition

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:06.630 align:middle line:84%
and their abilities to truly
be in control of the male.

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:10.440 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And it seems that
when I hear some reflections

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.900 align:middle line:84%
from past lives of people
and such who've been in these

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:19.260 align:middle line:84%
situations there was also a
kind of general union or support

00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:23.130 align:middle line:84%
among the women in terms of,
not shouldering everything,

00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:27.210 align:middle line:84%
of sharing and
child-rearing and so forth,

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:30.870 align:middle line:84%
but also that they were
depending on who the man was

00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:33.780 align:middle line:84%
and his situation and his own
level of heart or not heart

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:36.270 align:middle line:90%
and no heart.

00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:38.100 align:middle line:84%
Again, as you say,
this idea you have

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:41.550 align:middle line:84%
someone who has no home
being taken into the tribe

00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:43.510 align:middle line:90%
or taken into that household.

00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:46.890 align:middle line:84%
So there was it sounds
like also oftentimes

00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:49.560 align:middle line:84%
there might have been a saving
grace in that for a woman

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:54.420 align:middle line:84%
to now have extended family by
virtue of this polyamorists,

00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:55.770 align:middle line:90%
you might say, situation.

00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:56.730 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: Yes.

00:29:56.730 --> 00:30:06.150 align:middle line:84%
It all boils down to
survival ultimately

00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:08.857 align:middle line:90%
in the human experience.

00:30:08.857 --> 00:30:11.190 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So what if you
take this situation as we move

00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:15.030 align:middle line:84%
into modern time and the
advent of romantic love

00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:18.840 align:middle line:84%
and the nuclear family, and
parting out then even later

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:21.750 align:middle line:84%
in the last just
really few decades,

00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:25.380 align:middle line:84%
separating ourselves out into
single home, single families,

00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:27.320 align:middle line:84%
and not living an
extended family,

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:30.660 align:middle line:84%
even within our blood family,
for example, any longer.

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:32.730 align:middle line:84%
Looking at it from
your perspective,

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:36.750 align:middle line:84%
going from these larger tribal
familiar patterns, whether it

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:42.210 align:middle line:84%
was polygamy or it was simply
a multi-generational family

00:30:42.210 --> 00:30:47.850 align:middle line:84%
living together, what has
been the opportunity but also

00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:52.380 align:middle line:84%
perhaps a detriment in becoming
a solo nuclear family, alone,

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:54.150 align:middle line:90%
parents and children?

00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:57.020 align:middle line:10%
>> THEO: So what has occurred is
a bit of separation, hasn't it?

00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:58.350 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Mm, hm.

00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:02.680 align:middle line:10%
>> THEO: Separation from
community and connectivity.

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:06.090 align:middle line:84%
But that will be
retrieved again as there

00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:08.130 align:middle line:84%
is this evolution
of awareness that

00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:13.780 align:middle line:84%
comes as each person recognizes
their own mastery, if you

00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:18.980 align:middle line:84%
would, their own connectivity to
themselves and their divinity.

00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:22.110 align:middle line:84%
Then that returns
again in the presence

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:25.320 align:middle line:90%
of that awareness consciously.

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:31.800 align:middle line:84%
And compassion and sharing and
love for one another ensues.

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.490 align:middle line:84%
If all beings on your
planet would integrate

00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:38.610 align:middle line:84%
as we speak about it, you
would have peace in your world,

00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:41.550 align:middle line:84%
for you would treat
each other appropriately

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:43.840 align:middle line:90%
with love and compassion.

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:45.970 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So if I
hear you correctly,

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:48.390 align:middle line:84%
you're saying that the notion
of extended tribe, again,

00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:52.830 align:middle line:84%
or extended family, this will
also in a literal sense start

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:56.870 align:middle line:84%
coming back more
into our existence?

00:31:56.870 --> 00:32:02.670 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: Yes, because you are
one species on this planet.

00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:04.410 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, and
also economically,

00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:07.680 align:middle line:84%
most countries are having
so much trouble that older

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:10.620 align:middle line:84%
children and older parents and
then the next generation are

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:12.840 align:middle line:84%
all being forced to
live together again,

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:14.940 align:middle line:84%
which I see as a
beautiful thing.

00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:16.890 align:middle line:84%
I see this as a
great opportunity

00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:20.220 align:middle line:84%
to have more awareness and
knowledge and more consciously

00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:24.510 align:middle line:84%
live together than when you
had to by absolute necessity

00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:26.590 align:middle line:90%
decades or centuries ago.

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:28.440 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: Yes.

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:31.100 align:middle line:90%
It's coming to fruition.

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:38.160 align:middle line:84%
But it is preferential and
with better consciousness,

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:40.680 align:middle line:84%
for there's a heightened
awareness of who

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:47.640 align:middle line:84%
you are on a soul level that is
emerging now that wasn't then.

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:49.810 align:middle line:10%
>> MARCUS: And yet
we also have, THEO,

00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:53.917 align:middle line:10%
the dynamic of people looking
around at their nuclear family

00:32:53.917 --> 00:32:56.500 align:middle line:10%
as they get older saying, how
in the world or why in the world

00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:00.616 align:middle line:10%
did I pick this family
knowing that our soul chooses?

00:33:00.616 --> 00:33:02.740 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know who
these people are sometimes.

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:04.900 align:middle line:84%
They certainly can't
resonate with them sometimes.

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:06.380 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: That's true.

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:08.920 align:middle line:84%
However, understanding
that the soul chooses

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:14.800 align:middle line:84%
to come into the incarnation
and in a nuclear family,

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:18.220 align:middle line:84%
they may not all be
soulfully connected.

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:24.580 align:middle line:84%
They are there for a parent or a
sibling, but not for everybody.

00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:26.050 align:middle line:84%
And then there
are those families

00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:29.080 align:middle line:84%
that are soulfully
connected and soul family

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:33.890 align:middle line:84%
and have chosen to be together
and expressive in that way.

00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:37.150 align:middle line:90%
But each soul chooses.

00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And we hear often from humans,
I would not have chosen that.

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:43.340 align:middle line:90%
Ah, but you did.

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:44.620 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You did.

00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:47.230 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: And with
every experience,

00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:52.820 align:middle line:84%
everything that happens,
there is a gift, a blessing.

00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:57.400 align:middle line:84%
So we would encourage to look
for that, the strength that

00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:02.440 align:middle line:84%
comes within, and the ability
to have compassion for others

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:05.560 align:middle line:84%
in like circumstance,
and the story

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:10.389 align:middle line:84%
to be told of coming into
a higher state of being

00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:16.070 align:middle line:84%
through the experiences that one
has, not from being the victim,

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:20.129 align:middle line:84%
but from choosing an
opportunity of expansion.

00:34:20.129 --> 00:34:20.929 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:34:20.929 --> 00:34:23.710 align:middle line:84%
And these beings often that come
in without that soul connection

00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:26.440 align:middle line:84%
with the family would be
viewed, as we call it,

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:29.860 align:middle line:84%
as the black sheep of the
family and then often times

00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:34.570 align:middle line:84%
do feel kind of cast out,
misunderstood, victimized,

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:35.540 align:middle line:90%
and the like.

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:38.260 align:middle line:84%
But I remember one
time many years ago

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:42.560 align:middle line:84%
listening to the reading by
my beings of someone else

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:44.320 align:middle line:90%
and talking about their son.

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And they say, who
is this person?

00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:49.270 align:middle line:84%
He has nothing in
common with us.

00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:53.403 align:middle line:84%
And they said, you're not
part of a soul family.

00:34:53.403 --> 00:34:55.069 align:middle line:84%
You don't have any
previous connections.

00:34:55.069 --> 00:34:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And they said, what's
he doing in our lives?

00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And they said,
because you offered

00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:03.550 align:middle line:84%
a location, a possibility
in his expansion,

00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:07.750 align:middle line:84%
education, and so forth,
like a smooth path to what he

00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:09.410 align:middle line:90%
wishes to do with his life.

00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:11.200 align:middle line:84%
So he chose to
incarnate through you,

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:13.450 align:middle line:84%
even though there is
no soul connection.

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:14.449 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: That's true.

00:35:14.449 --> 00:35:15.990 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
and so this happens.

00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:19.940 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: It's difficult
to understand, however.

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:21.010 align:middle line:90%
But understand this.

00:35:21.010 --> 00:35:25.090 align:middle line:84%
There are no victims,
only volunteers in life.

00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:26.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:26.920 align:middle line:90%
Very good point.

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:29.086 align:middle line:84%
Were you going to say
something on that too, Marcus.

00:35:29.086 --> 00:35:31.454 align:middle line:84%
>> MARCUS: No, no,
enough said on that one.

00:35:31.454 --> 00:35:32.620 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Also the notion--

00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:36.040 align:middle line:84%
I asked you about the polyamory
and about the dominance of men

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:36.956 align:middle line:90%
over women.

00:35:36.956 --> 00:35:38.830 align:middle line:84%
Have there ever been
times throughout history

00:35:38.830 --> 00:35:41.680 align:middle line:84%
when it was reversed, the other
way around, where women would

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:44.770 align:middle line:84%
have more than one husband and
be able to choose what they

00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:48.040 align:middle line:84%
wished from among the men
just as the men did you have

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:49.592 align:middle line:90%
until recently or still do?

00:35:49.592 --> 00:35:50.800 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: There has been, yes.

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:51.730 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Can you
tell us about it?

00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:53.560 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: But it has
not been written about.

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:55.434 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Would you
please tell us about it?

00:35:55.434 --> 00:35:58.160 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: But that was
a matriarchal society,

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:02.330 align:middle line:84%
where the women had
power over the men.

00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And so now, it's
coming to fruition

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:06.490 align:middle line:90%
that there is a balance in that.

00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:07.321 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:36:07.321 --> 00:36:09.070 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's talk
about when that was,

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:12.280 align:middle line:84%
the regions of the world this
was occurring in, and what that

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:14.860 align:middle line:84%
was like, because women
have lost that pattern

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:18.130 align:middle line:84%
and the remembrance of that and
are still feeling at the whim

00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:21.430 align:middle line:84%
of and often victimized by
men simply by body size still.

00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:23.554 align:middle line:84%
There's still that
subconscious intimidation.

00:36:23.554 --> 00:36:25.720 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what
those other days were like.

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:28.180 align:middle line:90%
And did that get out of balance?

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:29.260 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: Yes, it did.

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:30.510 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Tell us about that.

00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:34.470 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: And they're all in
similar parts of the world

00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:35.850 align:middle line:90%
before the written history.

00:36:35.850 --> 00:36:38.810 align:middle line:90%


00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:42.290 align:middle line:84%
And then the patriarchal
society emerged.

00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:47.000 align:middle line:84%
The Essenes were very much
a matriarchal society.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:53.490 align:middle line:84%
And your master, known as
Jesus, was taught by them.

00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:56.960 align:middle line:84%
He had a very good
sense of femininity.

00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And that is what
true masters do,

00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:01.310 align:middle line:84%
have the balance of the
masculine and feminine

00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:04.037 align:middle line:84%
within them and an
understanding of it.

00:37:04.037 --> 00:37:06.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That seems like that
would have been a society that

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:10.310 align:middle line:84%
had already come more into
balance between the masculine

00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:11.300 align:middle line:90%
and feminine.

00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:13.010 align:middle line:84%
Give us an example
of a society that

00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:18.060 align:middle line:84%
was out of balance toward the
feminine and how that appeared

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:19.310 align:middle line:90%
or how that played itself out.

00:37:19.310 --> 00:37:23.599 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: Very much like
the patriarchal did.

00:37:23.599 --> 00:37:25.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But what
was the hook they held?

00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:26.190 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: Usury.

00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Usury, but the women
couldn't hold the power of size

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:31.010 align:middle line:84%
or strength or
anything over the men,

00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:34.080 align:middle line:84%
so what did they hold over the
men to put it out of balance

00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:34.880 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:37.100 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: Their intelligence.

00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:38.042 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:37:38.042 --> 00:37:39.500 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little
more, because this

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:42.110 align:middle line:90%
is a part we never hear about.

00:37:42.110 --> 00:37:47.920 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: Women have always had
an innate intuitive ability

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:53.620 align:middle line:84%
of knowing, of having
an awareness of prophecy

00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:56.050 align:middle line:90%
and connectivity to that.

00:37:56.050 --> 00:38:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And so men cowered in front of
that, for they did not know.

00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:07.210 align:middle line:84%
And they felt that if the
women knew these things,

00:38:07.210 --> 00:38:09.880 align:middle line:84%
certainly they had
power over them

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:13.010 align:middle line:90%
and their desire for survival.

00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:17.380 align:middle line:84%
They acquiesced their power
just as women have done to men.

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:20.190 align:middle line:84%
>> MARCUS: What time in
history was that, THEO?

00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:24.100 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: Mm, it was
thousands of years ago.

00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:28.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And why is it that
the feminine appears to have

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:33.220 align:middle line:84%
more of that innate connection
with the intuitive process than

00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:35.700 align:middle line:90%
men?

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:39.460 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: It is just exhibited
so, for men have prided

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:46.300 align:middle line:84%
themselves in their intellect,
in their physical prowess, yes?

00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:51.880 align:middle line:84%
So they have not been
interested in exploring

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:56.020 align:middle line:84%
that inner spiritual
aspect of who they are,

00:38:56.020 --> 00:39:00.100 align:middle line:90%
because it was not logical.

00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:08.440 align:middle line:84%
And they prided themselves on
intellect and physical form.

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:11.000 align:middle line:90%


00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.360 align:middle line:90%
So they left that to the women.

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:17.920 align:middle line:84%
They felt that was the
responsibility of the feminine

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:22.830 align:middle line:84%
to be the nurturers and the
intuitives and the healers.

00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:27.700 align:middle line:84%
>> MARCUS: And yet today, THEO,
women still seem so much more

00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:30.310 align:middle line:84%
awakened spiritually
on our planet,

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:32.435 align:middle line:84%
at least in our world
certainly than men are today.

00:39:32.435 --> 00:39:33.351 align:middle line:90%
Can you speak to that?

00:39:33.351 --> 00:39:34.540 align:middle line:90%
Is that pendulum swinging?

00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:37.570 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: That
pendulum has swung.

00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:40.810 align:middle line:84%
Men are having
experiences and awareness

00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:47.730 align:middle line:84%
of their intuitive abilities and
utilizing them more frequently.

00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:50.750 align:middle line:84%
>> MARCUS: Maybe just admitting
them as much for fear of--

00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:51.550 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: Judgment.

00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:52.760 align:middle line:84%
>> MARCUS: Ridicule
and judgment.

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:53.710 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: Yes.

00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:56.440 align:middle line:90%
But more in this time.

00:39:56.440 --> 00:40:00.230 align:middle line:90%
That will be revealed

00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:03.500 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What about the notion
of, for example, dolphins.

00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:05.330 align:middle line:84%
As we've studied
dolphin behavior--

00:40:05.330 --> 00:40:07.520 align:middle line:84%
and I think everybody
watching this loves dolphins.

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:10.880 align:middle line:84%
We love the kind of intelligence
they exhibit, sensitivity,

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:13.610 align:middle line:84%
love, playfulness,
but even sexually.

00:40:13.610 --> 00:40:15.510 align:middle line:90%
They have sex for fun.

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:16.790 align:middle line:90%
It's not just for procreation.

00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:18.480 align:middle line:84%
It's an enjoyable
part of their life.

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And they have, in their
case, multiple partners

00:40:21.810 --> 00:40:25.070 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes, although they
may have a primary partner.

00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:29.390 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk a little bit
about the animal kingdom

00:40:29.390 --> 00:40:31.520 align:middle line:84%
in terms of having
sex for something

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:32.990 align:middle line:90%
other than procreation?

00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:36.400 align:middle line:84%
And then extend that into what
happens between human beings

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:38.570 align:middle line:90%
with just kind of casual sex.

00:40:38.570 --> 00:40:40.760 align:middle line:84%
Is casual sex, does
it have a detriment

00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:43.940 align:middle line:84%
if you meet someone, say,
oh, well, that sounds fun?

00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:44.990 align:middle line:90%
It's a profound act.

00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:47.420 align:middle line:84%
So that's an open
question-- what

00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:51.980 align:middle line:84%
actually happens with casual
sex then among humans?

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:57.940 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: What humans have is a
consciousness and beliefs about

00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:01.870 align:middle line:84%
sexuality and what is
right and what is wrong,

00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:05.050 align:middle line:90%
a morality about it.

00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And so though it
might be fun, then

00:41:07.930 --> 00:41:11.950 align:middle line:84%
they can berate themselves
or judge themselves harshly

00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:13.330 align:middle line:84%
that they've done
something wrong

00:41:13.330 --> 00:41:16.900 align:middle line:84%
if they have a mate
doing something

00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:20.250 align:middle line:84%
against their
commitments you see.

00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:26.270 align:middle line:84%
So the mind is where that
all lies and beliefs.

00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:27.480 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:28.280 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:30.880 align:middle line:84%
So minus the
judgment, if we didn't

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:34.060 align:middle line:84%
have those judgments
around it, might humans

00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:38.020 align:middle line:84%
play and be more kind of
spontaneously expressive

00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:41.680 align:middle line:84%
sexually like the
world of dolphins?

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:43.030 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: Some do.

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Without having
any detriment to it?

00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:45.400 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: Some do.

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:47.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Or feeling
like they're using someone

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:48.520 align:middle line:90%
or whatever?

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:50.410 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: Some do.

00:41:50.410 --> 00:41:53.180 align:middle line:84%
But understand that humans
are different than dolphins.

00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:53.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
those differences.

00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:58.090 align:middle line:90%
They're a beautiful species.

00:41:58.090 --> 00:41:59.500 align:middle line:90%
We're different.

00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:00.760 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: Yes.

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:05.320 align:middle line:84%
Humans have a connectivity
to one another,

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:09.510 align:middle line:84%
just as there are some birds
that are monogamous as well,

00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:11.540 align:middle line:90%
and other animals.

00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:15.220 align:middle line:90%
The dolphins like that play.

00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:21.790 align:middle line:84%
But understand this that
sexuality, intercourse,

00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:24.520 align:middle line:90%
is creation.

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And it is the highest
connectedness to source.

00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:30.990 align:middle line:90%


00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:35.250 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And what happens then
during sex when the woman has

00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:38.550 align:middle line:84%
that seed inside her body
now even if you don't intend

00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:41.760 align:middle line:84%
or want anything to come of
that or even if nothing's going

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:43.980 align:middle line:84%
to come of it because
you're past a certain age?

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:46.740 align:middle line:84%
What is still happening
in that process?

00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:49.110 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: It is a process
of opening in all the cells

00:42:49.110 --> 00:42:51.730 align:middle line:84%
of the body and
the mind as well.

00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And certain endorphins
are released

00:42:55.110 --> 00:42:57.812 align:middle line:90%
to maintain balance and health.

00:42:57.812 --> 00:42:58.612 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:42:58.612 --> 00:42:59.940 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm, hm.

00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:06.590 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: But it is a
connectedness to the soul that

00:43:06.590 --> 00:43:11.820 align:middle line:84%
goes beyond the human
existence or the human body.

00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:14.220 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that imprint
of the man in the woman,

00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:20.580 align:middle line:84%
how does that show itself,
say, energetically or on a soul

00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:21.480 align:middle line:90%
level?

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:23.760 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: Like electricity.

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:32.720 align:middle line:84%
You have a receptor for your
light, do you not, in the wall?

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And you call one end
the masculine end

00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:38.210 align:middle line:90%
and one the female, yes?

00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:45.530 align:middle line:84%
To connect energetically,
to connect electrically,

00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:48.260 align:middle line:84%
that is the best
description we can have.

00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:52.490 align:middle line:84%
It is an electrical connection
in the physical body that

00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:56.100 align:middle line:90%
does affect the physical body.

00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:59.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So in general, it
is a health giving, nurturing,

00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:04.670 align:middle line:84%
providing process,
that one either chooses

00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:07.940 align:middle line:84%
or doesn't choose to participate
in throughout a given lifetime.

00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:09.850 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: Correct.

00:44:09.850 --> 00:44:10.769 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Marcus.

00:44:10.769 --> 00:44:12.560 align:middle line:84%
>> MARCUS: Yeah, I just
wanted, if I could,

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:15.050 align:middle line:84%
turn the conversation for
second into the really fun part

00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:18.170 align:middle line:84%
of relationships, at least as
we've experienced it, THEO.

00:44:18.170 --> 00:44:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And I know that when two
souls that are very resonant,

00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:25.550 align:middle line:84%
let's just say soul mates,
connect with each other,

00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:27.470 align:middle line:84%
there's unlimited
possibilities in terms

00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:31.270 align:middle line:84%
of how they can express, whether
it's telepathic communication,

00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:33.740 align:middle line:84%
as we've experienced, or
collapsing of time and space,

00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:36.892 align:middle line:84%
and past life recall,
traveling together

00:44:36.892 --> 00:44:37.850 align:middle line:90%
in multi-dimensionally.

00:44:37.850 --> 00:44:40.910 align:middle line:84%
Can you speak to those
experiences, the importance

00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:44.360 align:middle line:84%
of them as well, and
perhaps how we can intend

00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:47.160 align:middle line:90%
to manifest such experiences?

00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:50.450 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: It's an
intention, of course.

00:44:50.450 --> 00:44:54.170 align:middle line:84%
In all connections
that would have,

00:44:54.170 --> 00:45:02.900 align:middle line:84%
sexually, spiritually, mentally,
it all feeds relationship,

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:05.160 align:middle line:90%
doesn't it?

00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:06.860 align:middle line:90%
And it's all energy.

00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:07.660 align:middle line:90%
>> MARCUS: Right.

00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:10.310 align:middle line:90%


00:45:10.310 --> 00:45:13.010 align:middle line:90%
And it can be really fun.

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:17.490 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: Of course, with
that expectation, yes?

00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:21.180 align:middle line:90%
In agreement with one another.

00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:23.630 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And let's bring
in a third party, a soul,

00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:26.300 align:middle line:84%
another soul who wishes to
come through these bodies,

00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:28.700 align:middle line:84%
and the nature of what
that looks like from

00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:31.940 align:middle line:84%
your perspective on the other
side when a soul is ready

00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:32.840 align:middle line:90%
to incarnate.

00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:34.370 align:middle line:90%
It's part of the tribe.

00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:38.060 align:middle line:84%
The agreement is that it's going
to come between two people.

00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:42.260 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about how far
in advance, for example,

00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:46.140 align:middle line:84%
these kinds of intentions and
relationships are lined up?

00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:49.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I would think that this
is not a last minute decision

00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:53.390 align:middle line:84%
that these kinds of agreements
that are so deep and profound

00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:55.310 align:middle line:84%
happen over long periods
of time and maybe

00:45:55.310 --> 00:45:56.785 align:middle line:90%
even lifetimes into the future.

00:45:56.785 --> 00:45:57.660 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: That's true.

00:45:57.660 --> 00:46:00.290 align:middle line:90%


00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:03.650 align:middle line:84%
That's as we were
speaking previously

00:46:03.650 --> 00:46:07.460 align:middle line:84%
about souls incarnating together
to support each other's growth

00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:08.270 align:middle line:90%
by agreement.

00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:09.134 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:46:09.134 --> 00:46:11.300 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm, hm.

00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:13.360 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: So it is
other lifetimes,

00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:17.630 align:middle line:84%
other experiences that there
is a soul connectivity,

00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:22.730 align:middle line:84%
an agreement in contract,
if you would, to do such.

00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:27.110 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Could it even
be as such that you come

00:46:27.110 --> 00:46:29.840 align:middle line:84%
into an incarnation, but
it's known in advance that

00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:32.990 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be reincarnated
back into that same bloodline,

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:36.170 align:middle line:84%
maybe a couple
generations later?

00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:39.260 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: That is possible, yes.

00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:41.760 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because people see
that instance where your new

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:44.600 align:middle line:84%
little newborn has all the
same habits of grandpa or great

00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:48.020 align:middle line:84%
grandpa, knows where
all of his stuff is.

00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:50.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean that past life
work with children

00:46:50.090 --> 00:46:53.060 align:middle line:84%
is absolutely fascinating
to me because they're pure.

00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:53.870 align:middle line:90%
They don't bite.

00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:55.530 align:middle line:84%
They're not reading
anything into it.

00:46:55.530 --> 00:46:57.710 align:middle line:84%
They're just putting
cigarette packets

00:46:57.710 --> 00:46:59.480 align:middle line:84%
and rolling it up
in their t-shirts

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:01.910 align:middle line:84%
when they're four years
old because that's

00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:05.237 align:middle line:84%
their habit from the last
incarnation, for example.

00:47:05.237 --> 00:47:06.820 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: It's a
memory, a soul memory.

00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:07.620 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:08.480 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:10.520 align:middle line:84%
So this is not a
happenstance thing,

00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:13.940 align:middle line:84%
but let's talk about what
happens when a soul comes up

00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:15.480 align:middle line:90%
to the point of birth.

00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:17.600 align:middle line:90%
The agreement's been made.

00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:21.890 align:middle line:84%
And maybe a soul just chooses
more toward the last minute,

00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:26.270 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to do this,
I've changed my mind.

00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:29.270 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: The soul chooses
incarnations when they know

00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:30.455 align:middle line:90%
they will come to fruition.

00:47:30.455 --> 00:47:33.202 align:middle line:90%


00:47:33.202 --> 00:47:35.660 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Does it ever happen
that a soul simply backs out

00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:38.390 align:middle line:84%
and you have more of
a stillborn situation?

00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:40.370 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: The soul
isn't in that body.

00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:43.910 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Not yet, but if
it chooses not to occupy it

00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:47.810 align:middle line:84%
and the vehicle, the
baby, simply dies away,

00:47:47.810 --> 00:47:50.787 align:middle line:84%
is there anything else we need
to know about that for anyone

00:47:50.787 --> 00:47:52.370 align:middle line:84%
who's experienced
something like this?

00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:55.430 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: So there's a perception
that there's a soul in a body

00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:56.360 align:middle line:90%
at conception.

00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:57.800 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:01.800 align:middle line:10%
>> THEO: But the soul enters
at different times of the body.

00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And if it knows that
fetus, that infant,

00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:11.620 align:middle line:84%
will not have a full life,
the soul will not enter.

00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:17.570 align:middle line:84%
However, the parents
of that infant

00:48:17.570 --> 00:48:20.400 align:middle line:84%
have a learning within
that experience.

00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:21.200 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:22.250 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:48:22.250 --> 00:48:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And what happens then in kind
of a knocked on effect of that

00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:28.910 align:middle line:84%
a little later if
a soul does choose

00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:32.180 align:middle line:84%
to incarnate through a body
and then maybe has what's

00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:36.080 align:middle line:84%
called sudden death syndrome,
or sudden infant death,

00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:37.520 align:middle line:84%
where they're lying
in their crib.

00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:38.720 align:middle line:84%
They stop breathing,
and they die.

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:40.845 align:middle line:84%
There didn't appear to be
anything wrong with them.

00:48:40.845 --> 00:48:42.210 align:middle line:90%
They just leave the body.

00:48:42.210 --> 00:48:46.850 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: That too is a lesson
to be learned for those who are

00:48:46.850 --> 00:48:48.860 align:middle line:90%
still living.

00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:50.150 align:middle line:90%
So know this.

00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:54.290 align:middle line:84%
Because the body is small
doesn't mean the soul is.

00:48:54.290 --> 00:48:56.960 align:middle line:84%
The soul is larger
than the physical body,

00:48:56.960 --> 00:49:00.410 align:middle line:90%
much more powerful and wise.

00:49:00.410 --> 00:49:04.790 align:middle line:84%
So that the soul that comes
and leaves so early on

00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:08.810 align:middle line:84%
can be a master teacher
for those left behind

00:49:08.810 --> 00:49:10.852 align:middle line:90%
from the experience of that.

00:49:10.852 --> 00:49:13.310 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Is there something
more on that topic you'd like

00:49:13.310 --> 00:49:15.400 align:middle line:90%
to ask, Marcus, at this time?

00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:17.660 align:middle line:84%
>> MARCUS: No, I think
this is complete.

00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:19.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:20.000 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have the real
world we're living in,

00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:23.720 align:middle line:90%
which is a total fantasy world.

00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:26.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just a
construct of media,

00:49:26.370 --> 00:49:31.400 align:middle line:84%
where we're being kind of
manipulated, if we buy into,

00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:34.076 align:middle line:84%
a view of life that is really--
by and large, it's artificial.

00:49:34.076 --> 00:49:36.200 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing organic
about our media and the way

00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:38.870 align:middle line:84%
it projects life and
the way it projects love

00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:40.580 align:middle line:90%
and the way it projects romance.

00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:42.800 align:middle line:84%
But yet we're
easily programmable

00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:45.990 align:middle line:90%
and we buy into this.

00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:47.990 align:middle line:84%
What kind of effect
is the media having

00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:52.910 align:middle line:84%
on our ability to connect
on a meaningful level now?

00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:57.290 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: All media is
affecting throughout the world

00:49:57.290 --> 00:50:00.270 align:middle line:90%
the consciousness of humankind.

00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:04.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's being mindful
that that is occurring.

00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And trust on the inner
level of yourself

00:50:07.010 --> 00:50:12.110 align:middle line:84%
what your truth is, for you
all have a truth barometer

00:50:12.110 --> 00:50:14.840 align:middle line:90%
within you, all of you do.

00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:19.940 align:middle line:84%
You know when truth is being
told to you and when it is not.

00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:22.350 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We're just junkies
for the ride right now.

00:50:22.350 --> 00:50:25.760 align:middle line:84%
People want the fantastical and
the, quote, "magical" and wild,

00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:29.420 align:middle line:84%
the unearned, don't have
to work for it, right?

00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:30.715 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: Correct.

00:50:30.715 --> 00:50:32.090 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so
what do we get?

00:50:32.090 --> 00:50:34.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you get kind of
Kool-Aid out of that.

00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:39.380 align:middle line:84%
It's not a fine wine or even
a good water, spring water.

00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: So what you sit back
and watch the drama of it all

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:49.120 align:middle line:84%
and the entertainment of
it, for truth will out.

00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:50.630 align:middle line:90%
And understand this.

00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:52.370 align:middle line:84%
As each and every
one of you comes

00:50:52.370 --> 00:50:56.210 align:middle line:84%
into the truth of your being
and the recognition of that

00:50:56.210 --> 00:51:02.590 align:middle line:84%
and the wisdom of your soul,
you will not be manipulated.

00:51:02.590 --> 00:51:03.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:04.920 align:middle line:84%
And I have just
one more question.

00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:06.640 align:middle line:84%
Then I'll have Marcus
ask another one

00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:08.470 align:middle line:90%
before we bring Sheila back.

00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:12.100 align:middle line:84%
And that is in this movie,
Hollywood version of what life

00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:14.770 align:middle line:84%
is supposed to be
like, love and romance,

00:51:14.770 --> 00:51:18.640 align:middle line:84%
one thing you see often is that
people do not have the ability

00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:21.220 align:middle line:84%
to be truthful with
themselves or one another

00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:24.790 align:middle line:84%
and will not allow themselves to
be seen at their weakest, most

00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:28.030 align:middle line:84%
vulnerable moments, which
we all have and we're all

00:51:28.030 --> 00:51:33.550 align:middle line:84%
afraid of being rejected or
abandoned if we show how hurt

00:51:33.550 --> 00:51:36.790 align:middle line:84%
or the softer side, the more
vulnerable side of ourselves

00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:37.930 align:middle line:90%
to the other.

00:51:37.930 --> 00:51:41.810 align:middle line:84%
Can you just speak
to that for a moment?

00:51:41.810 --> 00:51:45.280 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: Vulnerability is
the greatest power you have.

00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:47.620 align:middle line:90%
That is the truth of your being.

00:51:47.620 --> 00:51:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And when all
understand this, you'll

00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:52.945 align:middle line:84%
live appropriately
with each other

00:51:52.945 --> 00:51:57.250 align:middle line:84%
for you'll be showing
truth to each other.

00:51:57.250 --> 00:52:02.770 align:middle line:84%
Abandonment is the greatest
concern of all human beings.

00:52:02.770 --> 00:52:03.850 align:middle line:90%
It's all about survival.

00:52:03.850 --> 00:52:06.430 align:middle line:90%


00:52:06.430 --> 00:52:09.727 align:middle line:90%
It's truly not about love.

00:52:09.727 --> 00:52:10.560 align:middle line:90%
It's about survival.

00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:13.070 align:middle line:90%


00:52:13.070 --> 00:52:15.790 align:middle line:90%
But it translates in love.

00:52:15.790 --> 00:52:21.010 align:middle line:84%
If you have an infant that
is not nurtured and loved,

00:52:21.010 --> 00:52:22.670 align:middle line:90%
it perishes.

00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:25.180 align:middle line:90%
And that has been proven, yes?

00:52:25.180 --> 00:52:31.150 align:middle line:84%
In all animals, whether
it be a tiger or a bear

00:52:31.150 --> 00:52:35.650 align:middle line:90%
or a horse or a lamb or a human.

00:52:35.650 --> 00:52:38.450 align:middle line:90%


00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:44.110 align:middle line:84%
So love is extremely
important, the love of self,

00:52:44.110 --> 00:52:47.960 align:middle line:84%
for you cannot give
what you do not have.

00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:49.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Very
true and so true.

00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:53.237 align:middle line:84%
I agree 100% on the
notion of vulnerability.

00:52:53.237 --> 00:52:55.820 align:middle line:84%
It seems like when you have the
courage to be vulnerable, i.e.

00:52:55.820 --> 00:52:59.180 align:middle line:84%
truthful, in the rawest
form with another person,

00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:01.220 align:middle line:84%
that's where the
magic really happens.

00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:04.070 align:middle line:84%
As painful as it is and
frightening as it is,

00:53:04.070 --> 00:53:05.690 align:middle line:90%
that's the magic of life.

00:53:05.690 --> 00:53:07.650 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: It is.

00:53:07.650 --> 00:53:08.450 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:53:08.450 --> 00:53:10.100 align:middle line:90%
You know these lessons.

00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:12.410 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Well, I'm learning.

00:53:12.410 --> 00:53:15.810 align:middle line:84%
Marcus, anything before we
sign off with the THEO Group?

00:53:15.810 --> 00:53:19.410 align:middle line:84%
>> MARCUS: THEO, I've been
observing that many people come

00:53:19.410 --> 00:53:22.970 align:middle line:84%
into our Ask THEO community,
just in the last several months

00:53:22.970 --> 00:53:28.610 align:middle line:84%
even, seem much more ready
to declare that they're open

00:53:28.610 --> 00:53:30.560 align:middle line:90%
and available to find the one.

00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:33.980 align:middle line:84%
Could you give us a blueprint,
please, for finding the one?

00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:37.700 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: Everybody wants,
as you speak of, the one.

00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:41.780 align:middle line:84%
All humans want to love
and be loved and nurtured,

00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:42.980 align:middle line:90%
be seen and heard.

00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:45.760 align:middle line:90%


00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:48.760 align:middle line:84%
So what is important
is as you're

00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:53.230 align:middle line:84%
seeking that in the external,
you have all the qualities

00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:57.640 align:middle line:84%
that you want in another,
you know what you want

00:53:57.640 --> 00:54:00.910 align:middle line:90%
and often what you don't want.

00:54:00.910 --> 00:54:02.760 align:middle line:90%
But go on the inner.

00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:07.560 align:middle line:84%
Do you have the qualities that
you are seeking in another?

00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:10.940 align:middle line:84%
For if you have
them not within you,

00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:16.240 align:middle line:84%
you will not have
them come to you.

00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:19.880 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, on that, THEO,
thank you so much for joining

00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:21.620 align:middle line:90%
us here through Sheila.

00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:26.120 align:middle line:84%
And until next time, we say
thank you, God bless, go well,

00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:29.360 align:middle line:90%
and we'll chat again soon.

00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:32.150 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: We appreciate the
opportunity to be of service

00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:33.950 align:middle line:90%
unto you.

00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:35.915 align:middle line:90%
God's love unto you.

00:54:35.915 --> 00:54:37.250 align:middle line:90%
>> MARCUS: Unto you, THEO.

00:54:37.250 --> 00:54:37.760 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: Good day.

00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:38.090 align:middle line:90%
>> MARCUS: Good day.

00:54:38.090 --> 00:54:38.923 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Good day.

00:54:38.923 --> 00:54:53.560 align:middle line:90%


00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:55.240 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Welcome back, Sheila.

00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:55.630 align:middle line:90%
You know, before--

00:54:55.630 --> 00:54:56.546 align:middle line:90%
>> MARCUS: She's back.

00:54:56.546 --> 00:54:59.680 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: When we were talking
in the green room before this--

00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:02.920 align:middle line:84%
it's not actually
green, the makeup room--

00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:05.980 align:middle line:84%
you said, I want to
know some things too.

00:55:05.980 --> 00:55:09.900 align:middle line:84%
So did you learn anything
from the THEO group today?

00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:12.150 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEILA: As you will talk
about it, I will remember.

00:55:12.150 --> 00:55:14.774 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's true, because
you don't have a lot of memory.

00:55:14.774 --> 00:55:18.380 align:middle line:84%
What were some of the things you
might jog her memory with that

00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:19.180 align:middle line:90%
struck you?

00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:20.770 align:middle line:84%
>> MARCUS: Well, I kind of
like the conversation about

00:55:20.770 --> 00:55:22.240 align:middle line:90%
the masculine and the feminine.

00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:24.680 align:middle line:84%
I thought that was
really powerful stuff.

00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:26.590 align:middle line:10%
And talking about
the fact that there

00:55:26.590 --> 00:55:28.482 align:middle line:10%
have been periods of
time thousands of years

00:55:28.482 --> 00:55:30.190 align:middle line:10%
ago where it was very
much a matriarchal,

00:55:30.190 --> 00:55:33.100 align:middle line:10%
and not a patriarchal
society, and the women

00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:35.870 align:middle line:10%
held the power because of the
intellect that they possessed

00:55:35.870 --> 00:55:39.010 align:middle line:10%
and the intuitive
powers that they

00:55:39.010 --> 00:55:40.660 align:middle line:10%
had and were perceived by men.

00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:41.410 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And they used them.

00:55:41.410 --> 00:55:42.180 align:middle line:90%
>> MARCUS: And used them.

00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:44.410 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And held power
over the men intentionally.

00:55:44.410 --> 00:55:45.250 align:middle line:90%
>> MARCUS: Yeah.

00:55:45.250 --> 00:55:47.590 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We've heard of
distant times and matriarchal

00:55:47.590 --> 00:55:48.390 align:middle line:90%
societies.

00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And women tend to
think, especially

00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:53.020 align:middle line:84%
goddess circles, well, that's
when everything was blissful

00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:54.772 align:middle line:90%
because we were in charge.

00:55:54.772 --> 00:55:56.230 align:middle line:84%
But in reality,
they're saying, no,

00:55:56.230 --> 00:55:58.330 align:middle line:84%
that was out of balance
as well oftentimes.

00:55:58.330 --> 00:56:00.940 align:middle line:84%
>> MARCUS: And the pendulum
spiritually is now swinging

00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:03.490 align:middle line:84%
for men to become more
awakened and more open.

00:56:03.490 --> 00:56:06.000 align:middle line:84%
We're experiencing
it little by little.

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.500 align:middle line:84%
It hasn't been a flood by
any stretch yet coming in.

00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:09.717 align:middle line:90%
But it's happening.

00:56:09.717 --> 00:56:11.550 align:middle line:84%
We can see it a little
bit in our community.

00:56:11.550 --> 00:56:13.000 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEILA: Well, it has to.

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:16.700 align:middle line:90%
And that's what it's all about.

00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:18.860 align:middle line:84%
It's about each and
every one of us,

00:56:18.860 --> 00:56:23.470 align:middle line:84%
men and women, coming into that
fuller awareness of who we are

00:56:23.470 --> 00:56:27.370 align:middle line:84%
and owning it and being
able to express it

00:56:27.370 --> 00:56:31.990 align:middle line:84%
from that vulnerable state,
which is really powerful.

00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:36.160 align:middle line:84%
It's not being a victim,
but being fully aligned

00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:37.155 align:middle line:90%
with who we are.

00:56:37.155 --> 00:56:38.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That
I think has been,

00:56:38.530 --> 00:56:40.537 align:middle line:84%
certainly for me and
for a lot of women,

00:56:40.537 --> 00:56:43.120 align:middle line:84%
especially strong women who are
used to having to kind of hold

00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:46.540 align:middle line:84%
the whole show together as
single moms and doing your own

00:56:46.540 --> 00:56:50.440 align:middle line:84%
businesses and so forth, the
notion of vulnerability is just

00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:51.370 align:middle line:90%
terrifying.

00:56:51.370 --> 00:56:53.860 align:middle line:84%
You just have to
hold it together out

00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:56.050 align:middle line:84%
in the external world
so much that when

00:56:56.050 --> 00:56:59.030 align:middle line:84%
it comes time for your internal
world and your private life,

00:56:59.030 --> 00:57:01.480 align:middle line:84%
it's very hard to
let those masks go.

00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:02.380 align:middle line:90%
You have to keep on.

00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:03.713 align:middle line:90%
You've got it all under control.

00:57:03.713 --> 00:57:05.620 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEILA: But you know what?

00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:06.977 align:middle line:90%
I think men do the same thing.

00:57:06.977 --> 00:57:08.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, we
know they do that.

00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:10.726 align:middle line:10%
>> SHEILA: I think they're
trying to hold everything

00:57:10.726 --> 00:57:13.472 align:middle line:10%
together and be the guy
that brings the dinner home

00:57:13.472 --> 00:57:14.920 align:middle line:10%
to the table.

00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:16.990 align:middle line:10%
And I think they go
through the same thing

00:57:16.990 --> 00:57:21.290 align:middle line:10%
that women do as a single
mom, fathers do as well.

00:57:21.290 --> 00:57:23.250 align:middle line:90%
But we don't talk about it.

00:57:23.250 --> 00:57:24.070 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:57:24.070 --> 00:57:26.500 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEILA: You know, we're going
to be tough and we can do this,

00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:26.920 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And men, the same
way, I'm not going

00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:31.390 align:middle line:84%
to bother the little
woman with these things.

00:57:31.390 --> 00:57:33.730 align:middle line:84%
But I think men get
just as terrified

00:57:33.730 --> 00:57:36.536 align:middle line:84%
as women of having to
hold it all together.

00:57:36.536 --> 00:57:38.410 align:middle line:84%
>> MARCUS: Well, and
we're seeking that level

00:57:38.410 --> 00:57:39.404 align:middle line:90%
of connection.

00:57:39.404 --> 00:57:42.070 align:middle line:10%
It's, you know, so much more fun
to have a spiritual connection,

00:57:42.070 --> 00:57:46.540 align:middle line:10%
so much more fun to be able
to experience our spirituality

00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:49.430 align:middle line:10%
or express it together or
have experiences together.

00:57:49.430 --> 00:57:51.220 align:middle line:10%
And at the end of
the day, it makes

00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:53.110 align:middle line:10%
for much richer relationships.

00:57:53.110 --> 00:57:57.310 align:middle line:10%
I see men just getting caught
up on all this right now

00:57:57.310 --> 00:57:59.680 align:middle line:10%
and really wanting that
level of connection.

00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:01.513 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But someone
has to break the ice.

00:58:01.513 --> 00:58:04.510 align:middle line:84%
Someone has to show their true
colors and who they really are,

00:58:04.510 --> 00:58:07.610 align:middle line:84%
so at least the other
can respond to it

00:58:07.610 --> 00:58:10.400 align:middle line:84%
and you can create a
new level of dialogue.

00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:11.500 align:middle line:90%
And this is a good part--

00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:13.660 align:middle line:84%
my husband Zeus
is finishing up--

00:58:13.660 --> 00:58:15.074 align:middle line:90%
actually it's already done--

00:58:15.074 --> 00:58:16.990 align:middle line:84%
a book called "The
Spiritually Confident Man,"

00:58:16.990 --> 00:58:21.250 align:middle line:84%
which is showing a completely
new model that allows the man

00:58:21.250 --> 00:58:24.850 align:middle line:84%
to take off the masks and
come forward and be who he is

00:58:24.850 --> 00:58:28.240 align:middle line:84%
and the power, the
genuine strength

00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:31.090 align:middle line:84%
and power that
comes from that that

00:58:31.090 --> 00:58:33.560 align:middle line:84%
can be lent to the world
in a whole new way.

00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:35.851 align:middle line:84%
>> MARCUS: And you know what
the secret to a lot of men

00:58:35.851 --> 00:58:38.072 align:middle line:84%
don't know, it's a magnet
to beautiful women.

00:58:38.072 --> 00:58:39.030 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's true.

00:58:39.030 --> 00:58:39.500 align:middle line:90%
>> MARCUS: Right?

00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:40.330 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that true?

00:58:40.330 --> 00:58:44.524 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know, as
beautiful awakened women,

00:58:44.524 --> 00:58:45.940 align:middle line:84%
are you going to
be more attracted

00:58:45.940 --> 00:58:47.699 align:middle line:84%
to a man who is spiritual
awakened or not?

00:58:47.699 --> 00:58:49.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's an
easy one, isn't it?

00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:51.610 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't want
to drag someone along

00:58:51.610 --> 00:58:53.930 align:middle line:84%
to bring him up to your
level of spiritual awakening.

00:58:53.930 --> 00:58:55.472 align:middle line:84%
You want some who's
done their work.

00:58:55.472 --> 00:58:57.680 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, and we see
it all the time in films.

00:58:57.680 --> 00:58:59.710 align:middle line:84%
Everyone loves a
man who has been

00:58:59.710 --> 00:59:01.840 align:middle line:84%
through the redemptive
process, who

00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:05.226 align:middle line:84%
had to go to the
bottom of his own well

00:59:05.226 --> 00:59:06.475 align:middle line:90%
and put himself back together.

00:59:06.475 --> 00:59:09.550 align:middle line:84%
It's just oh, my god,
we're getting there.

00:59:09.550 --> 00:59:12.230 align:middle line:84%
On that note, thank you
two so much for being here.

00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:14.510 align:middle line:84%
Thank you THEO Group
for joining us.

00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And it was a lovely
conversation.

00:59:16.330 --> 00:59:18.340 align:middle line:90%
So we'll be back, right?

00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:20.897 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEILA: Yes, we'd love to.

00:59:20.897 --> 00:59:21.980 align:middle line:90%
>> MARCUS: Thanks, Regina.

00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:22.900 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And it's
your birthday today.

00:59:22.900 --> 00:59:24.265 align:middle line:90%
So everybody, happy birthday.

00:59:24.265 --> 00:59:25.300 align:middle line:90%
It's Sheila's birthday.

00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:27.040 align:middle line:84%
And tomorrow is
Marcus's birthday.

00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:28.510 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEILA: Thank you.

00:59:28.510 --> 00:59:30.540 align:middle line:84%
What a gift we gave
ourselves in being here.

00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:32.080 align:middle line:84%
>> MARCUS: And we get to
celebrate it with you.

00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:32.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:59:32.350 --> 00:59:32.680 align:middle line:90%
>> MARCUS: Which is great.

00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:33.710 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thank you both.

00:59:33.710 --> 00:59:34.210 align:middle line:90%
>> MARCUS: Thank you.

00:59:34.210 --> 00:59:36.460 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Again, to tune
into THEO on a weekly basis,

00:59:36.460 --> 00:59:38.380 align:middle line:10%
you can go to asktheo.com.

00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:40.300 align:middle line:10%
Go to the website,
