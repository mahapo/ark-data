00:00:15.877 --> 00:00:17.960 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: While
much of the Western media

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.300 align:middle line:10%
has relegated
astrology to one-liners

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.240 align:middle line:10%
in the newspaper and
women's magazines, in truth,

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.560 align:middle line:10%
empires have been won
and lost on the basis

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.910 align:middle line:10%
of astrological
insights revealed

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.920 align:middle line:10%
to leaders throughout history.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.010 align:middle line:84%
From cave drawings 25,000
years ago to present,

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.980 align:middle line:84%
the position of the
sun, moon and planets

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.150 align:middle line:84%
can give us a
framework for the times

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.490 align:middle line:84%
of both large and
personal scales.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.210 align:middle line:84%
Monte Farber has
been assisting people

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.660 align:middle line:84%
to work in harmony with
these cycles for decades.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.660 align:middle line:84%
He's worked with some of
the world's wealthiest,

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.550 align:middle line:84%
to the average
person, and looking

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.780 align:middle line:84%
for clues as to how to
construct our actions in life.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.790 align:middle line:84%
Besides that, he's psychic,
which definitely gives you

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:54.624 align:middle line:90%
an edge.

00:00:54.624 --> 00:00:55.041 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTE FARBER: Yes, it does.

00:00:55.041 --> 00:00:57.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I understand
why you're so popular.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.980 align:middle line:84%
And I feel totally
honored to have you here.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:59.576 align:middle line:90%
You're on the large--

00:00:59.576 --> 00:00:59.830 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Thank you.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --networks,
and all of that,

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.087 align:middle line:84%
and here you are
with us at Gaiam.

00:01:03.087 --> 00:01:03.920 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Oh my god.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think you are
the large network.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I
love to hear that.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.266 align:middle line:84%
Please, tell us all your
predictions for Gaiam.

00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:12.500 align:middle line:90%
No, we'll wait on that.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.500 align:middle line:90%
I'll ask you off camera.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.540 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: I think they
could see it in my face.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.580 align:middle line:10%
I feel like I'm where
I'm supposed to be

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.920 align:middle line:10%
and where everyone wants to be.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.470 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Oh, that's fabulous.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.400 align:middle line:84%
OK, now we're going
to look at astrology

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.900 align:middle line:84%
from a very different
point of view.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.440 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Yes, which is
the way I look at it.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.023 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:01:26.023 --> 00:01:27.740 align:middle line:84%
And you look at it
from the deep history

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:28.920 align:middle line:90%
from a different point of view.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.545 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Yeah.

00:01:29.545 --> 00:01:31.405 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
we're going way back--

00:01:31.405 --> 00:01:31.730 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Way back.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:32.515 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We're going back--

00:01:32.515 --> 00:01:33.190 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Thousands of years.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --many, many
thousands of years.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.153 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Yes.

00:01:35.153 --> 00:01:37.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we are
going to be looking,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:42.010 align:middle line:84%
kind of as a set up for it,
at the cosmos through the lens

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.300 align:middle line:84%
of your friend,
the now deceased--

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.100 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Yes.
--Zecharia Sitchin.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.046 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: An amazing man.

00:01:48.046 --> 00:01:49.660 align:middle line:90%
A tough guy.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.055 align:middle line:84%
And I thought a genius
on the level of Einstein,

00:01:53.055 --> 00:01:56.740 align:middle line:84%
though a lot of people think
that his work is specious.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.120 align:middle line:84%
Knowing him, I know that
every word he ever said,

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.520 align:middle line:84%
he thought he could back up
with a stack of books this high.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.690 align:middle line:84%
So when I sometimes read
that people have problems

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.650 align:middle line:84%
with his theories,
to me, his theories

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.950 align:middle line:84%
are what Einstein was looking
at before he passed away,

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.810 align:middle line:84%
which was the
unified field theory.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.010 align:middle line:84%
Zecharia Sitchin did
the unified field theory

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.156 align:middle line:90%
of the origins of humanity.

00:02:19.156 --> 00:02:20.530 align:middle line:84%
It's the only
thing that explains

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.375 align:middle line:84%
the monumental buildings
around the world.

00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:23.750 align:middle line:84%
It's the only
thing that explains

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.810 align:middle line:90%
so many things around the world.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.455 align:middle line:84%
And it also relates to
the origins of astrology,

00:02:30.455 --> 00:02:36.020 align:middle line:84%
because astrologers who will
always say, well, astrology's

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.680 align:middle line:90%
been around for 5,000 years.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.380 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to
really admit what

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.079 align:middle line:84%
was going on when
it started out.

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:41.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.453 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I want
to talk to you about.

00:02:43.453 --> 00:02:45.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, Sitchin wrote "The
12th Planet," right?

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.680 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: He wrote a
whole series of books.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.000 align:middle line:84%
"The 12th Planet" series,
and that's the first one.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.920 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about not
only "The 12th Planet,"

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.270 align:middle line:84%
what happened to the other
planets in between the ones

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.190 align:middle line:90%
that we recognize today?

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And so let's go into
the deep history.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.125 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back about
four billion years.

00:03:02.125 --> 00:03:03.750 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Well, four
billion years ago,

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.170 align:middle line:84%
a planet that had been expelled
from an exploding solar system

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.670 align:middle line:84%
was captured by
the sun's gravity

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.070 align:middle line:84%
and came through our solar
system, with its moons.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And one of the moons
struck what the Earth

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.190 align:middle line:84%
was at that time, which was
twice its size, a glancing

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.130 align:middle line:90%
blow, split it in half.

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Half of it became
the asteroid belt,

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.790 align:middle line:84%
which is in Sumerian-- we're
talking about Sumerian-- which

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.130 align:middle line:90%
they called-- that was heaven.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And heaven, the
word heaven comes

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.815 align:middle line:90%
from hammered-out bracelet.

00:03:33.815 --> 00:03:35.690 align:middle line:84%
Because if you look at
a bracelet that's been

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.917 align:middle line:84%
hammered-out with a ball
peen hammer, it looks like--

00:03:38.917 --> 00:03:40.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Like an asteroid belt.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.708 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: --like an asteriod
belt completely encircling it.

00:03:42.708 --> 00:03:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And it knocked Earth
into its position

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.020 align:middle line:84%
where it is now, put it at the
23 degree tilt, we have summer,

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.630 align:middle line:84%
winter, we have the solstices,
we have the equinoxes.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And life originated
on that one planet

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.690 align:middle line:84%
when it was captured
by the solar system.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.830 align:middle line:84%
It's the reason that
Uranus inclines its axis

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.090 align:middle line:90%
towards the sun.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.585 align:middle line:84%
It created havoc, and we're
talking about four billion--

00:04:05.585 --> 00:04:07.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're saying
the sun pulled it into--

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:08.010 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Well, yes.

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --its
gravitational influence.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And what was the
name of this planet?

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.478 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Well, he
calls it Nibiru,

00:04:12.478 --> 00:04:16.850 align:middle line:84%
N-I-B-I-R-U is what he--
and he says that everything

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.950 align:middle line:84%
the Sumerians said, and they
knew that the Earth went around

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.670 align:middle line:84%
the sun, and they knew that
there was a planet Pluto.

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.796 align:middle line:84%
They called it Gaga, which
is funny with Lady Gaga.

00:04:25.796 --> 00:04:27.336 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I was
just going to say

00:04:27.336 --> 00:04:28.836 align:middle line:84%
Lady Gaga, gives
her some new depth.

00:04:28.836 --> 00:04:30.419 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Well, they
talked about Gaga

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:32.600 align:middle line:84%
and how it would be the
one that would greet them

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.766 align:middle line:84%
when they would come back
because it's the furthest.

00:04:34.766 --> 00:04:37.270 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes it would
be within the orbit.

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.540 align:middle line:10%
It gets a little confusing
because the Sumerians

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.220 align:middle line:10%
assigned the names of
their early kings of Nibiru

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.720 align:middle line:10%
and queens to the planets.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.814 align:middle line:84%
So when you're reading--
Zecharia's work is not easy.

00:04:48.814 --> 00:04:49.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.559 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: I'm a popularizer.

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:53.100 align:middle line:84%
Like the reason I've
done karma cards

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.860 align:middle line:84%
was to popularize astrology so
that anyone-- the hardest part

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.190 align:middle line:90%
is taking the shrink wrap off.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.815 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:57.815 --> 00:04:59.739 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't a popular genre.

00:04:59.739 --> 00:05:00.280 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: No.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.420 align:middle line:90%
He did not care.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.740 align:middle line:84%
He actually asked
me, and my wife

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.800 align:middle line:84%
Amy who's an artist, to
do the children's book

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.885 align:middle line:84%
version of his work,
because he felt

00:05:09.885 --> 00:05:11.440 align:middle line:84%
that she was the
only artist that--

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.398 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's great.

00:05:12.398 --> 00:05:13.829 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I could understand it.

00:05:13.829 --> 00:05:16.120 align:middle line:10%
>>FARBER: Well, the thing is
is I really understand it,

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.369 align:middle line:10%
but I don't understand why
no one else understands it,

00:05:18.369 --> 00:05:22.030 align:middle line:10%
because he will go through like
a whole book worth of stuff

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.584 align:middle line:10%
to get to something that I would
say in the first 10 minutes.

00:05:24.584 --> 00:05:26.250 align:middle line:10%
But anyway, so this
planet came through.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.300 align:middle line:90%
It comes back every 3,600 years.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.360 align:middle line:90%
That's one of their years.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.940 align:middle line:90%
Life originated on that planet--

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:33.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Nibiru.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:34.740 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: On Nibiru.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.610 align:middle line:84%
And when it hit what was
called Tiamat-- that's

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.300 align:middle line:84%
what the Sumarians called
Earth when it was big Earth.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:47.070 align:middle line:84%
Split in half, asteroid belt,
Earth, and where it is now.

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.700 align:middle line:84%
That seed got sent
on to our planet.

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.300 align:middle line:84%
So life came onto
this planet as well.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.700 align:middle line:84%
But life and sentient life
and people are on this planet.

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.632 align:middle line:84%
It goes every 3,600
years and makes a circle.

00:05:57.632 --> 00:05:59.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Isn't it
coming back right now?

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.530 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it a return cycle?

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.332 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: I mean,
it's like two rabbis.

00:06:03.332 --> 00:06:05.540 align:middle line:84%
You put two rabbis in a
room, you get three opinions.

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.931 align:middle line:84%
There's so many opinions
about when it's coming back.

00:06:07.931 --> 00:06:09.680 align:middle line:84%
But by now they should
be able to get here

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.690 align:middle line:90%
whenever they want to get here.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:12.235 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:06:12.235 --> 00:06:13.610 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Either
that, or they're

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.070 align:middle line:90%
really not the best scientists.

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.370 align:middle line:84%
Let's face it, if
they got here then,

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.330 align:middle line:84%
they can get here now
anytime they want.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:22.590 align:middle line:90%
And they must be psychic, too.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm always wondering,
are they psychic?

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.662 align:middle line:84%
If they're not psychic,
why are they not psyc--

00:06:25.662 --> 00:06:26.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're talking about--

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.167 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: The people
that live on the planet.

00:06:28.167 --> 00:06:29.542 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The ones
who were known

00:06:29.542 --> 00:06:30.782 align:middle line:90%
as a gods in ancient times

00:06:30.782 --> 00:06:31.740 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: The Anunnaki.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.430 align:middle line:84%
And in the Bible-- Zecharia
started his whole career

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:39.190 align:middle line:84%
because in the Bible, in the
first 12 verses of Genesis,

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:44.050 align:middle line:84%
it says, "And the God said,
let--" Elohim is plural.

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And he raised his hand
thinking he'd get a gold star

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.380 align:middle line:84%
saying, teacher,
Elohim is plural.

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.560 align:middle line:10%
Why does it say gods.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.825 align:middle line:10%
And they said, basically,
sit down and shut up.

00:06:53.825 --> 00:06:56.084 align:middle line:10%
And he spent his
whole life on this.

00:06:56.084 --> 00:06:58.250 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's the reason
he was a little crusty.

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.070 align:middle line:84%
Can imagine you spend your
whole life on something,

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:02.310 align:middle line:84%
you believe it with every
fiber, and people say ah, no.

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:02.720 align:middle line:90%
It's no good.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.886 align:middle line:84%
And they don't even read
it, because if they read it

00:07:04.886 --> 00:07:07.750 align:middle line:84%
they'd say, well, maybe he's
got something going on there.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:10.220 align:middle line:84%
So when the life started
there, their atmosphere

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.912 align:middle line:90%
was kept by volcanic eruptions.

00:07:12.912 --> 00:07:14.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: On Nibiru
you're talking about.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:15.640 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: On Nibiru, yeah.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.015 align:middle line:84%
Because the first
question people

00:07:17.015 --> 00:07:18.880 align:middle line:84%
say is, well, if they
go out every 3,600,

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.500 align:middle line:84%
and they go way out to the point
where either we don't see it

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.320 align:middle line:84%
or no one's saying
they see it, how

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.270 align:middle line:84%
do they breathe,
how do they live.

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And they supposedly live on
these volcanic eruptions.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.240 align:middle line:84%
But every time they would
come through our solar system,

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.505 align:middle line:84%
they'd lose a little
bit of their atmosphere.

00:07:34.505 --> 00:07:36.129 align:middle line:84%
And every time they'd
go way out there,

00:07:36.129 --> 00:07:38.330 align:middle line:84%
they'd lose a little
bit of their atmosphere.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.640 align:middle line:10%
And they found-- they
eventually decided

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.960 align:middle line:10%
to use gold particles
suspended in their atmosphere,

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.800 align:middle line:10%
because gold can be hammered
into-- like the gold

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.920 align:middle line:10%
on an astronaut's shield can
be seen through, because gold

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:53.130 align:middle line:10%
can be hammered 500 atoms thin.

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:57.240 align:middle line:84%
And one of the solutions
to our world's problem

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:02.940 align:middle line:84%
of the ozone layer was
to suspend gold particles

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:03.970 align:middle line:90%
in the hole over--

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:06.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it may-- so it
lends some credence to the fact

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.589 align:middle line:84%
that these many, many,
many, many years ago--

00:08:08.589 --> 00:08:09.630 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Many years ago.

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:12.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --this other
species came here in order

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.710 align:middle line:84%
to-- And Sitchin's
work, very specifically

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:18.147 align:middle line:84%
for the purpose of mining
gold from this planet

00:08:18.147 --> 00:08:19.855 align:middle line:84%
to be able to save
their own environment.

00:08:19.855 --> 00:08:20.730 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Exactly.

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:23.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which got into a
lot of complexities ethically,

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:24.550 align:middle line:90%
morally, and otherwise.

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:26.810 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Yes, they're like Star
Trek except they got involved.

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:27.393 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:27.393 --> 00:08:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot of debates
about also whether or not--

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.659 align:middle line:84%
I mean in Sitchin's work because
that's what he focused on,

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:35.580 align:middle line:84%
it seems to me that
the belief then

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.780 align:middle line:84%
is that's where it all
began, where in fact, there

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:40.950 align:middle line:84%
may have been other kinds
of evolutionary and-- not

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:43.257 align:middle line:84%
evolutionary-- seeded,
whatnot, experiments going on

00:08:43.257 --> 00:08:45.340 align:middle line:84%
even in other parts of the
planets at other times.

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:46.173 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Certainly.

00:08:46.173 --> 00:08:47.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But we
are only now going

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.200 align:middle line:84%
to talk about that portion that
he has carefully documented

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.310 align:middle line:84%
through his interpretations
of cuneiform.

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:56.610 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Of cuneiform,
and his interpretations,

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:59.310 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of the
things that were

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:01.380 align:middle line:84%
done by Kramer and all
these other people who

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:05.610 align:middle line:84%
explored the
libraries of Babylon.

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:08.700 align:middle line:84%
All these other places, that
found thousands and thousands

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.634 align:middle line:84%
and tens of thousands
of cylinder seals.

00:09:10.634 --> 00:09:12.300 align:middle line:84%
They recorded everything
from the making

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.690 align:middle line:84%
of beer, which originated
in Sumaria, which everyone's

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:18.880 align:middle line:90%
very interested in that.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.509 align:middle line:84%
There's something called
the Sumerian problem, which

00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:23.550 align:middle line:84%
is that one minute you
have nomadic goat herders,

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:26.310 align:middle line:84%
and the next minute you
have brick buildings rising

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:28.125 align:middle line:90%
into the sky, ballet dancers--

00:09:28.125 --> 00:09:30.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sophisticated
culture architecture.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.950 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Yes, people
writing, and judges,

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:36.409 align:middle line:90%
and all kinds of amazing things.

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:38.950 align:middle line:84%
And they would say, everything
we know the gods have told us.

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And in the Bible it talks
about the gods of our fathers.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:45.110 align:middle line:84%
The reason they were called
the gods of our fathers

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:47.410 align:middle line:84%
is because they
lived a long time.

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:49.760 align:middle line:84%
Because one year
was 3,600 years.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.970 align:middle line:84%
These people that were
gods with a small g.

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And they created
tremendous problems.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, that
gets back to the Tablet

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:01.180 align:middle line:90%
of the Kings, the King's list.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:04.765 align:middle line:84%
That's a different King's list
than the Egyptian or Egyptian

00:10:04.765 --> 00:10:05.640 align:middle line:90%
Atlantian Kings List.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.774 align:middle line:84%
This is the King's
list of those gods--

00:10:08.774 --> 00:10:09.440 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Well--

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.170 align:middle line:90%
--you're talking about--

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:10.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --those entities.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.131 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: If you're talking
about the ones from Manetho

00:10:13.131 --> 00:10:17.960 align:middle line:84%
and Berossus who were charged
by the different people

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.200 align:middle line:84%
to-- like the Egyptians,
I think, was Manetho

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.060 align:middle line:84%
and I think the
Babylonians, Berossus.

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:25.640 align:middle line:84%
They did a King's list, and the
first few kings on the list,

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:26.800 align:middle line:90%
I think, were the gods.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:27.180 align:middle line:90%
They talked with the--

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:28.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They lived
thousands of years.

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:29.700 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: 17,000 years.

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:29.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:30.340 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Yeah.

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:32.430 align:middle line:84%
So they supposedly came
forward in 20 something

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:34.150 align:middle line:90%
thousand years ago.

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:37.070 align:middle line:84%
The same thing is if you're
into Hindu astrology and the Age

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:39.230 align:middle line:84%
of Brahmin, all these
numbers work out.

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:42.590 align:middle line:90%
Or if you're a fan of Yogananda.

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:45.220 align:middle line:84%
He had a teacher that
he supposedly saw,

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:48.370 align:middle line:84%
or his teacher
Lahiri Mahasaya saw,

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:51.340 align:middle line:84%
this god Babaji who supposedly
lived for 3,000 years.

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:52.160 align:middle line:90%
He's one of them.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.310 align:middle line:84%
If he's real, he's
one of these people

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:56.770 align:middle line:84%
because they live
for a long time.

00:10:56.770 --> 00:11:00.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that 425,000 year
cycle would actually be one

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.410 align:middle line:84%
of the short cycles
in the day of Brahma--

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:03.160 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Exactly,

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:03.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --compared to the--

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:04.645 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: --because I
think it's a million two.

00:11:04.645 --> 00:11:06.186 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --overarching
larger, which

00:11:06.186 --> 00:11:07.935 align:middle line:84%
are up into the
trillions of years even.

00:11:07.935 --> 00:11:08.280 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Yes.

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.363 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's just
keep it to modern history,

00:11:10.363 --> 00:11:14.251 align:middle line:90%
the last 425,000 years or so.

00:11:14.251 --> 00:11:16.000 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: No, that's
what I love about it.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.510 align:middle line:84%
The thing is I know it
sounds crazy, because just

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:23.582 align:middle line:84%
like astrology, when I
first met my wife in 1974,

00:11:23.582 --> 00:11:25.540 align:middle line:84%
she was studying astrology,
I was studying her,

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:26.420 align:middle line:90%
so I learned astrology.

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:27.450 align:middle line:90%
But I thought it was nonsense.

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:29.908 align:middle line:84%
So whenever someone comes to
me and they say it's nonsense,

00:11:29.908 --> 00:11:32.480 align:middle line:84%
I say I understand because I
felt exactly the way you do.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.160 align:middle line:84%
It took me three years
before I actually

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.650 align:middle line:90%
read the Zecharia Sitchin books.

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:40.380 align:middle line:84%
Someone told me, if you really
want to have your mind blown,

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:41.150 align:middle line:90%
read this stuff.

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And when I finally
did I was like, wow,

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.910 align:middle line:84%
this really does
expand my consciousness

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:46.446 align:middle line:90%
because it explains a lot.

00:11:46.446 --> 00:11:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
saved my life many times

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:50.290 align:middle line:84%
is I know the truth
when I hear it,

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:52.301 align:middle line:84%
and when I read that, I
knew that was the truth.

00:11:52.301 --> 00:11:54.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, because you're
also intuitive, psychic.

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:55.133 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Yes.

00:11:55.133 --> 00:12:00.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk about
the information from Sitchin,

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:03.360 align:middle line:84%
the establishing of
societies on the planet

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.400 align:middle line:84%
from these travelers
from another place.

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.150 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Yes.

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:09.365 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the origins
of astrology, then, and how

00:12:09.365 --> 00:12:11.240 align:middle line:84%
it first started coming
in, because I know it

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.614 align:middle line:84%
went through a
lot of iterations.

00:12:12.614 --> 00:12:17.390 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of what do
you call it, superstition.

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:19.152 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
superstition involved.

00:12:19.152 --> 00:12:20.860 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Astrology
and superstition, you

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:21.780 align:middle line:90%
can't separate it.

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:22.488 align:middle line:90%
You really can't.

00:12:22.488 --> 00:12:24.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean this is why I'm
not popular with a lot

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.090 align:middle line:90%
of astrologers.

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:28.382 align:middle line:84%
Just like an astrology
chart, even though there's

00:12:28.382 --> 00:12:29.840 align:middle line:84%
a lot of things
that are supposedly

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.345 align:middle line:84%
irreconcilable in
your chart, you

00:12:32.345 --> 00:12:33.970 align:middle line:84%
have to figure out
how to live with it.

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:35.553 align:middle line:84%
That's the whole
purpose of astrology.

00:12:35.553 --> 00:12:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And I watch astrology charts
manifest in people's lives

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:41.872 align:middle line:84%
and I see them be useful
to people understanding

00:12:41.872 --> 00:12:43.580 align:middle line:84%
themselves, understanding
their children,

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:45.030 align:middle line:90%
understanding their spouses.

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:45.970 align:middle line:90%
I know it works.

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:48.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how it works,
but I know it works.

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:52.820 align:middle line:84%
But it also comes from a
time-- it was originally

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:57.875 align:middle line:84%
the zodiac was made
as a convenience.

00:12:57.875 --> 00:13:00.080 align:middle line:84%
In the Bible it
says the Sabbath was

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:03.760 align:middle line:84%
made for man, not
man for the Sabbath.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.730 align:middle line:84%
The Sabbath or
the constellations

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:08.290 align:middle line:84%
were made so that they could
say when the planets were coming

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:10.570 align:middle line:84%
from somewhere, you have
to be able-- like today,

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:15.320 align:middle line:84%
astronomers plot a planet
in the constellations.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.880 align:middle line:90%
They use this.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.360 align:middle line:90%
It was necessary.

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:21.280 align:middle line:84%
Just the way we have the
30 degree parallel Tropic

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.720 align:middle line:84%
of Cancer, Tropic of
Capricorn, all these tropics.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:29.510 align:middle line:84%
Those original 30 degree
parallels were the way of Anu,

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:32.640 align:middle line:84%
the way of Enlil,
the way of Enki,

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.990 align:middle line:84%
and they project
them out into space.

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:37.380 align:middle line:84%
The center one was the
one that we use today,

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:41.240 align:middle line:84%
but originally there
were three groups of 12.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And the 12 is because the
Sumerians and the gods

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:50.540 align:middle line:84%
used-- I forget how you say
it, but it's a 60-based.

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:52.230 align:middle line:90%
Its not 100-based.

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:54.910 align:middle line:90%
Even though we have ten fingers.

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:56.950 align:middle line:90%
It would be 60/10, 60/10.

00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:59.500 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we still
have a 360 degree circle.

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.610 align:middle line:84%
And they divided the
day into 12 and 12.

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:02.640 align:middle line:90%
12 is a big number.

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:03.140 align:middle line:90%
12 apostles.

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:04.473 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 60 minutes in an hour.

00:14:04.473 --> 00:14:05.830 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: 60 minutes in an hour.

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And they had 12 principle--
first there was Enki.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.760 align:middle line:84%
He was sent here
because-- for the gold.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.570 align:middle line:10%
I mean, to simplify,
and this simplifies

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:18.120 align:middle line:10%
matters because it's
pretty crazy stuff.

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.270 align:middle line:10%
And then his brother Enlil.

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:20.720 align:middle line:10%
So these are the two big bosses.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.100 align:middle line:10%
This is-- when
you read the Bible

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:24.150 align:middle line:10%
and it's like why is
God one minute loving

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:26.310 align:middle line:10%
everybody and the next
minute destroying everybody?

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:26.700 align:middle line:90%
I mean the original--

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, if you just
substitute the names of Enki

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:28.800 align:middle line:90%
and Enlil--

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:29.500 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Exactly.

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:30.625 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --you understand.

00:14:30.625 --> 00:14:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And there was an ethical debate
even in the day that occurred.

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:37.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean nobody looks
at these as what

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.460 align:middle line:84%
we would call Earth friendly
or human friendly beings.

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:40.460 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: They were not.

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:41.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But at
the same time, they

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:44.490 align:middle line:84%
did have certain ethics
they were arguing over

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:46.994 align:middle line:84%
when it came to the genetic
manipulation of the people

00:14:46.994 --> 00:14:48.160 align:middle line:90%
that they were going to use.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.410 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: You know your stuff.

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:50.770 align:middle line:90%
And this is not easy stuff.

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:53.380 align:middle line:90%
But it's so much fun.

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:55.974 align:middle line:84%
The reason everyone always
feels odd about themselves

00:14:55.974 --> 00:14:57.390 align:middle line:84%
and the human
condition is we were

00:14:57.390 --> 00:14:59.980 align:middle line:90%
created as primitive workers.

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:04.260 align:middle line:84%
It says in the Bible, God
created man in his image.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.070 align:middle line:90%
Well, they did.

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:07.970 align:middle line:90%
We have their DNA.

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:09.753 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Those gods
with the little g.

00:15:09.753 --> 00:15:12.260 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: The little g,
because they needed the gold.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:13.670 align:middle line:84%
They originally started
off mining seawater,

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:15.044 align:middle line:84%
because there's
gold in seawater,

00:15:15.044 --> 00:15:16.700 align:middle line:90%
but it wasn't enough gold.

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:19.470 align:middle line:84%
So the next minute they're
down in the lower world, which

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:21.300 align:middle line:84%
we consider hell,
but the lower world

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:24.540 align:middle line:84%
was South Africa where they have
found evidence of gold mining

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:25.882 align:middle line:90%
over 100,000 years old.

00:15:25.882 --> 00:15:27.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, Michael
Tellinger's work.

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:29.445 align:middle line:84%
I mean there's a
tremendous amount that's

00:15:29.445 --> 00:15:30.903 align:middle line:84%
been discovered in
the last decade.

00:15:30.903 --> 00:15:31.600 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: The lower world.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:32.690 align:middle line:90%
That's the lower world.

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:33.190 align:middle line:90%
And that's--

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:35.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Enki's palace
they've discovered.

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:35.870 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Exactly.

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:39.310 align:middle line:84%
And there was tremendous
toil-- and these guys,

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:42.040 align:middle line:84%
imagine the astronauts flying
around in their jet planes,

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:43.790 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden
they say, well, you've

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:46.330 align:middle line:84%
got to take a pickax
and go down into a hole.

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:48.180 align:middle line:84%
They got really--
OK, I'm going to live

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:52.120 align:middle line:84%
for 10,000 or 100,000 years, and
I'm going to do it mining gold?

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.640 align:middle line:90%
They rebelled.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, Enki,
the one who liked us,

00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:59.170 align:middle line:84%
and the reason he liked
us is the way you like

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:01.820 align:middle line:84%
the car that you work
on, because he said,

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:03.260 align:middle line:84%
in my roamings
around the planet,

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:07.960 align:middle line:84%
I have seen what he
called a lulu, which was I

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:09.680 align:middle line:84%
guess the Neander--
I don't even know.

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:10.710 align:middle line:90%
It must have been some kind of--

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:12.376 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Michael
Tellinger's take on it

00:16:12.376 --> 00:16:15.010 align:middle line:84%
is that they-- when he's
looked into those times,

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:17.510 align:middle line:84%
they appeared to be more
Neanderthal in nature,

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:20.980 align:middle line:84%
not so much the latest
evolution of the human.

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.861 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Well,
in Sitchin's work,

00:16:22.861 --> 00:16:24.860 align:middle line:84%
the Sumarians call them
the black-haired people.

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:27.280 align:middle line:84%
So it was probably the black
race was the first one.

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:30.350 align:middle line:84%
And they decided to fix
their genetic material

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:33.610 align:middle line:84%
on what had evolved,
on the being that

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:35.869 align:middle line:84%
had evolved in the
South African area.

00:16:35.869 --> 00:16:36.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:40.450 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: So when they say
that the DNA of our planet

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:42.660 align:middle line:84%
comes out of South Africa,
it makes perfect sense

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:44.840 align:middle line:84%
with what Sitchin's
talking about.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And then when they were
first created, these hominids

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.220 align:middle line:84%
or whatever you
want to call them,

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:52.761 align:middle line:84%
we just worked and
worked and worked.

00:16:52.761 --> 00:16:55.307 align:middle line:84%
And they really were
not-- they're not nice.

00:16:55.307 --> 00:16:56.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They worked them hard.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:57.655 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: They
worked them to death.

00:16:57.655 --> 00:16:59.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They did an
upgrade on the model

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:02.000 align:middle line:84%
because they gave them a certain
amount of physical traits

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.930 align:middle line:84%
and mental traits that
they did not-- that weren't

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:07.329 align:middle line:90%
native to them at that moment.

00:17:07.329 --> 00:17:08.380 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: They were
like mules, though,

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:09.470 align:middle line:90%
they couldn't reproduce.

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:10.339 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:11.524 align:middle line:90%
But they were used.

00:17:11.524 --> 00:17:13.024 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: They were
used and abused.

00:17:13.024 --> 00:17:14.300 align:middle line:90%
There's no two ways about it.

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:17.910 align:middle line:84%
And then what happened
is the goddesses,

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:21.050 align:middle line:84%
the female Anunnaki--
Anunnaki means

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:23.970 align:middle line:90%
those from heaven to Earth came.

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And the heaven that
they're referring to

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:26.990 align:middle line:90%
is the hammered-out bracelet.

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:29.120 align:middle line:84%
Those who through the
asteroid belt came.

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:30.630 align:middle line:84%
That's what they're
referring to.

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:34.400 align:middle line:84%
So the goddesses
rebelled against having

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:39.930 align:middle line:84%
to give birth to these primitive
workers, and then the Anunnaki,

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:44.780 align:middle line:84%
the first guy, his
sister and he figured out

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:47.970 align:middle line:84%
how to give us the
ability to procreate.

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:49.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's the story
of Adam and Eve.

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And where the gods lived--
small g-- where the gods lived

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:56.070 align:middle line:90%
was called Edin.

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:58.850 align:middle line:84%
So the story of the garden
of Eden is a real story.

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:03.720 align:middle line:84%
And when the brother
who was really the boss

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.390 align:middle line:84%
found out about
it, he threw a fit

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:08.540 align:middle line:84%
and threw everybody
out of the Edin.

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And this is how
Adam and Eve were

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:12.430 align:middle line:84%
expelled from the
garden of Eden.

00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:15.200 align:middle line:84%
Strangely enough in high school,
I was in honor English class

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.040 align:middle line:84%
and in Brooklyn
Technical High School

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:19.800 align:middle line:84%
we studied the Bible as a
secular book for a year,

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.000 align:middle line:84%
and it was actually
very useful to me

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.100 align:middle line:84%
in my understanding
of Sitchin's work.

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:29.320 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a lot of stuff
in the Bible that's true.

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:33.030 align:middle line:84%
They found all kinds of things
in the 1800s that had not

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:35.052 align:middle line:84%
been-- they did all these
kind of excavations.

00:18:35.052 --> 00:18:36.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean even
though some of it's

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:39.080 align:middle line:84%
presented in
allegorical form, they

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.180 align:middle line:84%
were finding the evidence
for the truth behind it.

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:42.013 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: They were.

00:18:42.013 --> 00:18:46.294 align:middle line:84%
And even Sodom and Gomorrah
and the destruction and Lot's

00:18:46.294 --> 00:18:47.960 align:middle line:84%
wife being turned
into a pillar of salt,

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.580 align:middle line:84%
that refers to a
nuclear exchange

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:53.600 align:middle line:84%
according to the Sitchin work,
which is what destroyed Sumer.

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.780 align:middle line:90%
They called it the evil wind.

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:59.390 align:middle line:84%
They had used nuclear
weapons on their planet

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:01.290 align:middle line:84%
to try and get the
volcanoes going.

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:03.110 align:middle line:84%
Because the reason
their atmosphere

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:06.990 align:middle line:84%
wasn't doing well as it went
around every 3,600 years was

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:10.140 align:middle line:84%
the volcanoes weren't belching
as much as they should.

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And they sent the nuclear
weapons into the volcanoes,

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:14.390 align:middle line:90%
and it didn't really help.

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:18.360 align:middle line:84%
And then when this one guy
who first came to Earth came,

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.560 align:middle line:84%
he used the nuclear
weapons to blast the path

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.470 align:middle line:84%
through the
hammered-out bracelet,

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:25.340 align:middle line:90%
through the asteroid belt.

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:27.660 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't know
anything about radiation.

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:29.910 align:middle line:84%
They just knew that they
sure did make a bright light,

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:31.826 align:middle line:84%
and they sure did blow
everything the hell up.

00:19:31.826 --> 00:19:34.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and these
references to nuclear attacks

00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:37.005 align:middle line:84%
and wars in the future are also
documented throughout the Vedas

00:19:37.005 --> 00:19:38.380 align:middle line:84%
and the Bhagavad
Gitas, I under--

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:39.085 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Yeah.

00:19:39.085 --> 00:19:39.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:41.310 align:middle line:90%
So it's there.

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:44.290 align:middle line:84%
It's in ancient historical
texts of other kinds as well.

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:46.081 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: That's why
I love Sitchin's work,

00:19:46.081 --> 00:19:47.770 align:middle line:84%
because it unites,
it's a uniter,

00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:49.000 align:middle line:90%
it's not really a divider.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.480 align:middle line:84%
Because Ishtar was the one
who founded the Vedic--

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:55.590 align:middle line:90%
the Indus Valley civilization.

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:57.680 align:middle line:84%
Which is why it's
so feminine and they

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:00.186 align:middle line:84%
don't want to kill
the cows and--

00:20:00.186 --> 00:20:01.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
coming back to that.

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:03.610 align:middle line:84%
Now that brings us
back into astrology,

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:05.770 align:middle line:84%
because that is a
deep and ancient part

00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:07.610 align:middle line:90%
of the Indian and Hindu culture.

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:09.380 align:middle line:84%
When you have a
child, the astrologer

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:11.240 align:middle line:84%
comes and reads for
your child at birth.

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:12.177 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Even today.

00:20:12.177 --> 00:20:13.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Even today from birth.

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:19.730 align:middle line:84%
So where did the system
of astrology as we--

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:23.620 align:middle line:84%
even somewhat like we know it
now first come into existence,

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:27.320 align:middle line:84%
with the 12 planets-- I mean
with the 12 signs and so forth?

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:30.430 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: The two brothers then
had children, they had wives.

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:33.814 align:middle line:84%
And then people would give
birth to more children.

00:20:33.814 --> 00:20:36.230 align:middle line:84%
It gets confusing because they
lived for such a long time.

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:38.215 align:middle line:84%
So you could have the
grandfather, the father,

00:20:38.215 --> 00:20:38.840 align:middle line:90%
and they were--

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:39.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And many
grandchildren.

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:41.118 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Many grandchildren.

00:20:41.118 --> 00:20:42.760 align:middle line:84%
So they had a ruling
of the Twelve.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.460 align:middle line:84%
There were 12 who
were the council who

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:46.020 align:middle line:90%
sort of ran the place.

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:50.810 align:middle line:84%
And the way things changed
in terms of who had dominance

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:53.830 align:middle line:84%
was based on when the
procession of the equinox

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:57.140 align:middle line:84%
is put the first day of
spring into a different sign.

00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:59.670 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's always singing
about the Age of Aquarius.

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:01.080 align:middle line:90%
Well, it was a big deal to them.

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:05.840 align:middle line:84%
And we all know that there's
observatories around the world,

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:08.950 align:middle line:84%
whether it's Stonehenge,
whether it's Chichen Itza,

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:10.240 align:middle line:90%
there's observatories.

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.390 align:middle line:84%
Because the change in
Egypt, it was a big deal.

00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:15.290 align:middle line:90%
The Ziggurat at Ur.

00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:17.810 align:middle line:84%
People will say,
well, astrology came--

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:19.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean even I have
written in my book

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:21.860 align:middle line:84%
"Karma Cards," because before
I knew the Sitchin work,

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:24.000 align:middle line:84%
I'd tried to apply a
different kind of logic.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.670 align:middle line:84%
This was before I had
identified myself as a psychic.

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:29.660 align:middle line:84%
I approached it from an
agrarian point of view.

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And then one day I
realized, no farmer needs

00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:36.630 align:middle line:84%
a gigantic Ziggurat of Ur to
know when to plant his crops,

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:39.400 align:middle line:84%
because if he does he
shouldn't be in that business.

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:42.117 align:middle line:84%
You can see that lambs are
being born, oh, spring's coming.

00:21:42.117 --> 00:21:43.450 align:middle line:90%
There's a whole bunch of things.

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:45.990 align:middle line:84%
They needed it for a big
reason, and the reason

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:48.720 align:middle line:90%
was who's the boss.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:53.764 align:middle line:84%
And when the change
from Aries right now we

00:21:53.764 --> 00:21:55.180 align:middle line:84%
talk about the Age
of Aquarius, we

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:57.679 align:middle line:84%
sing about the Age of Aquarius,
it's been the Age of Pisces,

00:21:57.679 --> 00:22:00.110 align:middle line:84%
Pisces was the fish,
the fish is Jesus.

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:02.220 align:middle line:84%
The symbol for
Jesus was the fish.

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:07.710 align:middle line:84%
But a few Piscean ages ago,
and it takes about 25,000 years

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:09.740 align:middle line:90%
to go around.

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:12.360 align:middle line:84%
A few Piscean ages
ago, that fish

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:13.780 align:middle line:90%
was the first guy who came here.

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:16.060 align:middle line:84%
That was his symbol because
he landed in the water,

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:18.470 align:middle line:84%
and he wore a suit that
enabled him to go in the water.

00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:20.630 align:middle line:90%
So his symbol was the fish.

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:24.190 align:middle line:84%
His son's symbol, which is
some very weird Sumarian name,

00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:25.900 align:middle line:90%
Ningishzida.

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:28.530 align:middle line:84%
His symbol was the
DNA snakes that we

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:30.210 align:middle line:84%
use today, the
caduceus, which is

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:33.640 align:middle line:90%
used to identify medical things.

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:35.080 align:middle line:90%
They knew about DNA.

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:36.770 align:middle line:90%
They knew all this stuff.

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:40.840 align:middle line:84%
So when we have our inventions
today, it's a reinvention.

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:43.820 align:middle line:84%
They were able to communicate
with their planet.

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:46.606 align:middle line:84%
So they must have known
about a whole lot of things.

00:22:46.606 --> 00:22:48.480 align:middle line:84%
I don't know about the
psychic stuff, though.

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:51.670 align:middle line:84%
That's something that I think
might be a function of Earth.

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Because we were made, when that
first brother, the fish, who's

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:58.310 align:middle line:84%
Enki, when him
and his sister who

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:03.560 align:middle line:84%
was the medical technician
on board Star Trek, she said,

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:04.620 align:middle line:90%
my hands have made it.

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:07.760 align:middle line:84%
She figured out how to
do it by combining clay

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.850 align:middle line:90%
from different areas.

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
Sumerian explanation

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:14.002 align:middle line:90%
of why the different races are.

00:23:14.002 --> 00:23:15.710 align:middle line:84%
Why we're different
colors, because we're

00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:19.980 align:middle line:84%
from the different clays of the
areas that they made the pe--

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:23.030 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of beautiful in a way,
it's kind of scary in a way.

00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:25.030 align:middle line:90%
But it's a lot of fun.

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And then what happened is
you have these 12 goddesses

00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:30.950 align:middle line:84%
and gods-- there's only
one real goddess, Ishtar,

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:33.770 align:middle line:84%
who was the one who--
because she was tough.

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:35.040 align:middle line:90%
She was really tough.

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.240 align:middle line:84%
So you'd have--
astrology was used

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:39.654 align:middle line:84%
to tell when the procession
of equinoxes, when

00:23:39.654 --> 00:23:41.820 align:middle line:84%
the first day of spring
would occur in the different

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:43.810 align:middle line:90%
constellations.

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:51.280 align:middle line:84%
It goes back, I think, 72 years
is one degree of each 30 degree

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:53.805 align:middle line:90%
segment of a 360 degree circle.

00:23:53.805 --> 00:23:55.280 align:middle line:90%
So it's every 72 years.

00:23:55.280 --> 00:24:00.437 align:middle line:84%
So every 2,160 years, I think,
the rulership would change.

00:24:00.437 --> 00:24:02.520 align:middle line:84%
But for them, that's
nothing, because they lived--

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:06.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're saying those
cycles were a direct reference

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.670 align:middle line:90%
to who the planetary rule was--

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:09.420 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Exactly.

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:10.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --under at that time.

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:11.935 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: It was
like a time clock.

00:24:11.935 --> 00:24:13.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When
did it switch over

00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:16.905 align:middle line:84%
to being symbolic of
the animal kingdom?

00:24:16.905 --> 00:24:19.030 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Well, those
symbols were always the same.

00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:20.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They were.

00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:20.643 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Yes.

00:24:20.643 --> 00:24:21.760 align:middle line:90%
They were always the same.

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:24.760 align:middle line:84%
Ishtar was always
a woman with wheat.

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:27.220 align:middle line:90%
And the bull was Enlil.

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:28.620 align:middle line:90%
He was the Bull of Heaven.

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:29.775 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:24:29.775 --> 00:24:32.520 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: It used to be the
bull was the first sign.

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And then when it moved
into Aries who was Marduk,

00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:38.582 align:middle line:84%
which is the Babylonian name
for Ra of Egypt-- You see,

00:24:38.582 --> 00:24:41.313 align:middle line:84%
the problem is is they have so
many names because they're--

00:24:41.313 --> 00:24:42.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The same entities
have so many names.

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:43.250 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Yes.

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:46.315 align:middle line:84%
And Ra was-- like
whenever we're in church

00:24:46.315 --> 00:24:49.890 align:middle line:84%
and we say the word amen,
that comes back from Egypt.

00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:52.830 align:middle line:90%
Amen in Egyptian meant hidden.

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:56.980 align:middle line:84%
When Ra was expelled for his
transgressions from Egypt

00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:59.300 align:middle line:90%
and went to South America.

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:00.563 align:middle line:90%
If you read the Sitchin work--

00:25:00.563 --> 00:25:00.916 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It gets--

00:25:00.916 --> 00:25:01.270 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: I know it gets--

00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:02.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --very confusing.

00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:04.830 align:middle line:84%
Because then if you go
into more modern times,

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:08.260 align:middle line:84%
you're looking at Edgar Cayce is
the reincarnation of Ra, and on

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:09.570 align:middle line:90%
and on and on.

00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:11.051 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it gets
really confusing.

00:25:11.051 --> 00:25:12.550 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Well, as
a psychic, I know

00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:15.910 align:middle line:84%
that it would be
easy to confuse--

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:18.170 align:middle line:84%
because I was a big
Edgar Cayce fan.

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:21.740 align:middle line:84%
Still am, because he's like one
of the kings of all psychics.

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:23.550 align:middle line:84%
And I actually left
college because I

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:25.133 align:middle line:84%
thought the Earth
changes were coming.

00:25:25.133 --> 00:25:27.510 align:middle line:84%
I could imagine the
guidance counselor is still

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:28.920 align:middle line:90%
dining out on that story.

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm sure.

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:32.160 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: But you
can make mistakes.

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:35.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's easy to understand
that time in history

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:39.240 align:middle line:84%
as Atlantis or Lemuria,
because all these places

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:42.200 align:middle line:84%
around the world existed along
the 30th parallel mainly,

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:45.386 align:middle line:84%
which is why the Sphinx looks
out on the 30th parallel.

00:25:45.386 --> 00:25:47.010 align:middle line:84%
All this stuff is in
the Sitchin books.

00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:51.210 align:middle line:84%
They're fascinating, lovely
explanations for stuff.

00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:53.840 align:middle line:90%
But it's a ride.

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:56.450 align:middle line:84%
You have to deal with
a scientist who's

00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:57.700 align:middle line:90%
trying to document everything.

00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:00.199 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we were talking
off camera and you were saying

00:26:00.199 --> 00:26:04.500 align:middle line:84%
the really big shift in
astrology came when it was no

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:07.594 align:middle line:84%
longer something that was
utilized only by the royalty

00:26:07.594 --> 00:26:08.135 align:middle line:90%
and leaders--

00:26:08.135 --> 00:26:08.310 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Yeah.

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:09.393 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --of the planet.

00:26:09.393 --> 00:26:12.732 align:middle line:84%
When it started becoming more
of a popularly used system--

00:26:12.732 --> 00:26:13.690 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: It backfired.

00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:14.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It changed.

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:15.020 align:middle line:90%
It backfired.

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:16.720 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's talk about
that transition.

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:17.345 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Sure.

00:26:17.345 --> 00:26:22.430 align:middle line:84%
The gods and goddesses used
the superstitious aspect

00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:23.887 align:middle line:90%
to control the people.

00:26:23.887 --> 00:26:25.345 align:middle line:10%
It's just like,
what was it, Lennon

00:26:25.345 --> 00:26:27.730 align:middle line:10%
who said religion is the
opiate of the people.

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:28.480 align:middle line:10%
They used it.

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:31.150 align:middle line:10%
And so it was them who
sort of started it off

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:34.200 align:middle line:10%
as the omens
proclaim my divinity.

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:37.560 align:middle line:10%
Or the omens-- they
had omen priests.

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:39.410 align:middle line:84%
Sitchin, who was a
linguist, told me

00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:41.460 align:middle line:84%
that the word worship,
the origin for worship

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:44.250 align:middle line:84%
as he had understood
it meant to work for.

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:47.200 align:middle line:84%
And when you worshipped a
god, you provided them--

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.912 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I would
agree with that.

00:26:48.912 --> 00:26:49.870 align:middle line:90%
I don't like that word.

00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:52.060 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Yeah, well, you
provided them with food.

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:55.150 align:middle line:84%
You provided them with stuff
because they were lazy.

00:26:55.150 --> 00:26:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And supposedly they
were big, and plus they

00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:02.230 align:middle line:84%
came from this planet where
their time was so different.

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:05.690 align:middle line:84%
Our Earth was just like, oh
my god, the lights are on,

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:06.970 align:middle line:90%
the lights are off.

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:11.650 align:middle line:84%
So they had to develop ways of
dealing with all those things.

00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And it just got to the point
where the omen priests,

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:19.250 align:middle line:84%
it's like anything
else, it devolved.

00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:22.350 align:middle line:84%
One minute you're using it as
a clock to determine rulership.

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:23.850 align:middle line:84%
Then you start
saying to the people,

00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:25.880 align:middle line:84%
oh yes, but I want
you to fight for me

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:29.050 align:middle line:84%
because the omens in the sky
are saying I am the leader,

00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:31.130 align:middle line:84%
and you should be
fighting for me.

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:33.860 align:middle line:84%
Sitchin has a book called
"The War of Gods and Men."

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:37.180 align:middle line:84%
When they gods started
using men as surrogates

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:41.040 align:middle line:84%
to fight their battles because
they all-- not only were they

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:44.520 align:middle line:84%
human, they were some of
the worst aspects of human.

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:48.650 align:middle line:84%
They were incestuous,
the guys couldn't keep it

00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:49.840 align:middle line:90%
in their space suits.

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.530 align:middle line:90%
And it was really very odd.

00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:54.780 align:middle line:84%
The things that they-- I
mean with their grandchildren

00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:56.220 align:middle line:90%
and people.

00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:59.710 align:middle line:84%
It's what you would
think would happen

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:03.320 align:middle line:84%
with very, very human
beings or, unfortunately,

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:05.360 align:middle line:84%
some of the worst aspects
of human beings given

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:06.980 align:middle line:90%
ultimate power.

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:10.031 align:middle line:84%
And were supposedly really
big when they first start.

00:28:10.031 --> 00:28:10.656 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:10.656 --> 00:28:12.097 align:middle line:90%
25, 35 feet tall.

00:28:12.097 --> 00:28:12.680 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Yes.

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And supposedly when
they started us,

00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:18.970 align:middle line:84%
the stories in the Bible
of Methuselah are real.

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:21.910 align:middle line:84%
And if I was a super
wealthy person,

00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:24.400 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure this
is going on, I would

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:27.350 align:middle line:84%
be studying the junk genes
that have been reported,

00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:29.740 align:middle line:84%
because supposedly
those can be turned on

00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:31.830 align:middle line:84%
and we could live for
hundreds of years.

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:33.538 align:middle line:84%
And there are some
people that say, well,

00:28:33.538 --> 00:28:35.820 align:middle line:84%
who wants to live for
hundreds of years?

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:38.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm enjoying my life.

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:39.890 align:middle line:90%
You could live healthy.

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:42.180 align:middle line:84%
So originally when we
were built as people,

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:45.110 align:middle line:84%
they didn't want us to
fall apart in 70, 80 years.

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:48.977 align:middle line:84%
They wanted us to work in
the mines for a long time.

00:28:48.977 --> 00:28:51.310 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the, I think,
one of the important aspects

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:54.920 align:middle line:84%
of Sitchin's work is it
suggests that there is a way

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:57.990 align:middle line:90%
to have us live a longer time.

00:28:57.990 --> 00:29:02.700 align:middle line:84%
So the superstition connected
with the omens in the sky,

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:04.440 align:middle line:84%
then instead-- the
first time someone

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:07.430 align:middle line:84%
said-- they used to do
the charts of the kings

00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:09.530 align:middle line:84%
to show why the King
was so wonderful.

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:15.100 align:middle line:84%
Because the gods decided
that they couldn't just

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:16.360 align:middle line:90%
talk to the people.

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:17.900 align:middle line:90%
There were so many people.

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:19.380 align:middle line:90%
They needed intercession.

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:22.210 align:middle line:84%
They needed either a-- first
it was priests who were really

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:24.650 align:middle line:90%
scientists, then it was kings.

00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And when kingship
was done, the king

00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:29.330 align:middle line:90%
would be able to approach them.

00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:32.970 align:middle line:84%
Then the king's chart-- they had
to show his chart to show why

00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:33.880 align:middle line:90%
he was so great--

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:35.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So
proclamation will do.

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:35.760 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Exactly.

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And then the first time
they did a chart for someone

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:41.260 align:middle line:84%
less than a king was the
beginning of democracy.

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And now we do charts
for everything.

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:45.400 align:middle line:84%
We do charts for companies,
we do charts for books.

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:47.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So during
what period of history

00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:50.210 align:middle line:84%
did that happen where it
started becoming popularized?

00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:52.450 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Well, I'm sure
it was popularized even

00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:54.700 align:middle line:90%
in the early days of kingship.

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:56.405 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So Babylonian times.

00:29:56.405 --> 00:29:57.320 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: 3000 BC.

00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:59.650 align:middle line:90%
It could be 2000 BC.

00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:00.660 align:middle line:90%
Probably with Acadia.

00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:02.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:04.830 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Which was the
first Semitic language.

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:06.930 align:middle line:84%
But I'm sure it had
to be done in secret

00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:13.614 align:middle line:84%
because that was-- they were
very, very rigid in terms

00:30:13.614 --> 00:30:15.530 align:middle line:84%
of what you could do and
what you couldn't do.

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:16.196 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:16.196 --> 00:30:18.300 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: And they'd
kill you for very little.

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:20.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet
at the same time,

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:24.320 align:middle line:84%
there are cave drawings of the
cycles of the Moon dating back

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.760 align:middle line:84%
at least 25,000 years,
probably beyond.

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:28.510 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Because it was magic.

00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:31.890 align:middle line:84%
If you want to look
at the people-- Well,

00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:33.310 align:middle line:90%
that was the earliest calendar.

00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:35.400 align:middle line:84%
The Moon is the
earliest calendar.

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:39.270 align:middle line:84%
You have the two calendars--
the calendar originally

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:41.770 align:middle line:84%
that the Hebrews used,
that the Jews used,

00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:44.040 align:middle line:84%
which is I think
57 something, is

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:48.220 align:middle line:84%
the same calendar from
Sippar in Sumeria.

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:50.320 align:middle line:84%
They've been using
this calendar which

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:52.332 align:middle line:84%
connects the solar and
the lunar calendar.

00:30:52.332 --> 00:30:53.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's interesting.

00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:56.530 align:middle line:84%
I spoke with Jose
Arguelles before he died,

00:30:56.530 --> 00:30:59.850 align:middle line:84%
and we had a very
interesting conversation.

00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And he was talking
about the Mayan calendar

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:03.695 align:middle line:84%
and the passage of
time and cycles.

00:31:03.695 --> 00:31:05.570 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Yeah, Sitchin
quotes him, actually.

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:06.153 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:06.153 --> 00:31:08.760 align:middle line:10%
And then he was talking
about the introduction

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:11.330 align:middle line:10%
of the Gregorian calendar,
which we use now,

00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:15.130 align:middle line:10%
as being something that
was intentionally planted

00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:19.270 align:middle line:10%
by an extraterrestrial species
to put the average human out

00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:21.210 align:middle line:10%
of sync with all natural
rhythms and cycles--

00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:21.970 align:middle line:10%
>>FARBER: Probably true.

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:23.490 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: --and
make us compliant.

00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:25.710 align:middle line:90%
So what about this larger cycle?

00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:27.680 align:middle line:84%
If that's happening
with the calendar itself

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:29.920 align:middle line:84%
where, obviously,
it should be more

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:34.890 align:middle line:84%
of a Moon cycle, a 28-day cycle,
rather 30, 31 days, 28 one

00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:36.680 align:middle line:90%
month of the year.

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:38.230 align:middle line:84%
However they have
constructed it,

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:40.280 align:middle line:84%
it's just off enough
that you're never--

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:42.710 align:middle line:84%
you're looking at an artificial
construct for guidance

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:45.050 align:middle line:84%
rather than an
innate understanding

00:31:45.050 --> 00:31:46.320 align:middle line:90%
of natural cycles.

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:50.250 align:middle line:84%
So how does that reflect back
to what happened with astrology?

00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:53.300 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Well, because
astrology, Western astrology

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:55.310 align:middle line:90%
starts with the equinox.

00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:57.920 align:middle line:84%
When someone says Happy New
Year to me on January 1,

00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:59.640 align:middle line:84%
it's like that's
not my new year.

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:02.010 align:middle line:84%
My new year is the
first day of spring.

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And all those wonderful
temples were-- a lot of them

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:08.990 align:middle line:84%
were oriented to determine when
is the first day of spring.

00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:11.800 align:middle line:84%
When does the sun come
through, and it wouldn't always

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:15.590 align:middle line:90%
fall in the Aries constellation.

00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:17.550 align:middle line:84%
Now it's been in Pisces
for the last 20--

00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:19.440 align:middle line:84%
and pretty soon it's
going to be in Aquarius.

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:21.790 align:middle line:90%
It pretty much is in Aquarius.

00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:24.440 align:middle line:84%
All the electronics
that we have now.

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:27.470 align:middle line:84%
You might say that the
harbinger was in the 1600s

00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:29.250 align:middle line:90%
when the atom was rediscovered.

00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:33.050 align:middle line:84%
The Hindus have had the concept
of the atom for 10,000 years.

00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:33.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:35.199 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: And what
did they call it?

00:32:35.199 --> 00:32:39.640 align:middle line:84%
Anu, A-N-U, which was the name
of the god ruler of Nibiru.

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:41.970 align:middle line:90%
That's the actual spelling.

00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:43.410 align:middle line:90%
Same sound.

00:32:43.410 --> 00:32:48.380 align:middle line:84%
Just like some sounds resonate
through history, like Ram.

00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:51.940 align:middle line:84%
Everything from Ram of India
to RAM, Random Access Memory

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:52.760 align:middle line:90%
from the computer.

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:56.222 align:middle line:84%
There are certain sounds that
resonate through history.

00:32:56.222 --> 00:32:58.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's another reason
I love Sitchin stuff,

00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:00.939 align:middle line:84%
it just sets me off
thinking about stuff.

00:33:00.939 --> 00:33:02.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All the correlations.

00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.855 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Yeah.

00:33:02.855 --> 00:33:03.810 align:middle line:90%
But it's odd.

00:33:03.810 --> 00:33:05.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So it's passed down.

00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:06.710 align:middle line:90%
It's using superstition.

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:09.070 align:middle line:84%
It's initially used
to control the masses.

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:11.120 align:middle line:84%
Now the masses
have access to what

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:14.840 align:middle line:84%
is, more or less, an
established, almost scientific

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:17.920 align:middle line:90%
kind of modality.

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:19.837 align:middle line:84%
I guess you call it
divination device or tool.

00:33:19.837 --> 00:33:21.461 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Well, that's
what it becomes,

00:33:21.461 --> 00:33:24.280 align:middle line:84%
because ever since people
have known there was a future,

00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:25.671 align:middle line:90%
everyone wants to predict it.

00:33:25.671 --> 00:33:26.920 align:middle line:90%
This is why I have a business.

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:28.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:30.927 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: And they wanted
to predict it, too.

00:33:30.927 --> 00:33:32.635 align:middle line:84%
Now, the strange thing
about the Anunnaki

00:33:32.635 --> 00:33:34.220 align:middle line:90%
is they believed in God.

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And their big debate was
whether the horrible things that

00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:40.900 align:middle line:84%
had happened-- once they
realized what they had done

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:42.720 align:middle line:84%
when the nuclear
devices went off

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:45.116 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't know anything
about radiation, once they

00:33:45.116 --> 00:33:46.990 align:middle line:84%
realized they had killed
the things they just

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:49.800 align:middle line:84%
loved and destroyed them
all, they wanted to know

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:51.910 align:middle line:90%
was it fate, or was it destiny?

00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:54.480 align:middle line:84%
Their understanding
of destiny as a word

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:57.410 align:middle line:84%
was like a planetary--
planets have destinies.

00:33:57.410 --> 00:34:00.290 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they can be changed, but
like every four billion years

00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:01.620 align:middle line:90%
or every few mill--

00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:06.170 align:middle line:84%
Fate, they called their
leader, the decider of fate.

00:34:06.170 --> 00:34:08.260 align:middle line:84%
The different gods were
the decider of fates

00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:10.100 align:middle line:90%
because fates can be changed.

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And they finally came to
believe that certain things had

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.860 align:middle line:90%
been destiny.

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:16.392 align:middle line:84%
And they supposedly
left the planet,

00:34:16.392 --> 00:34:17.850 align:middle line:84%
but I don't believe
everybody left.

00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:20.433 align:middle line:84%
You never know, because there's
certain things in world events

00:34:20.433 --> 00:34:22.815 align:middle line:84%
that sure smack of someone
trying to have control--

00:34:22.815 --> 00:34:23.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well,

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:24.030 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: --over everyone.

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:25.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and
those giant beings

00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:27.139 align:middle line:90%
exist all over the planet.

00:34:27.139 --> 00:34:28.820 align:middle line:84%
Those kinds of
skeletons have been

00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:31.889 align:middle line:84%
found in Asia, South
America, Central America.

00:34:31.889 --> 00:34:33.520 align:middle line:84%
There's some very
large beings that

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:36.040 align:middle line:84%
have been found in
North America as well.

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.619 align:middle line:84%
So this is not something that
was exclusive to that region.

00:34:38.619 --> 00:34:39.660 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: No, not at all.

00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:43.280 align:middle line:84%
And if you go to any place
that has any of the Sumerian

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:45.340 align:middle line:84%
headdresses, like
University of Pennsylvania

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:48.580 align:middle line:84%
or in England they're at
some of the museums or maybe

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:50.235 align:middle line:84%
even the Lourve,
they're like this big.

00:34:50.235 --> 00:34:50.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:53.070 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: The woman's
headdress is like this big.

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And you know,
Sitchin's last book

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:59.890 align:middle line:84%
was all about Puabi--
Puabi-- I looked it up.

00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:03.340 align:middle line:84%
Supposedly, this sarcophagus
exists in an English museum

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:07.080 align:middle line:84%
of this woman who
probably has alien DNA.

00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And he really wanted
to have that analyzed

00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:14.080 align:middle line:84%
to see if-- And he bet
his whole life on it.

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:16.230 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
it'll ever happen.

00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:18.870 align:middle line:84%
But he was willing to
stake his reputation

00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:22.470 align:middle line:84%
on DNA from this
mummy being in there.

00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:26.040 align:middle line:84%
So if this stuff is true
or not doesn't really

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:27.915 align:middle line:84%
affect the fact that I
can do a chart for you

00:35:27.915 --> 00:35:29.460 align:middle line:90%
and tell you stuff about it.

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:31.360 align:middle line:84%
Once again, we're
back to a situation

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:33.880 align:middle line:84%
where we have to, just like
in your astrology chart,

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:38.770 align:middle line:84%
reconcile all the disparate
aspects of astrology.

00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:40.960 align:middle line:84%
I have to reconcile the
fact that I look out

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:43.900 align:middle line:90%
on the world as an Aquarius.

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:45.454 align:middle line:84%
I have a Pisces
moon, which is so

00:35:45.454 --> 00:35:47.870 align:middle line:84%
different-- the signs next to
each other are so different.

00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:51.720 align:middle line:84%
Aquarius is cold and emotional,
Pisces is very emotional.

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And yet it's my rising sign that
the world sees, which is Leo.

00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:57.656 align:middle line:84%
I always joke about
Leo risings, art--

00:35:57.656 --> 00:35:58.780 align:middle line:90%
we have stage fright, sure.

00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:00.280 align:middle line:84%
We get scared if
we're not on stage.

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:00.946 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:00.946 --> 00:36:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: So it's trying
to get involved with--

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:08.750 align:middle line:84%
to reconcile the fact that
it started with superstition.

00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:11.060 align:middle line:84%
It was used to
control the masses.

00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:14.910 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately-- and we were
talking about India before.

00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:17.010 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it controls
people's lives too much.

00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:20.240 align:middle line:84%
I do not believe in living your
life by astrology or anything.

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:23.153 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm a big
free will person.

00:36:23.153 --> 00:36:23.962 align:middle line:90%
Once again--

00:36:23.962 --> 00:36:26.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it can give
you just certain potentials

00:36:26.170 --> 00:36:29.820 align:middle line:84%
and attributes that you can
likely use or choose or not

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:30.320 align:middle line:90%
choose.

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:31.595 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Like what you were
saying about electricity

00:36:31.595 --> 00:36:32.137 align:middle line:90%
yesterday.

00:36:32.137 --> 00:36:32.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:34.610 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: It shows
you the potentials

00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:35.660 align:middle line:90%
and where you're flowing.

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:37.201 align:middle line:84%
But you can't look
at someone's chart

00:36:37.201 --> 00:36:40.720 align:middle line:84%
and say this person is a genius
or this person is unfortunately

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:42.390 align:middle line:90%
in a mental institution.

00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:45.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand how you
can tell from astrology

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:47.970 align:middle line:84%
what level someone's
operating their chart on.

00:36:47.970 --> 00:36:49.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm not that good.

00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:50.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't think
anyone's that good.

00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:52.096 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
and also, you just

00:36:52.096 --> 00:36:54.460 align:middle line:84%
talked about reconciling
these various factors.

00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:57.537 align:middle line:84%
Now we have to reconcile also
that there's vedic astrology.

00:36:57.537 --> 00:36:58.120 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Yes.

00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:01.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, vedic astrology
shifts the chart to the extent

00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:04.220 align:middle line:84%
that you're almost
in an entire sign--

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:04.970 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: You are.

00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:06.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --behind what your--

00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:07.670 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Because they
use the constellations.

00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:08.295 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:08.295 --> 00:37:11.030 align:middle line:84%
Western astrology says, and some
people love vedic astrology,

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:12.190 align:middle line:90%
some people love Western.

00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:13.694 align:middle line:90%
Then you have Chinese.

00:37:13.694 --> 00:37:14.235 align:middle line:90%
The Chinese--

00:37:14.235 --> 00:37:14.730 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Well,
that's different.

00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The Chinese astrology,
the Chinese horoscope.

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:18.050 align:middle line:90%
And that's different as well.

00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:22.210 align:middle line:84%
So you have chosen
Western astrology, why?

00:37:22.210 --> 00:37:23.900 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: It's what
I learned at first.

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:24.950 align:middle line:90%
And it seems to work.

00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:26.820 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to
mess up my brain.

00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:28.900 align:middle line:84%
It's why I stay
away from numerology

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:30.640 align:middle line:84%
because their versions
of the numbers

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:32.841 align:middle line:84%
are different from
what astrology teaches.

00:37:32.841 --> 00:37:34.340 align:middle line:84%
I have friends who
are numerologists

00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:36.500 align:middle line:90%
who do very accurate stuff.

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:39.510 align:middle line:84%
I think, once again, coming
back to the Sabbath being

00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:41.490 align:middle line:84%
made for man, not
man for the Sabbath.

00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:45.020 align:middle line:84%
I feel that it's in
us, the magic is in us.

00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:47.350 align:middle line:90%
The magic's not in a magic wand.

00:37:47.350 --> 00:37:49.020 align:middle line:90%
My cards are just nothing--

00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:50.686 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These are
little guide stones,

00:37:50.686 --> 00:37:52.276 align:middle line:90%
but your intuition is innate.

00:37:52.276 --> 00:37:53.130 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Exactly.

00:37:53.130 --> 00:37:54.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:57.590 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: The divinity, because
they were gods with a small g,

00:37:57.590 --> 00:38:01.140 align:middle line:84%
but God with a big G
lives inside all things.

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:02.950 align:middle line:84%
Even they came to
finally realize it

00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:04.630 align:middle line:90%
after they destroyed everything.

00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:06.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's a
whole other conversation.

00:38:06.770 --> 00:38:09.611 align:middle line:84%
It's a conversation I adore,
but one we can't get into today.

00:38:09.611 --> 00:38:10.610 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: No, of course.

00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:13.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That nature of
what is a human versus what

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:14.437 align:middle line:90%
is a god and so forth.

00:38:14.437 --> 00:38:16.811 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Well, I just think
that they weren't intuitive,

00:38:16.811 --> 00:38:18.870 align:middle line:84%
because why did they
need electronic devices?

00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:20.430 align:middle line:84%
They should have
been psychic enough

00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:22.230 align:middle line:90%
to communicate with each other--

00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:24.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Maybe technologically
advanced, but not necessarily

00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:28.720 align:middle line:84%
advanced on the other levels of
abilities, expansive abilities.

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:29.790 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: It must be.

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:30.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Quite possible.

00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:33.875 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, so now you've
settled on Western astrology.

00:38:33.875 --> 00:38:34.910 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: I have.

00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:37.935 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You use it very
successfully with people.

00:38:37.935 --> 00:38:38.560 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Yeah.

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:40.434 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, you use
your psychic abilities

00:38:40.434 --> 00:38:42.950 align:middle line:84%
as an overlay, but you've
dedicated a lot of your time,

00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:45.760 align:middle line:84%
creativity, energy, your
wife's lovely artwork

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:48.520 align:middle line:84%
to create books-- as you say,
they're in Barnes and Noble.

00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:49.520 align:middle line:90%
You have your own shelf.

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:50.386 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: We do in the
spirituality section

00:38:50.386 --> 00:38:51.700 align:middle line:90%
of Barnes and Noble.

00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:53.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you've
created even these--

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:54.390 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: This is my first book.

00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:55.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --these cards.

00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:56.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, these karma cards.

00:38:56.430 --> 00:38:59.000 align:middle line:84%
But the reason I had
you bring these here

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.150 align:middle line:84%
is because when we were
speaking off camera

00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:04.260 align:middle line:84%
you said one of the things
that is often overlooked

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:06.157 align:middle line:84%
is the importance
of the rising sign.

00:39:06.157 --> 00:39:06.740 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Yes.

00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:08.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I
want us to have news

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:11.320 align:middle line:84%
we can go away with
individually today,

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:13.400 align:middle line:84%
if you'll please take
some time and talk

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:15.770 align:middle line:84%
about the various
signs and the rising

00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:17.024 align:middle line:90%
signs and their attributes.

00:39:17.024 --> 00:39:18.190 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: It is so powerful.

00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:19.856 align:middle line:84%
I know that we've
talked about astrology

00:39:19.856 --> 00:39:21.090 align:middle line:90%
is coming from superstition.

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:23.260 align:middle line:84%
But the rising sign is
something-- have you ever

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:26.744 align:middle line:84%
wondered why don't they get
me, or why I'm saying this

00:39:26.744 --> 00:39:28.910 align:middle line:84%
and they're not hearing me,
it's because your rising

00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:31.799 align:middle line:84%
sign and your sun sign, or your
rising sign and your moon sign,

00:39:31.799 --> 00:39:33.590 align:middle line:84%
especially if you're
a woman, is different.

00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:33.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:39:33.850 --> 00:39:35.724 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk about
what the rising sign is,

00:39:35.724 --> 00:39:37.430 align:middle line:90%
how you even find it on a chart.

00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: OK, it's the
most specious thing

00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:41.650 align:middle line:90%
we've spoked about so far.

00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:43.560 align:middle line:84%
The rising sign is
the sign that is

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:45.740 align:middle line:84%
on the horizon at
the moment you're

00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:47.350 align:middle line:84%
born, the second
that you're born,

00:39:47.350 --> 00:39:49.820 align:middle line:84%
as viewed from the
place you're born.

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:55.700 align:middle line:84%
So I was born on January 22,
1950, which was Aquarius.

00:39:55.700 --> 00:40:00.870 align:middle line:84%
But the sign on the horizon
at 6:33 PM that was rising

00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:02.830 align:middle line:90%
was Leo.

00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And that is how I have
chosen to project myself

00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:07.510 align:middle line:90%
into physical reality.

00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:10.307 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But most people
hear that they're an Aquarius

00:40:10.307 --> 00:40:10.890 align:middle line:90%
and that's it.

00:40:10.890 --> 00:40:11.480 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: They think
they're an Aquarius.

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:12.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They think
they're an Aquarius

00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:15.570 align:middle line:84%
and you project to the world at
a party, oh, I'm an Aquarius.

00:40:15.570 --> 00:40:17.820 align:middle line:84%
But what you're saying
is the other person

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:19.950 align:middle line:84%
is saying maybe you
think so, but what

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:21.525 align:middle line:90%
I see is the rising sign.

00:40:21.525 --> 00:40:22.610 align:middle line:90%
I see a Leo.

00:40:22.610 --> 00:40:25.190 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: They're seeing
an Aquarius flavored

00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:26.449 align:middle line:90%
with Pisces overtones.

00:40:26.449 --> 00:40:27.990 align:middle line:84%
It's like we're like
a glass of wine.

00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:28.695 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:28.695 --> 00:40:33.800 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Well, I sense it's a
susane of Aquarius with Pisces.

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:36.260 align:middle line:90%
It's a lot of fun.

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:38.950 align:middle line:84%
I tell people-- I've been doing
these things on Facebook called

00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:41.305 align:middle line:84%
tweetchings, which I'll
explain to people all

00:40:41.305 --> 00:40:43.180 align:middle line:84%
the different rising
signs and what it means,

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:44.690 align:middle line:84%
and I'll do it in
tweet-size bites.

00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:45.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I
want to do that now.

00:40:45.650 --> 00:40:46.310 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: OK.

00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:51.020 align:middle line:84%
So I tell people look at
yourself as a movie projector.

00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:53.710 align:middle line:84%
A movie projector
is a bright light,

00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:56.100 align:middle line:84%
a curved mirror to
focus that bright light,

00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:58.020 align:middle line:84%
and it goes out
through the film,

00:40:58.020 --> 00:41:00.450 align:middle line:84%
and then it goes
out through a lens.

00:41:00.450 --> 00:41:01.290 align:middle line:90%
What do people see?

00:41:01.290 --> 00:41:02.910 align:middle line:84%
They see the light
on the lens that's

00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:05.570 align:middle line:90%
been projected onto the screen.

00:41:05.570 --> 00:41:06.910 align:middle line:90%
What is the bright light?

00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:08.140 align:middle line:90%
The bright light is the sun.

00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:10.649 align:middle line:10%
In your chart, even the
symbol in your astrology chart

00:41:10.649 --> 00:41:12.690 align:middle line:10%
is a dot in the center of
a circle like the sun's

00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:14.170 align:middle line:10%
in the center of
the solar system.

00:41:14.170 --> 00:41:16.045 align:middle line:10%
Like you're in the center
of everything else.

00:41:16.045 --> 00:41:17.670 align:middle line:10%
The ego, the sun is the purpose.

00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:18.770 align:middle line:90%
The ego.

00:41:18.770 --> 00:41:21.690 align:middle line:84%
So your ego bright light
gets reflected off your moon.

00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:23.510 align:middle line:84%
In astrology the
symbol for the moon

00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:25.380 align:middle line:90%
looks like a curved mirror.

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And so there's that
bright light sun,

00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:29.590 align:middle line:84%
my Aquarius sun
getting reflected off

00:41:29.590 --> 00:41:34.300 align:middle line:84%
of my Pisces-colored moon,
so it colors the light.

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:36.920 align:middle line:84%
Then it gets reflected and it
goes towards my rising sign

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:37.420 align:middle line:90%
lens.

00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:38.660 align:middle line:90%
What's the film?

00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:40.000 align:middle line:90%
It's my thoughts.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.390 align:middle line:84%
It's the constant film
of my 35 millimeter brain

00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:46.410 align:middle line:84%
always going with
different things.

00:41:46.410 --> 00:41:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And how is that going to
get shot out into the world?

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:50.528 align:middle line:84%
It's going to get shot
out into the world

00:41:50.528 --> 00:41:51.581 align:middle line:90%
through my rising sign.

00:41:51.581 --> 00:41:52.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, so let's--

00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:53.700 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: So they see Leo.

00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:56.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so Leo-- why
don't we start at Aries

00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:58.181 align:middle line:90%
and then work our way through.

00:41:58.181 --> 00:41:59.680 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: If you're
an Aries rising,

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:03.220 align:middle line:84%
you could be the nicest Pisces,
you could be the nicest Cancer,

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:06.120 align:middle line:84%
you could be the sweet--
they see you as aggressive.

00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:08.790 align:middle line:90%
They see you as liking to fight.

00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And they'll say to you
that you like to fight,

00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:13.630 align:middle line:84%
and you'll say no you
don't, no I don't.

00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:15.976 align:middle line:90%
And you'll be fighting.

00:42:15.976 --> 00:42:17.350 align:middle line:84%
But for you, you're
not fighting.

00:42:17.350 --> 00:42:19.170 align:middle line:84%
You're just telling
them what's true.

00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:21.600 align:middle line:84%
So the rising sign is a
very interesting concept

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:23.550 align:middle line:84%
because it has nothing
to do with you.

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:26.180 align:middle line:84%
All it has to do with is
how people perceive you.

00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:27.820 align:middle line:90%
And it's so powerful.

00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:31.190 align:middle line:84%
So if you're a Cancer,
sun, and you're sensitive

00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:34.072 align:middle line:84%
and you want to help everybody,
and your rising sign is Aries,

00:42:34.072 --> 00:42:35.780 align:middle line:84%
a lot of times people
will be like, well,

00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:37.880 align:middle line:90%
that's a little harsh.

00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:39.974 align:middle line:84%
And this is without
talking about planets

00:42:39.974 --> 00:42:41.640 align:middle line:84%
that are in the signs
at the same moment

00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:43.931 align:middle line:84%
you're rising, because when
I was born Pluto was there,

00:42:43.931 --> 00:42:45.890 align:middle line:90%
so that changes the things too.

00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:47.932 align:middle line:84%
But still, if you're
an Aries rising,

00:42:47.932 --> 00:42:49.390 align:middle line:84%
you're always going
to be perceived

00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:50.806 align:middle line:84%
as somebody who
wants to be first,

00:42:50.806 --> 00:42:52.475 align:middle line:84%
a little pushy, a
little aggressive.

00:42:52.475 --> 00:42:55.239 align:middle line:90%


00:42:55.239 --> 00:42:56.280 align:middle line:90%
All the traits that you--

00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:57.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Controlling?

00:42:57.370 --> 00:42:58.590 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: They can
be controlling.

00:42:58.590 --> 00:42:58.900 align:middle line:90%
Bossy--

00:42:58.900 --> 00:42:59.566 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Bossy,

00:42:59.566 --> 00:43:01.959 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: OK. -is more-- And
I love my wife is an Aries.

00:43:01.959 --> 00:43:03.750 align:middle line:84%
She has Mars in Aries
and Mercury in Aries,

00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:04.570 align:middle line:90%
and I'll say you're bossy.

00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:05.850 align:middle line:90%
She'll say no, I'm not bossy.

00:43:05.850 --> 00:43:07.050 align:middle line:90%
I just know what I want.

00:43:07.050 --> 00:43:08.321 align:middle line:90%
I want--

00:43:08.321 --> 00:43:10.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there's a fair
amount of denial that goes

00:43:10.570 --> 00:43:12.350 align:middle line:90%
along with the--

00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:13.860 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Well, for
fun, sure, yeah.

00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:16.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --with our rising sign
because inside ourselves, we're

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:17.658 align:middle line:84%
feeling-- maybe
we're relating more

00:43:17.658 --> 00:43:20.980 align:middle line:84%
to our purpose or our emotions
of the moon or something,

00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:23.035 align:middle line:84%
and we resent people
seeing us in this way

00:43:23.035 --> 00:43:25.160 align:middle line:84%
because we don't think it's
an accurate reflection.

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:26.845 align:middle line:84%
But it's really,
really good to know

00:43:26.845 --> 00:43:29.465 align:middle line:84%
that that is what's being
cast out as the image.

00:43:29.465 --> 00:43:31.220 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Well, it's just like
what we're talking about today.

00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:33.370 align:middle line:84%
The history of astrology is
something if you don't know it,

00:43:33.370 --> 00:43:34.120 align:middle line:90%
you don't know it.

00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:37.070 align:middle line:84%
If you don't know
about your rising sign,

00:43:37.070 --> 00:43:40.130 align:middle line:84%
it's like you have an
incomplete bag of tools.

00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:42.740 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of astrologists don't
know where it's come from.

00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:43.420 align:middle line:90%
That's what--

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:43.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah--

00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:44.460 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: --afflicts them--

00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:46.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I've never put
so much emphasis on it.

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:48.680 align:middle line:84%
OK, now we have about
15, 20 minutes left,

00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:50.130 align:middle line:84%
and I want to go through all
of them and have some fun.

00:43:50.130 --> 00:43:50.290 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: OK.

00:43:50.290 --> 00:43:52.230 align:middle line:84%
Taurus rising, if
you're a Taurus rising,

00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:54.020 align:middle line:90%
people see you as steady.

00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:55.580 align:middle line:90%
They will trust you.

00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:58.710 align:middle line:84%
They see you as-- Taurus
is ruled by Venus.

00:43:58.710 --> 00:44:00.650 align:middle line:84%
They're usually
attractive people.

00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:03.800 align:middle line:84%
They see you as
somebody they can trust.

00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:05.180 align:middle line:90%
You don't like change.

00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:06.820 align:middle line:90%
They see you this way.

00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:10.460 align:middle line:84%
But let's say you have your moon
in Aquarius, you like change.

00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:12.865 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's me, my
moon in Aquarius and Taurus

00:44:12.865 --> 00:44:13.365 align:middle line:90%
rising.

00:44:13.365 --> 00:44:15.330 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Now that's what I say.

00:44:15.330 --> 00:44:19.130 align:middle line:84%
They see you as change is not
something that you really want.

00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:20.880 align:middle line:84%
But it's something
that you do want.

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:23.402 align:middle line:84%
But this is one of the
hard things to reconcile.

00:44:23.402 --> 00:44:25.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So someone else
might be looking back

00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:27.730 align:middle line:90%
and I'm thinking I love change.

00:44:27.730 --> 00:44:30.837 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking for the next
most interesting thing.

00:44:30.837 --> 00:44:32.920 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, that's not
what's being protected.

00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:34.990 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Because
on occasion you

00:44:34.990 --> 00:44:38.240 align:middle line:84%
will have said something to
someone in a Taurus rising

00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:41.530 align:middle line:84%
fashion to indicate that
you don't want things

00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:43.130 align:middle line:84%
to change about a
particular thing.

00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And in your mind,
you're being Aquarian

00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:48.900 align:middle line:84%
and you're being coldly
scientific about it,

00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:50.800 align:middle line:84%
and you're just
laying out the facts.

00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And they heard it as this
is the way things have to be

00:44:53.410 --> 00:44:56.135 align:middle line:84%
or else I will not be
happy, and you will not

00:44:56.135 --> 00:44:57.310 align:middle line:90%
be happy if I'm not happy.

00:44:57.310 --> 00:44:57.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:57.820 --> 00:44:59.653 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Because Taurus,
think of the bull.

00:44:59.653 --> 00:45:02.534 align:middle line:84%
When Taurus gets really mad,
you don't want to be around.

00:45:02.534 --> 00:45:03.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:07.290 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Even though Aries are
more angry and then calm down.

00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:10.260 align:middle line:84%
Taurus, if you get them
angry, get out of the way.

00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:11.374 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:45:11.374 --> 00:45:13.040 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: You don't
want that to happen.

00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:14.500 align:middle line:84%
So then you get
to Gemini rising.

00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:16.770 align:middle line:90%
Gemini rising, they are quick.

00:45:16.770 --> 00:45:18.460 align:middle line:10%
They don't like to be bored.

00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:19.300 align:middle line:10%
Oh my god.

00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:21.020 align:middle line:10%
Boredom is-- this
is why they could

00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:22.790 align:middle line:10%
have a whole bunch
of different signs,

00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:24.800 align:middle line:10%
and yet it doesn't
apply to them,

00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:26.670 align:middle line:10%
because they want
to know everything.

00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:28.300 align:middle line:90%
They seem very fast.

00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:30.370 align:middle line:90%
They seem very communicative.

00:45:30.370 --> 00:45:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And let's say someone's a
Scorpio with a Gemini rising.

00:45:33.370 --> 00:45:34.650 align:middle line:90%
That's hard.

00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And this is another thing
with the rising sign,

00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:39.080 align:middle line:84%
it explains why you're
having difficulty

00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:42.170 align:middle line:84%
projecting who you really
are into life, which

00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:44.230 align:middle line:84%
is what's so useful
because it helps

00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:46.230 align:middle line:84%
you to feel more
comfortable with yourself.

00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:47.980 align:middle line:84%
That's why I get
excited about it.

00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:52.575 align:middle line:84%
Because when I was a kid, I was
shy, and I'm not shy anymore.

00:45:52.575 --> 00:45:54.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:45:54.370 --> 00:45:57.390 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Because I had that
Aquarian scientific thing.

00:45:57.390 --> 00:46:00.199 align:middle line:84%
When you're scientific
or you're a little cold,

00:46:00.199 --> 00:46:01.990 align:middle line:84%
you're a little
unemotional about something

00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:02.985 align:middle line:84%
because you want to
make it work and you

00:46:02.985 --> 00:46:05.443 align:middle line:84%
don't want to have to think
about all the emotions involved

00:46:05.443 --> 00:46:06.330 align:middle line:90%
with it.

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:08.030 align:middle line:90%
I was a little ashamed of that.

00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:09.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's just like
hey, rising sign.

00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:11.040 align:middle line:90%
You don't like it?

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:11.540 align:middle line:90%
Too bad.

00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:11.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Too bad.

00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:12.760 align:middle line:90%
That's what it is.

00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:13.264 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:46:13.264 --> 00:46:14.930 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: So Gemini
rising, they usually

00:46:14.930 --> 00:46:17.190 align:middle line:84%
have long arms, which is
a very interesting trait.

00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:18.273 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:46:18.273 --> 00:46:19.769 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: They
seem young forever.

00:46:19.769 --> 00:46:21.310 align:middle line:84%
Gemini rising's
actually kind of fun.

00:46:21.310 --> 00:46:22.912 align:middle line:90%
They seem smart quick.

00:46:22.912 --> 00:46:24.620 align:middle line:84%
But they don't
necessarily seem like they

00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:28.110 align:middle line:84%
want to study like
Zacharia did for 90 years.

00:46:28.110 --> 00:46:29.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:31.900 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: So now Cancer
rising is the nurturer.

00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:33.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you're a really
aggressive person

00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:36.197 align:middle line:84%
and you're a Cancer rising,
no one's going to know.

00:46:36.197 --> 00:46:38.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What if you're
Aries with Cancer rising?

00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:40.613 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: No one's going to
know how aggressive you are,

00:46:40.613 --> 00:46:43.300 align:middle line:90%
and you can get away with a lot.

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:46.450 align:middle line:84%
Because you're thinking
they're-- Aries are burning all

00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:47.260 align:middle line:90%
the time.

00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And Cancer rising,
everyone thinks you care.

00:46:50.610 --> 00:46:54.160 align:middle line:84%
So you can get away with a
bit when you're Cancer rising.

00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:56.580 align:middle line:84%
But they really-- the thing
is you really do care,

00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:59.090 align:middle line:84%
and when you're a Taurus
rising you really are that way.

00:46:59.090 --> 00:47:01.600 align:middle line:84%
You really do want--
you want to make things

00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:03.350 align:middle line:84%
better because
Taurus likes luxury,

00:47:03.350 --> 00:47:05.580 align:middle line:84%
and Taurus doesn't
want people to suffer.

00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:06.560 align:middle line:90%
They hate pain.

00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:08.730 align:middle line:90%
Taurus as a sign hates pain.

00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:11.490 align:middle line:84%
So they want things to be--
And Aries rising really

00:47:11.490 --> 00:47:12.500 align:middle line:90%
do want to be pioneers.

00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:14.458 align:middle line:84%
They do want to be first,
and sometimes they'll

00:47:14.458 --> 00:47:16.680 align:middle line:84%
push to get to the
head of the line.

00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And Geminis really do
want to know everything.

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:21.879 align:middle line:84%
They wish if they could just
sit at the Library of Alexandria

00:47:21.879 --> 00:47:23.670 align:middle line:84%
for a little while,
they'd know everything.

00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:24.836 align:middle line:90%
They really want to do that.

00:47:24.836 --> 00:47:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And Cancers really do
want to nurture people.

00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:30.490 align:middle line:84%
The thing to know is
if your rising sign's

00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:33.665 align:middle line:84%
different than your sun sign
tremendously, it's hard.

00:47:33.665 --> 00:47:34.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:47:34.290 --> 00:47:35.415 align:middle line:90%
You have internal conflict.

00:47:35.415 --> 00:47:39.000 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Like if you were a
Libra rising and a Scorpio sun,

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:39.980 align:middle line:90%
it's hard.

00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:42.880 align:middle line:84%
And you think about the
structure of a chart,

00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:45.110 align:middle line:84%
if you're let's say a
Scorpio rising in Libra sun,

00:47:45.110 --> 00:47:46.610 align:middle line:84%
it puts your sun
into the 12th house

00:47:46.610 --> 00:47:50.270 align:middle line:84%
which makes you a little
shyer than normal.

00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:52.940 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of intricacies
in astrology that I

00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:56.220 align:middle line:84%
have found-- sorry--
actually work.

00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:59.985 align:middle line:84%
And the rising sign is sort
of the key to understanding

00:47:59.985 --> 00:48:02.340 align:middle line:84%
the things that
don't seem to work.

00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:04.055 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now we're
going on from Cancer.

00:48:04.055 --> 00:48:04.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So hidden
conflicts, OK.

00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:06.365 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Leo rising I've
already talked about.

00:48:06.365 --> 00:48:07.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's you.

00:48:07.130 --> 00:48:07.755 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Yeah.

00:48:07.755 --> 00:48:09.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean we stand
upright, we're proud.

00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:10.490 align:middle line:90%
Leo is proud.

00:48:10.490 --> 00:48:13.150 align:middle line:84%
The word for a group
of lions is pride.

00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:15.552 align:middle line:84%
And I've already said
that our stage fright

00:48:15.552 --> 00:48:17.260 align:middle line:84%
is we get scared when
we're not on stage.

00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:19.804 align:middle line:84%
Like we read things
about public speaking.

00:48:19.804 --> 00:48:21.595 align:middle line:84%
Fear of public speaking
is worse than death

00:48:21.595 --> 00:48:22.750 align:middle line:90%
fear for most people.

00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:23.916 align:middle line:90%
We're like what's that mean?

00:48:23.916 --> 00:48:24.840 align:middle line:90%
That's impossible.

00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:25.684 align:middle line:90%
So Leo is--

00:48:25.684 --> 00:48:27.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
people warm to Leos.

00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:27.870 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: They do.

00:48:27.870 --> 00:48:29.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They are
charming, often.

00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:31.352 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: We're having fun.

00:48:31.352 --> 00:48:32.935 align:middle line:84%
We're here, we might
as well have fun.

00:48:32.935 --> 00:48:35.280 align:middle line:90%
That's the Leo attitude.

00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:37.159 align:middle line:84%
But Leos as leaders--
Aries are leaders

00:48:37.159 --> 00:48:38.700 align:middle line:84%
because they're out
there pioneering.

00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:41.250 align:middle line:84%
Leos as leaders walk backwards
making sure someone's

00:48:41.250 --> 00:48:43.090 align:middle line:90%
following them.

00:48:43.090 --> 00:48:43.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:48:43.970 --> 00:48:45.361 align:middle line:90%
It's about me.

00:48:45.361 --> 00:48:46.110 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Exactly.

00:48:46.110 --> 00:48:48.460 align:middle line:84%
Enough about me, what
do you think of me?

00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:50.530 align:middle line:90%
So then Virgo now.

00:48:50.530 --> 00:48:53.060 align:middle line:84%
If you're a Leo and a Virgo
combination, very hard,

00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:55.450 align:middle line:84%
because Virgo looks
at things, they're shy

00:48:55.450 --> 00:48:59.040 align:middle line:84%
and-- even though
Ishtar was not shy,

00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:02.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean the sacred King rituals,
all those things were from her.

00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:06.800 align:middle line:84%
She was incredibly strong and
violent and powerful woman.

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:12.530 align:middle line:84%
Virgo as a sign represents
analysis, detail-oriented work.

00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:15.910 align:middle line:84%
If you get connected to worrying
about the outcome of what

00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:17.360 align:middle line:90%
your analysis is, it's worry.

00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:20.520 align:middle line:84%
So if you're a Virgo
rising everyone--

00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:22.980 align:middle line:84%
Virgo rising or Pisces rising,
the opposite sign, everyone

00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:25.390 align:middle line:84%
always comes up to you
and says, what's wrong?

00:49:25.390 --> 00:49:26.810 align:middle line:90%
Is something wrong?

00:49:26.810 --> 00:49:30.350 align:middle line:84%
And if you're a Leo sun,
there's nothing wrong.

00:49:30.350 --> 00:49:32.495 align:middle line:84%
You're looking out in the
world as a Leo and you're

00:49:32.495 --> 00:49:34.750 align:middle line:84%
a Pisces rising, everyone's
like, are you OK?

00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:37.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But they often
have a lot of the minutia--

00:49:37.730 --> 00:49:38.855 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: The Virgo rising.

00:49:38.855 --> 00:49:40.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --shunted
off onto them

00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:42.230 align:middle line:90%
because they can handle it.

00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:44.290 align:middle line:84%
They can handle
detail without it

00:49:44.290 --> 00:49:46.080 align:middle line:90%
driving them absolutely insane.

00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:48.040 align:middle line:90%
That's the perception anyway.

00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:50.024 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: That they
want to do useful,

00:49:50.024 --> 00:49:51.190 align:middle line:90%
they want to do useful work.

00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:52.630 align:middle line:84%
Another thing about
Taurus is they

00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:54.230 align:middle line:90%
are the copers of the zodiac.

00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:57.146 align:middle line:84%
So people think that you
can cope with anything.

00:49:57.146 --> 00:49:57.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: True.

00:49:57.770 --> 00:49:59.320 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Throw another
rock on the pile.

00:49:59.320 --> 00:49:59.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:00.560 align:middle line:90%
That is very true.

00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:01.490 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: She'll carry it.

00:50:01.490 --> 00:50:01.990 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry.

00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:03.292 align:middle line:90%
But you're not a Taurus.

00:50:03.292 --> 00:50:04.750 align:middle line:84%
That's the thing
to keep reminding.

00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:06.700 align:middle line:90%
I just look this way.

00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:08.550 align:middle line:90%
I play this on TV.

00:50:08.550 --> 00:50:11.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the
Virgo, they are tasked,

00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:12.810 align:middle line:84%
and they're often
seen as the one who

00:50:12.810 --> 00:50:16.077 align:middle line:84%
can handle the responsibilities
of a lot of detail, when maybe

00:50:16.077 --> 00:50:18.160 align:middle line:84%
that's not what they are
in their sun sign at all.

00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:19.570 align:middle line:84%
That's just what
they appear to be.

00:50:19.570 --> 00:50:20.090 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Exactly.

00:50:20.090 --> 00:50:20.631 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:50:20.631 --> 00:50:23.810 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: The rising sign is
always what you appear to be.

00:50:23.810 --> 00:50:25.380 align:middle line:84%
And when we get
to Capricorn we'll

00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:27.095 align:middle line:84%
talk about that, because
if you're a Capricorn,

00:50:27.095 --> 00:50:29.260 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be given more
responsibility than you should

00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:29.700 align:middle line:90%
be.

00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:30.533 align:middle line:90%
Virgos are usually--

00:50:30.533 --> 00:50:31.959 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh,
that's interesting.

00:50:31.959 --> 00:50:34.250 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: One of the great
things about the rising sign

00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:37.810 align:middle line:84%
is mothers should know their
children's rising sign.

00:50:37.810 --> 00:50:38.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very good.

00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:39.781 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Think about it.

00:50:39.781 --> 00:50:41.520 align:middle line:90%
A kid can't talk.

00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:45.530 align:middle line:84%
But if you know your child's
rising sign, you'll understand,

00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:47.050 align:middle line:84%
and your sun sign,
you'll understand

00:50:47.050 --> 00:50:49.210 align:middle line:84%
that they might look
like look like-- what

00:50:49.210 --> 00:50:51.620 align:middle line:84%
if your baby is a Pisces
or a Virgo rising?

00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:52.600 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong?

00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:53.670 align:middle line:90%
There's something wrong.

00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:55.590 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing wrong.

00:50:55.590 --> 00:50:57.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure sometimes there
is something wrong,

00:50:57.440 --> 00:50:58.481 align:middle line:90%
but you know what I mean.

00:50:58.481 --> 00:50:59.889 align:middle line:90%
There's a tendency.

00:50:59.889 --> 00:51:00.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:51:00.430 --> 00:51:00.750 align:middle line:90%
So where are we now?

00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:01.865 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: So now
we're up to Libra.

00:51:01.865 --> 00:51:02.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Libra, OK.

00:51:02.490 --> 00:51:04.073 align:middle line:10%
>>FARBER: So if
you're a Libra rising,

00:51:04.073 --> 00:51:06.880 align:middle line:10%
everything's bounc-- the
air signs are Libra, where

00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:09.090 align:middle line:10%
your point of view
is in the middle.

00:51:09.090 --> 00:51:12.284 align:middle line:10%
You're looking here and here to
see how the scales are balanced

00:51:12.284 --> 00:51:13.700 align:middle line:10%
and the scales are
never balanced.

00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:16.220 align:middle line:84%
If you're a Gemini, you're
here and you're here.

00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:17.720 align:middle line:84%
So when you're a
Gemini rising, they

00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:19.192 align:middle line:90%
see you as two different people.

00:51:19.192 --> 00:51:20.900 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe I
didn't say that before.

00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:22.737 align:middle line:90%
But it's so major.

00:51:22.737 --> 00:51:24.820 align:middle line:84%
If you're a Gemini rising,
people are always like,

00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:26.900 align:middle line:84%
but you just said something
completely different.

00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:27.480 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:31.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm a Gemini rising and I
am two different people.

00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:32.810 align:middle line:84%
If you don't like that,
you don't like me.

00:51:32.810 --> 00:51:33.990 align:middle line:90%
See, that's the whole business.

00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:36.031 align:middle line:84%
And if you're Aquarius
you're all over the place.

00:51:36.031 --> 00:51:37.870 align:middle line:90%
You're non-local.

00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:42.630 align:middle line:84%
It's the Heisenberg uncertainty
principle as a personality.

00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:44.690 align:middle line:84%
If you know where
he is, then you

00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:46.320 align:middle line:84%
can't measure how
fast it's going.

00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:47.780 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't know
how fast it's going,

00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:48.420 align:middle line:90%
you don't know where it is.

00:51:48.420 --> 00:51:50.295 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now we're in
the quantum realm, OK.

00:51:50.295 --> 00:51:52.550 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: We're in the quantum
realm with personality.

00:51:52.550 --> 00:51:55.020 align:middle line:84%
So if you're a Libra rising,
you're in the middle.

00:51:55.020 --> 00:51:57.650 align:middle line:84%
You're watching this, so
they like nice clothes,

00:51:57.650 --> 00:51:59.570 align:middle line:84%
they like balance,
they like harmony.

00:51:59.570 --> 00:52:01.750 align:middle line:84%
So you're an Aries, but
you're a Libra rising.

00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:04.020 align:middle line:84%
So you are ready
to kick some butt.

00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And everyone thinks
he just wants harmony.

00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:07.631 align:middle line:90%
Don't fight.

00:52:07.631 --> 00:52:10.130 align:middle line:84%
If you're a Libra rising, people
should not fight around you

00:52:10.130 --> 00:52:12.440 align:middle line:84%
because Libras are willing
to fight for harmony.

00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:15.960 align:middle line:84%
But once again, knowing
that people are seeing you,

00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:19.120 align:middle line:84%
and Libra is-- every sign
has positive and negative.

00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:21.920 align:middle line:84%
Libra rising negative is they
can see you as indecisive.

00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:24.275 align:middle line:84%
Like oh my god, I
can't really decide.

00:52:24.275 --> 00:52:25.390 align:middle line:90%
I can't really decide.

00:52:25.390 --> 00:52:27.220 align:middle line:84%
And Gemini is not
going to decide,

00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:28.500 align:middle line:90%
it's who are they going to be.

00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:30.412 align:middle line:84%
It's two different
people at the very least.

00:52:30.412 --> 00:52:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And if they're
expert on something,

00:52:31.870 --> 00:52:35.540 align:middle line:84%
then you get four different
people with Gemini rising.

00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:38.500 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now we move on from
Libra to Scorpio rising.

00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:42.807 align:middle line:84%
Scorpio rising is the
sign of misunderstanding

00:52:42.807 --> 00:52:44.390 align:middle line:84%
because they're so
passionate, they're

00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:46.090 align:middle line:84%
so deep, they're
so beyond words,

00:52:46.090 --> 00:52:48.950 align:middle line:84%
they're so no second
agenda with Scorpio

00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:51.810 align:middle line:84%
that they are perceived
by the rest of the world

00:52:51.810 --> 00:52:55.430 align:middle line:90%
as they can't figure out.

00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:56.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're an enigma.

00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:58.310 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Scorpio is the
sign of misunderstanding.

00:52:58.310 --> 00:53:00.018 align:middle line:84%
So when you're a
Scorpio rising-- my wife

00:53:00.018 --> 00:53:01.230 align:middle line:90%
is a Scorpio rising.

00:53:01.230 --> 00:53:04.154 align:middle line:84%
She'll be sitting there thinking
did I leave the water running

00:53:04.154 --> 00:53:05.570 align:middle line:84%
when I left the
house, and someone

00:53:05.570 --> 00:53:07.695 align:middle line:84%
will think that she's
looking at their darkest fear

00:53:07.695 --> 00:53:09.730 align:middle line:90%
inside themselves.

00:53:09.730 --> 00:53:11.897 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they're
constantly being misunderstood.

00:53:11.897 --> 00:53:13.729 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: It's the sign
of misunderstanding.

00:53:13.729 --> 00:53:15.940 align:middle line:84%
When you're a Scorpio rising,
if someone doesn't have

00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:17.989 align:middle line:84%
their act together
and you look at them,

00:53:17.989 --> 00:53:19.530 align:middle line:84%
or if you're a
Scorpio sun-- you see,

00:53:19.530 --> 00:53:21.160 align:middle line:84%
when that Scorpio
sun's coming out

00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:22.740 align:middle line:84%
of your Taurus
rising, whenever you

00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:25.390 align:middle line:84%
have Scorpio prominent
in someone's chart,

00:53:25.390 --> 00:53:27.690 align:middle line:90%
weak people need not apply.

00:53:27.690 --> 00:53:31.350 align:middle line:84%
Because A) you really do see--
especially when it's the sun,

00:53:31.350 --> 00:53:33.100 align:middle line:90%
you really do see through them.

00:53:33.100 --> 00:53:36.230 align:middle line:84%
But a Scorpio rising, it looks
like you see through them.

00:53:36.230 --> 00:53:38.530 align:middle line:84%
So if you're this
Cancer sun or a Pisces--

00:53:38.530 --> 00:53:41.620 align:middle line:84%
and I'm using those as-- there's
other signs that are nice,

00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:44.080 align:middle line:84%
but those are the
sweetest, emotional.

00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:47.960 align:middle line:84%
You're really nice, and you're
a Scorpio rising, oh, oh, oh.

00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:51.180 align:middle line:90%
I didn't mean it, mommy.

00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:54.580 align:middle line:84%
They think you're super intense,
because Scorpio is Scorpio.

00:53:54.580 --> 00:53:55.900 align:middle line:90%
It's power.

00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:57.940 align:middle line:84%
We'll move on to
Sagittarius rising.

00:53:57.940 --> 00:54:00.154 align:middle line:84%
Sagittarius rising--
Scorpios can keep secrets,

00:54:00.154 --> 00:54:02.570 align:middle line:84%
so they think you're secretive
when you're Scorpio rising.

00:54:02.570 --> 00:54:05.800 align:middle line:90%
Sagittarius don't keep secrets.

00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:07.550 align:middle line:84%
Scorpio knows the truth
and doesn't say it

00:54:07.550 --> 00:54:09.508 align:middle line:84%
because they want to use
it at the right moment

00:54:09.508 --> 00:54:11.190 align:middle line:84%
when they can use
the most power.

00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:13.690 align:middle line:84%
Sagittarius feel like if they
don't say what they know,

00:54:13.690 --> 00:54:14.414 align:middle line:90%
they're lying.

00:54:14.414 --> 00:54:16.080 align:middle line:84%
Because the whole
purpose of Sagittarius

00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:17.340 align:middle line:90%
is to disseminate wisdom.

00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:19.756 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they'd be all for
the radical truth movement,

00:54:19.756 --> 00:54:20.853 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:54:20.853 --> 00:54:21.539 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Yeah.

00:54:21.539 --> 00:54:22.580 align:middle line:90%
Don't tell them a secret.

00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:24.371 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A lot of Sag
risings there, yeah.

00:54:24.371 --> 00:54:26.670 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: And Sag rising, I
mean Sag risings are blunt

00:54:26.670 --> 00:54:30.221 align:middle line:84%
to the point where people feel
like the evil wind of the--

00:54:30.221 --> 00:54:31.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I've
experienced that.

00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:34.890 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: The Anunnaki or-- with
the radiation is just like--

00:54:34.890 --> 00:54:35.571 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:54:35.571 --> 00:54:37.320 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: --a little
too much information.

00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:38.440 align:middle line:90%
A little too much truth.

00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:40.292 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not necessarily
their intention to hurt,

00:54:40.292 --> 00:54:40.720 align:middle line:90%
though.

00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:41.761 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: No, not at all.

00:54:41.761 --> 00:54:42.639 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:54:42.639 --> 00:54:44.680 align:middle line:84%
See, the whole thing is
they're being themselves.

00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:46.930 align:middle line:84%
And when you're a
Sag rising, whatever

00:54:46.930 --> 00:54:51.210 align:middle line:84%
energy is all potential and
kinetic inside your projector

00:54:51.210 --> 00:54:53.510 align:middle line:84%
of you is coming
through that lens.

00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:55.469 align:middle line:84%
And people who don't
know you, only gonna--

00:54:55.469 --> 00:54:57.260 align:middle line:84%
and people who don't
want to take the time,

00:54:57.260 --> 00:54:59.327 align:middle line:84%
or people who are in a
destabilized situation,

00:54:59.327 --> 00:55:01.660 align:middle line:84%
they're only going to see
what's coming out of the lens.

00:55:01.660 --> 00:55:05.180 align:middle line:84%
If you're a Sag rising,
they'll see you as wise.

00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:08.134 align:middle line:84%
But they'll also see you as
incredibly blunt sometimes

00:55:08.134 --> 00:55:09.550 align:middle line:84%
and someone who's
saying something

00:55:09.550 --> 00:55:11.390 align:middle line:90%
that maybe they shouldn't say.

00:55:11.390 --> 00:55:13.430 align:middle line:84%
It's the classic too
much information.

00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:15.050 align:middle line:84%
So now we come to
Capricorn rising.

00:55:15.050 --> 00:55:16.550 align:middle line:84%
And this is really
important to know

00:55:16.550 --> 00:55:18.140 align:middle line:84%
if your baby's a
Capricorn rising.

00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:19.930 align:middle line:84%
Because kids who are
Capricorn risings

00:55:19.930 --> 00:55:23.220 align:middle line:84%
are given too much
responsibility as children.

00:55:23.220 --> 00:55:25.150 align:middle line:90%
It's classic.

00:55:25.150 --> 00:55:27.890 align:middle line:84%
And they shouldn't
be, and then they

00:55:27.890 --> 00:55:32.540 align:middle line:84%
end up having another $5
into the psychiatrist's

00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:33.467 align:middle line:90%
fund for their future.

00:55:33.467 --> 00:55:35.050 align:middle line:84%
They're given too
much responsibility,

00:55:35.050 --> 00:55:36.175 align:middle line:90%
but they seem very serious.

00:55:36.175 --> 00:55:37.940 align:middle line:84%
And as a sign, they
get younger as they

00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:39.335 align:middle line:90%
get older, which is really nice.

00:55:39.335 --> 00:55:40.460 align:middle line:90%
Capricorn risings are nice.

00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:41.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh,
that's interesting.

00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:42.960 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Yeah,
but they're very--

00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:44.150 align:middle line:90%
they want to be respected.

00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:46.930 align:middle line:84%
If you know you have a child
that's a Capricorn rising,

00:55:46.930 --> 00:55:51.192 align:middle line:84%
do not say you've lost respect
for them because it's like a--

00:55:51.192 --> 00:55:53.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: My husband and my
son are Capricorn rising.

00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:54.850 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Well, you understand.

00:55:54.850 --> 00:55:57.395 align:middle line:84%
They want to be respected
by the people they respect.

00:55:57.395 --> 00:55:58.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:55:58.020 --> 00:56:00.603 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: They don't care about
everybody, but by the people--

00:56:00.603 --> 00:56:03.500 align:middle line:84%
and Capricorn as a sign is
the goat with the fish's tail.

00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:06.290 align:middle line:84%
The fish's tail symbolizes the
emotional needs of a Capricorn,

00:56:06.290 --> 00:56:07.580 align:middle line:90%
and they're very deep.

00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:09.990 align:middle line:84%
That's why-- they seem
craggy on the exterior,

00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:11.710 align:middle line:90%
but they're very sensitive.

00:56:11.710 --> 00:56:13.330 align:middle line:84%
So then we come to
Aquarius rising.

00:56:13.330 --> 00:56:15.590 align:middle line:90%
Aquarius risings seem more cool.

00:56:15.590 --> 00:56:17.360 align:middle line:90%
They seem more futuristic.

00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:18.510 align:middle line:90%
They seem more distant.

00:56:18.510 --> 00:56:20.610 align:middle line:90%
They seem more crazy.

00:56:20.610 --> 00:56:24.221 align:middle line:84%
The eccentrics and the
geniuses, a lot of them

00:56:24.221 --> 00:56:26.470 align:middle line:84%
can be Aquarius rising, or
they're perceived that way.

00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:28.710 align:middle line:84%
They seem like they're in
the past or the future.

00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And the Pisces rising, Pisces
as the last sign controls--

00:56:34.740 --> 00:56:36.660 align:middle line:84%
contains something
of every sign.

00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:40.250 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones who are
seen as something's wrong,

00:56:40.250 --> 00:56:43.630 align:middle line:84%
but it's because they're
reading the energies.

00:56:43.630 --> 00:56:45.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're so sensitive.

00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:47.508 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: They're like--
when I do a psychic reading,

00:56:47.508 --> 00:56:48.270 align:middle line:90%
I look away.

00:56:48.270 --> 00:56:50.210 align:middle line:90%
I diffuse my consciousness.

00:56:50.210 --> 00:56:53.720 align:middle line:84%
It's the purpose of
the crystal ball.

00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:56.115 align:middle line:84%
It's not to see little
pictures like it's a TV,

00:56:56.115 --> 00:56:58.150 align:middle line:84%
it's to diffuse
your consciousness

00:56:58.150 --> 00:57:02.160 align:middle line:84%
so that you can see it on the
little TV inside your head.

00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:06.360 align:middle line:84%
So you have the Aquarius rising
who's the futuristic inventor,

00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:08.280 align:middle line:84%
wants to do mankind,
and wants to do

00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:08.880 align:middle line:90%
everything scientifically--

00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:09.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Visionary.

00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:10.138 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: -by the book.

00:57:10.138 --> 00:57:10.910 align:middle line:90%
The visionary.

00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:13.300 align:middle line:84%
And someone like
Zachariah, I know

00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:16.140 align:middle line:84%
he had Mercury in Leo, which is
why he's so proud of himself.

00:57:16.140 --> 00:57:18.620 align:middle line:84%
But he must have
had Aquarius, too.

00:57:18.620 --> 00:57:21.050 align:middle line:90%
But Pisces cares.

00:57:21.050 --> 00:57:25.010 align:middle line:84%
Aquarius cares, but they're
doing about the future

00:57:25.010 --> 00:57:27.640 align:middle line:84%
so they won't be around to
know what exactly happens.

00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:29.019 align:middle line:90%
But they--

00:57:29.019 --> 00:57:30.435 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But
Pisces really cares.

00:57:30.435 --> 00:57:30.780 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Pisces really cares.

00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:31.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Now.

00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:31.840 align:middle line:90%
They care now.

00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:32.320 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: The care really now.

00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:33.220 align:middle line:90%
They really feel it.

00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:35.785 align:middle line:84%
They feel your pain is the
classic example of Pisces.

00:57:35.785 --> 00:57:37.410 align:middle line:84%
So that brings us
through the 12 signs.

00:57:37.410 --> 00:57:41.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what if
you have an Aquarian sun

00:57:41.010 --> 00:57:42.777 align:middle line:90%
and then a Pisces rising?

00:57:42.777 --> 00:57:43.610 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: It's hard.

00:57:43.610 --> 00:57:45.984 align:middle line:84%
I tell you, when they're right
next to each other, that's

00:57:45.984 --> 00:57:46.780 align:middle line:90%
the hardest.

00:57:46.780 --> 00:57:50.770 align:middle line:84%
So you are being-- if you are
a Pisces rising and Aquarius

00:57:50.770 --> 00:57:52.650 align:middle line:90%
sun, wow, that is hard.

00:57:52.650 --> 00:57:55.189 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I would think it's
the total opposite projection.

00:57:55.189 --> 00:57:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: But
depending on if they're

00:57:56.730 --> 00:57:58.104 align:middle line:84%
at different houses
of astrology.

00:57:58.104 --> 00:58:01.490 align:middle line:84%
Astrology chart looks like
a pizza pie with 12 slices.

00:58:01.490 --> 00:58:04.725 align:middle line:84%
So the sign that's right above
the horizon of the slice,

00:58:04.725 --> 00:58:07.560 align:middle line:84%
that's right above the
horizon is the 12th House,

00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:10.590 align:middle line:84%
if your sun's there, you need--
you're even more sensitive.

00:58:10.590 --> 00:58:12.490 align:middle line:84%
Even if you're an
Aquarius because it's

00:58:12.490 --> 00:58:15.740 align:middle line:90%
that dawn time of day.

00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:17.140 align:middle line:10%
You would need to be alone.

00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:19.290 align:middle line:10%
You would do well with
large institutions

00:58:19.290 --> 00:58:21.140 align:middle line:10%
because in a large
institution in a way,

00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:24.560 align:middle line:10%
you merge with a large
institution, it's a merging.

00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:27.340 align:middle line:84%
Pisces is all about
merging the oneness.

00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:29.860 align:middle line:84%
Put your finger or
your toe in the ocean

00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:31.660 align:middle line:84%
and you connect
with all the oceans.

00:58:31.660 --> 00:58:32.480 align:middle line:90%
That's what psychics go through.

00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:33.063 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:58:33.063 --> 00:58:34.360 align:middle line:90%
I mean it makes total sense.

00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:39.470 align:middle line:84%
If you didn't know anything
else of a metaphysical nature

00:58:39.470 --> 00:58:43.020 align:middle line:84%
about your child, that if
you knew this one thing,

00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:45.940 align:middle line:84%
it could help you tremendously
in raising that person.

00:58:45.940 --> 00:58:47.620 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: It really
is, because you

00:58:47.620 --> 00:58:50.560 align:middle line:84%
meet people who say I
don't understand my child.

00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And then I can look at their
chart and in five minutes

00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:55.304 align:middle line:90%
they're going, really?

00:58:55.304 --> 00:58:57.720 align:middle line:84%
I don't know their child from
a hole-- I wouldn't know him

00:58:57.720 --> 00:58:58.761 align:middle line:90%
if he walked in the room.

00:58:58.761 --> 00:59:00.810 align:middle line:84%
But I know what the
problem is because you

00:59:00.810 --> 00:59:02.610 align:middle line:84%
can see it in the
astrology chart.

00:59:02.610 --> 00:59:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And to reconcile that
with the Anunnaki 12

00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:09.225 align:middle line:84%
is kind of impossible,
but it's fun.

00:59:09.225 --> 00:59:09.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:59:09.850 --> 00:59:10.850 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: So I'm
having a good time.

00:59:10.850 --> 00:59:12.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's hard
reconciling them,

00:59:12.130 --> 00:59:14.000 align:middle line:84%
but we come down to
practical tools and--

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:14.750 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Yeah.

00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:14.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is fun.

00:59:14.850 --> 00:59:16.183 align:middle line:90%
You've got practical tools here.

00:59:16.183 --> 00:59:17.352 align:middle line:90%
This is the Karma Card set.

00:59:17.352 --> 00:59:18.560 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Yes, my first book.

00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:19.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your
first book and you

00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:21.968 align:middle line:84%
said that you don't know how
you even wrote what you wrote.

00:59:21.968 --> 00:59:24.300 align:middle line:84%
It's a really good
kind of primer guide

00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:26.261 align:middle line:90%
to astrology you're saying?

00:59:26.261 --> 00:59:28.510 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: I've read a lot
of books on astrology since,

00:59:28.510 --> 00:59:31.840 align:middle line:84%
and mine I still think is
the clearest, easiest way

00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:33.570 align:middle line:90%
to understand astrology basics.

00:59:33.570 --> 00:59:36.165 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not just saying
it because-- because it's

00:59:36.165 --> 00:59:39.350 align:middle line:84%
my first book, I don't make
very much money on it at all.

00:59:39.350 --> 00:59:41.080 align:middle line:84%
I just want people
to learn astrology

00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:42.360 align:middle line:84%
because it's so
useful and powerful.

00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:43.360 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So an
easy way to learn

00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:45.151 align:middle line:10%
it and it has all these
little cards, which

00:59:45.151 --> 00:59:48.120 align:middle line:10%
you can use as divination tools
to go through if you have,

00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:50.220 align:middle line:10%
say, something you want
to know an outcome to,

00:59:50.220 --> 00:59:51.692 align:middle line:10%
or a way to handle something.

00:59:51.692 --> 00:59:53.150 align:middle line:10%
You go through and
use these cards,

00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:54.726 align:middle line:10%
which is-- that's very cool.

00:59:54.726 --> 00:59:56.100 align:middle line:84%
We only have about
a minute left.

00:59:56.100 --> 00:59:59.990 align:middle line:84%
Any final thoughts on astrology
you can share in 30 seconds?

00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:02.550 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Well, the
thing about astrology

01:00:02.550 --> 01:00:04.255 align:middle line:84%
is it teaches us how
similar we all are

01:00:04.255 --> 01:00:06.420 align:middle line:90%
and how different we all are.

01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:09.830 align:middle line:10%
And the key to remembering
about astrology

01:00:09.830 --> 01:00:13.490 align:middle line:10%
is not that you somehow have
to transcend your chart.

01:00:13.490 --> 01:00:15.360 align:middle line:10%
You just have to--
it says to you

01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:17.570 align:middle line:10%
this is who you are potentially.

01:00:17.570 --> 01:00:18.832 align:middle line:90%
Work it out.

01:00:18.832 --> 01:00:19.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

01:00:19.790 --> 01:00:21.850 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, it
seems like it would also

01:00:21.850 --> 01:00:23.259 align:middle line:90%
encourage compassion.

01:00:23.259 --> 01:00:24.050 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: For sure.

01:00:24.050 --> 01:00:25.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're hard-wired
in with some of these things.

01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:27.091 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Well, I have
moon in Pisces, so--

01:00:27.091 --> 01:00:28.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course.

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:31.710 align:middle line:84%
Monte and I have also discussed
astrology's impact on markets

01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:34.220 align:middle line:84%
and what that means
to each of us today.

01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:36.750 align:middle line:84%
Are the current market
tools becoming antiquated?

01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:39.490 align:middle line:84%
Do we have an entirely different
financial landscape ahead,

01:00:39.490 --> 01:00:40.244 align:middle line:90%
globally?

01:00:40.244 --> 01:00:42.160 align:middle line:84%
You can find out the
answer to these questions

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:44.310 align:middle line:84%
by taking a look at
our previous interview.

01:00:44.310 --> 01:00:47.840 align:middle line:84%
