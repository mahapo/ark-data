[ Music ]

00:00:20.287 --> 00:00:22.423 align:middle line:84%
One of the great debates
throughout history has been the

00:00:22.423 --> 00:00:25.059 align:middle line:84%
nature of the origin
of the human species.

00:00:25.059 --> 00:00:27.661 align:middle line:84%
In the west it's been a
very narrow debate siding

00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:29.830 align:middle line:84%
with either religion
or Darwinism.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.633 align:middle line:84%
If we look into ancient and
eastern cultures however,

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:34.802 align:middle line:84%
a much more complex
history arises.

00:00:34.802 --> 00:00:37.705 align:middle line:84%
One that acknowledges that
humanity has risen and fallen

00:00:37.705 --> 00:00:39.173 align:middle line:90%
on numerous occasions.

00:00:39.173 --> 00:00:42.309 align:middle line:84%
Each epoch bring its own
opportunity for learning.

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.678 align:middle line:84%
Raymond Tarpey has
studied them all and says

00:00:44.678 --> 00:00:46.680 align:middle line:84%
that life is the
art of discovery

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.582 align:middle line:90%
of who we are and what we are.

00:00:48.582 --> 00:00:50.818 align:middle line:84%
And it's so good to
sit with you again.

00:00:50.818 --> 00:00:54.321 align:middle line:84%
We were last together on
a sacred day; 11-11-11.

00:00:54.321 --> 00:00:55.823 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: That's correct.

00:00:55.823 --> 00:00:58.592 align:middle line:84%
And this was a gathering
of the crystal skulls

00:00:58.592 --> 00:01:01.228 align:middle line:84%
from around the world
and the Shamanic view

00:01:01.228 --> 00:01:02.596 align:middle line:90%
of what these times offer

00:01:02.596 --> 00:01:04.731 align:middle line:84%
and you were the scholar
amongst the group.

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:05.733 align:middle line:90%
I mean it was wonderful.

00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:06.367 align:middle line:90%
[Inaudible] was there...

00:01:06.367 --> 00:01:07.501 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yeah.

00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:09.303 align:middle line:84%
...with his beautiful
skull; beautiful man.

00:01:09.303 --> 00:01:11.338 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: He has
it in the blood.

00:01:11.338 --> 00:01:13.941 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Ray Tarpey: You can
just feel when [inaudible]

00:01:13.941 --> 00:01:16.911 align:middle line:84%
when I began to talk
at the first interview.

00:01:16.911 --> 00:01:20.881 align:middle line:84%
He looked at me and he
went -- and it was just...

00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:22.650 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Ray Tarpey:
...a million years

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.920 align:middle line:84%
of communication went
through in seconds.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.254 align:middle line:90%
Split second.

00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:31.091 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as though you
have been a scribe throughout

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:31.659 align:middle line:90%
the ages.

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:32.593 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:01:32.593 --> 00:01:33.928 align:middle line:84%
I mean that's how
I perceive you.

00:01:33.928 --> 00:01:35.462 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yeah.

00:01:35.462 --> 00:01:37.998 align:middle line:84%
You're -- whatever we start
talking about you can go

00:01:37.998 --> 00:01:40.768 align:middle line:84%
on a hundred different
streams of consciousness.

00:01:40.768 --> 00:01:42.169 align:middle line:90%
I mean you're -- and I know

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:44.638 align:middle line:84%
that you formally have educated
yourself to a very high degree.

00:01:44.638 --> 00:01:46.407 align:middle line:84%
But to me it's a
lot more than that.

00:01:46.407 --> 00:01:47.675 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: It's a -- yeah.

00:01:47.675 --> 00:01:49.143 align:middle line:84%
You're bringing forward
ancient knowledge as a scribe...

00:01:49.143 --> 00:01:49.843 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yeah.

00:01:49.843 --> 00:01:50.477 align:middle line:90%
...from ancient times.

00:01:50.477 --> 00:01:51.712 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yeah.

00:01:51.712 --> 00:01:54.581 align:middle line:84%
Much more profound than just
the studies you've done.

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:59.153 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: Yeah, it's the
habit of study and I found

00:01:59.153 --> 00:02:02.690 align:middle line:84%
that if one studies,
one can lead.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.428 align:middle line:84%
If one doesn't study, one has
to follow the ones who do.

00:02:07.428 --> 00:02:10.998 align:middle line:84%
And so it's important
not just that I do it,

00:02:10.998 --> 00:02:16.203 align:middle line:84%
that everybody begins to study
because then we have a citizenry

00:02:16.203 --> 00:02:20.541 align:middle line:84%
that will not follow
leaders into blind alleys.

00:02:20.541 --> 00:02:22.309 align:middle line:84%
Yes, which we're doing
in the masses right now.

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:23.711 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: Many times
[laughter], many times.

00:02:23.711 --> 00:02:25.646 align:middle line:84%
And we've done it
as civilizations...

00:02:25.646 --> 00:02:26.347 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:02:26.347 --> 00:02:26.914 align:middle line:90%
...over, and over again.

00:02:26.914 --> 00:02:27.748 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:02:27.748 --> 00:02:28.415 align:middle line:90%
We're going to talk about that.

00:02:28.415 --> 00:02:29.449 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:31.418 align:middle line:84%
This conversation is
about the origins.

00:02:31.418 --> 00:02:34.521 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have a second
conversation about the rise

00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:37.658 align:middle line:84%
and fall on numerous occasions
of the Alantean civilization.

00:02:37.658 --> 00:02:38.892 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:02:38.892 --> 00:02:40.194 align:middle line:84%
Which has to do with
where we are right now.

00:02:40.194 --> 00:02:41.028 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Correct.

00:02:41.028 --> 00:02:41.695 align:middle line:90%
Quite literally.

00:02:41.695 --> 00:02:42.896 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Correct.

00:02:42.896 --> 00:02:44.732 align:middle line:84%
But one thing you say to
start this conversation is

00:02:44.732 --> 00:02:48.068 align:middle line:84%
that you consider the
word and concept belief...

00:02:48.068 --> 00:02:48.636 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:02:48.636 --> 00:02:49.503 align:middle line:90%
...as a no-no.

00:02:49.503 --> 00:02:50.904 align:middle line:90%
Just let's dig into that.

00:02:50.904 --> 00:02:51.839 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:53.907 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: Well
in our culture --

00:02:53.907 --> 00:02:56.944 align:middle line:90%
our culture is largely Germanic.

00:02:56.944 --> 00:02:59.546 align:middle line:84%
I won't get into that,
I'm still doing research

00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:01.682 align:middle line:90%
on that right now.

00:03:01.682 --> 00:03:06.053 align:middle line:84%
But it's -- belief is a
German word and it consists

00:03:06.053 --> 00:03:08.522 align:middle line:90%
of to be -- and then leaden.

00:03:08.522 --> 00:03:12.660 align:middle line:84%
Leaden is the verb to
be in love or to prefer.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.862 align:middle line:84%
And we all know if
we are in love

00:03:14.862 --> 00:03:17.898 align:middle line:84%
with something we
have huge blind spots.

00:03:17.898 --> 00:03:23.971 align:middle line:84%
And so a person that has beliefs
is therefore not listening

00:03:23.971 --> 00:03:26.307 align:middle line:84%
equally to all the
other theories.

00:03:26.307 --> 00:03:28.375 align:middle line:90%
They've already decided.

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:31.211 align:middle line:84%
And in the face of the
intelligence that we are

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:34.848 align:middle line:84%
in the midst of we don't
have the right to do that.

00:03:34.848 --> 00:03:37.618 align:middle line:84%
We have to keep all
quadrants open

00:03:37.618 --> 00:03:41.955 align:middle line:84%
so that we can receive signals
from the intended sources

00:03:41.955 --> 00:03:46.427 align:middle line:84%
of this universe which is
a living, intelligent body

00:03:46.427 --> 00:03:50.163 align:middle line:84%
that we interface
with every second.

00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:51.565 align:middle line:90%
And when we look at --

00:03:51.565 --> 00:03:54.201 align:middle line:84%
I mean people can
already get a hint here

00:03:54.201 --> 00:03:57.538 align:middle line:84%
that you have taken yourself
into all these four corners.

00:03:57.538 --> 00:04:00.741 align:middle line:84%
And I mentioned this when
I was introducing you.

00:04:00.741 --> 00:04:04.445 align:middle line:84%
The narrow band of options that
we have utilized in the west

00:04:04.445 --> 00:04:09.450 align:middle line:84%
of either Judeo Christian
view or Darwinism;

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.518 align:middle line:90%
both have huge gaping holes.

00:04:11.518 --> 00:04:12.353 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:04:12.353 --> 00:04:12.920 align:middle line:90%
As you say blind -- there are...

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.154 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:04:14.154 --> 00:04:16.857 align:middle line:84%
...blind spots there and
yet, the belief runs so deep

00:04:16.857 --> 00:04:20.994 align:middle line:84%
that we somehow find a way
to rationalize either one...

00:04:20.994 --> 00:04:21.695 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:04:21.695 --> 00:04:23.130 align:middle line:90%
...as our total reality.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.198 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:04:24.198 --> 00:04:25.499 align:middle line:84%
That's the belief
you're talking about.

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:27.267 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: That's
the belief and it has

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:29.203 align:middle line:90%
to do with culture also.

00:04:29.203 --> 00:04:31.872 align:middle line:84%
We have the separate
cultures they're like species,

00:04:31.872 --> 00:04:33.774 align:middle line:90%
almost like plants are.

00:04:33.774 --> 00:04:37.044 align:middle line:90%
That's part of the design of it.

00:04:37.044 --> 00:04:41.615 align:middle line:84%
The -- I love the
Chinese/Japanese/Korean metaphor

00:04:41.615 --> 00:04:43.916 align:middle line:90%
of the frog in the well.

00:04:43.916 --> 00:04:48.689 align:middle line:84%
The frog sits at the bottom
of the well and looks up

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:52.092 align:middle line:84%
and sees the circle
-- the sky and thinks

00:04:52.092 --> 00:04:54.194 align:middle line:90%
that that's the whole sky.

00:04:54.194 --> 00:04:57.498 align:middle line:84%
And that to me is the
metaphor or a culture.

00:04:57.498 --> 00:04:59.666 align:middle line:90%
We must go beyond the cultures.

00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:02.770 align:middle line:84%
For myself when I
discovered China and I learned

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.139 align:middle line:84%
to speak Chinese,
and then Japanese,

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:08.275 align:middle line:84%
and then Irish my own
people's language...

00:05:08.275 --> 00:05:11.779 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Ray Tarpey: ...many other
words and dimensions open up.

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:13.247 align:middle line:90%
Because if you're studying only

00:05:13.247 --> 00:05:15.716 align:middle line:84%
in one language it's
been heavily interpreted

00:05:15.716 --> 00:05:16.450 align:middle line:90%
and reinterpreted...

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:17.084 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:05:17.084 --> 00:05:18.385 align:middle line:90%
...in the process.

00:05:18.385 --> 00:05:20.421 align:middle line:84%
So you -- give us an idea of
the breadth of your study.

00:05:20.421 --> 00:05:21.522 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:05:21.522 --> 00:05:23.223 align:middle line:84%
You just mentioned it
but it also extends

00:05:23.223 --> 00:05:24.658 align:middle line:90%
into Mayan civilizations...

00:05:24.658 --> 00:05:25.225 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:05:25.225 --> 00:05:27.194 align:middle line:90%
...into Tibet.

00:05:27.194 --> 00:05:30.030 align:middle line:84%
A little bit more on the
breadth of the knowledge...

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.131 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:05:31.131 --> 00:05:32.833 align:middle line:84%
...that you have gained
from your research.

00:05:32.833 --> 00:05:34.234 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Right.

00:05:34.234 --> 00:05:36.503 align:middle line:84%
Most of my life I've spent --
in my college years I studied

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:40.274 align:middle line:84%
of course Western civilization
and a little bit of African,

00:05:40.274 --> 00:05:43.610 align:middle line:84%
but they were mostly
concentrated on themselves

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.814 align:middle line:84%
in this culture Western
civilization in the standard.

00:05:46.814 --> 00:05:50.250 align:middle line:84%
So of course I go
for the vacuum.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.519 align:middle line:90%
My mind is like that.

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:56.457 align:middle line:84%
And so I wound up
going to Asia --

00:05:56.457 --> 00:05:59.226 align:middle line:84%
to China, because
I was in the Army

00:05:59.226 --> 00:06:02.062 align:middle line:84%
and I studied Vietnamese
during the war.

00:06:02.062 --> 00:06:05.098 align:middle line:84%
And then I found out that
I could just learn it.

00:06:05.098 --> 00:06:08.769 align:middle line:84%
I'm born in the year of the
monkey so it's easier for us.

00:06:08.769 --> 00:06:10.838 align:middle line:90%
We're good at imitating people.

00:06:10.838 --> 00:06:14.308 align:middle line:84%
And so I could just --
people would just look at me

00:06:14.308 --> 00:06:16.410 align:middle line:90%
because I could say the words.

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:19.646 align:middle line:84%
It's -- I think I have many
past lives in many cultures

00:06:19.646 --> 00:06:23.050 align:middle line:84%
and so I wound up going to
Taiwan; we were not allowed

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.853 align:middle line:84%
to go to China proper,
at that time,

00:06:25.853 --> 00:06:28.856 align:middle line:84%
but the real China
exists in Taiwan.

00:06:28.856 --> 00:06:33.060 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps, even more than
the continental China

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.363 align:middle line:84%
at these present --
at this present time.

00:06:36.363 --> 00:06:40.767 align:middle line:84%
And what I discovered
was in the language --

00:06:40.767 --> 00:06:44.805 align:middle line:84%
language is the main carrier
of the culture and when I went

00:06:44.805 --> 00:06:47.307 align:middle line:90%
into that language I found

00:06:47.307 --> 00:06:50.777 align:middle line:84%
that their references
were completely different.

00:06:50.777 --> 00:06:53.881 align:middle line:84%
The thing that comes to
mind that I learned was

00:06:53.881 --> 00:06:59.052 align:middle line:84%
in the West they say that the
whole is the sum of its parts.

00:06:59.052 --> 00:07:01.755 align:middle line:84%
In China subconsciously
I realized

00:07:01.755 --> 00:07:04.091 align:middle line:90%
that the part is the whole.

00:07:04.091 --> 00:07:05.158 align:middle line:90%
That's their saying.

00:07:05.158 --> 00:07:06.827 align:middle line:84%
Oh. Ray Tarpey: That's
why the bottom

00:07:06.827 --> 00:07:09.263 align:middle line:90%
of the foot is the whole body.

00:07:09.263 --> 00:07:12.099 align:middle line:84%
When you study one
thing you do study all.

00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:15.969 align:middle line:84%
If you're listening to
nature at the same time.

00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:18.105 align:middle line:90%
So culture needn't be --

00:07:18.105 --> 00:07:20.107 align:middle line:84%
a single culture
needn't be a block.

00:07:20.107 --> 00:07:24.111 align:middle line:84%
Some people can find it
in their own backyard.

00:07:24.111 --> 00:07:25.679 align:middle line:90%
Anyway getting back to --

00:07:25.679 --> 00:07:28.482 align:middle line:84%
it went from China and then
when I needed the history

00:07:28.482 --> 00:07:32.753 align:middle line:84%
of Moldamoria I had to
go to Japan because many

00:07:32.753 --> 00:07:35.088 align:middle line:90%
of China's records were burned

00:07:35.088 --> 00:07:39.126 align:middle line:84%
by the first emperor Qin
Shi Huang in around two --

00:07:39.126 --> 00:07:42.796 align:middle line:90%
the 200's, 300's B.C.E.,

00:07:42.796 --> 00:07:48.135 align:middle line:84%
and so their creation story does
not have the same compactness

00:07:48.135 --> 00:07:54.841 align:middle line:84%
and summary narration that the
Japanese [foreign word] does.

00:07:54.841 --> 00:08:00.147 align:middle line:84%
And so -- and also in order to
find out about China I majored

00:08:00.147 --> 00:08:02.549 align:middle line:90%
in Tong Dynastic History;

00:08:02.549 --> 00:08:07.487 align:middle line:84%
the Japanese know a lot more
sometimes than the Chinese do

00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:09.723 align:middle line:84%
because their records
were destroyed.

00:08:09.723 --> 00:08:12.693 align:middle line:84%
But the Chinese -- the Japanese
were students and so I had

00:08:12.693 --> 00:08:14.027 align:middle line:90%
to know Japanese also.

00:08:14.027 --> 00:08:14.828 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:08:14.828 --> 00:08:16.029 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: And so it began.

00:08:16.029 --> 00:08:17.731 align:middle line:84%
And so it began [laughter]
and it goes on and on.

00:08:17.731 --> 00:08:21.001 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: Into ancient Mayan
and ancient Nahunta the language

00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:25.906 align:middle line:84%
of Mexico and then to ancient
Celtic the Irish language.

00:08:25.906 --> 00:08:28.141 align:middle line:90%
I study German, I study French.

00:08:28.141 --> 00:08:31.777 align:middle line:84%
To try to get as many
languages in as possible,

00:08:31.777 --> 00:08:35.449 align:middle line:90%
to get more of the nuances

00:08:35.449 --> 00:08:38.952 align:middle line:84%
of the interpretation
of the intelligence.

00:08:38.952 --> 00:08:43.457 align:middle line:84%
And among your studies you're
considered a Casey Scholar.

00:08:43.457 --> 00:08:45.692 align:middle line:84%
You have a good amount
of -- you have what?

00:08:45.692 --> 00:08:47.094 align:middle line:90%
15, 16 years of Casey...

00:08:47.094 --> 00:08:48.161 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:08:48.161 --> 00:08:49.263 align:middle line:84%
...studies under your
belt at this time

00:08:49.263 --> 00:08:51.431 align:middle line:84%
and you've embraced
them as fully

00:08:51.431 --> 00:08:53.000 align:middle line:84%
as you have all of
the other studies.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.134 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: I love
Edgar Casey...

00:08:54.134 --> 00:08:54.968 align:middle line:84%
I do too. Ray Tarpey:
...and I love the whole

00:08:54.968 --> 00:08:56.236 align:middle line:90%
tradition [laughter].

00:08:56.236 --> 00:09:01.074 align:middle line:84%
I do too. And so in this
conversation why don't we begin

00:09:01.074 --> 00:09:02.209 align:middle line:90%
with Edgar Casey...

00:09:02.209 --> 00:09:03.143 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Okay.

00:09:03.143 --> 00:09:04.978 align:middle line:84%
...and what flowed
through him --

00:09:04.978 --> 00:09:07.648 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't his information it
was what flowed through him --

00:09:07.648 --> 00:09:09.816 align:middle line:84%
regarding the origin
of the species

00:09:09.816 --> 00:09:11.018 align:middle line:90%
and then we can migrate out...

00:09:11.018 --> 00:09:12.386 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Okay.

00:09:12.386 --> 00:09:14.955 align:middle line:84%
...to the Mayan, the Japanese
and the other reflections...

00:09:14.955 --> 00:09:15.922 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: Sounds
like a great idea.

00:09:15.922 --> 00:09:16.923 align:middle line:84%
Yeah and I'm really
interested in...

00:09:16.923 --> 00:09:18.025 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Okay.

00:09:18.025 --> 00:09:19.026 align:middle line:84%
...where connecting
points start popping up.

00:09:19.026 --> 00:09:19.860 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Okay.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.029 align:middle line:90%
But Edgar Casey -- let's begin

00:09:22.029 --> 00:09:24.564 align:middle line:84%
with his version,
his works version.

00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:25.132 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:09:25.132 --> 00:09:26.166 align:middle line:90%
The compilation.

00:09:26.166 --> 00:09:27.367 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: Okay,
that's a tall order.

00:09:27.367 --> 00:09:28.435 align:middle line:90%
It is but you know...

00:09:28.435 --> 00:09:29.303 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: Let's
begin, let's just begin.

00:09:29.303 --> 00:09:29.870 align:middle line:90%
...let's just go for it.

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:31.271 align:middle line:90%
We have time.

00:09:31.271 --> 00:09:36.410 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: Edgar Casey was a
healer and then in 1923 a person

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:39.146 align:middle line:84%
by the name of Arthur
Lamers from Dayton,

00:09:39.146 --> 00:09:46.219 align:middle line:84%
Ohio began asking him
questions about past lives.

00:09:46.219 --> 00:09:50.123 align:middle line:84%
And Edgar Casey himself did
not believe in reincarnation.

00:09:50.123 --> 00:09:55.562 align:middle line:84%
He was a strict Christian
and he did not know what came

00:09:55.562 --> 00:09:58.498 align:middle line:84%
out of him during
these hypnotic trances.

00:09:58.498 --> 00:10:02.202 align:middle line:84%
And so he had a major fight with
himself and he had to go back

00:10:02.202 --> 00:10:07.274 align:middle line:84%
to the Bible and read it many,
many times to get ballast in him

00:10:07.274 --> 00:10:09.576 align:middle line:84%
so he could trust
what he was saying.

00:10:09.576 --> 00:10:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And eventually he came to
realize that this is the truth.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.016 align:middle line:90%
And so he had those Dayton years

00:10:16.016 --> 00:10:19.486 align:middle line:84%
where he began those
past life readings

00:10:19.486 --> 00:10:23.457 align:middle line:84%
and so many people besides
healing they came to him

00:10:23.457 --> 00:10:26.293 align:middle line:84%
for other problems
that they were having

00:10:26.293 --> 00:10:27.961 align:middle line:90%
and knowledge about themselves.

00:10:27.961 --> 00:10:30.097 align:middle line:84%
Why they were involved
in this work

00:10:30.097 --> 00:10:32.165 align:middle line:84%
and why they couldn't do
this, or why they couldn't --

00:10:32.165 --> 00:10:36.236 align:middle line:84%
they had allergies to this
which no medical reason.

00:10:36.236 --> 00:10:40.507 align:middle line:84%
And so the element of
past lives came through.

00:10:40.507 --> 00:10:45.712 align:middle line:84%
And out of those many readings
came a coherent story much a

00:10:45.712 --> 00:10:50.117 align:middle line:84%
surprise to everybody around
Casey and to Casey himself.

00:10:50.117 --> 00:10:57.257 align:middle line:84%
And he did a series of readings
called the 364 Group of Readings

00:10:57.257 --> 00:10:59.760 align:middle line:90%
which concerned Atlantis.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:05.165 align:middle line:84%
And out of that direct -- those
direct readings by people asking

00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:10.737 align:middle line:84%
about Atlantis and the single
individual client readings we

00:11:10.737 --> 00:11:13.940 align:middle line:84%
get sort of a story
and it begins

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:17.344 align:middle line:84%
with [wind blowing] a
creator, an intelligent force,

00:11:17.344 --> 00:11:24.251 align:middle line:84%
and the force seems
to want companionship.

00:11:24.251 --> 00:11:26.987 align:middle line:84%
We're just using
these minds to --

00:11:26.987 --> 00:11:28.755 align:middle line:90%
and our own intelligence

00:11:28.755 --> 00:11:32.492 align:middle line:84%
to consider what it
might possibly be.

00:11:32.492 --> 00:11:35.162 align:middle line:84%
And so what came out of the
Casey readings is their --

00:11:35.162 --> 00:11:38.999 align:middle line:84%
the creator wants a
companionship, wants a sharing

00:11:38.999 --> 00:11:41.802 align:middle line:90%
to go on with parts of itself.

00:11:41.802 --> 00:11:45.839 align:middle line:90%
And so beings are created.

00:11:45.839 --> 00:11:48.375 align:middle line:84%
Beings that are the
same as itself.

00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:52.746 align:middle line:84%
And a universe is created
for them to learn and evolve

00:11:52.746 --> 00:11:56.483 align:middle line:90%
so that they will have a --

00:11:56.483 --> 00:12:01.154 align:middle line:84%
the same level of love
for the created things

00:12:01.154 --> 00:12:03.590 align:middle line:90%
as the creator has.

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:07.360 align:middle line:84%
And so the story with
Edgar Casey begins at one

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:11.898 align:middle line:84%
of these levels about 10
million years ago when beings,

00:12:11.898 --> 00:12:15.802 align:middle line:84%
ethereal beings, spirit
beings began to descend

00:12:15.802 --> 00:12:18.805 align:middle line:90%
into the earthen realm.

00:12:18.805 --> 00:12:22.742 align:middle line:84%
And they came -- he talks
first about New Mexico

00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:24.477 align:middle line:90%
in the area of the four corners.

00:12:24.477 --> 00:12:28.748 align:middle line:84%
And he said the signs of these
beings can still be seen there.

00:12:28.748 --> 00:12:30.784 align:middle line:84%
And I get chills as I
speak to it because...

00:12:30.784 --> 00:12:33.019 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Ray Tarpey: ...I've
been there to Chaco Canyon,

00:12:33.019 --> 00:12:38.158 align:middle line:84%
and to Casa Grande, and Pueblo
Grande and the signs are there.

00:12:38.158 --> 00:12:38.859 align:middle line:90%
What are the signs?

00:12:38.859 --> 00:12:40.193 align:middle line:90%
How do recognize them?

00:12:40.193 --> 00:12:42.596 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: One of the major
signs is the letter T. Okay.

00:12:42.596 --> 00:12:47.567 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: It's -- in the Mayan
it's the sign of [foreign word],

00:12:47.567 --> 00:12:50.537 align:middle line:84%
the human teacher, the
great human teacher.

00:12:50.537 --> 00:12:57.143 align:middle line:84%
He is the American equivalent
of Casey's Ra-Ta or Ra-Ta;

00:12:57.143 --> 00:12:59.746 align:middle line:84%
the one who was the
major priest of Egypt

00:12:59.746 --> 00:13:03.083 align:middle line:90%
who came from Persia later on.

00:13:03.083 --> 00:13:08.955 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, to continue with
the story; these beings began

00:13:08.955 --> 00:13:11.925 align:middle line:90%
to become enwrapped incarnately

00:13:11.925 --> 00:13:13.994 align:middle line:84%
because this is a
different realm

00:13:13.994 --> 00:13:17.264 align:middle line:84%
and they were experimenting and
they're allowed to experiment

00:13:17.264 --> 00:13:19.900 align:middle line:90%
because they're given free will.

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:23.570 align:middle line:84%
And free will is a grant,
it's a gift and the gift

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:25.805 align:middle line:90%
of free will is complete.

00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:31.177 align:middle line:84%
When free will is given then of
necessity my researchers tell me

00:13:31.177 --> 00:13:36.983 align:middle line:84%
that then the creator does not
fully know what you will do.

00:13:36.983 --> 00:13:38.385 align:middle line:90%
And that's really key isn't it?

00:13:38.385 --> 00:13:39.452 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:13:39.452 --> 00:13:41.688 align:middle line:84%
Instead of trying to
control outcomes...

00:13:41.688 --> 00:13:42.856 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Right.

00:13:42.856 --> 00:13:43.990 align:middle line:84%
...that the creation
allows for more creation.

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:46.760 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: Right and so
depending on what we do

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:50.964 align:middle line:84%
and what we did the universe
was expanded in all sort

00:13:50.964 --> 00:13:55.335 align:middle line:84%
of myriad ways, so
to give us the stage

00:13:55.335 --> 00:13:57.737 align:middle line:90%
to play out what we want.

00:13:57.737 --> 00:14:00.407 align:middle line:84%
It is endless, it is
a universe of words.

00:14:00.407 --> 00:14:04.544 align:middle line:84%
It is -- what Casey talks
about is a habitation

00:14:04.544 --> 00:14:08.248 align:middle line:84%
of all the realms
now invisible to us.

00:14:08.248 --> 00:14:10.717 align:middle line:90%
We think they are uninhabited.

00:14:10.717 --> 00:14:14.454 align:middle line:84%
He talked about the solar
systems specifically,

00:14:14.454 --> 00:14:19.893 align:middle line:84%
and he comes through with a new
version of astrology where Mars

00:14:19.893 --> 00:14:23.697 align:middle line:84%
in inhabited right now
by billions of souls.

00:14:23.697 --> 00:14:28.168 align:middle line:84%
So are Venus, all the planets;
all of them are inhabited,

00:14:28.168 --> 00:14:32.172 align:middle line:84%
but they are in the realm of
dark matter and dark energy

00:14:32.172 --> 00:14:36.209 align:middle line:84%
which our quantum physicists
are finally learning about

00:14:36.209 --> 00:14:39.546 align:middle line:84%
and realizing that their
starting to sound like a bunch

00:14:39.546 --> 00:14:42.549 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual philosophers
now talking,

00:14:42.549 --> 00:14:45.719 align:middle line:84%
trying to explain
the standard model.

00:14:45.719 --> 00:14:49.255 align:middle line:84%
Their standard model which
grew from their attempt

00:14:49.255 --> 00:14:52.692 align:middle line:84%
to understand everything
that's going on here,

00:14:52.692 --> 00:14:54.594 align:middle line:90%
and now it's going into realms

00:14:54.594 --> 00:14:57.630 align:middle line:84%
that they never predicted
would happen.

00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:59.466 align:middle line:84%
Let me ask you a
question at point then.

00:14:59.466 --> 00:15:02.635 align:middle line:84%
If these beings, these
thousands and thousands

00:15:02.635 --> 00:15:06.973 align:middle line:84%
of souls are living on Mars and
Venus is there a migration back

00:15:06.973 --> 00:15:08.608 align:middle line:84%
and forth between
Earth for them?

00:15:08.608 --> 00:15:10.043 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Lifetimes.

00:15:10.043 --> 00:15:11.878 align:middle line:84%
And they can -- lifetimes
of inhabiting Earth...

00:15:11.878 --> 00:15:14.347 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: So he
said your astrology is

00:15:14.347 --> 00:15:17.183 align:middle line:90%
from a recent sojourn in Mars.

00:15:17.183 --> 00:15:20.420 align:middle line:84%
Oh. Ray Tarpey: Or a
recent sojourn in Venus.

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:23.857 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what the nature
of that life is but it seems

00:15:23.857 --> 00:15:29.195 align:middle line:84%
to be a vibration and a
whole other realm of being

00:15:29.195 --> 00:15:30.663 align:middle line:90%
that we don't know about.

00:15:30.663 --> 00:15:36.369 align:middle line:84%
Because as the quantum
physicists now say most

00:15:36.369 --> 00:15:43.443 align:middle line:84%
of the matter and the energy of
the universe is unseen by us,

00:15:43.443 --> 00:15:47.414 align:middle line:84%
our senses, or the instruments
that we've created to sense.

00:15:47.414 --> 00:15:50.517 align:middle line:84%
Right, so that means they have
to be existing within for lack

00:15:50.517 --> 00:15:52.285 align:middle line:84%
of a better term other
dimensional fields.

00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:53.486 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Correct.

00:15:53.486 --> 00:15:55.722 align:middle line:84%
And they're beginning to
see the tip of the iceberg

00:15:55.722 --> 00:15:57.757 align:middle line:90%
with the Hicks-Boson Particle.

00:15:57.757 --> 00:16:00.593 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Ray Tarpey: That's
just coming through the LHC,

00:16:00.593 --> 00:16:03.830 align:middle line:84%
the Large Hadron
Collider in Switzerland.

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:07.834 align:middle line:84%
That's that 17 mile
particle collider there

00:16:07.834 --> 00:16:10.703 align:middle line:84%
that they're not getting
ready for further testing

00:16:10.703 --> 00:16:16.109 align:middle line:84%
because they've just seen one
small particle; the Hicks-Boson.

00:16:16.109 --> 00:16:21.848 align:middle line:84%
And these particles are a field
like gravity is particles.

00:16:21.848 --> 00:16:25.118 align:middle line:84%
It's hard for us to
contemplate gravity

00:16:25.118 --> 00:16:31.357 align:middle line:84%
as particles giving orders for
things to operate in its realm

00:16:31.357 --> 00:16:34.561 align:middle line:84%
and that's why they call
the Hicks-Boson Particle the

00:16:34.561 --> 00:16:35.929 align:middle line:90%
God Particle.

00:16:35.929 --> 00:16:39.065 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Ray Tarpey: Because it
comes in and changes the speed

00:16:39.065 --> 00:16:43.903 align:middle line:84%
of electrons and gives
orders to change masses.

00:16:43.903 --> 00:16:47.773 align:middle line:84%
So something from the
other dimensions comes in

00:16:47.773 --> 00:16:53.379 align:middle line:84%
and tells these dimensional
objects and forces what to do.

00:16:53.379 --> 00:16:55.281 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I mean it is mind boggling.

00:16:55.281 --> 00:16:57.550 align:middle line:84%
I remember one of the most
delicate statements I heard --

00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:58.818 align:middle line:84%
I was interviewing
Patrick Flannigan...

00:16:58.818 --> 00:16:59.953 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yeah.

00:16:59.953 --> 00:17:01.688 align:middle line:84%
...and I said, "Patrick,
what is electricity?"

00:17:01.688 --> 00:17:03.356 align:middle line:90%
Because it's a common question.

00:17:03.356 --> 00:17:06.126 align:middle line:84%
Most people very -- that are
very ensconced in that field

00:17:06.126 --> 00:17:09.863 align:middle line:84%
so on what electricity is
and he said quite simply,

00:17:09.863 --> 00:17:13.198 align:middle line:84%
"Well it's the flow of electrons
from a higher potential

00:17:13.198 --> 00:17:14.300 align:middle line:90%
to a lower potential."

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:15.368 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Right.

00:17:15.368 --> 00:17:16.002 align:middle line:84%
In other words from
a high dimension...

00:17:16.002 --> 00:17:17.370 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yeah.

00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:19.339 align:middle line:84%
...into this dimension to be
organized for whatever purpose.

00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:20.506 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: Yeah,
the more dense...

00:17:20.506 --> 00:17:21.441 align:middle line:90%
Yes, more dense.

00:17:21.441 --> 00:17:22.841 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: ...and
the less dense.

00:17:22.841 --> 00:17:25.645 align:middle line:84%
Yes. And so these beings coming
from Mars and coming from Venus

00:17:25.645 --> 00:17:28.181 align:middle line:84%
and many other places; I
assume he was saying there,

00:17:28.181 --> 00:17:31.818 align:middle line:84%
that quite a number of humans
inhabiting bodies now have had

00:17:31.818 --> 00:17:32.385 align:middle line:90%
this experience...

00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:33.520 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:34.287 align:middle line:84%
...about migrating from
these other planets...

00:17:34.287 --> 00:17:35.054 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes, multiple.

00:17:35.054 --> 00:17:35.922 align:middle line:90%
...in our astrological...

00:17:35.922 --> 00:17:37.023 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Multiple.

00:17:37.023 --> 00:17:38.992 align:middle line:90%
And their astrology,

00:17:38.992 --> 00:17:43.329 align:middle line:84%
their predominant astrology is
probably a more recent sojourn

00:17:43.329 --> 00:17:45.799 align:middle line:84%
but there are background
sojourns

00:17:45.799 --> 00:17:47.534 align:middle line:90%
that come into play also.

00:17:47.534 --> 00:17:49.135 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Ray Tarpey:
It's very complex.

00:17:49.135 --> 00:17:52.438 align:middle line:84%
It's not as though there
was just a single creation

00:17:52.438 --> 00:17:53.640 align:middle line:90%
and Earth is it.

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:56.576 align:middle line:84%
Those very beings may have
as you said, had far --

00:17:56.576 --> 00:17:58.578 align:middle line:84%
had sojourns far out
into other fields.

00:17:58.578 --> 00:17:59.646 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Correct.

00:17:59.646 --> 00:18:00.980 align:middle line:84%
Even maybe other
third-dimensional places.

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:02.315 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Right.

00:18:02.315 --> 00:18:05.185 align:middle line:84%
Prior to this grand what 10
million year old experience.

00:18:05.185 --> 00:18:07.020 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to bring
that up because in one

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:11.157 align:middle line:84%
of Casey's books he was
talking about the Italian man,

00:18:11.157 --> 00:18:12.625 align:middle line:90%
the Italian man which is --

00:18:12.625 --> 00:18:15.028 align:middle line:84%
I think it's in Basil,
Switzerland.

00:18:15.028 --> 00:18:18.298 align:middle line:84%
That skeleton which was found
600 feet under the earth

00:18:18.298 --> 00:18:22.101 align:middle line:84%
in Italy was estimated to be
about 10 million years old.

00:18:22.101 --> 00:18:24.571 align:middle line:84%
So I bring it up because
it's some physical evidence

00:18:24.571 --> 00:18:27.373 align:middle line:84%
apparently that over
lays this Casey timeline.

00:18:27.373 --> 00:18:28.675 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yeah.

00:18:28.675 --> 00:18:30.376 align:middle line:84%
But the Casey timeline of
10 million years [inaudible]

00:18:30.376 --> 00:18:32.846 align:middle line:84%
with the digs that
we have in Africa...

00:18:32.846 --> 00:18:36.883 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Ray Tarpey: ...in the
Ethiopian area, where Brings,

00:18:36.883 --> 00:18:40.220 align:middle line:84%
Lucy and all those now they're
discovering more and more

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:43.489 align:middle line:84%
and it's bringing back to
about 10 million years.

00:18:43.489 --> 00:18:49.529 align:middle line:84%
So Casey's figure of 10
million years based on what --

00:18:49.529 --> 00:18:53.066 align:middle line:84%
the dates on the present
surface of the earth.

00:18:53.066 --> 00:18:58.504 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that began
to get me to read Edgar Casey

00:18:58.504 --> 00:19:02.742 align:middle line:84%
and go beyond mainstream
history, and archaeology,

00:19:02.742 --> 00:19:05.778 align:middle line:84%
is that the consideration
that 75%

00:19:05.778 --> 00:19:07.880 align:middle line:90%
of the earth's surface is water.

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And we presently do
not have the technology

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:13.019 align:middle line:90%
to excavate underwater.

00:19:13.019 --> 00:19:20.260 align:middle line:84%
So basically our history, our
archaeology is limited to 25%

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.862 align:middle line:84%
of the earth's surface
which we know has changed.

00:19:22.862 --> 00:19:24.797 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Ray Tarpey: And
even less than that

00:19:24.797 --> 00:19:29.035 align:middle line:84%
because the resources are
limited for the excavation.

00:19:29.035 --> 00:19:31.337 align:middle line:90%
So it's all going to change.

00:19:31.337 --> 00:19:34.140 align:middle line:84%
I tell people hold
on to your hats.

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:38.211 align:middle line:84%
Don't believe in stuff because
once we get the technology we're

00:19:38.211 --> 00:19:42.482 align:middle line:84%
going to find whole other
dimensions and areas of history

00:19:42.482 --> 00:19:46.352 align:middle line:84%
and lost continents; not
just Atlantis and Moldomoria,

00:19:46.352 --> 00:19:50.156 align:middle line:84%
but the hyperborean that they
talked about in the north.

00:19:50.156 --> 00:19:53.393 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Ray Tarpey: That
the Diasophical Society

00:19:53.393 --> 00:19:57.096 align:middle line:84%
and Blavatsky talked
about in the 1800's.

00:19:57.096 --> 00:19:58.665 align:middle line:90%
The late 1800's.

00:19:58.665 --> 00:20:03.670 align:middle line:84%
Okay, so we have these souls
taking material form for play...

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:04.637 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Playing.

00:20:04.637 --> 00:20:05.872 align:middle line:90%
...for experimentation...

00:20:05.872 --> 00:20:06.939 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Experimentation.

00:20:06.939 --> 00:20:07.674 align:middle line:90%
...and adventure.

00:20:07.674 --> 00:20:08.875 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yeah.

00:20:08.875 --> 00:20:12.145 align:middle line:84%
And you're placing this is
the four corners region.

00:20:12.145 --> 00:20:14.881 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's expand out
and go to [inaudible]...

00:20:14.881 --> 00:20:15.515 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:20:15.515 --> 00:20:16.082 align:middle line:90%
...and then Muria.

00:20:16.082 --> 00:20:17.350 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:19.118 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people think that
those are interchangeable.

00:20:19.118 --> 00:20:20.086 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:20:20.086 --> 00:20:21.220 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
the differentiation

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:22.889 align:middle line:84%
between the two,
the locations of...

00:20:22.889 --> 00:20:24.157 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Okay.

00:20:24.157 --> 00:20:25.858 align:middle line:84%
...and then that takes us
into the Japanese account.

00:20:25.858 --> 00:20:27.727 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: All right.

00:20:27.727 --> 00:20:32.198 align:middle line:84%
Mu Lemuria -- Edgar Casey used
the terms interchangeably.

00:20:32.198 --> 00:20:34.334 align:middle line:90%
Most the time he says Mu Lemuria

00:20:34.334 --> 00:20:37.136 align:middle line:84%
but he does sometimes
just say Lemuria

00:20:37.136 --> 00:20:38.504 align:middle line:90%
and sometimes he just says Mu.

00:20:38.504 --> 00:20:40.073 align:middle line:90%
What's the distinction?

00:20:40.073 --> 00:20:46.612 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: Lemuria came into
providence, the providences

00:20:46.612 --> 00:20:51.551 align:middle line:84%
in the -- I believe in the
early -- in the late 1800's,

00:20:51.551 --> 00:20:57.790 align:middle line:84%
1900's when they were trying to
find out why or how the Lemurs

00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:02.028 align:middle line:90%
of Madagascar came from India.

00:21:02.028 --> 00:21:05.131 align:middle line:84%
There must have been another
continent between India

00:21:05.131 --> 00:21:07.600 align:middle line:84%
and Madagascar and
so in the name

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:10.169 align:middle line:84%
of the Lemur the
called it Lemuria.

00:21:10.169 --> 00:21:13.072 align:middle line:84%
And the word Lemur has
other ramifications

00:21:13.072 --> 00:21:17.010 align:middle line:84%
because the Romans had
the Feast of Lemuras,

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:20.446 align:middle line:84%
which is their ghost
festival, their Halloween.

00:21:20.446 --> 00:21:24.684 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of the
intelligence interfering in here

00:21:24.684 --> 00:21:28.087 align:middle line:84%
because there's a lot of
interference and plugs coming

00:21:28.087 --> 00:21:30.857 align:middle line:90%
in to help us along the way.

00:21:30.857 --> 00:21:33.092 align:middle line:90%
So it's not just random.

00:21:33.092 --> 00:21:37.697 align:middle line:84%
There are certain souls with
missions to plug in information

00:21:37.697 --> 00:21:41.033 align:middle line:84%
to help alone, to
understand our history.

00:21:41.033 --> 00:21:44.670 align:middle line:84%
So what was according to
the ancient legends --

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:46.839 align:middle line:90%
what was the nature of Mu?

00:21:46.839 --> 00:21:48.074 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:21:48.074 --> 00:21:49.308 align:middle line:84%
I know we talked off camera
and that you were saying

00:21:49.308 --> 00:21:52.678 align:middle line:84%
that was a spiritually
clean environment.

00:21:52.678 --> 00:21:53.312 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes it was...

00:21:53.312 --> 00:21:54.013 align:middle line:90%
For those souls.

00:21:54.013 --> 00:21:55.214 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: ...according

00:21:55.214 --> 00:21:58.351 align:middle line:84%
to Edgar Casey [inaudible]
Lemuria was the place

00:21:58.351 --> 00:22:00.086 align:middle line:90%
of all the civilizations

00:22:00.086 --> 00:22:03.790 align:middle line:84%
that have been established
upon the surface of the earth.

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:06.859 align:middle line:84%
It was in Mu Lemuria that
they reached their highest

00:22:06.859 --> 00:22:08.828 align:middle line:90%
spirit level.

00:22:08.828 --> 00:22:13.266 align:middle line:84%
And Meditron, a person that
channels ancient history too.

00:22:13.266 --> 00:22:17.170 align:middle line:84%
I read all of the Meditron
stuff to everybody.

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:21.140 align:middle line:84%
Leave -- I leave nothing
out because we do not know

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:25.578 align:middle line:84%
which soul is appointed
with certain information.

00:22:25.578 --> 00:22:27.680 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're off
base in some...

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:30.416 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Ray Tarpey: ...but some
of the details will be true.

00:22:30.416 --> 00:22:32.485 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Ray Tarpey: And
so I read everything.

00:22:32.485 --> 00:22:34.887 align:middle line:84%
So what does Meditron
say about Mu Lemuria.

00:22:34.887 --> 00:22:39.659 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: And Meditron says
that they were mostly ethereal

00:22:39.659 --> 00:22:45.531 align:middle line:84%
in the early times of Mu Lemuria
so therefore, they could have

00:22:45.531 --> 00:22:47.099 align:middle line:90%
that more spiritual...

00:22:47.099 --> 00:22:49.168 align:middle line:84%
Ethereal as in -- I
saw ethereal as in...

00:22:49.168 --> 00:22:50.736 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: Ethereal,
yeah ethereal.

00:22:50.736 --> 00:22:54.273 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Ray Tarpey: And so
they were more of the ether.

00:22:54.273 --> 00:22:55.241 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Ray Tarpey: The [foreign
word], the [foreign word].

00:22:55.241 --> 00:22:56.375 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Ray Tarpey:
The [foreign word].

00:22:56.375 --> 00:23:00.646 align:middle line:84%
And so it was easier
for them to attain it.

00:23:00.646 --> 00:23:05.384 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know what degrees
of hardness or easiness

00:23:05.384 --> 00:23:08.154 align:middle line:84%
at those levels because I
don't have that memory yet.

00:23:08.154 --> 00:23:10.690 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Ray Tarpey: But
I accept what he says

00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:12.525 align:middle line:90%
as a distinct possibility.

00:23:12.525 --> 00:23:17.730 align:middle line:84%
Okay and so we know that
Lemuria actually overlapped

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:22.902 align:middle line:84%
with also the ceding of
civilization in the Atlantean,

00:23:22.902 --> 00:23:23.836 align:middle line:90%
the upper Atlantean...

00:23:23.836 --> 00:23:24.670 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:25.738 align:middle line:90%
...there were in communication

00:23:25.738 --> 00:23:27.707 align:middle line:84%
with each other according
to Edgar Casey.

00:23:27.707 --> 00:23:29.842 align:middle line:84%
Now this is where a
lot of stories come

00:23:29.842 --> 00:23:32.745 align:middle line:84%
in that are interesting
regarding the manipulation

00:23:32.745 --> 00:23:37.850 align:middle line:84%
genetically and electrically
of the human body or vehicle.

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:42.855 align:middle line:84%
And was that already occurring
in the Lemurian period?

00:23:42.855 --> 00:23:46.659 align:middle line:84%
That making arrangements
with the physical species

00:23:46.659 --> 00:23:47.727 align:middle line:90%
for the soul to inhabit...

00:23:47.727 --> 00:23:48.895 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:23:48.895 --> 00:23:50.229 align:middle line:84%
...this vehicle that
is known as the human.

00:23:50.229 --> 00:23:53.266 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: Yes, a lot
of work had to be done

00:23:53.266 --> 00:24:00.640 align:middle line:84%
because they began to not
just commune with each other,

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.175 align:middle line:90%
but commune with material forms

00:24:03.175 --> 00:24:05.177 align:middle line:84%
and they could produce
by thought form.

00:24:05.177 --> 00:24:09.215 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Ray Tarpey: so they could
produce and Edgar Casey said

00:24:09.215 --> 00:24:13.252 align:middle line:84%
that that's the reason for the
pre-civilizational; animal,

00:24:13.252 --> 00:24:19.759 align:middle line:84%
humanoid forms that you see
in our mythology and history.

00:24:19.759 --> 00:24:22.028 align:middle line:90%
It's not baseless it's true.

00:24:22.028 --> 00:24:26.465 align:middle line:84%
They remember more than we
do because they lived earlier

00:24:26.465 --> 00:24:29.135 align:middle line:84%
and so we're to listen
to their testimony.

00:24:29.135 --> 00:24:30.469 align:middle line:84%
When you say their,
you talking animals?

00:24:30.469 --> 00:24:31.637 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Ancient people.

00:24:31.637 --> 00:24:32.638 align:middle line:90%
The ancient people.

00:24:32.638 --> 00:24:34.407 align:middle line:84%
Okay. Ray Tarpey:
And their myths --

00:24:34.407 --> 00:24:39.045 align:middle line:84%
their myths are important
because they give us information

00:24:39.045 --> 00:24:42.348 align:middle line:84%
from people who remember
things thousands

00:24:42.348 --> 00:24:45.184 align:middle line:84%
of years before our
present generation.

00:24:45.184 --> 00:24:47.853 align:middle line:84%
So it behooves us to
listen and to read

00:24:47.853 --> 00:24:51.624 align:middle line:84%
and in our modern generations
we are starting to do that.

00:24:51.624 --> 00:24:54.827 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Okay let's get back to what
you were just speaking about...

00:24:54.827 --> 00:24:56.262 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yeah.

00:24:56.262 --> 00:24:57.463 align:middle line:90%
...a moment ago.

00:24:57.463 --> 00:24:59.365 align:middle line:84%
The beings that have been
known mythologically,

00:24:59.365 --> 00:25:02.268 align:middle line:84%
some of them appeared
as Egyptian gods,

00:25:02.268 --> 00:25:04.570 align:middle line:90%
others in Greek Mythology

00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:07.440 align:middle line:84%
where you have half ram
half man and so forth.

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:08.441 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Right.

00:25:08.441 --> 00:25:12.278 align:middle line:84%
Now was this something
that occurred

00:25:12.278 --> 00:25:15.548 align:middle line:84%
in the ethereal plane
first where there was more

00:25:15.548 --> 00:25:17.383 align:middle line:84%
of an immerging of
those two types?

00:25:17.383 --> 00:25:20.453 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: It's a merger
that occurs in middle earth.

00:25:20.453 --> 00:25:22.555 align:middle line:84%
What I have called -- what
the Japanese would call

00:25:22.555 --> 00:25:24.023 align:middle line:90%
middle earth.

00:25:24.023 --> 00:25:29.996 align:middle line:84%
It is a place in-between;
[foreign word] they call it.

00:25:29.996 --> 00:25:33.366 align:middle line:84%
Ami is heaven and noca
means in the middle.

00:25:33.366 --> 00:25:37.603 align:middle line:84%
And so it occurs in
the meeting place

00:25:37.603 --> 00:25:40.373 align:middle line:90%
between the dense area created.

00:25:40.373 --> 00:25:44.510 align:middle line:84%
The dense area is originally
created for the beings

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:49.849 align:middle line:84%
that are created to learn
to deal with suffering.

00:25:49.849 --> 00:25:52.451 align:middle line:90%
And death will come and appear

00:25:52.451 --> 00:25:56.422 align:middle line:84%
and that is an intended
suffering to teach

00:25:56.422 --> 00:26:01.193 align:middle line:84%
by our suffering and our
falling do we learn to love.

00:26:01.193 --> 00:26:03.029 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise the mind takes over.

00:26:03.029 --> 00:26:06.132 align:middle line:90%
The mind is given as a gift

00:26:06.132 --> 00:26:11.404 align:middle line:84%
but it is not intended
for us to overuse.

00:26:11.404 --> 00:26:13.706 align:middle line:84%
Right. Ray Tarpey: It's more
intended for us to align

00:26:13.706 --> 00:26:15.675 align:middle line:90%
with the intelligence rather

00:26:15.675 --> 00:26:17.877 align:middle line:84%
than tell the intelligence
what to do.

00:26:17.877 --> 00:26:18.978 align:middle line:90%
Yeah absolutely.

00:26:18.978 --> 00:26:19.745 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yeah [laughter].

00:26:19.745 --> 00:26:20.913 align:middle line:90%
So and the intelligence

00:26:20.913 --> 00:26:22.915 align:middle line:84%
of the animal kingdom
was here before --

00:26:22.915 --> 00:26:24.316 align:middle line:90%
in the physical realm...

00:26:24.316 --> 00:26:25.718 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:26:25.718 --> 00:26:28.254 align:middle line:84%
...was here before what became
the human merging so to speak.

00:26:28.254 --> 00:26:30.523 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: Right and so
the intelligence is the

00:26:30.523 --> 00:26:32.258 align:middle line:90%
grand engineer.

00:26:32.258 --> 00:26:36.095 align:middle line:84%
And as the intelligence
sees what we're doing;

00:26:36.095 --> 00:26:37.863 align:middle line:90%
oh they're doing that again.

00:26:37.863 --> 00:26:41.701 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Ray Tarpey: Okay, set up
over here, put in over here.

00:26:41.701 --> 00:26:43.969 align:middle line:84%
It's like Disney Land,
it's a Disney set.

00:26:43.969 --> 00:26:48.174 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Ray Tarpey: And it changes
every moment to interface

00:26:48.174 --> 00:26:51.744 align:middle line:90%
with our learning curve.

00:26:51.744 --> 00:26:58.751 align:middle line:84%
So in this process
Casey states that many

00:26:58.751 --> 00:27:00.686 align:middle line:84%
of the souls became
trapped into...

00:27:00.686 --> 00:27:01.387 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:27:01.387 --> 00:27:01.954 align:middle line:90%
...material realm.

00:27:01.954 --> 00:27:03.089 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:27:03.089 --> 00:27:04.890 align:middle line:84%
Which kind of -- well I
mean I've heard other...

00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:05.991 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yeah.

00:27:05.991 --> 00:27:07.359 align:middle line:84%
...stories that are
very similar to this.

00:27:07.359 --> 00:27:08.627 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:27:08.627 --> 00:27:11.697 align:middle line:84%
And in becoming trapped
there became a different kind

00:27:11.697 --> 00:27:13.699 align:middle line:84%
of imperative that
occurred at that time.

00:27:13.699 --> 00:27:14.934 align:middle line:90%
And can you talk about that

00:27:14.934 --> 00:27:16.802 align:middle line:84%
because I think many people
relate to that feeling.

00:27:16.802 --> 00:27:20.506 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: The trapping
is attached to pleasure

00:27:20.506 --> 00:27:23.576 align:middle line:84%
because they're getting used
to the pleasure in a new form

00:27:23.576 --> 00:27:24.810 align:middle line:90%
and it's an incarnate form.

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:27.580 align:middle line:84%
It's a more dense form
and they love it so much

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:30.349 align:middle line:84%
that they begin to
think that's real.

00:27:30.349 --> 00:27:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And they begin to forget
about their true selves

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:37.123 align:middle line:84%
and their own destiny
and where they come from.

00:27:37.123 --> 00:27:42.428 align:middle line:84%
We're going through a material
phase in order to learn things.

00:27:42.428 --> 00:27:44.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's created
by the creator

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:47.700 align:middle line:90%
to help us as a teaching device.

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:49.935 align:middle line:84%
I've always wondered
how incredibly painful

00:27:49.935 --> 00:27:53.038 align:middle line:84%
and frustrating it must
have been to become encased

00:27:53.038 --> 00:27:56.008 align:middle line:84%
in the physical without
the ability to create...

00:27:56.008 --> 00:27:57.109 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Right.

00:27:57.109 --> 00:27:58.077 align:middle line:84%
...reality at the speed
of thought anymore.

00:27:58.077 --> 00:27:59.478 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: There's
a sense of loss.

00:27:59.478 --> 00:28:02.448 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Ray Tarpey: There's a sense
of fear and we can't explain it.

00:28:02.448 --> 00:28:05.718 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Ray Tarpey: It just comes
with the human condition.

00:28:05.718 --> 00:28:07.553 align:middle line:84%
It comes with the
animal condition.

00:28:07.553 --> 00:28:10.189 align:middle line:84%
It comes with all
incarnate conditions.

00:28:10.189 --> 00:28:12.057 align:middle line:84%
And so with that became
the loss of memory.

00:28:12.057 --> 00:28:13.125 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:28:13.125 --> 00:28:15.060 align:middle line:90%
And so -- which for good reason.

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:16.395 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:28:16.395 --> 00:28:17.763 align:middle line:84%
I mean what is the point of
carrying forward that memory

00:28:17.763 --> 00:28:20.266 align:middle line:84%
when one has no ability
to be able

00:28:20.266 --> 00:28:21.967 align:middle line:90%
to access that aspect of self.

00:28:21.967 --> 00:28:23.035 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Correct.

00:28:23.035 --> 00:28:25.905 align:middle line:84%
And so we began to
construct another world

00:28:25.905 --> 00:28:28.007 align:middle line:90%
and we constructed civilizations

00:28:28.007 --> 00:28:30.509 align:middle line:84%
and we constructed
new mythologies

00:28:30.509 --> 00:28:32.812 align:middle line:90%
to explain our origins.

00:28:32.812 --> 00:28:35.314 align:middle line:90%
And we -- in order -- and a lot

00:28:35.314 --> 00:28:38.551 align:middle line:84%
of these mythologies were
constructed to control.

00:28:38.551 --> 00:28:39.485 align:middle line:90%
Okay, let's talk about that.

00:28:39.485 --> 00:28:40.820 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yeah.

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:45.157 align:middle line:84%
There are two camps that Edgar
Casey discusses repeatedly

00:28:45.157 --> 00:28:46.792 align:middle line:90%
in very consistent channelings.

00:28:46.792 --> 00:28:47.860 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Right.

00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:51.564 align:middle line:84%
These readings are
maybe 10 years apart,

00:28:51.564 --> 00:28:53.532 align:middle line:90%
but it'll be the exact same.

00:28:53.532 --> 00:28:54.867 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:28:54.867 --> 00:28:56.135 align:middle line:84%
.He'll go to the exact same
place, location, dynamic...

00:28:56.135 --> 00:28:57.503 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: It becomes
a coherent story.

00:28:57.503 --> 00:28:58.204 align:middle line:90%
Exactly. Ray Tarpey: Yeah.

00:28:58.204 --> 00:28:59.471 align:middle line:90%
Very coherent.

00:28:59.471 --> 00:29:01.574 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things he
talks about is this dichotomy

00:29:01.574 --> 00:29:04.710 align:middle line:84%
within the psyche there
where the sons of Belial

00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:08.113 align:middle line:84%
and then there were the
sons of the loved one.

00:29:08.113 --> 00:29:09.448 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Correct.

00:29:09.448 --> 00:29:12.251 align:middle line:84%
Now can you explain in essence
what he meant by those --

00:29:12.251 --> 00:29:16.188 align:middle line:84%
these two mindsets, or
forces, or types of being?

00:29:16.188 --> 00:29:18.757 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: It seems
to be a sicklical form.

00:29:18.757 --> 00:29:22.828 align:middle line:84%
It is a development
in Atlantis of a group

00:29:22.828 --> 00:29:27.166 align:middle line:84%
who take the crystal,
the crystal skull.

00:29:27.166 --> 00:29:30.035 align:middle line:84%
Originally the crystal
is created

00:29:30.035 --> 00:29:32.571 align:middle line:84%
in the earth as a
storage device.

00:29:32.571 --> 00:29:34.406 align:middle line:84%
That's why we're
using it right now.

00:29:34.406 --> 00:29:37.576 align:middle line:84%
It's intended from
the very beginning.

00:29:37.576 --> 00:29:39.445 align:middle line:90%
And so all of it has memory.

00:29:39.445 --> 00:29:42.548 align:middle line:84%
And this is the basis
of the crystal skulls.

00:29:42.548 --> 00:29:44.617 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize that
until I got dragged

00:29:44.617 --> 00:29:45.918 align:middle line:90%
into the crystal skull...

00:29:45.918 --> 00:29:46.619 align:middle line:90%
After 11-11.

00:29:46.619 --> 00:29:47.553 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: ...thing.

00:29:47.553 --> 00:29:48.687 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Ray Tarpey:
Until 11-11-11.

00:29:48.687 --> 00:29:51.357 align:middle line:84%
Right. Ray Tarpey: So
I'm a Mayan researcher

00:29:51.357 --> 00:29:54.093 align:middle line:84%
and they took me up
a couple of levels.

00:29:54.093 --> 00:29:59.131 align:middle line:84%
And so then I realized
that the mind is not ready

00:29:59.131 --> 00:30:01.934 align:middle line:90%
until certain points to realize.

00:30:01.934 --> 00:30:05.371 align:middle line:84%
Then I began to look at crystal
and what Edgar Casey said

00:30:05.371 --> 00:30:10.409 align:middle line:84%
about crystal, and he said that
the original crystal is created

00:30:10.409 --> 00:30:13.646 align:middle line:84%
in the earth for us
to be able to commune

00:30:13.646 --> 00:30:15.047 align:middle line:90%
with other dimensions."

00:30:15.047 --> 00:30:20.052 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Ray Tarpey: But later on
that crystal could become used

00:30:20.052 --> 00:30:25.424 align:middle line:84%
in technology and it
could be used to --

00:30:25.424 --> 00:30:29.161 align:middle line:84%
for our physical needs
and it could be abused.

00:30:29.161 --> 00:30:31.997 align:middle line:84%
So this is where the --
this is where the parting

00:30:31.997 --> 00:30:35.200 align:middle line:84%
of the ways philosophically
comes between the sons of Belial

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.035 align:middle line:90%
and I mean we could almost...

00:30:36.035 --> 00:30:36.735 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:30:36.735 --> 00:30:37.303 align:middle line:90%
It's the same drama...

00:30:37.303 --> 00:30:38.671 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:30:38.671 --> 00:30:39.705 align:middle line:84%
...almost in our world right
now which is why we're talking

00:30:39.705 --> 00:30:40.906 align:middle line:84%
about it -- and the
followers of one.

00:30:40.906 --> 00:30:41.473 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yeah.

00:30:41.473 --> 00:30:42.608 align:middle line:90%
The Law of One.

00:30:42.608 --> 00:30:43.943 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: They became
the users and abusers.

00:30:43.943 --> 00:30:45.344 align:middle line:90%
The Belial?

00:30:45.344 --> 00:30:47.846 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Ray Tarpey: I call them
the SOB's for short [laughter].

00:30:47.846 --> 00:30:48.981 align:middle line:90%
[Multiple Speakers].

00:30:48.981 --> 00:30:52.952 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: They became
the users and abusers.

00:30:52.952 --> 00:30:56.689 align:middle line:84%
And as in Plato, when he
discusses it he says --

00:30:56.689 --> 00:30:59.892 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if it's
Plato or Edgar Casey

00:30:59.892 --> 00:31:03.495 align:middle line:84%
but the discussion was,
about things talking

00:31:03.495 --> 00:31:05.597 align:middle line:90%
about people as slaves.

00:31:05.597 --> 00:31:06.498 align:middle line:90%
I was wondering that about...

00:31:06.498 --> 00:31:07.833 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: As things.

00:31:07.833 --> 00:31:10.970 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Ray Tarpey: And so it
gets to that level when you get

00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:14.640 align:middle line:84%
into that material culture
and to your own attachments.

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:19.345 align:middle line:84%
Then other beings -- you lose
your respect for the whole thing

00:31:19.345 --> 00:31:23.015 align:middle line:84%
and your ego, the
mind is just driving.

00:31:23.015 --> 00:31:26.452 align:middle line:84%
And driving the whole
force of civilization.

00:31:26.452 --> 00:31:28.921 align:middle line:84%
And it creates its
own mythologies.

00:31:28.921 --> 00:31:33.092 align:middle line:84%
So Plato came up with
the allegory of the cave

00:31:33.092 --> 00:31:38.197 align:middle line:84%
in the republic I believe
it appeared that he wrote

00:31:38.197 --> 00:31:43.168 align:middle line:84%
in the 300 B.C.E., and
he envisioned us all

00:31:43.168 --> 00:31:45.237 align:middle line:84%
and I'm very much in
agreement with him -- I just --

00:31:45.237 --> 00:31:48.207 align:middle line:84%
my research is leading
me back right to him.

00:31:48.207 --> 00:31:54.313 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of years ago where
he said the human condition is

00:31:54.313 --> 00:31:57.282 align:middle line:84%
like people sitting
in a large cave

00:31:57.282 --> 00:32:00.619 align:middle line:84%
and they're facing the
inner world, the inner wall

00:32:00.619 --> 00:32:03.889 align:middle line:84%
of this large cave and the
light sources coming --

00:32:03.889 --> 00:32:07.493 align:middle line:84%
the entrance of the
cave is way behind them.

00:32:07.493 --> 00:32:13.165 align:middle line:84%
And the light is shining
and there are puppeteers,

00:32:13.165 --> 00:32:16.702 align:middle line:84%
days of our civilizations
and the manipulators

00:32:16.702 --> 00:32:20.372 align:middle line:84%
who are conducting a
puppet show and it appears

00:32:20.372 --> 00:32:22.307 align:middle line:90%
as shadows upon the wall.

00:32:22.307 --> 00:32:26.145 align:middle line:84%
And these shadows -- this
shadow world becomes the reality

00:32:26.145 --> 00:32:28.981 align:middle line:84%
of the people living
in these civilizations.

00:32:28.981 --> 00:32:30.382 align:middle line:90%
Such a beautiful way to put it.

00:32:30.382 --> 00:32:36.021 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: And nobody dares to
turn around and see what's...

00:32:36.021 --> 00:32:37.423 align:middle line:90%
Casting those shadows.

00:32:37.423 --> 00:32:40.859 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: ...going on behind
except the people that study.

00:32:40.859 --> 00:32:45.030 align:middle line:84%
Who Socrates and Plato
call the "philosophers."

00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:47.633 align:middle line:90%
The ones who study the details,

00:32:47.633 --> 00:32:51.637 align:middle line:84%
who go away from the assigned
books, the ones who look

00:32:51.637 --> 00:32:54.606 align:middle line:84%
for the anomalies
in-between the words.

00:32:54.606 --> 00:32:59.545 align:middle line:84%
The little tiny things
that almost appear when --

00:32:59.545 --> 00:33:03.415 align:middle line:84%
that when people take these,
the hallucinogenic plants,

00:33:03.415 --> 00:33:09.655 align:middle line:84%
like our ancient Mayans and the
[foreign word] people take --

00:33:09.655 --> 00:33:11.723 align:middle line:90%
[foreign word] go to Peru.

00:33:11.723 --> 00:33:16.728 align:middle line:84%
Their mind tries to
make a scene and all

00:33:16.728 --> 00:33:19.731 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden the scene
starts to crack.

00:33:19.731 --> 00:33:22.301 align:middle line:84%
And that's the planned
intelligence coming

00:33:22.301 --> 00:33:27.606 align:middle line:84%
through to teach us that
that's just a puppet scenario.

00:33:27.606 --> 00:33:29.208 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Ray Tarpey: That's
not the real thing.

00:33:29.208 --> 00:33:32.778 align:middle line:84%
So now are the puppet -- are the
puppeteers essentially the line

00:33:32.778 --> 00:33:35.314 align:middle line:84%
of Belial on a consciousness
scale?

00:33:35.314 --> 00:33:37.316 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: They change
with each generation.

00:33:37.316 --> 00:33:41.954 align:middle line:84%
It depends -- as Casey
said, we gain and we lose.

00:33:41.954 --> 00:33:48.193 align:middle line:84%
Just because we gain in one
lifetime we can easily go back

00:33:48.193 --> 00:33:51.797 align:middle line:84%
and forget and go against
everything we said.

00:33:51.797 --> 00:33:55.100 align:middle line:84%
But isn't the -- is the
Law of One acknowledge

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:56.835 align:middle line:84%
that there is no
right, there's no wrong,

00:33:56.835 --> 00:33:58.070 align:middle line:90%
there's no good, there's no bad.

00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:59.338 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: There
is no judgment.

00:33:59.338 --> 00:34:01.440 align:middle line:90%
There is only one and so we play

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:04.643 align:middle line:84%
out these various scenarios
throughout eternity so to speak.

00:34:04.643 --> 00:34:07.479 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: I love you
say there is only one.

00:34:07.479 --> 00:34:11.150 align:middle line:84%
Then you eliminate all
the names that they create

00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:12.383 align:middle line:90%
to divide the people...

00:34:12.383 --> 00:34:13.919 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Ray Tarpey:
...and conquer them.

00:34:13.919 --> 00:34:16.054 align:middle line:84%
There is only once
source of spirit.

00:34:16.054 --> 00:34:20.124 align:middle line:84%
It's in everybody the same and
I none one is the great leader

00:34:20.124 --> 00:34:23.495 align:middle line:90%
that knows more than you do.

00:34:23.495 --> 00:34:27.566 align:middle line:90%
There is a democracy of spirit.

00:34:27.566 --> 00:34:31.103 align:middle line:84%
Spirit is always
entirely democratic.

00:34:31.103 --> 00:34:33.905 align:middle line:84%
Each soul has equal
intelligence.

00:34:33.905 --> 00:34:39.077 align:middle line:84%
No soul is more intelligent than
the other because they're made

00:34:39.077 --> 00:34:42.847 align:middle line:84%
of the same spirit
substrates stuff.

00:34:42.847 --> 00:34:48.987 align:middle line:84%
And so when we study we
assume our highest level.

00:34:48.987 --> 00:34:53.525 align:middle line:84%
We make a decision to
study for ourselves

00:34:53.525 --> 00:34:55.861 align:middle line:90%
and stop studying for others.

00:34:55.861 --> 00:34:58.197 align:middle line:90%
Yes. Ray Tarpey: Most people

00:34:58.197 --> 00:35:01.533 align:middle line:84%
in the civilizations
are studying for others.

00:35:01.533 --> 00:35:04.770 align:middle line:84%
I want to be this, I
want to get into that.

00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:08.106 align:middle line:84%
It's good but at some
point in our lives we have

00:35:08.106 --> 00:35:11.777 align:middle line:84%
to fulfill the ancient
contracts that we've made.

00:35:11.777 --> 00:35:15.447 align:middle line:84%
And the Maya talk about
about the ancient contracts.

00:35:15.447 --> 00:35:19.985 align:middle line:84%
We must go back and do the
thing that we came here to do.

00:35:19.985 --> 00:35:23.589 align:middle line:84%
And come out of the
entertainment field Disney Land.

00:35:23.589 --> 00:35:29.161 align:middle line:84%
And then really investigate
why we have certain powers,

00:35:29.161 --> 00:35:32.331 align:middle line:84%
why we're good in art and the
other person is not that good

00:35:32.331 --> 00:35:34.266 align:middle line:90%
but they're better in math.

00:35:34.266 --> 00:35:37.169 align:middle line:84%
But I still have this
other intelligence.

00:35:37.169 --> 00:35:39.137 align:middle line:90%
And just stopped comparing.

00:35:39.137 --> 00:35:43.208 align:middle line:84%
And to start realizing who
-- what power you have.

00:35:43.208 --> 00:35:46.111 align:middle line:90%
I talk a lot to young people.

00:35:46.111 --> 00:35:50.816 align:middle line:84%
I still go in and teach and I
teach them about these things.

00:35:50.816 --> 00:35:55.454 align:middle line:84%
I teach them to begin
buying your own books.

00:35:55.454 --> 00:35:57.956 align:middle line:90%
Don't use the library books.

00:35:57.956 --> 00:36:02.594 align:middle line:84%
To begin looking at the
internet, downloading things

00:36:02.594 --> 00:36:03.996 align:middle line:84%
from the internet,
they're not --

00:36:03.996 --> 00:36:09.935 align:middle line:84%
Wikipedia is my greatest source
because it's not an authority.

00:36:09.935 --> 00:36:12.638 align:middle line:84%
Right. Ray Tarpey: Everybody
says it's got holes in it.

00:36:12.638 --> 00:36:15.140 align:middle line:90%
Good. I love the holes.

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:16.842 align:middle line:90%
Give me the holes any time.

00:36:16.842 --> 00:36:20.012 align:middle line:84%
I don't want the --
somebody's complete steril...

00:36:20.012 --> 00:36:22.447 align:middle line:84%
You don't want it
[inaudible] [laughter].

00:36:22.447 --> 00:36:24.082 align:middle line:90%
Okay, you brought up the Maya's.

00:36:24.082 --> 00:36:25.484 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:36:25.484 --> 00:36:27.419 align:middle line:84%
Now, I want to go back because
this is something so little know

00:36:27.419 --> 00:36:31.823 align:middle line:84%
and you mentioned something off
camera that was so intriguing.

00:36:31.823 --> 00:36:34.359 align:middle line:84%
We don't understand
a lot in the west

00:36:34.359 --> 00:36:36.762 align:middle line:84%
about the ancient
lore of the east.

00:36:36.762 --> 00:36:39.164 align:middle line:84%
Other than what's been passed
on through Buddhism for example.

00:36:39.164 --> 00:36:40.532 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:36:40.532 --> 00:36:43.101 align:middle line:84%
And part of that through the
Casey readings, specifically,

00:36:43.101 --> 00:36:46.905 align:middle line:84%
was that there were not a lot of
Asians, nor African-Americans,

00:36:46.905 --> 00:36:49.908 align:middle line:84%
nor anyone else besides
Caucasians...

00:36:49.908 --> 00:36:50.976 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:36:50.976 --> 00:36:52.778 align:middle line:84%
...asking questions
of Casey in the day.

00:36:52.778 --> 00:36:54.813 align:middle line:84%
So he was only responding
to what was asked.

00:36:54.813 --> 00:36:56.214 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes, yes.

00:36:56.214 --> 00:36:58.650 align:middle line:84%
So now you can paint a different
portrait for us through the --

00:36:58.650 --> 00:36:59.952 align:middle line:90%
is it called [foreign word]?

00:36:59.952 --> 00:37:01.153 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: Yeah,
the [foreign word].

00:37:01.153 --> 00:37:02.454 align:middle line:90%
The [foreign word].

00:37:02.454 --> 00:37:05.958 align:middle line:84%
Okay. Let's talk about that
version of our origins.

00:37:05.958 --> 00:37:07.259 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: And the --

00:37:07.259 --> 00:37:10.729 align:middle line:84%
as you say the channeler is
limited by the clientele.

00:37:10.729 --> 00:37:12.064 align:middle line:90%
By the questions.

00:37:12.064 --> 00:37:15.100 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Ray Tarpey: And so if
it's not asked it's not given.

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:17.502 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a sacred
relationship

00:37:17.502 --> 00:37:21.807 align:middle line:84%
between the channeler and the
client, and the acoustic record

00:37:21.807 --> 00:37:24.776 align:middle line:84%
which is the intelligence
will come through.

00:37:24.776 --> 00:37:29.414 align:middle line:84%
An interface with that
soul and it's totally --

00:37:29.414 --> 00:37:31.383 align:middle line:84%
it's almost as a
teacher teaches.

00:37:31.383 --> 00:37:35.187 align:middle line:84%
There is a readiness level
that the individual soul has

00:37:35.187 --> 00:37:38.423 align:middle line:84%
and the [foreign word]
record has to channel

00:37:38.423 --> 00:37:41.493 align:middle line:84%
through the nature
of its lifetimes --

00:37:41.493 --> 00:37:46.998 align:middle line:84%
what knowledge it's built up
and try to give it knowledge,

00:37:46.998 --> 00:37:49.501 align:middle line:84%
give the being knowledge
that can advance it.

00:37:49.501 --> 00:37:51.636 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Ray Tarpey: And
that's why it's a caveat

00:37:51.636 --> 00:37:54.139 align:middle line:84%
when we interpret
a reading that's

00:37:54.139 --> 00:37:56.208 align:middle line:84%
between the channeler
and the client.

00:37:56.208 --> 00:37:57.142 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:37:57.142 --> 00:37:59.411 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: It is
not a religion.

00:37:59.411 --> 00:38:03.215 align:middle line:84%
Once we think Casey said
this and Casey said that,

00:38:03.215 --> 00:38:06.418 align:middle line:84%
that's your opinion
of what Casey said.

00:38:06.418 --> 00:38:10.288 align:middle line:84%
And really the value of his work
is there were just so many that,

00:38:10.288 --> 00:38:12.557 align:middle line:90%
common points started merging.

00:38:12.557 --> 00:38:13.925 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: And he
always said it.

00:38:13.925 --> 00:38:17.562 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Ray Tarpey: I am an --
I am not an infallible source.

00:38:17.562 --> 00:38:19.798 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Ray Tarpey: Do not
make me into a religion.

00:38:19.798 --> 00:38:21.233 align:middle line:90%
I am not that.

00:38:21.233 --> 00:38:25.504 align:middle line:84%
And so anybody arguing
over what Casey said it's a

00:38:25.504 --> 00:38:27.039 align:middle line:90%
ridiculous proposition.

00:38:27.039 --> 00:38:29.641 align:middle line:84%
Right, there is no point because
he isn't even attached to it.

00:38:29.641 --> 00:38:30.709 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: There is no point.

00:38:30.709 --> 00:38:32.544 align:middle line:84%
And he -- and the
followers of the one --

00:38:32.544 --> 00:38:36.348 align:middle line:84%
it comes to me now to tell you
-- that the things that drew me

00:38:36.348 --> 00:38:41.019 align:middle line:84%
to him immediately was when he
said, "How can anyone culture be

00:38:41.019 --> 00:38:45.757 align:middle line:84%
so arrogant as to think that
the Christ would only appear

00:38:45.757 --> 00:38:46.425 align:middle line:90%
to them?"

00:38:46.425 --> 00:38:47.859 align:middle line:90%
The divine infusion.

00:38:47.859 --> 00:38:52.197 align:middle line:84%
The Christ will appear
to all people and walk

00:38:52.197 --> 00:38:54.599 align:middle line:90%
with people of every kind.

00:38:54.599 --> 00:38:58.570 align:middle line:84%
Because the Chris is a
divine infusion that occurs

00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:00.972 align:middle line:90%
at intervals when needed,

00:39:00.972 --> 00:39:04.209 align:middle line:84%
because it's a living
being this universe.

00:39:04.209 --> 00:39:07.712 align:middle line:90%
And that infusion comes

00:39:07.712 --> 00:39:12.117 align:middle line:84%
in at certain key
points when it's needed.

00:39:12.117 --> 00:39:14.152 align:middle line:90%
Yes. Okay, so let's take that.

00:39:14.152 --> 00:39:15.020 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yeah.

00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:16.488 align:middle line:84%
Understanding it
shines at all --

00:39:16.488 --> 00:39:19.958 align:middle line:84%
at different times in different
places and go to the Japanese.

00:39:19.958 --> 00:39:21.026 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:39:21.026 --> 00:39:21.726 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at that,
the [foreign word].

00:39:21.726 --> 00:39:23.028 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Good idea.

00:39:23.028 --> 00:39:25.097 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Ray Tarpey: And the
Japanese Christ [background

00:39:25.097 --> 00:39:27.065 align:middle line:84%
music] is described
in the [foreign word].

00:39:27.065 --> 00:39:28.200 align:middle line:84%
The [foreign word] means, the
story of the old [inaudible]...

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:29.334 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. Right.

00:39:29.334 --> 00:39:30.635 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: It's kind
of hard to interpret.

00:39:30.635 --> 00:39:31.937 align:middle line:90%
Right. But...

00:39:31.937 --> 00:39:33.038 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: Because they're
Chinese characters and...

00:39:33.038 --> 00:39:33.939 align:middle line:90%
Physically...

00:39:33.939 --> 00:39:35.941 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Chinese characters.

00:39:35.941 --> 00:39:37.042 align:middle line:90%
You're seeing them in your head

00:39:37.042 --> 00:39:38.176 align:middle line:84%
and I say good enough
[laughter].

00:39:38.176 --> 00:39:39.244 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Are so large.

00:39:39.244 --> 00:39:41.980 align:middle line:84%
My favorite line which
to read is Chinese

00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:44.583 align:middle line:90%
because western languages it's

00:39:44.583 --> 00:39:47.319 align:middle line:84%
like reading on a
10-inch screen.

00:39:47.319 --> 00:39:50.121 align:middle line:84%
But when you read Chinese
it's a 17-inch screen.

00:39:50.121 --> 00:39:52.324 align:middle line:84%
Okay. Ray Tarpey:
Because hieroglyphics have

00:39:52.324 --> 00:39:53.492 align:middle line:90%
such an advantage...

00:39:53.492 --> 00:39:54.559 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Ray Tarpey:
...for the mind.

00:39:54.559 --> 00:39:55.393 align:middle line:90%
It fits better.

00:39:55.393 --> 00:39:56.695 align:middle line:90%
Yes. That makes sense.

00:39:56.695 --> 00:40:00.932 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: And so this
[foreign word] was -- it's --

00:40:00.932 --> 00:40:05.570 align:middle line:84%
what happened was [foreign
word] was a famous limericst

00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:10.275 align:middle line:90%
in the 7th Century Japan --

00:40:10.275 --> 00:40:15.814 align:middle line:84%
600's of Japan and the emperor
wanted to know the history

00:40:15.814 --> 00:40:18.550 align:middle line:90%
of japan because the writing --

00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:22.787 align:middle line:84%
Chinese writing was coming
through to Japan at that time.

00:40:22.787 --> 00:40:27.692 align:middle line:84%
Japanese were great
students of China.

00:40:27.692 --> 00:40:28.927 align:middle line:84%
So the writing is coming through
so they're using Japanese --

00:40:28.927 --> 00:40:32.831 align:middle line:84%
Chinese characters to
express their history.

00:40:32.831 --> 00:40:34.599 align:middle line:90%
And he goes traveling all

00:40:34.599 --> 00:40:39.137 align:middle line:84%
over Japan remembering all the
legends that everybody knew

00:40:39.137 --> 00:40:42.407 align:middle line:84%
and he comes back and
nobody debriefed him.

00:40:42.407 --> 00:40:44.809 align:middle line:84%
He was just sitting there
because there was a change

00:40:44.809 --> 00:40:50.448 align:middle line:84%
of emperors and it was an
empress, Empress Ling May

00:40:50.448 --> 00:40:53.919 align:middle line:84%
who finally said, "Let's
get this thing done."

00:40:53.919 --> 00:40:59.624 align:middle line:84%
And it was [foreign word]
a fellow by the name

00:40:59.624 --> 00:41:02.561 align:middle line:84%
of [foreign word] who
finally wrote it down.

00:41:02.561 --> 00:41:06.431 align:middle line:84%
It became the [foreign word]
and it became the [foreign word]

00:41:06.431 --> 00:41:11.136 align:middle line:84%
which came a little bit later
which is jumping off of it.

00:41:11.136 --> 00:41:14.339 align:middle line:84%
And it talked about
the beginnings

00:41:14.339 --> 00:41:17.442 align:middle line:90%
of the Lemurian Theater.

00:41:17.442 --> 00:41:22.047 align:middle line:84%
Because Edgar Casey said at
some point in this history

00:41:22.047 --> 00:41:25.350 align:middle line:84%
that we've been talking
about this --

00:41:25.350 --> 00:41:29.721 align:middle line:84%
when the creator created all
the beings he also created

00:41:29.721 --> 00:41:30.555 align:middle line:90%
the Christ.

00:41:30.555 --> 00:41:32.657 align:middle line:90%
And what is this Christ?

00:41:32.657 --> 00:41:36.461 align:middle line:84%
This Christ he said is
a little bit different.

00:41:36.461 --> 00:41:42.801 align:middle line:84%
This Christ is created by amebic
reproduction with the creator.

00:41:42.801 --> 00:41:49.641 align:middle line:84%
It was like two ameba coming
apart and it was the same thing.

00:41:49.641 --> 00:41:56.181 align:middle line:84%
And this one he named it
Amilius, A-M-I-L-I-U-S;

00:41:56.181 --> 00:41:58.950 align:middle line:84%
and he said, "That's
the great over soul."

00:41:58.950 --> 00:42:03.154 align:middle line:84%
The one, the director of
incarnation I would call it.

00:42:03.154 --> 00:42:07.359 align:middle line:84%
The one who's the [foreign
word] of the -- of Indian.

00:42:07.359 --> 00:42:12.764 align:middle line:84%
The one who is conducting
everything for the creator

00:42:12.764 --> 00:42:14.399 align:middle line:90%
in the incarnate realm.

00:42:14.399 --> 00:42:17.636 align:middle line:90%
The creator itself in his aspect

00:42:17.636 --> 00:42:20.939 align:middle line:84%
of a divine infusion
into the incarnate.

00:42:20.939 --> 00:42:22.507 align:middle line:90%
It's heavy stuff.

00:42:22.507 --> 00:42:24.909 align:middle line:84%
It's hard for this
mind to comprehend.

00:42:24.909 --> 00:42:26.011 align:middle line:90%
We'll just go with an over soul.

00:42:26.011 --> 00:42:27.178 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: An over soul.

00:42:27.178 --> 00:42:28.913 align:middle line:84%
That is creating on
behalf of the greater...

00:42:28.913 --> 00:42:33.918 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: And so what got
me started was Casey said --

00:42:33.918 --> 00:42:40.125 align:middle line:84%
he mentioned that this over
soul in a later incarnation came

00:42:40.125 --> 00:42:47.432 align:middle line:84%
about -- he mentioned Amilius
as existing in Atlantis two --

00:42:47.432 --> 00:42:52.704 align:middle line:84%
approximately 200,000
years before the appearance

00:42:52.704 --> 00:42:54.839 align:middle line:90%
of Ra in India.

00:42:54.839 --> 00:42:56.207 align:middle line:90%
Now that's a heavy subject.

00:42:56.207 --> 00:42:57.909 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to get
into Indian history.

00:42:57.909 --> 00:42:59.911 align:middle line:84%
Right. Ray Tarpey: That's
a heavy subject itself.

00:42:59.911 --> 00:43:03.481 align:middle line:84%
But long ago he gave
a mark of 200,000

00:43:03.481 --> 00:43:06.651 align:middle line:84%
which I want other people
-- scholars to consider.

00:43:06.651 --> 00:43:09.120 align:middle line:90%
And but it could be --

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:11.990 align:middle line:84%
it's sicklical, there are
many other of these cycles...

00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:14.726 align:middle line:90%
Yes. Ray Tarpey: ...to consider.

00:43:14.726 --> 00:43:17.796 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, at that
point what he said

00:43:17.796 --> 00:43:22.701 align:middle line:84%
that Amilius did
was splice himself

00:43:22.701 --> 00:43:27.739 align:middle line:84%
into five different beings,
five different entities,

00:43:27.739 --> 00:43:30.842 align:middle line:90%
five different Adam and Eve's.

00:43:30.842 --> 00:43:33.478 align:middle line:90%
One of them is Mu Lemuria.

00:43:33.478 --> 00:43:37.449 align:middle line:84%
One of them is in
the Capetians Europe.

00:43:37.449 --> 00:43:40.919 align:middle line:84%
And the one in Mu
Lemuria the color is brown

00:43:40.919 --> 00:43:44.189 align:middle line:84%
and they are attached
to the sense of smell.

00:43:44.189 --> 00:43:47.392 align:middle line:84%
Because the divine --
we're given five senses

00:43:47.392 --> 00:43:53.131 align:middle line:84%
and the divine can be
experienced completely almost

00:43:53.131 --> 00:43:55.734 align:middle line:84%
through those five
different senses.

00:43:55.734 --> 00:43:57.569 align:middle line:84%
And so you'll hear
the mystics talk

00:43:57.569 --> 00:44:01.406 align:middle line:84%
about the fragrance
of God for example.

00:44:01.406 --> 00:44:07.479 align:middle line:84%
Because you can experience
the divine, the character

00:44:07.479 --> 00:44:11.216 align:middle line:84%
of the intelligence through
that divinely appointed sense

00:44:11.216 --> 00:44:12.283 align:middle line:90%
of smell.

00:44:12.283 --> 00:44:16.121 align:middle line:84%
And Mu Lemuria is then
the expert in that

00:44:16.121 --> 00:44:18.323 align:middle line:84%
and that's what lead
me in my researches.

00:44:18.323 --> 00:44:19.524 align:middle line:90%
Okay. Ray Tarpey: And then

00:44:19.524 --> 00:44:23.027 align:middle line:84%
for the Europeans the
Capetians he mentions

00:44:23.027 --> 00:44:26.064 align:middle line:90%
as another of the first Adam's.

00:44:26.064 --> 00:44:30.802 align:middle line:84%
Because for Casey the first
Adam is the last Adam.

00:44:30.802 --> 00:44:32.337 align:middle line:90%
The first Christ is going

00:44:32.337 --> 00:44:34.639 align:middle line:84%
to be the same Christ
all the way through.

00:44:34.639 --> 00:44:36.841 align:middle line:84%
So that's why it's the
followers of the one.

00:44:36.841 --> 00:44:41.412 align:middle line:84%
Because the Christ is always
the same in every culture.

00:44:41.412 --> 00:44:42.647 align:middle line:90%
It's interfacing

00:44:42.647 --> 00:44:45.650 align:middle line:84%
with a different
theater of incarnation.

00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:49.554 align:middle line:84%
So it gets a little
complex with the five there.

00:44:49.554 --> 00:44:52.357 align:middle line:84%
And so the others
if I can remember,

00:44:52.357 --> 00:44:55.360 align:middle line:84%
are the Atlantean
and the American.

00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:59.164 align:middle line:84%
And the Atlantean and the
American are the red theater I

00:44:59.164 --> 00:45:00.165 align:middle line:90%
call it.

00:45:00.165 --> 00:45:03.968 align:middle line:84%
And their expertise
is in feeling.

00:45:03.968 --> 00:45:09.040 align:middle line:84%
The American Indian can
feel this place much better

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:10.608 align:middle line:90%
than the other four.

00:45:10.608 --> 00:45:12.410 align:middle line:90%
It's their power.

00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:16.214 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the American
Indian becomes so important

00:45:16.214 --> 00:45:20.885 align:middle line:84%
in my researches because I'm
feeling now what they feel.

00:45:20.885 --> 00:45:23.488 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I do the
Mayan calendar reading

00:45:23.488 --> 00:45:26.124 align:middle line:84%
because the Mayan
calendar readings,

00:45:26.124 --> 00:45:29.460 align:middle line:84%
that ancient instrument
which was allowed to come

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:35.800 align:middle line:84%
through I can express to people
that feeling of the divine

00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:39.938 align:middle line:84%
so that they can experience
it in their American selves...

00:45:39.938 --> 00:45:42.307 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Ray Tarpey: ...not
their Eurasian selves.

00:45:42.307 --> 00:45:46.711 align:middle line:84%
Because they come from
ancestors in the white realm.

00:45:46.711 --> 00:45:49.714 align:middle line:84%
In the white realm
the eyes are good.

00:45:49.714 --> 00:45:53.518 align:middle line:90%
In the Carpathian incarnation --

00:45:53.518 --> 00:45:58.756 align:middle line:84%
theater of incarnation
the eye is supreme.

00:45:58.756 --> 00:46:03.561 align:middle line:84%
It's the -- the European
has such marvelous visions.

00:46:03.561 --> 00:46:06.231 align:middle line:90%
It sees it has a perfect model.

00:46:06.231 --> 00:46:10.401 align:middle line:84%
If we follow this
model we can get there.

00:46:10.401 --> 00:46:13.204 align:middle line:84%
But they cannot feel
the suffering

00:46:13.204 --> 00:46:17.242 align:middle line:84%
that their model causes
upon the rest of the earth.

00:46:17.242 --> 00:46:18.910 align:middle line:90%
They don't -- they see it.

00:46:18.910 --> 00:46:23.414 align:middle line:84%
They think it's for the good but
they're limited in their sight,

00:46:23.414 --> 00:46:25.817 align:middle line:84%
which is one of the
reasons they were appointed

00:46:25.817 --> 00:46:27.886 align:middle line:90%
to come to the America's.

00:46:27.886 --> 00:46:30.555 align:middle line:84%
So that they could
begin to learn to feel.

00:46:30.555 --> 00:46:33.057 align:middle line:84%
So on a mass psycho-spiritual
level...

00:46:33.057 --> 00:46:34.459 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:46:34.459 --> 00:46:37.295 align:middle line:84%
...the incarnations of some --
I mean a huge majority of people

00:46:37.295 --> 00:46:40.698 align:middle line:84%
that are in America now coming
from Europe was to be able

00:46:40.698 --> 00:46:41.833 align:middle line:90%
on a spiritual level

00:46:41.833 --> 00:46:44.669 align:middle line:84%
to integrate the vision
then with the feeling.

00:46:44.669 --> 00:46:46.037 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: It's
divinely appointed...

00:46:46.037 --> 00:46:47.305 align:middle line:90%
Okay. Ray Tarpey: ...migration.

00:46:47.305 --> 00:46:49.240 align:middle line:84%
Okay. Ray Tarpey: So
when I mention this

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:53.444 align:middle line:84%
to American Indian -- because
everything is invitation.

00:46:53.444 --> 00:46:59.484 align:middle line:84%
I said to one American Indian,
I said, "You invited them here."

00:46:59.484 --> 00:47:02.053 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at
me, glared at me,

00:47:02.053 --> 00:47:03.855 align:middle line:90%
"We invited them [laughter]?"

00:47:03.855 --> 00:47:06.858 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't make sense
in a suffering phase.

00:47:06.858 --> 00:47:10.128 align:middle line:90%
Yes. Ray Tarpey: And I explained

00:47:10.128 --> 00:47:15.400 align:middle line:84%
to him what my research has
showed is this whole universe;

00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:18.569 align:middle line:84%
this dense world
of matter is based

00:47:18.569 --> 00:47:21.539 align:middle line:90%
on the principle of sacrifice.

00:47:21.539 --> 00:47:25.977 align:middle line:84%
One being sacrifices
completely to the other.

00:47:25.977 --> 00:47:28.046 align:middle line:90%
The food chain.

00:47:28.046 --> 00:47:30.181 align:middle line:90%
It's built on that.

00:47:30.181 --> 00:47:34.819 align:middle line:84%
And so that's just one of
the sacrifices called for

00:47:34.819 --> 00:47:40.892 align:middle line:84%
and in our spiritual realm part
of us has agreed by contract

00:47:40.892 --> 00:47:43.494 align:middle line:90%
to come in again to do that.

00:47:43.494 --> 00:47:45.997 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Ray Tarpey: That
precise sacrifice.

00:47:45.997 --> 00:47:49.067 align:middle line:84%
That's why the fall
of us is so important.

00:47:49.067 --> 00:47:54.172 align:middle line:84%
Okay now you talked about the
Lemurian which is the sense

00:47:54.172 --> 00:47:55.740 align:middle line:90%
of -- the scent of smell.

00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:57.108 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:47:57.108 --> 00:48:00.545 align:middle line:84%
And then we have the American
Atlantean which is feeling.

00:48:00.545 --> 00:48:01.546 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Feeling.

00:48:01.546 --> 00:48:03.414 align:middle line:84%
Then we have the
European which is sight.

00:48:03.414 --> 00:48:04.849 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Sense of sight.

00:48:04.849 --> 00:48:06.651 align:middle line:84%
Now what about the
sense of sound?

00:48:06.651 --> 00:48:07.819 align:middle line:84%
What about the African
continent?

00:48:07.819 --> 00:48:10.321 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: Sense of
sound is the Gobi Desert.

00:48:10.321 --> 00:48:11.022 align:middle line:90%
Gobi Desert.

00:48:11.022 --> 00:48:12.390 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: The Chinese.

00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:13.758 align:middle line:84%
Okay. Ray Tarpey: That's why
they have the tonal language.

00:48:13.758 --> 00:48:14.559 align:middle line:90%
It fits. Okay.

00:48:14.559 --> 00:48:15.226 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:48:15.226 --> 00:48:16.194 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: It fits.

00:48:16.194 --> 00:48:18.529 align:middle line:90%
And their ear is acute.

00:48:18.529 --> 00:48:21.165 align:middle line:84%
They can experience the
design through their --

00:48:21.165 --> 00:48:23.001 align:middle line:90%
through the sense of hearing.

00:48:23.001 --> 00:48:26.037 align:middle line:84%
What -- now what -- where does
African continent come in?

00:48:26.037 --> 00:48:27.839 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: The African
continent has

00:48:27.839 --> 00:48:29.774 align:middle line:90%
to do with the blackness.

00:48:29.774 --> 00:48:30.942 align:middle line:90%
It's not racial.

00:48:30.942 --> 00:48:32.543 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Ray Tarpey:
It is racial --

00:48:32.543 --> 00:48:36.180 align:middle line:84%
it's just an outcome of
the beautiful resonance

00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:38.549 align:middle line:84%
that they have in
the spirit realm.

00:48:38.549 --> 00:48:43.221 align:middle line:84%
The color describes a resonance
and it's the sense of taste.

00:48:43.221 --> 00:48:45.890 align:middle line:84%
Okay. Ray Tarpey: I'm still
doing my researches on that...

00:48:45.890 --> 00:48:48.626 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Ray Tarpey: So I won't talk
to you about that right now.

00:48:48.626 --> 00:48:50.795 align:middle line:84%
But I found it in
their ancient records.

00:48:50.795 --> 00:48:53.965 align:middle line:84%
Okay and then we talked
-- we start hearing the --

00:48:53.965 --> 00:48:56.768 align:middle line:84%
of the many people watching
this know of some of the legends

00:48:56.768 --> 00:49:01.939 align:middle line:84%
that people such as [foreign
word] and now Michael Salinger

00:49:01.939 --> 00:49:04.509 align:middle line:84%
and others talk about
regarding the peopling

00:49:04.509 --> 00:49:09.113 align:middle line:84%
of the African continent about
500,000 years ago at the hand

00:49:09.113 --> 00:49:12.483 align:middle line:84%
of the Nepaline or another
group of beings that...

00:49:12.483 --> 00:49:13.184 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: The giants.

00:49:13.184 --> 00:49:13.751 align:middle line:90%
The giants.

00:49:13.751 --> 00:49:14.552 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:49:14.552 --> 00:49:15.620 align:middle line:90%
That engineered a species...

00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:16.554 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:49:16.554 --> 00:49:17.755 align:middle line:90%
...for the purposes of work.

00:49:17.755 --> 00:49:18.523 align:middle line:90%
But you can look at it again...

00:49:18.523 --> 00:49:19.557 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:49:19.557 --> 00:49:20.691 align:middle line:84%
...if you look at it
as the Law of One.

00:49:20.691 --> 00:49:23.394 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps, you know, an
upgrade or a simple...

00:49:23.394 --> 00:49:24.529 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:49:24.529 --> 00:49:25.697 align:middle line:84%
...change to what was
happening at the time.

00:49:25.697 --> 00:49:26.631 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:49:26.631 --> 00:49:27.732 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:49:27.732 --> 00:49:28.533 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: In Greek
history the same thing.

00:49:28.533 --> 00:49:29.333 align:middle line:90%
Yes. Ray Tarpey: The Titans.

00:49:29.333 --> 00:49:30.701 align:middle line:90%
The Titans yes.

00:49:30.701 --> 00:49:32.370 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: And they're the
new ear formed by the Olympians

00:49:32.370 --> 00:49:35.640 align:middle line:84%
and thus the leader who was
one of the sons of the Titans

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:37.909 align:middle line:90%
that Ra -- Ra hid away from him.

00:49:37.909 --> 00:49:39.010 align:middle line:90%
Yes. Ray Tarpey: In a cave.

00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:41.813 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Ray Tarpey: And
he organized a revolt

00:49:41.813 --> 00:49:46.684 align:middle line:84%
of the other sons and
daughters of the Titans

00:49:46.684 --> 00:49:48.686 align:middle line:84%
and then they overthrew
the Titans.

00:49:48.686 --> 00:49:50.621 align:middle line:84%
So the same story
reverberates...

00:49:50.621 --> 00:49:51.456 align:middle line:90%
Over and over.

00:49:51.456 --> 00:49:52.290 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: ...around the world.

00:49:52.290 --> 00:49:53.257 align:middle line:90%
Yes. Ray Tarpey: It gets around

00:49:53.257 --> 00:49:54.225 align:middle line:84%
and that's what we're
looking for.

00:49:54.225 --> 00:49:55.626 align:middle line:90%
Yes is those connecting points.

00:49:55.626 --> 00:49:57.061 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: We're looking for
that ancient memory but we have

00:49:57.061 --> 00:50:00.264 align:middle line:84%
to beware of making
it the same story.

00:50:00.264 --> 00:50:02.266 align:middle line:84%
Right. Ray Tarpey: There
are different theaters.

00:50:02.266 --> 00:50:03.634 align:middle line:90%
Right. Yes.

00:50:03.634 --> 00:50:06.804 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: And different things
can occur on different parts

00:50:06.804 --> 00:50:10.641 align:middle line:84%
of the earth because it is
magical and it is mysterious

00:50:10.641 --> 00:50:13.211 align:middle line:84%
and our mind does not
comprehend it at this time

00:50:13.211 --> 00:50:15.713 align:middle line:90%
and science is just beginning.

00:50:15.713 --> 00:50:17.615 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
the Mayan version...

00:50:17.615 --> 00:50:18.249 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Okay.

00:50:18.249 --> 00:50:18.883 align:middle line:90%
...of the origins.

00:50:18.883 --> 00:50:19.984 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yeah.

00:50:19.984 --> 00:50:20.785 align:middle line:84%
This is an area that
you're familiar with.

00:50:20.785 --> 00:50:22.053 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes [laughter].

00:50:22.053 --> 00:50:23.921 align:middle line:84%
Very. Ray Tarpey: They got
me started through China.

00:50:23.921 --> 00:50:25.323 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. Ray Tarpey: That's -- I --

00:50:25.323 --> 00:50:28.626 align:middle line:84%
when I did, we did our first
interview I told you I came

00:50:28.626 --> 00:50:31.329 align:middle line:84%
into this because I came
in with the Asian eye.

00:50:31.329 --> 00:50:34.198 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Ray Tarpey: And
it suited because I had

00:50:34.198 --> 00:50:35.867 align:middle line:90%
to see China in the Maya.

00:50:35.867 --> 00:50:38.503 align:middle line:84%
I had to see that
they esteemed jade

00:50:38.503 --> 00:50:41.005 align:middle line:84%
above gold just as
the Chinese do.

00:50:41.005 --> 00:50:43.708 align:middle line:84%
That they have a symbol
of the Goddess of the Moon

00:50:43.708 --> 00:50:46.277 align:middle line:84%
and a rabbit just
as the Chinese do.

00:50:46.277 --> 00:50:50.181 align:middle line:84%
And me perplexed how
is this possible?

00:50:50.181 --> 00:50:51.549 align:middle line:90%
This is too much.

00:50:51.549 --> 00:50:54.819 align:middle line:84%
And many, many other things
that we won't have time to go

00:50:54.819 --> 00:50:59.257 align:middle line:84%
into here that I mentioned,
that perhaps I mentioned

00:50:59.257 --> 00:51:00.358 align:middle line:90%
in the last interview but...

00:51:00.358 --> 00:51:03.127 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about their myth.

00:51:03.127 --> 00:51:04.162 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Right.

00:51:04.162 --> 00:51:05.096 align:middle line:84%
Their mythology regarding
the origins.

00:51:05.096 --> 00:51:06.497 align:middle line:90%
Ray: Right.

00:51:06.497 --> 00:51:08.833 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: And so I began to
look at their myth and I began

00:51:08.833 --> 00:51:13.337 align:middle line:84%
to go to Edgar Casey so I could
see beyond the mainstream myths

00:51:13.337 --> 00:51:16.774 align:middle line:84%
of the [foreign word]
as the soul source

00:51:16.774 --> 00:51:21.612 align:middle line:84%
of the Asian presence
here in the Americas.

00:51:21.612 --> 00:51:23.514 align:middle line:90%
That the land bridge theory,

00:51:23.514 --> 00:51:26.150 align:middle line:84%
that all the American
Indians came across.

00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:28.853 align:middle line:84%
Where Edgar Casey was saying
there were these Asian

00:51:28.853 --> 00:51:33.658 align:middle line:84%
continents of Mu Lemuria in
the Pacific, and the Atlantis

00:51:33.658 --> 00:51:37.361 align:middle line:84%
in the Atlantic, with Maya
right at the crossroads.

00:51:37.361 --> 00:51:39.964 align:middle line:84%
The Maya were right
directly in-between them

00:51:39.964 --> 00:51:42.099 align:middle line:90%
with the thin piece of land.

00:51:42.099 --> 00:51:43.301 align:middle line:90%
So they became...

00:51:43.301 --> 00:51:44.669 align:middle line:84%
So did they get migrations
from both directions?

00:51:44.669 --> 00:51:45.503 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: They got them both.

00:51:45.503 --> 00:51:46.837 align:middle line:90%
They got both characters.

00:51:46.837 --> 00:51:51.042 align:middle line:84%
So my job became
finding the Lemuria layer

00:51:51.042 --> 00:51:54.845 align:middle line:84%
and the Atlantean layer in the
culture, within the culture,

00:51:54.845 --> 00:51:56.647 align:middle line:90%
that we call the Maya.

00:51:56.647 --> 00:51:58.616 align:middle line:90%
And I found it in their story,

00:51:58.616 --> 00:52:00.251 align:middle line:84%
their creation story,
the [foreign word].

00:52:00.251 --> 00:52:04.088 align:middle line:84%
Which is the great thing
that was allowed to come

00:52:04.088 --> 00:52:07.191 align:middle line:84%
through which was put
together by the shamans

00:52:07.191 --> 00:52:11.896 align:middle line:84%
who wrote it anonymously
because they risked their necks

00:52:11.896 --> 00:52:14.565 align:middle line:84%
to produce it during the
time of the conquest.

00:52:14.565 --> 00:52:17.034 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Ray Tarpey: And they
said -- in their they said,

00:52:17.034 --> 00:52:19.270 align:middle line:84%
"Let it be said,
let the light --

00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:22.907 align:middle line:84%
that the ancient light
come through in the time

00:52:22.907 --> 00:52:26.444 align:middle line:84%
of the Christian
domination of our land.

00:52:26.444 --> 00:52:28.145 align:middle line:90%
Let their be one record."

00:52:28.145 --> 00:52:32.149 align:middle line:84%
And it's a miracle but it's
intended, it's an infusion,

00:52:32.149 --> 00:52:36.187 align:middle line:84%
it's a help that was
given to the humans

00:52:36.187 --> 00:52:39.757 align:middle line:90%
from the Christ's that came.

00:52:39.757 --> 00:52:41.892 align:middle line:84%
So what does that
story look like?

00:52:41.892 --> 00:52:43.194 align:middle line:84%
We only have about
five minutes left.

00:52:43.194 --> 00:52:44.262 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Oh yeah.

00:52:44.262 --> 00:52:46.030 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell that
story in five minutes?

00:52:46.030 --> 00:52:51.569 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: It's a story
of the progress from --

00:52:51.569 --> 00:52:55.706 align:middle line:84%
it's a story of ancient
contracts first.

00:52:55.706 --> 00:52:57.475 align:middle line:90%
They talk about the --

00:52:57.475 --> 00:53:01.746 align:middle line:84%
we are presently in the fourth
creation according to the Maya.

00:53:01.746 --> 00:53:03.614 align:middle line:90%
And it agrees with Edgar Casey.

00:53:03.614 --> 00:53:04.682 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:53:04.682 --> 00:53:08.886 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: In the
first instance it was --

00:53:08.886 --> 00:53:10.921 align:middle line:90%
the plans were created.

00:53:10.921 --> 00:53:14.292 align:middle line:84%
And I call that the
zero production.

00:53:14.292 --> 00:53:17.161 align:middle line:84%
Because the plants
are the most aligned.

00:53:17.161 --> 00:53:19.030 align:middle line:84%
They were the guardians
of the earth

00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:21.032 align:middle line:90%
and that was the first creation.

00:53:21.032 --> 00:53:27.004 align:middle line:84%
The second guardian creation
was that of the animals.

00:53:27.004 --> 00:53:30.574 align:middle line:84%
And it worked for a while
but it depends on --

00:53:30.574 --> 00:53:33.911 align:middle line:84%
because animals are
equal to us and according

00:53:33.911 --> 00:53:37.682 align:middle line:84%
to the American Indian even
more intelligent than we are,

00:53:37.682 --> 00:53:39.183 align:middle line:84%
because they've been
here longer.

00:53:39.183 --> 00:53:43.654 align:middle line:84%
So that unseats a lot that
goes on in the white place.

00:53:43.654 --> 00:53:48.359 align:middle line:84%
The red place feels the animals
and their intelligence much more

00:53:48.359 --> 00:53:50.294 align:middle line:90%
than the white place can.

00:53:50.294 --> 00:53:54.632 align:middle line:84%
The white place used to do
it in Egypt and in Babylonia

00:53:54.632 --> 00:53:57.168 align:middle line:84%
but that was all cut out
of their sacred books

00:53:57.168 --> 00:54:01.806 align:middle line:84%
and all the animals were
taken out of the new books

00:54:01.806 --> 00:54:04.375 align:middle line:84%
that they use in the
present civilization.

00:54:04.375 --> 00:54:07.011 align:middle line:84%
So all animals have
nothing to do with it.

00:54:07.011 --> 00:54:09.046 align:middle line:84%
We simply have dominion
over there.

00:54:09.046 --> 00:54:12.650 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Ray Tarpey: And so the
animals though refuse to talk.

00:54:12.650 --> 00:54:15.486 align:middle line:84%
They refuse to fulfill
their contract

00:54:15.486 --> 00:54:18.255 align:middle line:84%
and so they have to
sacrifice and go.

00:54:18.255 --> 00:54:23.127 align:middle line:84%
So as part of their ancient
contract they gave up to us

00:54:23.127 --> 00:54:28.132 align:middle line:84%
and their destiny is aligned
with ours by ancient contract.

00:54:28.132 --> 00:54:32.336 align:middle line:84%
And so it is that we were
allowed to eat their meat.

00:54:32.336 --> 00:54:35.139 align:middle line:84%
What greater sacrifice
could you have?

00:54:35.139 --> 00:54:37.708 align:middle line:90%
And they agreed to this.

00:54:37.708 --> 00:54:40.644 align:middle line:84%
And that's why when the Indian
goes into the sweat bath

00:54:40.644 --> 00:54:45.249 align:middle line:84%
and purifies himself he knows
that the animal will come to him

00:54:45.249 --> 00:54:46.851 align:middle line:90%
because it's contract.

00:54:46.851 --> 00:54:48.853 align:middle line:90%
But we have to deserve it.

00:54:48.853 --> 00:54:52.857 align:middle line:84%
And the Spaniards who first
came watched the Indians hunt

00:54:52.857 --> 00:54:54.258 align:middle line:90%
and observed it.

00:54:54.258 --> 00:54:55.826 align:middle line:90%
We have the record of it.

00:54:55.826 --> 00:54:57.294 align:middle line:90%
So that is the second level?

00:54:57.294 --> 00:54:58.496 align:middle line:90%
The animals.

00:54:58.496 --> 00:55:00.998 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: Yes and the
third level is Mu Lumeria,

00:55:00.998 --> 00:55:02.366 align:middle line:90%
the mud people.

00:55:02.366 --> 00:55:07.838 align:middle line:84%
And this was a sort of a
humanoid anthropoid realm

00:55:07.838 --> 00:55:11.709 align:middle line:84%
in its first instances with
a combination of animals,

00:55:11.709 --> 00:55:14.278 align:middle line:84%
and plants, and all
sorts of things

00:55:14.278 --> 00:55:15.980 align:middle line:90%
and it lasted a long time.

00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:18.416 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't give you the time
but its millions of years.

00:55:18.416 --> 00:55:23.287 align:middle line:84%
Yes, yes. Ray Tarpey: And that
was the first implantation

00:55:23.287 --> 00:55:26.090 align:middle line:90%
of what we would call humanoid.

00:55:26.090 --> 00:55:29.293 align:middle line:84%
And what we know as humanoid
would be at the 10 --

00:55:29.293 --> 00:55:32.329 align:middle line:84%
so far the 10 million year
frame but it's going to change.

00:55:32.329 --> 00:55:34.398 align:middle line:84%
Right. Ray Tarpey: It's
all that is all juts based

00:55:34.398 --> 00:55:36.500 align:middle line:90%
on our histories, our research.

00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:37.568 align:middle line:90%
So then the fourth level.

00:55:37.568 --> 00:55:40.871 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: And the
fourth level is us.

00:55:40.871 --> 00:55:45.009 align:middle line:84%
We are in the fourth -- because
we were willing to use speech.

00:55:45.009 --> 00:55:48.245 align:middle line:84%
And you say the animals
refuse that contract?

00:55:48.245 --> 00:55:51.849 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: They refuse to
talk beyond their own species.

00:55:51.849 --> 00:55:53.851 align:middle line:90%
They refuse to unite.

00:55:53.851 --> 00:55:57.021 align:middle line:84%
Because incarnation's
a shock to all of us.

00:55:57.021 --> 00:55:58.656 align:middle line:90%
Now what we remember to do --

00:55:58.656 --> 00:56:02.092 align:middle line:84%
what we were assigned to do
is not what we're going to do

00:56:02.092 --> 00:56:05.729 align:middle line:84%
when we go through the
shock portal of incarnation.

00:56:05.729 --> 00:56:06.864 align:middle line:90%
They wouldn't.

00:56:06.864 --> 00:56:09.166 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Ray Tarpey: It was
kind of a disobedience,

00:56:09.166 --> 00:56:11.202 align:middle line:90%
it's a kind of loss of memory.

00:56:11.202 --> 00:56:14.638 align:middle line:84%
Contracts are made and many
of our lifetimes are --

00:56:14.638 --> 00:56:19.009 align:middle line:84%
we don't fulfill what we came in
to do so we need another sojourn

00:56:19.009 --> 00:56:24.381 align:middle line:84%
on Mars or Venus, a
little therapy there for us

00:56:24.381 --> 00:56:26.083 align:middle line:90%
to come back into the --

00:56:26.083 --> 00:56:27.985 align:middle line:84%
what Casey called
the laboratorial --

00:56:27.985 --> 00:56:29.086 align:middle line:90%
the laboratory earth.

00:56:29.086 --> 00:56:30.154 align:middle line:90%
[Inaudible].

00:56:30.154 --> 00:56:31.589 align:middle line:84%
So the humans are
fulfilling the contract

00:56:31.589 --> 00:56:33.357 align:middle line:90%
by the simple element of speech?

00:56:33.357 --> 00:56:34.358 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Speech.

00:56:34.358 --> 00:56:35.793 align:middle line:84%
Which is designed
ideally to unite?

00:56:35.793 --> 00:56:37.394 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: Which we
are doing right now.

00:56:37.394 --> 00:56:38.529 align:middle line:90%
Yes. Ray Tarpey:

00:56:38.529 --> 00:56:40.264 align:middle line:84%
We're accomplishing what
we're supposed to do.

00:56:40.264 --> 00:56:42.533 align:middle line:84%
Okay. Now we have a
couple minutes left here.

00:56:42.533 --> 00:56:44.835 align:middle line:84%
The reality is very hard to
piece all of this together.

00:56:44.835 --> 00:56:45.970 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: I know.

00:56:45.970 --> 00:56:47.304 align:middle line:84%
Unless -- you've only
scratched the surface.

00:56:47.304 --> 00:56:50.608 align:middle line:84%
You could talk for 24 hours
straight on these subjects.

00:56:50.608 --> 00:56:51.976 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: I'm writing
a book now so...

00:56:51.976 --> 00:56:54.178 align:middle line:84%
Okay. Ray Tarpey: My
wife is getting --

00:56:54.178 --> 00:56:55.579 align:middle line:84%
kicking me now to get
it done [laughter]

00:56:55.579 --> 00:56:56.981 align:middle line:90%
so it'll be coming out soon.

00:56:56.981 --> 00:56:58.883 align:middle line:84%
What you've given us, you've
scratched the surface.

00:56:58.883 --> 00:56:59.583 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:56:59.583 --> 00:57:00.484 align:middle line:90%
We've got a little...

00:57:00.484 --> 00:57:01.318 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:57:01.318 --> 00:57:04.388 align:middle line:90%
...bit of an idea of the reach.

00:57:04.388 --> 00:57:07.191 align:middle line:84%
I mean the incredibly
variable reach...

00:57:07.191 --> 00:57:08.125 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Right.

00:57:08.125 --> 00:57:09.627 align:middle line:84%
...into ourselves,
into the past.

00:57:09.627 --> 00:57:11.428 align:middle line:84%
And as you say it's
not a consistent story.

00:57:11.428 --> 00:57:13.197 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: It has
to make sense though.

00:57:13.197 --> 00:57:14.899 align:middle line:84%
But we've seen it at
different times everywhere.

00:57:14.899 --> 00:57:16.534 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: It has to be simple.

00:57:16.534 --> 00:57:18.569 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Ray Tarpey: And
it has to make sense.

00:57:18.569 --> 00:57:20.271 align:middle line:84%
And it has to be made such
sense because I'm used

00:57:20.271 --> 00:57:22.606 align:middle line:90%
to talking to children.

00:57:22.606 --> 00:57:24.308 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Ray Tarpey: And
this generation is raised

00:57:24.308 --> 00:57:25.309 align:middle line:90%
on the internet.

00:57:25.309 --> 00:57:28.045 align:middle line:84%
I have an easier
time talking to them.

00:57:28.045 --> 00:57:31.115 align:middle line:84%
I thought they were
not focused [laughter].

00:57:31.115 --> 00:57:33.017 align:middle line:84%
I thought "Oh, they're
not studying."

00:57:33.017 --> 00:57:35.319 align:middle line:84%
But no, there's another
advantage.

00:57:35.319 --> 00:57:39.223 align:middle line:84%
They have an exposure that
the older people don't have.

00:57:39.223 --> 00:57:40.291 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:57:40.291 --> 00:57:42.192 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: And they
don't argue with me.

00:57:42.192 --> 00:57:45.763 align:middle line:84%
They -- their horizons
are wider so they're --

00:57:45.763 --> 00:57:46.964 align:middle line:84%
the things that are
being done for us...

00:57:46.964 --> 00:57:49.533 align:middle line:84%
And you really encourage
them to open their mind...

00:57:49.533 --> 00:57:50.234 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:57:50.234 --> 00:57:50.801 align:middle line:90%
...to all new thought.

00:57:50.801 --> 00:57:51.802 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Yes.

00:57:51.802 --> 00:57:52.870 align:middle line:84%
And one of the problems
has also been --

00:57:52.870 --> 00:57:55.005 align:middle line:84%
we just have a few
seconds left really --

00:57:55.005 --> 00:57:58.275 align:middle line:84%
that the bodies of information
that were left for us many

00:57:58.275 --> 00:58:01.645 align:middle line:84%
of them as you say in
China as in the Library

00:58:01.645 --> 00:58:03.013 align:middle line:90%
of Alexandria were burned.

00:58:03.013 --> 00:58:05.449 align:middle line:84%
Ray Tarpey: But culture
can never be destroyed.

00:58:05.449 --> 00:58:07.618 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Ray Tarpey:
We will find it.

00:58:07.618 --> 00:58:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And the [foreign word]
is there to help us.

00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:13.691 align:middle line:84%
Because as we read we will
get insights unbelievable.

00:58:13.691 --> 00:58:17.394 align:middle line:84%
As we channel we will get
insights unbelievable.

00:58:17.394 --> 00:58:18.729 align:middle line:90%
To be continued.

00:58:18.729 --> 00:58:21.765 align:middle line:84%
We're going to carry this
conversation beyond Mu Lumeria.

00:58:21.765 --> 00:58:23.000 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Oh good.

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:26.537 align:middle line:84%
Beyond the Maya, beyond
the Japanese into Atlantis.

00:58:26.537 --> 00:58:30.040 align:middle line:84%
Because many of us here now
are here because of that time.

00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:30.975 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: That's right.

00:58:30.975 --> 00:58:32.109 align:middle line:90%
So thank you very much.

00:58:32.109 --> 00:58:32.943 align:middle line:90%
Ray Tarpey: Thank you.

00:58:32.943 --> 00:58:34.411 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:58:34.411 --> 00:58:36.580 align:middle line:84%
This topic never
ceases to fascinate me.

00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:39.416 align:middle line:84%
I hope you've found some real
intrigue in this, as well.

00:58:39.416 --> 00:58:42.219 align:middle line:84%
As Raymond says, "It's not
for us to attach to a version

00:58:42.219 --> 00:58:45.055 align:middle line:84%
of the truth; rather to
open to all new thought.

00:58:45.055 --> 00:58:47.091 align:middle line:90%
To live in a state of wonder."

00:58:47.091 --> 00:58:49.426 align:middle line:84%
In our next conversation as
just mentioned we'll speak

00:58:49.426 --> 00:58:51.595 align:middle line:84%
about the lost continent
of Atlantis.

00:58:51.595 --> 00:58:56.266 align:middle line:84%
Until next time thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.

00:58:56.266 --> 00:59:15.786 align:middle line:90%
