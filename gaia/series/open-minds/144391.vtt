>>REGINA MEREDITH: We're
all familiar with the notion

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.049 align:middle line:10%
that we've been
manipulated as a society.

Eldon Taylor's new
book, "Gotcha,"

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.960 align:middle line:10%
attempts to help you
find yourself amidst

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.965 align:middle line:10%
the misinformation by peeling
back all that you are not,

00:00:38.965 --> 00:00:41.090 align:middle line:10%
and I think that was the
term in the book-- peeling

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.585 align:middle line:10%
back all that you are not.

00:00:42.585 --> 00:00:43.460 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDON TAYLOR: True.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you know,
first of all, let's start

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.790 align:middle line:90%
with the foreword of the book.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.330 align:middle line:84%
Your wife is saying, you've
been spending all this time

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.190 align:middle line:84%
in self-help for
all these years.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.329 align:middle line:84%
What made you go the
direction of conspiracy?

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:57.870 align:middle line:10%
>>TAYLOR: You know, and I don't
consider it to be conspiracy,

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.530 align:middle line:10%
so I would correct that some.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.160 align:middle line:10%
There's a lot of talk
about tinfoil hats,

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.920 align:middle line:10%
and that's itself a
manipulation mechanism.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.080 align:middle line:90%
Let me give you a case in point.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.120 align:middle line:84%
We have officials from
the CIA and the NSA,

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.670 align:middle line:84%
and they testified before
Congress that they would never

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.380 align:middle line:90%
use or spy upon Americans.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.530 align:middle line:84%
Then Snowden comes out, and we
discovered, no, they both lied,

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.557 align:middle line:84%
that, indeed, that's
exactly what they're doing.

00:01:30.557 --> 00:01:31.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course, yeah.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.220 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: We
recently had Vault7,

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.200 align:middle line:84%
and we discovered
that the CIA has

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.260 align:middle line:84%
all sorts of devices
they can use to spy

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.850 align:middle line:90%
on everything that we do.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.270 align:middle line:84%
Your Samsung television
is watching you.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.330 align:middle line:84%
Your smartphone is
following everything you do,

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.750 align:middle line:90%
picking up all your email.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.740 align:middle line:84%
They can remote control
your automobile.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.650 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: OK?

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you look at
that, is that a conspiracy

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.904 align:middle line:84%
theory, or was that a factual
statement that was made--

00:02:04.904 --> 00:02:06.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with you--

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.470 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: That it took
us time to catch up to--

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Embrace.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.710 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Right.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.001 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean there was
a saying that I really like.

00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:14.840 align:middle line:84%
It said "a better term
for conspiracy theory

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.340 align:middle line:84%
is unspeakable truths,"
and I happen to like that.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.140 align:middle line:90%
That's my favorite.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.500 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: I agree.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We know they're true.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm just kind of
throwing it, and maybe I

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.840 align:middle line:84%
should choose my
words more carefully.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.460 align:middle line:84%
Conspiracy theory--
no, it's not.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.160 align:middle line:84%
These unspeakable
truths-- what made

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.460 align:middle line:84%
you turn to an interest in
these unspeakable truths?

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And you need to
know also-- and I'm

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.032 align:middle line:84%
sure you do-- my audience is
aware of virtually all of them,

00:02:36.032 --> 00:02:38.240 align:middle line:84%
and I've done in-depth
interviews on almost every one

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.350 align:middle line:90%
of them already.

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And so they're familiar
with that body of knowledge.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.770 align:middle line:84%
What made you turn to
that body of knowledge?

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.410 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: I don't
see it as a turn.

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.580 align:middle line:84%
What I see is I've spent my
career trying to understand

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.270 align:middle line:90%
why people do what people do.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.910 align:middle line:84%
As you know, I was a practicing
criminalist for many years,

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.080 align:middle line:84%
so my typical day was made up
of running lie detection tests

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.010 align:middle line:84%
or conducting a forensic
hypnosis session

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.760 align:middle line:90%
or supervising an investigation.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And I would repeatedly hear
people use rationalizations

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.670 align:middle line:84%
as to why they did
what they did that just

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.660 align:middle line:90%
didn't make any real sense.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.450 align:middle line:90%
I remember one case.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.710 align:middle line:90%
This was a young fellow.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.430 align:middle line:84%
He was tall, good-looking, from
a good family, had everything

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.740 align:middle line:84%
in the world going for him,
had a very pretty wife.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.610 align:middle line:84%
They had a baby that
was due to come,

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.210 align:middle line:84%
and he decided that it
was his fatherly role

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.690 align:middle line:84%
to fix a nursery
up for the child.

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.670 align:middle line:84%
So he stole lumber
from his employer.

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.610 align:middle line:84%
I picked him up in a
lie detection test.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.320 align:middle line:84%
We ultimately got
the confession,

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.750 align:middle line:84%
and I heard this story
that, well, you know,

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.050 align:middle line:84%
the home that we're living
in doesn't have a nursery.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.360 align:middle line:84%
It's not large enough, so
I went into the basement,

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.670 align:middle line:84%
and I stole this
lumber, so I could

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.320 align:middle line:90%
build a nursery for my child.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.310 align:middle line:84%
I just felt that I owed that
to my wife and my unborn child.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.010 align:middle line:84%
Now where I can
sympathize and even

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.150 align:middle line:84%
empathize with that
rationalization,

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.900 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't make any real sense.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.470 align:middle line:90%
The man gave up his life.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:16.880 align:middle line:90%
He became a felon.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.550 align:middle line:90%
He lost his right to vote.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:24.170 align:middle line:84%
Think of the impact of that
decision, that process.

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.020 align:middle line:84%
What makes people
do what they do?

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.840 align:middle line:84%
To me, self-help is
about understanding

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:36.050 align:middle line:84%
who we are, becoming authentic
about how we live, what

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.340 align:middle line:90%
we believe, why we believe it.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And it became clear to me
over the years of research,

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:44.930 align:middle line:90%
more than approaching--

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm dating myself
now-- but approaching

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.180 align:middle line:84%
40 years of research,
it became clear to me

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.720 align:middle line:84%
that people didn't understand
that for all intent

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.320 align:middle line:84%
and purposes, it's our
subconscious mind that's

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.920 align:middle line:84%
motivating, that's priming
everything they do.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.670 align:middle line:84%
In fact, today we
take FMRI studies,

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.470 align:middle line:90%
and we watch the brain lifetime.

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And if I were to
give you a problem,

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.420 align:middle line:84%
let's say the problem,
Regina, was a paragraph long.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And I gave you a button for
your right hand and a button

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.330 align:middle line:84%
for your left hand to indicate
A or B or true or false,

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.656 align:middle line:84%
depending on the
nature of the question.

00:05:25.656 --> 00:05:31.110 align:middle line:84%
An MRI technician watching you
make your decision on average

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:36.230 align:middle line:84%
will know six seconds before you
do what you're going to decide.

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:39.990 align:middle line:84%
That ought to cause everyone
great pause right there.

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.230 align:middle line:84%
Six seconds before you know
what you're going to do,

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.140 align:middle line:84%
a technician watching
your brain will know

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.450 align:middle line:90%
what you're going to choose.

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That
actually makes sense.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.100 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Which button
you're going to push.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.610 align:middle line:84%
So it becomes incumbent
upon each of us

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.550 align:middle line:84%
to explore what's in
our own unconscious.

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.030 align:middle line:10%
I mean, the fact of the
matter is Benjamin Libet,

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:06.050 align:middle line:10%
years ago, utilizing
multi-cranial EEG, witnessed

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.800 align:middle line:10%
the so-called P300 wave, the
cortical evoked response,

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.340 align:middle line:10%
occurring in areas of the
brain known to be unconscious

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.440 align:middle line:10%
and theorized that before
there is any conscious action,

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.720 align:middle line:10%
we get this P300
wave that indicates

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.290 align:middle line:10%
we have action out of the
unconscious predisposing that.

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:29.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, FMRI studies,
as I said, clearly

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:32.460 align:middle line:84%
demonstrate that
to be the truth.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.070 align:middle line:84%
But the work of Libet started
this whole conversation

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:36.810 align:middle line:90%
about free will.

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.320 align:middle line:84%
If what's going
on, if what we do,

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.470 align:middle line:84%
if what we believe, if what
we think, if all of that,

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:47.160 align:middle line:84%
including our motor
movements, occurs initially

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.250 align:middle line:84%
in the unconscious,
what is free will?

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:51.870 align:middle line:90%
Do we have free will?

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, most scientists
today would say no.

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:56.169 align:middle line:90%
It's a grand illusion.

00:06:56.169 --> 00:06:58.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They would if they're
looking at it from a material

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.084 align:middle line:84%
science point of
view, of course,

00:07:00.084 --> 00:07:02.150 align:middle line:84%
but not if you're
looking beyond that.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:03.090 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Well, I'm not
going to disagree with that.

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:04.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It makes
perfect sense.

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:04.710 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: But--

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:06.918 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you can't look
at the brain and the way

00:07:06.918 --> 00:07:09.090 align:middle line:84%
the mind works from a
materialistic point of view,

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:11.040 align:middle line:84%
from a scientific
materialism point of view.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.060 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.393 align:middle line:84%
That's why all the conundrums,
why they don't understand

00:07:14.393 --> 00:07:16.290 align:middle line:90%
anything about the brain yet.

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:20.100 align:middle line:84%
If they understood it more as
a processing unit for a larger

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.330 align:middle line:84%
body that is feeding it, then
you have something different

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.260 align:middle line:90%
called the subconscious mind.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:26.540 align:middle line:90%
You can't map it.

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:27.340 align:middle line:90%
They can't map it.

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:30.090 align:middle line:84%
There's no material way to
map the way the whole mind is

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:33.060 align:middle line:84%
actually working
through the brain.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:35.190 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the big
problem, which, of course,

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:35.900 align:middle line:90%
there would be a delay.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.050 align:middle line:84%
You could see a brain center
light up, for example,

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:39.257 align:middle line:90%
in advance of a response.

00:07:39.257 --> 00:07:41.340 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: See, now I don't
disagree that the brain

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:42.542 align:middle line:90%
is the ultimate frontier.

00:07:42.542 --> 00:07:43.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, it's not.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.810 align:middle line:90%
The mind is, but not the brain.

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.600 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: I do agree that mind
is greater than the brain.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:52.730 align:middle line:84%
We have action of
mind at a distance.

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:54.490 align:middle line:84%
We know that such
a thing occurs.

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:56.365 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, Dean
Radin's work and so forth.

00:07:56.365 --> 00:07:58.060 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah, all right.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:59.960 align:middle line:90%
Dean Radin is a good example.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.900 align:middle line:84%
You can take a simple
thing like remove

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:06.430 align:middle line:84%
some of the glial cells from
your mouth, put part of them

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:10.180 align:middle line:84%
in a Petri dish, take part
of them five miles away,

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:12.727 align:middle line:84%
shock the Petri dish,
and at the same moment,

00:08:12.727 --> 00:08:13.935 align:middle line:90%
you'll see those [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:13.935 --> 00:08:15.025 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Spooky
action at a distance.

00:08:15.025 --> 00:08:15.825 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:08:15.825 --> 00:08:18.020 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: So we know
that there is actually--

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Mind is
not in the brain.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:20.300 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:21.379 align:middle line:90%
It's a processing unit.

00:08:21.379 --> 00:08:23.920 align:middle line:84%
I think once the science starts
looking at it as a processing

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.720 align:middle line:84%
unit, all their
questions are not

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.330 align:middle line:84%
going to be
mysteries any longer.

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.580 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: But let's deal
with it as a processing unit.

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:30.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.130 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: The processing
unit itself, for all intent

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:35.679 align:middle line:90%
and purposes, has limitations.

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:40.274 align:middle line:84%
Those limitations include
what Freud would call

00:08:40.274 --> 00:08:43.419 align:middle line:90%
our id, our ego, our super ego.

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:46.720 align:middle line:84%
They would include
a Thanatos drive.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.180 align:middle line:84%
We're not free of
being an animal.

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:51.395 align:middle line:90%
All those reptilian signals--

00:08:51.395 --> 00:08:52.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's very true.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.670 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: --systems,
they still exist.

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:58.360 align:middle line:84%
We sometimes deny
our physiology.

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.610 align:middle line:90%
You could take your right foot.

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:01.810 align:middle line:90%
Do it right now.

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:05.140 align:middle line:84%
Pick it up, and move it
in a clockwise circle.

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.080 align:middle line:90%
And then write six in the air.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.500 align:middle line:84%
Then discover that,
wait a minute.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:12.910 align:middle line:84%
My foot doesn't remain
going in a clockwise signal.

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:15.430 align:middle line:84%
I could sit you
down and give you

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:17.350 align:middle line:84%
something to do
with your right hand

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:20.660 align:middle line:84%
while you answered or
responded to stimulus

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:23.020 align:middle line:90%
I was giving you very rapidly.

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:27.310 align:middle line:84%
And the whole notion here
would be, identify that signal

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:28.480 align:middle line:90%
every time you see it.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And if I put something
in your right hand, which

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.210 align:middle line:84%
is connected to your
left brain, you'll

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:37.720 align:middle line:84%
identify it far more
times accurately

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.920 align:middle line:84%
than if I gave you something
to do with your left hand.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.300 align:middle line:84%
You'll fail to
notice it many times.

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:46.545 align:middle line:84%
So there are some very
real physiological limits--

00:09:46.545 --> 00:09:47.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.690 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: --to how we
process information.

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:50.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
reptilian brain

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:51.300 align:middle line:90%
still works with our survival.

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:54.700 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: So if we look
at processing information,

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.490 align:middle line:84%
and we realize that
that information is

00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:01.780 align:middle line:84%
processed from the subconscious,
for all intent and purposes,

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:05.620 align:middle line:84%
now whether it comes from
somewhere else, a larger mind,

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.330 align:middle line:90%
that's another discussion.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:11.810 align:middle line:84%
Or it's just coming out
of our fears, our beliefs.

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:13.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's all part
of the larger complex.

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:15.850 align:middle line:84%
But I guess what
I'm asking is this.

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:18.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean the original
question is, these--

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:22.360 align:middle line:84%
because the book is a compendium
of various conspiracy theories,

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.890 align:middle line:84%
under the loose term,
conspiracy theories.

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:27.730 align:middle line:84%
I will call them a
compendium of various events

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:30.040 align:middle line:90%
that I find to be factual.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.422 align:middle line:90%
And so these are--

00:10:32.422 --> 00:10:33.880 align:middle line:84%
the point I'm making
is the book is

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.710 align:middle line:90%
a compendium of these things.

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:38.620 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm trying to find out,
because what you're telling

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:43.480 align:middle line:84%
me right now is we're talking
about like this man that wanted

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.980 align:middle line:84%
to build a nursery
for his child.

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:49.030 align:middle line:84%
and somehow had some dissonance
in his brain to think he

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:51.460 align:middle line:84%
could get away with stealing
the materials to give

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:53.620 align:middle line:90%
his family a better life.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:55.030 align:middle line:90%
And so I think--

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:57.580 align:middle line:84%
I want to find out what the
link between that compendium

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:00.760 align:middle line:84%
of material and this subject
we're talking about now is,

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.920 align:middle line:84%
so we can go in a linear
progression from there.

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:03.720 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: OK.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:07.660 align:middle line:84%
So in my own work,
it became important

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:11.470 align:middle line:84%
for me to understand how
and why you got programmed,

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:14.680 align:middle line:84%
because that programming
coming out of your subconscious

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.290 align:middle line:84%
is predisposing
everything you do.

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:20.585 align:middle line:84%
The conscious mind
is a 20/20 hindsight

00:11:20.585 --> 00:11:23.770 align:middle line:84%
on what the subconscious
is telling you to do.

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:25.240 align:middle line:90%
So how did you get programmed?

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, we all know
about inculturation.

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:31.480 align:middle line:84%
We all naturally
are inculturated.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:35.390 align:middle line:84%
We know that we're herd animals,
and because we're herd animals,

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:38.090 align:middle line:84%
one of our greatest
fears is rejection.

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And so we immediately begin to
tend to the needs of the herd

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:44.860 align:middle line:90%
in order to be accepted.

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:48.340 align:middle line:84%
Now in that process, we
begin to take on beliefs,

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:51.700 align:middle line:84%
and we begin to build defense
mechanisms and defense

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:52.640 align:middle line:90%
strategies.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:53.440 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.990 align:middle line:84%
So if my belief is that
to be a good father,

00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:58.780 align:middle line:84%
I need to provide
a nursery, where

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.090 align:middle line:90%
did that belief come from?

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:05.260 align:middle line:84%
Each of us have to look
at what the contents

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.830 align:middle line:84%
of our subconscious mind is
before we can become authentic,

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:12.930 align:middle line:84%
because every one of us have
developed these strategies.

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:16.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The problem is the
subconscious is generally sub.

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:18.530 align:middle line:84%
We generally can't
consciously access it.

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:19.395 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: But it can
be made conscious.

00:12:19.395 --> 00:12:20.050 align:middle line:90%
That's the whole point.

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:22.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, through hypnosis
and some of these things, yes.

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.140 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Knowledge is power.

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:25.990 align:middle line:90%
Once you understand--

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:28.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you're
conservative or liberal,

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.880 align:middle line:84%
but we have things
we call primes.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.340 align:middle line:84%
I could give you a
test sitting right here

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:37.570 align:middle line:84%
at this table designed to scale
whether you were a conservative

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:39.660 align:middle line:90%
or you were a liberal.

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:42.460 align:middle line:84%
I could bring it back in a
week and sit you back down,

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:47.090 align:middle line:84%
because let's say I want to
move you toward conservatism.

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And I'll put a jar of hand
sanitizer on the table.

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:54.550 align:middle line:84%
You will see that
your hand sanitizer,

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:57.610 align:middle line:84%
even though maybe you might not
look at it like these crystals

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:01.580 align:middle line:84%
right here, it presents a
subliminal message to you.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And that subliminal
message says, watch out.

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:07.790 align:middle line:90%
Germs, danger-- beware.

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:08.590 align:middle line:90%
Caution.

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:09.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course.

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:10.960 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Those are
the thought processes

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.670 align:middle line:90%
of a conservative person.

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:15.760 align:middle line:84%
What will happen is that
will skew your answers

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.260 align:middle line:90%
toward conservative.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.870 align:middle line:84%
Now because there's a
consistency principle

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:22.510 align:middle line:84%
among what we call
compliance principles,

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:25.940 align:middle line:84%
if I point out to you that
you're answering differently,

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:29.570 align:middle line:84%
you'll have a rationalization
for why you did.

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:32.110 align:middle line:84%
You won't really have
the real-- indeed,

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:36.550 align:middle line:84%
we take five automobiles,
and we take a beautiful model

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:38.890 align:middle line:84%
in a bikini and
drape her over one.

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:41.650 align:middle line:84%
And we ask men, which
one is the fastest?

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:43.900 align:middle line:84%
They will invariably
choose the one

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:49.300 align:middle line:84%
with the bikini-clad
woman laying over it, OK?

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:52.510 align:middle line:84%
Bring them back a week
later, same five automobiles,

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:55.070 align:middle line:90%
different colors, rearranged.

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:57.370 align:middle line:90%
She's on a different automobile.

00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:59.470 align:middle line:84%
They will choose the
car she's on again.

00:13:59.470 --> 00:13:59.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course.

00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:00.970 align:middle line:90%
And we're aware of that, yeah.

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:01.300 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Why?

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.110 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a
threshold of arousal.

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:03.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:06.100 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Then when
you ask them, though--

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:06.920 align:middle line:90%
that's the key.

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.860 align:middle line:84%
When you ask them, why
did you make that choice?

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:12.460 align:middle line:84%
Can you see that last
time you chose this car?

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:15.370 align:middle line:90%
They will again invent a reason.

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:19.780 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to be involved
in the field of self-help,

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:22.900 align:middle line:84%
in my view, the first
thing you need to do

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:25.780 align:middle line:84%
is help people
understand themselves

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:28.660 align:middle line:84%
in a process of
becoming authentic.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:31.990 align:middle line:84%
So to me, "Gotcha" was
the next natural step.

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:34.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But why--

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:37.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean hundreds of pages of,
you know, these different--

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:39.870 align:middle line:90%
whether it's GMOs or whatever.

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:44.200 align:middle line:84%
Is it-- were you
trying to show us

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.659 align:middle line:84%
the ways in which all
of the means and ways

00:14:46.659 --> 00:14:47.950 align:middle line:90%
in which we've been hoodwinked?

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:49.190 align:middle line:90%
Is that the point of that?

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:51.565 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: The point is to show
you the many ways that you

00:14:51.565 --> 00:14:52.820 align:middle line:90%
have been herded.

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:53.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:55.000 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Is there an agenda?

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.501 align:middle line:90%
That's the real question.

00:14:56.501 --> 00:14:58.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, of
course, there's--

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:58.750 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Is there an agenda?

00:14:58.750 --> 00:14:59.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, of course.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:01.290 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: All right, so I
know you've interviewed--

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:02.206 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know that.

00:15:02.206 --> 00:15:05.530 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: --and you're
familiar with Project Monarch.

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:06.656 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yep.

00:15:06.656 --> 00:15:08.780 align:middle line:84%
Most of those topics I've
done interviews on, yeah.

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:10.196 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: So there
are discussions

00:15:10.196 --> 00:15:12.400 align:middle line:84%
out there about
Illuminati and one world

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:16.340 align:middle line:84%
governments and the elite
and so on and so forth.

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:19.820 align:middle line:84%
There are many theories
about what's going on.

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:21.610 align:middle line:90%
Are we being herded?

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:24.730 align:middle line:84%
I once had a conversation with
Dewey Fillis in his office

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:26.050 align:middle line:90%
at the-- he was former bureau.

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:28.390 align:middle line:84%
At the time, he was chief
of police in Salt Lake City,

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:30.870 align:middle line:84%
went on to Chicago to
be the chief there.

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:34.930 align:middle line:84%
Fillis had an associate
who had attended

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:39.490 align:middle line:84%
a meeting in California,
in San Francisco, where

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:42.190 align:middle line:84%
they had laid out
an agenda to change

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:46.120 align:middle line:84%
the nature of our society,
change the nature so that it'd

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:52.870 align:middle line:84%
conform more to what some would
say is the path toward a one

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:56.200 align:middle line:84%
world government
or a path toward,

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.950 align:middle line:84%
we are simply pawns
in a larger game.

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:02.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and we're
all aware of this, OK?

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.680 align:middle line:90%
So go ahead from there.

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.800 align:middle line:84%
Know that everyone
watching is aware of this.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:06.600 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: OK.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.760 align:middle line:84%
So there were three
things, three objectives

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.950 align:middle line:90%
that they wanted to get done.

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:16.130 align:middle line:84%
The first one was, break
down the nuclear family.

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:16.930 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:20.800 align:middle line:90%
The second one was, create debt.

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:24.620 align:middle line:84%
The third one was,
change our morality.

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:28.060 align:middle line:84%
Now this meeting took
place in the late '50s.

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:33.610 align:middle line:84%
If you compare where we were
post-Second World War in any

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:37.000 align:middle line:84%
of those three categories
to where we are today,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.050 align:middle line:84%
you have to say, well,
they're either Nostradamus--

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:44.150 align:middle line:90%
this came about coincidentally--

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:47.350 align:middle line:84%
and/or an agenda is
being carried out.

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:49.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, if there is
an agenda, what's

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:51.970 align:middle line:84%
that agenda designed
to do, and how does

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:55.570 align:middle line:90%
that empower us individually?

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:56.890 align:middle line:90%
Or does it?

00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:59.830 align:middle line:84%
Because if it
doesn't empower us,

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:03.130 align:middle line:84%
if it doesn't lend
to our authenticity,

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:06.790 align:middle line:84%
then it's something that we
should be aware of at the very

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:07.641 align:middle line:90%
least, is it not?

00:17:07.641 --> 00:17:09.849 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's what
we've been trying to do--

00:17:09.849 --> 00:17:11.740 align:middle line:84%
I've been trying to do
for the last 13 years--

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:12.270 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: I know.

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:13.436 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --is exactly that.

00:17:13.436 --> 00:17:15.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean this is what we've
all been trying to do.

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:19.540 align:middle line:84%
And I mean there are
some amazing, I think,

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:21.310 align:middle line:90%
instructive tools toward that.

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:24.832 align:middle line:84%
My favorite is the film, which I
think it runs about four hours.

00:17:24.832 --> 00:17:26.290 align:middle line:84%
You can find it on
YouTube, and I'm

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:28.150 align:middle line:84%
sure you're well
aware of it, the film,

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:30.850 align:middle line:84%
"The Century of Self,"
starting with Bernays, right?

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And looking at the ways in
which the public-- and that's

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:36.010 align:middle line:84%
something as a primer
of course to anybody.

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:40.660 align:middle line:84%
I think most of our viewers
are fully aware of all of this.

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:43.720 align:middle line:84%
"The Century of Self" helps
us understand the process

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:46.024 align:middle line:84%
of mass manipulation
on what seems like--

00:17:46.024 --> 00:17:47.565 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: The
engineering of consent.

00:17:47.565 --> 00:17:49.148 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --the
engineering of consent

00:17:49.148 --> 00:17:50.350 align:middle line:90%
on kind of everyday levels.

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:54.580 align:middle line:84%
This goes-- it doesn't, per
se, go into some of the darker

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:56.740 align:middle line:84%
agendas that we're
aware of like Monarch

00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:58.660 align:middle line:90%
and some of these projects.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:00.736 align:middle line:84%
But it does explain
to people the ways

00:18:00.736 --> 00:18:02.860 align:middle line:84%
in which they've been
manipulated very beautifully.

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:06.800 align:middle line:84%
So I always recommend someone
watch that, if you haven't.

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of
shocking for those

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.780 align:middle line:84%
who don't know the
details of how we end up

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:15.310 align:middle line:84%
in wars, how we sell war, and
so forth to get public buy-in so

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:17.530 align:middle line:84%
that the military industrial
complex, for example,

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:21.152 align:middle line:84%
can profit from it, and some of
their political allies as well.

00:18:21.152 --> 00:18:22.110 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: That's right.

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:24.151 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean that's
the backdrop for reality.

00:18:24.151 --> 00:18:25.310 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And so I think maybe
the conversation that's

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:31.870 align:middle line:84%
really interesting here
is then, let's look at it

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:34.810 align:middle line:84%
from maybe your background
is in hypnosis, for example.

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:36.910 align:middle line:84%
You have a strong
background in hypnosis.

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:39.290 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about it from
the hypnotic point of view

00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:41.380 align:middle line:84%
so that people,
even though they're

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:44.200 align:middle line:84%
aware of all these agendas and
most of the cases you mentioned

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.980 align:middle line:84%
in your book, let's look at
really practical levels of how

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:50.890 align:middle line:84%
a person can start
discerning in the moment

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:52.660 align:middle line:84%
when something
new is zinging in.

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:54.130 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at it that way.

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:56.470 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Well, I
think for all intent

00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:59.290 align:middle line:84%
and purposes, if we're going
to become aware of what's

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:02.410 align:middle line:84%
in our subconscious, the
first thing that we have to do

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:06.250 align:middle line:84%
is become mindful, mindful of
every single thought that we

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:07.390 align:middle line:90%
have.

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And you know, we all
have aberrant thoughts.

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:13.690 align:middle line:84%
But you know, we've
all been trained

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:15.310 align:middle line:90%
not to acknowledge them.

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:16.180 align:middle line:90%
We deny them.

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:19.094 align:middle line:84%
We push them away,
and that's probably

00:19:19.094 --> 00:19:20.260 align:middle line:90%
the worst thing we could do.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:23.680 align:middle line:84%
Little Johnny is told in
kindergarten, oh, Johnny,

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:25.390 align:middle line:90%
you shouldn't get angry.

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:27.010 align:middle line:90%
Anger is not good for you.

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:28.570 align:middle line:90%
Anger is bad.

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:30.340 align:middle line:90%
Johnny, angry, you just--

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:34.210 align:middle line:84%
anger is something that
you never want to have.

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:37.780 align:middle line:84%
So little Johnny, to use
Robert Bly's words in his book,

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:41.560 align:middle line:84%
"The Dark Side of
our Shadow," puts it

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:44.552 align:middle line:90%
in this imaginary long bag.

00:19:44.552 --> 00:19:45.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You stuff it.

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:46.635 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: And so he takes--

00:19:46.635 --> 00:19:48.250 align:middle line:84%
you know, we take
all these emotions

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:51.430 align:middle line:84%
that we have that we're
not supposed to have,

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:53.650 align:middle line:84%
all these thoughts that
we have that we're not

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:56.140 align:middle line:84%
supposed to have, and we
stick them in this long bag.

00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:57.910 align:middle line:84%
But we're dragging
them along with us.

00:19:57.910 --> 00:19:59.000 align:middle line:90%
We're never healing them.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.249 align:middle line:90%
We're never dealing with them.

00:20:00.249 --> 00:20:01.690 align:middle line:90%
We're never facing them.

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:04.330 align:middle line:84%
We don't even want to
recognize they exist.

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And then one day,
we blow up maybe

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:09.000 align:middle line:84%
at our wife for no
reason, but there

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.460 align:middle line:84%
have been stimuli throughout
the day that has us on edge,

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:14.650 align:middle line:90%
and boom, we dump it out.

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:18.250 align:middle line:84%
OK, what we should
be doing is looking

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:23.050 align:middle line:84%
at each of these thoughts
and not in a judgmental way.

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:26.860 align:middle line:84%
So I have the thought,
where did that come from?

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:29.140 align:middle line:90%
Why would I think that?

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:32.920 align:middle line:84%
When was the first time I
had a thought like that?

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:36.610 align:middle line:84%
Is there-- is that a
thought I want to own,

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:40.540 align:middle line:84%
is there another context
I can think about this in?

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:42.310 align:middle line:90%
Context is everything.

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:45.040 align:middle line:84%
It takes somebody either
in 5 o'clock traffic,

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:47.150 align:middle line:84%
and you're in a
hurry to get home.

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:48.760 align:middle line:84%
You've got tickets
to the theater.

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.380 align:middle line:84%
Your wife or husband
is waiting for you.

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:53.590 align:middle line:84%
You were late in the
office, and suddenly a car

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:55.330 align:middle line:90%
cuts in front of you.

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:57.810 align:middle line:90%
The natural reaction is what?

00:20:57.810 --> 00:20:59.890 align:middle line:90%
The middle finger?

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:01.570 align:middle line:90%
Lay on the horn?

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:06.580 align:middle line:84%
Adrenaline, cortisol, neither of
which are good for the optimal

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:10.130 align:middle line:84%
operation of your immune,
endochrine, or [? ANS. ? ]

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:14.700 align:middle line:84%
So how could I change that
context, so the next time

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:17.590 align:middle line:84%
it happened to me, I
wouldn't respond that way?

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:19.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, what if I
just begin to think

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:21.990 align:middle line:84%
that if a car cuts
in front of me,

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:24.150 align:middle line:84%
maybe they have a
small child laying

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:27.900 align:middle line:84%
on the floorboards in the
back seat that's bleeding,

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:30.360 align:middle line:90%
and they need emergency medical?

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.790 align:middle line:84%
If I change that
context, suddenly, I

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:34.830 align:middle line:84%
don't mind that they
got in front of me.

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:38.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm blessing them that they
get on down the highway.

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:39.600 align:middle line:90%
We choose the context.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:43.440 align:middle line:84%
We can volitionally choose
to change the context

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.290 align:middle line:84%
and reframe all of
these so-called--

00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:49.950 align:middle line:84%
and in that process, we
begin to make uncoverings.

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:54.160 align:middle line:84%
So we discover a
young man can't laugh.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.370 align:middle line:90%
He's in his late 30s.

00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:58.200 align:middle line:90%
He's considered a stoic.

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.030 align:middle line:90%
He's not invited to any parties.

00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:03.840 align:middle line:84%
It's bearing hard on his
relationship with his wife.

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.720 align:middle line:90%
They seek marriage counseling.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.880 align:middle line:84%
In the counseling
and uncovering,

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:12.270 align:middle line:84%
a hypnotic
uncovering, revivifies

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:18.540 align:middle line:84%
when he had his first
negative reaction to laughter.

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:20.460 align:middle line:90%
And he's a small boy.

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:22.200 align:middle line:90%
He's seven, eight years old.

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:26.820 align:middle line:84%
He's with a group of kids, and
somebody tells a story that's

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:28.920 align:middle line:90%
funny, and he laughs.

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.780 align:middle line:90%
Tears come down his face.

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:32.580 align:middle line:90%
He doubles over.

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:35.490 align:middle line:84%
He smiles a little funny
because of a partial paralysis

00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:36.290 align:middle line:90%
on his face.

00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:38.490 align:middle line:90%
They make fun of his face.

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:42.340 align:middle line:84%
They ridicule and criticize
him, and a defense mechanism.

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:43.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:44.900 align:middle line:84%
This is how the
subconscious works, yes.

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:47.010 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: And so now
that defense mechanism

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:49.380 align:middle line:84%
says, we'll never
be ridiculed again.

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:50.660 align:middle line:90%
So we won't laugh.

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:51.460 align:middle line:90%
We won't smile.

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:54.060 align:middle line:84%
He finds many things
funny, but because

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:58.080 align:middle line:84%
of that adaptation
at a very young age,

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:02.760 align:middle line:84%
it changes his entire life,
impacts his friendships,

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:05.580 align:middle line:90%
his family, etc.

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:09.710 align:middle line:84%
These mechanisms are all
a part of who we are,

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:12.060 align:middle line:84%
and in order to
flesh them out, we

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:14.330 align:middle line:84%
need to get into
our own unconscious,

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:17.880 align:middle line:84%
our own subconscious, and
discover what they are.

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.220 align:middle line:84%
Hypnosis is a tool,
as you know, that

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:24.150 align:middle line:84%
can be very beneficial in
that process in uncovering,

00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:27.150 align:middle line:84%
but just being mindful,
paying attention

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:30.810 align:middle line:84%
to every single thought
we have, and then,

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:34.710 align:middle line:84%
as I say, without
discriminating, without judging

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:38.220 align:middle line:84%
that thought, simply
accepting that that was ours,

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:42.100 align:middle line:84%
owning it, and then the healing
it, whatever it might be,

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:44.350 align:middle line:90%
or changing its context.

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:47.910 align:middle line:84%
That's a first step to any
sense of self-actualization.

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:49.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:52.500 align:middle line:90%
Meditation 101, be mindful.

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:54.330 align:middle line:90%
Pay attention to your thoughts.

00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:57.600 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't accomplish any
of those things in the reality

00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.090 align:middle line:90%
day to day in their lives.

00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:01.200 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: They've been
trained to be consumers.

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:04.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And also, life
is zinging in so quickly

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:06.450 align:middle line:84%
that there is not
enough time, even,

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:09.580 align:middle line:84%
in most people's perception
to respond to anything.

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:11.054 align:middle line:90%
You're multitasking.

00:24:11.054 --> 00:24:12.720 align:middle line:84%
Which of those things
are you taking in?

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:13.890 align:middle line:84%
Which ones do you
stop and think,

00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:16.140 align:middle line:84%
why am I doing this, this,
and this at this moment?

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:18.760 align:middle line:84%
So yes, I think mindfulness
is a great idea.

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:20.826 align:middle line:84%
I mean absolutely, we
should all be mindful.

00:24:20.826 --> 00:24:22.200 align:middle line:84%
If you meditate,
I think it makes

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:24.280 align:middle line:84%
it a little easier for
people to be slowed

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:28.200 align:middle line:84%
down enough to be mindful,
for example, in your driving

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.240 align:middle line:90%
example.

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.882 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Meditation is key.

00:24:30.882 --> 00:24:32.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
meditation is really key.

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:35.070 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: We know that
you can change your brain.

00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:36.630 align:middle line:84%
You can increase
your gray matter.

00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:39.360 align:middle line:90%
You can rewire your brain.

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:44.870 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, you can influence
the manifestation of the DNA.

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:46.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, we
can do all of that.

00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:49.830 align:middle line:84%
So again, I'm trying to get
back to all of these events

00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:52.960 align:middle line:84%
you're writing about and where
you're taking people with it.

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.181 align:middle line:90%
Is it to show them, again--

00:24:55.181 --> 00:24:56.430 align:middle line:90%
because I want to progress it.

00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:58.920 align:middle line:90%
We know we've been hoodwinked.

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:01.410 align:middle line:84%
We know that we're under
mass hypnosis, essentially,

00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:03.060 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:07.590 align:middle line:84%
And so coming from
that point of view,

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:10.230 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about the
pragmatic ways in which we

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:12.630 align:middle line:90%
can break the hypnotic trance.

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:15.420 align:middle line:84%
Again, most people's
subconscious--

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:18.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean this goes back, some
would argue, for lifetimes, not

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:20.790 align:middle line:84%
just even this lifetime,
what's carried around

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:22.200 align:middle line:90%
in the subconscious.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:25.380 align:middle line:84%
And it is subbed our
ability to recognize.

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:27.780 align:middle line:84%
So unless you do something
like deep meditation

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:30.150 align:middle line:84%
with an eye toward this,
or unless you do hypnosis,

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:34.640 align:middle line:84%
for example, the possibility of
actually uncovering everything

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:37.590 align:middle line:84%
or a significant amount of it
what's in the subconscious,

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:39.940 align:middle line:84%
that, in itself, would
be a lifetime endeavor,

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:41.150 align:middle line:90%
if you just did that.

00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:41.950 align:middle line:90%
And you--

00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:42.810 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Isn't that
what life's for?

00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:45.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It is, and if you have
hypnosis or something to work

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:46.620 align:middle line:90%
with, you could.

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:49.702 align:middle line:84%
But not everybody is going to
pursue the path of hypnosis,

00:25:49.702 --> 00:25:51.660 align:middle line:84%
for example, to find out
what's rattling around

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:53.610 align:middle line:84%
in there, unless it
becomes chronic or acute--

00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:54.540 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: I don't think
they even have to.

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:55.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --on some level.

00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:57.740 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: I think that's just
a tool in the armamentarium.

00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:00.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a good
tool, and it is a tool,

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:02.370 align:middle line:84%
and I've used it
plenty in my past, too.

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:03.270 align:middle line:90%
And it is--

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:04.440 align:middle line:90%
I think it's a very--

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:06.660 align:middle line:90%
it's a commendable tool.

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:09.360 align:middle line:84%
But let's just say for
the average person that's

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:11.110 align:middle line:84%
watching this that has
a lot of knowledge,

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:14.020 align:middle line:84%
they're aware of all of these
various agendas and such,

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:15.940 align:middle line:84%
really kind of hands-on
ways that you're

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:18.820 align:middle line:84%
going to thwart that
stuff coming in, aside

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:21.880 align:middle line:84%
from the obvious, which we've
talked about many times.

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.200 align:middle line:90%
Don't buy in to media.

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:24.880 align:middle line:90%
Don't watch media.

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.704 align:middle line:84%
If you just unplug
from media in general,

00:26:26.704 --> 00:26:28.120 align:middle line:84%
you're not going
to be programmed,

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:31.030 align:middle line:84%
and then how do you go about
choosing to educate yourself

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:34.180 align:middle line:84%
on the affairs of the
world, and then discerning?

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:36.670 align:middle line:84%
Really practical
things like that-- what

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:38.090 align:middle line:90%
do you recommend to people?

00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:39.339 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: See, I don't think--

00:26:39.339 --> 00:26:42.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm not one that says
unplug from media.

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:48.140 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, I spend a good deal of
time paying attention to media.

00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:49.780 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you an example.

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:52.281 align:middle line:84%
One morning I'm
watching two networks.

00:26:52.281 --> 00:26:53.155 align:middle line:90%
One's a conservative.

00:26:53.155 --> 00:26:56.020 align:middle line:90%
The other's a liberal network.

00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:57.540 align:middle line:90%
They're having a poll.

00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:00.129 align:middle line:90%
It's the same poll.

00:27:00.129 --> 00:27:02.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Each one is
skewing for their audience.

00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:02.590 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: We are
creatures that want

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:04.360 align:middle line:90%
to hear what we want to hear.

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:05.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:08.470 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: We look for feedback
that tells us we're right.

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:09.729 align:middle line:90%
So I happen to be liberal.

00:27:09.729 --> 00:27:11.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to listen to liberal.

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:13.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to go to Fox.

00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:14.920 align:middle line:84%
If I happen to be
conservative, I'm

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:18.150 align:middle line:90%
certainly not going to MSNBC.

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:22.400 align:middle line:84%
So on this same
day on one network,

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:26.020 align:middle line:84%
we have the question posed,
"should poor taxpayers be

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:30.910 align:middle line:84%
forced to work two jobs in order
to pay for their children's

00:27:30.910 --> 00:27:33.710 align:middle line:84%
education and put them
in private schools,

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:37.360 align:middle line:84%
since our public education
system is failing?"

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.970 align:middle line:84%
On the other network, the
question goes this way.

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:43.780 align:middle line:84%
Should poor taxpayers be
forced to pay for rich kids

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:46.000 align:middle line:90%
to go to private school?

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000 align:middle line:84%
Now the issue is
about school vouchers.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, this is how
the network's positioned-- it's

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:52.550 align:middle line:90%
how the media positions it.

00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:54.966 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Now I don't believe
you can be spiritual and not

00:27:54.966 --> 00:27:57.910 align:middle line:84%
be involved in the
world, because well,

00:27:57.910 --> 00:27:58.870 align:middle line:90%
we can get into that.

00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:00.890 align:middle line:84%
I'll stay on point
for the moment.

00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:02.950 align:middle line:90%
So here we are.

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:05.920 align:middle line:84%
If I happen to be
liberal, I just

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:09.850 align:middle line:84%
ingested this new sound
bite, and right away, I'm

00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:12.100 align:middle line:90%
opposed to school vouchers.

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And if I happen to
be conservative,

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:16.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm pro-school vouchers.

00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:21.370 align:middle line:84%
And I will go out, and I will

what a school voucher is,

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:29.830 align:middle line:84%
where the money comes from, how
it impacts public education,

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:31.849 align:middle line:84%
who uses it,
dah-dah-dah-dah-dah.

00:28:31.849 --> 00:28:33.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you'll defend it.

00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:36.580 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: So I believe
we need to be informed,

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:37.450 align:middle line:90%
and the only way--

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:39.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Neither one of those

we have to take--

00:28:42.825 --> 00:28:45.190 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: I need to go
seek out the knowledge.

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:47.470 align:middle line:90%
What is a school voucher?

00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:49.720 align:middle line:90%
Where does the money come from?

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:50.597 align:middle line:90%
Etc and so forth.

00:28:50.597 --> 00:28:52.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, do your
own research on the topic.

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:53.350 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: I have to.

00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:54.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But let's
take this further.

00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:56.908 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: That means I'm
a responsible citizen.

00:28:56.908 --> 00:28:59.800 align:middle line:84%
See, if I don't take the role
as a responsible citizen,

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:02.590 align:middle line:90%
I fulfill Bernays' philosophy.

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:03.972 align:middle line:84%
Your fans all know
about Bernays.

00:29:03.972 --> 00:29:05.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They all
know this stuff.

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:07.420 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Nephew

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:08.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's why I

00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:10.540 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Bernays said
we're not smart enough--

>>TAYLOR: --to live

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:15.850 align:middle line:84%
We need to be

to have a cohesive society.

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:19.090 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:21.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's only true
if I let it be true.

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:23.660 align:middle line:90%
But it's absolutely true.

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:25.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's go into
this example you used.

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:27.580 align:middle line:90%
This is a good example, right?

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:29.550 align:middle line:84%
So you're being lied to
by both media sources.

00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:30.350 align:middle line:90%
That's how it is.

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:31.240 align:middle line:90%
That's how it works.

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:33.110 align:middle line:90%
It's only to support your frame.

00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:35.251 align:middle line:84%
It's only to support
itself and its advertisers.

00:29:35.251 --> 00:29:37.750 align:middle line:84%
There's no other point to either
one of those media sources.

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:38.708 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: That's right.

00:29:38.708 --> 00:29:41.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're in a
consumer machine of advertising

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:44.170 align:middle line:84%
and positions that
are going to position

00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:46.484 align:middle line:84%
that advertiser in front
of that conservative viewer

00:29:46.484 --> 00:29:48.400 align:middle line:84%
and this one in front
of this network in front

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:50.140 align:middle line:90%
of that, liberal buyer.

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:51.880 align:middle line:84%
These are just
buyer-consumer issues.

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:52.750 align:middle line:90%
It's not about news.

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:53.950 align:middle line:90%
It's not about truth.

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:56.920 align:middle line:84%
So you've been misinformed
on each of these.

00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:57.910 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:29:57.910 --> 00:30:00.205 align:middle line:84%
Now let's get into
more psychological,

00:30:00.205 --> 00:30:01.810 align:middle line:84%
because that's really
your background.

00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:04.190 align:middle line:84%
Let's just look at more of
the psychological components

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:04.990 align:middle line:90%
of this.

00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:11.620 align:middle line:84%
What is it in us that once
we grab on to an idea,

00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:14.710 align:middle line:84%
insists on defending
it to the death,

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:17.000 align:middle line:84%
whether we even believe
it's true or not?

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.120 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about more
psychological factors.

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:20.280 align:middle line:90%
I think that's interesting.

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:24.000 align:middle line:10%
>>TAYLOR: So there's what we
call compliance principles.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.320 align:middle line:84%
One of those compliance
principles is consistency.

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:31.210 align:middle line:84%
If I'm going to
be consistent, let

00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:35.500 align:middle line:84%
me give you a kind of
a study that was done.

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.580 align:middle line:84%
If I come to your
home with a placard

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:41.410 align:middle line:84%
to go into your window
to support an issue--

00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:45.760 align:middle line:84%
feed the poor--
and I convince you

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:48.490 align:middle line:84%
that you would make a great
contribution to just put

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:52.540 align:middle line:84%
this placard in your window,
front window of your home,

00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:57.610 align:middle line:84%
to support this idea, you
are 10 times more likely

00:30:57.610 --> 00:31:01.500 align:middle line:84%
to let me put a
billboard on your yard

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:04.497 align:middle line:84%
than you would be if you didn't
put the placard in your window.

00:31:04.497 --> 00:31:05.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course.

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:06.996 align:middle line:84%
There's already a
history of compliance.

00:31:06.996 --> 00:31:09.450 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: The reason is
you need to be consistent.

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:13.260 align:middle line:84%
If I vote a certain
way, I need to defend

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:18.300 align:middle line:84%
how I voted, because otherwise,
I'm admitting that I was wrong.

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:22.860 align:middle line:84%
We have a need not just to
be right, to be consistent.

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:25.680 align:middle line:84%
The compliance principles
exist of a number of them--

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:27.340 align:middle line:90%
reciprocity.

00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:32.040 align:middle line:84%
Reciprocity is one merchants
use on us all the time.

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:33.510 align:middle line:90%
We get something free.

00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:35.860 align:middle line:90%
We feel a sense of obligation.

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:39.960 align:middle line:84%
So I am a charity,
and I send you a dime,

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:44.820 align:middle line:84%
or I send you a gift,
all these return labels.

00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:49.610 align:middle line:84%
Because you accept the gift, you
feel more inclined to respond.

00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:51.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it's a
manipulation, and yeah.

00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:52.740 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: That's right.

00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:56.610 align:middle line:84%
We are hardwired in some ways
that predisposes that way.

00:31:56.610 --> 00:32:00.270 align:middle line:84%
We know watching the brain
lifetime that if I sign

00:32:00.270 --> 00:32:03.690 align:middle line:84%
a check, just signing a check to
a charity I really care about--

00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:05.750 align:middle line:90%
my favorite's Women for Women--

00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:08.390 align:middle line:90%
I sign their check.

00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:11.810 align:middle line:84%
The reward centers
in my brain light up.

00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:15.440 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
I am being bathed

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:18.440 align:middle line:84%
with those great
neurochemicals and the body's

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:19.430 align:middle line:90%
natural opiates--

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:21.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because of
your intention, yeah.

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:26.290 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: That's right,
because I'm hardwired to help,

00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:31.030 align:middle line:84%
to give, to be
involved, to care.

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:37.120 align:middle line:84%
So psychologically speaking,
understanding that we

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:40.230 align:middle line:90%
are built in a mechanical way--

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:44.500 align:middle line:84%
and I am not one that believes
that the human condition is

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:46.450 align:middle line:84%
simply a meat machine
that has evolved

00:32:46.450 --> 00:32:49.240 align:middle line:84%
through some Darwinian
process in the materialistic

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:50.184 align:middle line:90%
reductionist sense.

00:32:50.184 --> 00:32:51.350 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe that at all.

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:54.010 align:middle line:90%
That's all nonsense in my view.

00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:56.920 align:middle line:84%
But we're nevertheless--
we nevertheless

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:59.470 align:middle line:84%
operate in very
mechanical ways, very

00:32:59.470 --> 00:33:02.590 align:middle line:90%
predictive mechanical ways.

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:03.870 align:middle line:90%
You know all about media.

00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:06.100 align:middle line:84%
You spent a career
in media, so you

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:10.780 align:middle line:84%
know that demographics
are key to advertisers.

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:14.740 align:middle line:84%
But today we have
psychographics.

00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:19.540 align:middle line:84%
Psychographics takes the great
ocean, the five principle

00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:20.340 align:middle line:90%
primary--

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:21.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Data mining.

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:23.547 align:middle line:84%
It's possible by
data mining, Facebook

00:33:23.547 --> 00:33:25.130 align:middle line:84%
being one of the
primary contributors.

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:27.040 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Well, if
you look recently

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:30.550 align:middle line:84%
at Cambridge Analytics,
Cambridge Analytics

00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:35.890 align:middle line:84%
combined psychographic knowledge
with demographic knowledge,

00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:40.150 align:middle line:84%
allegedly, they claim,
to elect Donald Trump.

00:33:40.150 --> 00:33:41.170 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:44.110 align:middle line:90%
What makes psychographics work?

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:46.480 align:middle line:90%
Personality.

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:48.310 align:middle line:90%
What forms our personality?

00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:50.470 align:middle line:84%
When I went to
college, I was taught

00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:52.600 align:middle line:90%
that personality is fixed.

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:56.920 align:middle line:84%
It's like IQ or brain cells
that die at the age of 30

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:58.930 align:middle line:90%
and don't regenerate themselves.

00:33:58.930 --> 00:34:01.960 align:middle line:84%
All of that's false to fact,
but that's nevertheless

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:04.060 align:middle line:90%
what I was taught.

00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:07.210 align:middle line:84%
Today we would say changing
your personality is the best

00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:10.690 align:middle line:84%
way in the world for you
to make your next step

00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:13.000 align:middle line:90%
in self-improvement.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.580 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to look
at your personality,

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:21.219 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to look at
just how outgoing you are,

00:34:21.219 --> 00:34:27.659 align:middle line:84%
how agreeable you are,
your scale of neuroticism,

00:34:27.659 --> 00:34:31.219 align:middle line:90%
your extroversion, introversion.

00:34:31.219 --> 00:34:33.760 align:middle line:84%
We're going to look at these
primary characteristics

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:36.580 align:middle line:84%
of human personality,
and then we're

00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:41.500 align:middle line:84%
going to say, well, if we
want to persuade this person,

00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:45.190 align:middle line:84%
they tend to be liberal,
but they're also Catholic,

00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:46.630 align:middle line:90%
religious.

00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:49.120 align:middle line:84%
We can approach this
person by talking

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:52.280 align:middle line:90%
to them about right for life.

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:55.159 align:middle line:84%
We can persuade them
to move our direction.

00:34:55.159 --> 00:34:58.430 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is billions
and billions of dollars

00:34:58.430 --> 00:35:04.040 align:middle line:84%
have been spent by governments
and private merchandisers

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:06.560 align:middle line:90%
to understand our psychology.

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:09.680 align:middle line:84%
We don't spend five
minutes to understand it,

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:11.260 align:middle line:90%
but they have spent billions.

00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And now they gained the
ability to tweak us,

00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:21.350 align:middle line:84%
so we know that, look, there's a
group think problem that we all

00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:24.190 align:middle line:90%
need to be aware of.

00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:28.370 align:middle line:84%
If you get 20 people together,
19 of them are Confederates.

00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:32.300 align:middle line:84%
One of them is a subject, and
you begin to show them lines,

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:34.580 align:middle line:84%
and you ask them, which
line is the longest?

00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:38.375 align:middle line:84%
This is a study that's been
replicated many, many times.

00:35:38.375 --> 00:35:41.660 align:middle line:90%


00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:46.190 align:middle line:84%
19 of them say the shorter
line is the longest.

00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:49.340 align:middle line:84%
The first one that's not the
Confederate, the subject,

00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:52.520 align:middle line:84%
initially may say, no,
that's the longer line.

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:55.040 align:middle line:84%
But after two or
three passes, they

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:58.460 align:middle line:84%
will deny what they
physically see in order

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:00.090 align:middle line:90%
to go along with the group.

00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:01.890 align:middle line:84%
So we have this high
of consciousness,

00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:04.320 align:middle line:90%
this group think that goes on.

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:10.010 align:middle line:84%
So what happens to many of us is
we get caught in a group think,

00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:13.160 align:middle line:84%
and we follow along
with that group think.

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:16.550 align:middle line:84%
They understand this, those
people who would manipulate us,

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:17.570 align:middle line:90%
that would move us.

00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:18.653 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course, yeah.

00:36:18.653 --> 00:36:21.380 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: So they can take
search engine results,

00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:25.040 align:middle line:84%
and they can shove something
artificially to the top,

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:29.480 align:middle line:84%
and we'll follow suit, because
that's what everybody believes.

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:30.890 align:middle line:90%
That's what everybody thinks.

00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:32.510 align:middle line:90%
That is the group think.

00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:34.210 align:middle line:90%
That's how we work.

00:36:34.210 --> 00:36:37.040 align:middle line:84%
Understanding--
"Gotcha" contains

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:39.680 align:middle line:84%
all of these
psychological mechanisms.

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:41.780 align:middle line:84%
It contains all of
the ways that we

00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:47.430 align:middle line:84%
have been massaged, including
some of the most horrific ways

00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:50.510 align:middle line:90%
that government has betrayed us.

00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:52.580 align:middle line:90%
We trust the media.

00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:53.780 align:middle line:90%
We used to.

00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:56.870 align:middle line:84%
Today people talk
about fake news,

00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:58.550 align:middle line:90%
but we used to trust the media.

00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:00.560 align:middle line:90%
I remember Edward R Murrow.

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:02.630 align:middle line:84%
I would ingest
everything he said.

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:03.980 align:middle line:90%
He had to be right.

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:05.660 align:middle line:90%
He was a news reporter.

00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:08.730 align:middle line:84%
He only brought you
facts, didn't he?

00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:10.970 align:middle line:90%
But the world has changed.

00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:13.710 align:middle line:84%
It's all driven
now by consumption.

00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:16.470 align:middle line:84%
Remember the three principles
that we talked about earlier

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:18.190 align:middle line:84%
and that were part
of the agenda?

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:21.050 align:middle line:84%
Debt-- if we can
keep you consuming,

00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:22.970 align:middle line:84%
if we can keep
you on that path--

00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:25.640 align:middle line:84%
I once had a conversation
with an entrepreneur

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:27.740 align:middle line:84%
who controlled the
Maxfield Oppenheimer

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:29.900 align:middle line:90%
Trust out of Canada.

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:32.956 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking about
this very thing, and I said,

00:37:32.956 --> 00:37:34.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't really get
the picture of debt.

00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:37.460 align:middle line:84%
Of course, if you're
in debt, there's

00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:39.060 align:middle line:90%
an enslavement idea to this.

00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:39.860 align:middle line:90%
I understand that.

00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:41.401 align:middle line:84%
But you have the
choice of that debt.

00:37:41.401 --> 00:37:43.400 align:middle line:84%
He says, let me
tell you something.

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:46.610 align:middle line:84%
Eldon, if somebody comes
to your door, and they say,

00:37:46.610 --> 00:37:47.990 align:middle line:90%
I want your house, your ranch.

00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:48.870 align:middle line:90%
I like this spread.

00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:50.092 align:middle line:90%
This is just a nice spread.

00:37:50.092 --> 00:37:51.050 align:middle line:90%
I want you to move out.

00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:52.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to move in.

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:55.294 align:middle line:84%
You're going to tell
them to go to Hades.

00:37:55.294 --> 00:37:57.085 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get
your gun, if necessary,

00:37:57.085 --> 00:37:59.850 align:middle line:84%
and drive them
off your property.

00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:03.480 align:middle line:84%
But Eldon, if they come to you
with a piece of paper in hand,

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:05.170 align:middle line:84%
and they say to you,
you know, you just

00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:07.500 align:middle line:90%
didn't make your payments.

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:09.930 align:middle line:84%
I regret to inform
you you're going

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:11.970 align:middle line:90%
to have to leave your home.

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:14.250 align:middle line:84%
You'll drop up
your head in shame,

00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:16.830 align:middle line:84%
because you've been
trained to do that.

00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:18.330 align:middle line:90%
You broke your word.

00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:19.950 align:middle line:90%
You failed.

00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:23.960 align:middle line:84%
You didn't live up to
society's expectation,

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:25.852 align:middle line:90%
and you will walk away.

00:38:25.852 --> 00:38:27.060 align:middle line:90%
That's the power [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:27.893 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's true.

00:38:27.893 --> 00:38:30.090 align:middle line:84%
The entire system is made
so that people are made

00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:31.890 align:middle line:90%
to feel less of themselves.

00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:32.880 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Absolutely.

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:34.350 align:middle line:84%
Every commercial
you will ever see

00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:36.670 align:middle line:84%
is designed to tell
you you're deficient.

00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:37.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:39.094 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: If not, I
mean, look, I'm not

00:38:39.094 --> 00:38:42.090 align:middle line:84%
going to buy a life vest, if I
don't think I'm going to drown.

00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:44.410 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't matter if
it's hair color or makeup

00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:46.230 align:middle line:90%
or clothing or automobiles.

00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:50.490 align:middle line:84%
All of it is aimed
psychologically at telling you

00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:51.480 align:middle line:90%
you're deficient.

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:53.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about what happened.

00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:56.512 align:middle line:84%
I mean there are some
political instances

00:38:56.512 --> 00:38:58.470 align:middle line:84%
in the book that we'll
get to a couple of them,

00:38:58.470 --> 00:39:01.050 align:middle line:84%
but let's look at the
psychological fact

00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:03.870 align:middle line:84%
underpinnings that
they had to appeal to--

00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:05.850 align:middle line:84%
that's what I'm
interested in your work--

00:39:05.850 --> 00:39:07.290 align:middle line:90%
to make that happen.

00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:10.290 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: One candidate
used the latest

00:39:10.290 --> 00:39:17.190 align:middle line:84%
greatest in psychological
technology to engineer consent,

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:20.310 align:middle line:84%
obviously, among more
than the other candidate.

00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:25.590 align:middle line:84%
Now if you remember when Barack
Obama ran in his last campaign,

00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:29.190 align:middle line:84%
he used what everybody
called the elite team

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:32.460 align:middle line:84%
of social psychologists,
the guys that

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:37.560 align:middle line:84%
wrote the books on compliance
principles, on manipulation.

00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And they orchestrated
every single word

00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:43.890 align:middle line:84%
that his canvassers
used, whether in person

00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:47.100 align:middle line:84%
or on the phone, and
positioned much of what

00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:48.840 align:middle line:90%
went on in his campaign.

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And of course, he is
a tremendous speaker,

00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:57.840 align:middle line:84%
and that was a pretty
easy win over Romney.

00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:59.550 align:middle line:90%
On the other hand, along comes--

00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:01.380 align:middle line:84%
and Romney didn't
use any of this--

00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:04.520 align:middle line:90%
along comes Trump.

00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And Trump uses
Cambridge Analytics.

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:12.540 align:middle line:84%
Cambridge Analytics begins to
look at where they have to win

00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:15.240 align:middle line:90%
and where they're behind.

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:18.210 align:middle line:84%
So one thing they
were aware of is

00:40:18.210 --> 00:40:24.660 align:middle line:84%
there was some backlash among
law enforcement, backlash

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:29.400 align:middle line:84%
among white males in
some areas, because there

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:34.230 align:middle line:84%
was a perception that
Barack Obama was weak

00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:36.610 align:middle line:84%
on law enforcement,
that he favored,

00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:40.170 align:middle line:84%
indeed, a form of
reverse racism.

00:40:40.170 --> 00:40:42.840 align:middle line:84%
So they knew exactly
how to go after that,

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:47.670 align:middle line:84%
and they won the white
male all across the board.

00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And they did so by appealing
to that audience on the basis

00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:57.570 align:middle line:84%
that there was a
preference given

00:40:57.570 --> 00:41:01.590 align:middle line:84%
by the president
to minority races.

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:03.920 align:middle line:90%
So what they did was identify--

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:06.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which was-- that was
a bias that had been projected

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:07.910 align:middle line:90%
through the media already.

00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:10.860 align:middle line:84%
So you're saying they had
bought that particular bias

00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:12.170 align:middle line:90%
to the point of being--

00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:17.050 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: They took that bias,
and they made an example out

00:41:17.050 --> 00:41:17.850 align:middle line:90%
of it.

00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:19.680 align:middle line:90%
They heightened the fear.

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:22.184 align:middle line:84%
Fear is a very common
motivating thing.

00:41:22.184 --> 00:41:24.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, fear is the
primary mechanism, yeah.

00:41:24.350 --> 00:41:26.550 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: And any way you
look at this election,

00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:29.910 align:middle line:84%
fear is what the
dividing force was.

00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:33.150 align:middle line:84%
People that didn't vote
for Hillary Clinton

00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:35.850 align:middle line:84%
feared that she was just
dishonest, that they just

00:41:35.850 --> 00:41:38.762 align:middle line:84%
couldn't trust her, and if
they couldn't trust her, well,

00:41:38.762 --> 00:41:40.720 align:middle line:84%
then they had to put
their vote somewhere else.

00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:42.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know,
but the irony here

00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:45.960 align:middle line:84%
that was so interesting to me is
they feared she was dishonest,

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:49.170 align:middle line:84%
where Trump was literally
caught in one lie after another,

00:41:49.170 --> 00:41:51.930 align:middle line:84%
and they said, well, at least
we know what we're getting.

00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:53.317 align:middle line:90%
You heard this over and over.

00:41:53.317 --> 00:41:54.900 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: I hate to
get into politics,

00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:57.750 align:middle line:84%
but that's an unfair statement,
because Hillary Clinton was

00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:59.950 align:middle line:84%
caught in one lie after
another, including, I hit

00:41:59.950 --> 00:42:00.750 align:middle line:90%
the ground running.

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:02.290 align:middle line:84%
They were shooting
bullets at me.

00:42:02.290 --> 00:42:03.090 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:05.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the point is that
half the public accepted that.

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:06.816 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: But Trump
did a good job

00:42:06.816 --> 00:42:10.600 align:middle line:84%
in taking what analytics told
him and branding her the liar.

00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:12.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, and she
didn't do as good a job

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:13.516 align:middle line:90%
branding him the liar.

00:42:13.516 --> 00:42:14.774 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: No.

00:42:14.774 --> 00:42:15.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:16.490 align:middle line:90%
That is true.

00:42:16.490 --> 00:42:19.500 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: So he may have lied,
but we didn't hear much about

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:22.344 align:middle line:84%
him as a liar, except from
Hillary's inner crowd--

00:42:22.344 --> 00:42:23.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:24.900 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: --as we did
about Hillary as the liar.

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:26.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They didn't go
after him the same way, yeah.

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:28.170 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: So we took the data.

00:42:28.170 --> 00:42:29.970 align:middle line:90%
We said, where's her weakness?

00:42:29.970 --> 00:42:31.620 align:middle line:90%
And we started branding her.

00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:32.620 align:middle line:90%
It's called framing.

00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:33.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:35.628 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: You put a framer--
see, people are really--

00:42:35.628 --> 00:42:38.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So in your opinion,
it's because they successfully

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:40.809 align:middle line:84%
fully framed her as a
liar, and they ddin't--

00:42:40.809 --> 00:42:42.600 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Well, it's
one of the components.

00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:43.789 align:middle line:90%
Think about framing.

00:42:43.789 --> 00:42:45.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, I agree with you.

00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:46.080 align:middle line:90%
I agree with you.

00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:49.500 align:middle line:84%
They did not-- in
return, the other party

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:52.620 align:middle line:84%
did not successfully go after
framing him in the same way.

00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:54.637 align:middle line:84%
So we're at an unequal
advantage there.

00:42:54.637 --> 00:42:56.970 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: They tried to frame
him in different ways that

00:42:56.970 --> 00:42:57.350 align:middle line:90%
didn't stick.

00:42:57.350 --> 00:42:58.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It wasn't
consistent, yeah.

00:42:58.990 --> 00:43:01.450 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: And there
wasn't any consistency.

00:43:01.450 --> 00:43:03.760 align:middle line:90%
You've got the magic word there.

00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:07.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So consistency is what
really matters in brainwashing.

00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:08.470 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Absolutely.

00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:11.530 align:middle line:84%
You repeat the same lie over
and over again, it's believed.

00:43:11.530 --> 00:43:17.500 align:middle line:84%
The studies show us clearly
that even a retraction will not

00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:18.770 align:middle line:90%
change your mind.

00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:22.320 align:middle line:84%
You can know that something
is false that you heard,

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:26.020 align:middle line:84%
and you'll still go on
believing it or repeating it.

00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:27.771 align:middle line:84%
We see entertainment
do this all the time.

00:43:27.771 --> 00:43:29.561 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like weapons
of mass destruction.

00:43:29.561 --> 00:43:30.400 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:34.850 align:middle line:84%
Saturday Night Live says,
Sarah Palin, in an imitation,

00:43:34.850 --> 00:43:39.220 align:middle line:84%
in a mock thing, can see
Alaska from her kitchen.

00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:41.470 align:middle line:84%
You'll walk out there
and talk to people

00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:44.620 align:middle line:84%
and find that most people today
believe Sarah Palin actually

00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:48.790 align:middle line:84%
said she could see
Russia from her kitchen.

00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:49.950 align:middle line:90%
It never happened.

00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:51.670 align:middle line:90%
It just simply didn't happen.

00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:53.750 align:middle line:84%
But it was repeated
so many times,

00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:57.760 align:middle line:84%
that scene was shown over and
over, that people actually

00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:58.930 align:middle line:90%
accepted it.

00:43:58.930 --> 00:44:01.150 align:middle line:84%
Entertainment has a
way of doing that.

00:44:01.150 --> 00:44:02.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Entertrainment, yeah.

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:03.580 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Well, that's right.

00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:04.380 align:middle line:90%
That's a good word.

00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:06.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Entertrainment, yeah.

00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:07.572 align:middle line:90%
So OK, that's why--

00:44:07.572 --> 00:44:09.280 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to know in
your perception, what

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:13.540 align:middle line:84%
was the primary message
that really got through that

00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:14.770 align:middle line:90%
allowed this to happen?

00:44:14.770 --> 00:44:15.090 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Framing.

00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:15.430 align:middle line:90%
It's all about framing.

00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:17.429 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it was the
framing, and a lot of it

00:44:17.429 --> 00:44:20.170 align:middle line:84%
having to do with the
truthfulness of the candidates.

00:44:20.170 --> 00:44:21.020 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Well--

00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:21.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And so that's fine.

00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:22.580 align:middle line:90%
No, that's a good answer.

00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:24.960 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to know what your
personal point of view on it

00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:25.760 align:middle line:90%
was.

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:28.690 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: But also understand
that if I know how I can tweak

00:44:28.690 --> 00:44:33.080 align:middle line:84%
you, how I can get you,
even though you might be,

00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:36.100 align:middle line:84%
in this instance, a
Clinton supporter,

00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:38.430 align:middle line:84%
to slide over and
vote for Trump,

00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:40.180 align:middle line:84%
so we can take everybody
in Pennsylvania--

00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:41.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you have to appeal
to those fears and weaknesses.

00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:43.630 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: If I
target that audience,

00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:46.720 align:middle line:84%
I know who I want out
there, who's likely,

00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:48.500 align:middle line:84%
more likely than
others-- in other words,

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:50.380 align:middle line:84%
I know white males
are more likely, say,

00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:52.280 align:middle line:90%
than a black male--

00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:55.000 align:middle line:84%
what message is it I need
to give those white males

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.740 align:middle line:90%
to move them over here?

00:44:56.740 --> 00:44:58.990 align:middle line:84%
If I know what their
personality is,

00:44:58.990 --> 00:45:02.160 align:middle line:84%
I can find the weakness
that I can exploit,

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:04.820 align:middle line:90%
and then I will go after that.

00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:07.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly what
Cambridge Analytics did.

00:45:07.450 --> 00:45:10.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely, and
because it really was a lot of,

00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:12.370 align:middle line:84%
I would say angry on one
hand, but I think more

00:45:12.370 --> 00:45:14.050 align:middle line:84%
than that, fearful
white men who feel

00:45:14.050 --> 00:45:16.300 align:middle line:84%
that their entitlements
were being taken away

00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:19.330 align:middle line:84%
after a black president, now
a potential female president,

00:45:19.330 --> 00:45:21.580 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of these white men
couldn't take it anymore.

00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:23.680 align:middle line:84%
So they went into a
retro state, and I

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:24.847 align:middle line:90%
understand how that happens.

00:45:24.847 --> 00:45:26.555 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: There's a
lot of truth to that,

00:45:26.555 --> 00:45:28.570 align:middle line:84%
but that, too, can
become a soundbite.

00:45:28.570 --> 00:45:31.452 align:middle line:84%
We need to evaluate and
analyze that and understand--

00:45:31.452 --> 00:45:32.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, I get it.

00:45:32.410 --> 00:45:34.940 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: --that that isn't
the only reason he won,

00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:41.050 align:middle line:84%
and that that doesn't equate
to white supremacy or the KKK.

00:45:41.050 --> 00:45:43.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we did find
out how much hatefulness is

00:45:43.450 --> 00:45:46.540 align:middle line:84%
at the core of our society as
a result, probably the most--

00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:48.160 align:middle line:84%
I think the most
valuable thing that

00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:50.300 align:middle line:84%
might have come out
of all of this so far,

00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:53.980 align:middle line:84%
and it's still new, is that we
realized how divided we really

00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:57.830 align:middle line:84%
are and how prejudiced and
hateful at the core we really

00:45:57.830 --> 00:45:58.630 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:45:58.630 --> 00:46:01.780 align:middle line:84%
That was an astounding thing
for a country that actually

00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:07.060 align:middle line:84%
somewhat prided itself on having
some equality at its basis.

00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:10.780 align:middle line:84%
We realized that is not the
case, not in the subconscious.

00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:13.345 align:middle line:84%
This was a revelation of the
subconscious of the country.

00:46:13.345 --> 00:46:14.750 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: I agree totally.

00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:20.360 align:middle line:84%
Our long bags suddenly came out,
and the problem is it persists.

00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:26.340 align:middle line:84%
We see hateful remarks
from both sides,

00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:28.280 align:middle line:84%
and I've never seen
the likes of it.

00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:31.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I've never seen this
amount of hatred made public

00:46:31.570 --> 00:46:32.370 align:middle line:90%
in my life.

00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:33.170 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: No.

00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:36.064 align:middle line:84%
But our social networking
and our 24/7 media--

00:46:36.064 --> 00:46:37.605 align:middle line:84%
they do a pretty
good job at seeing--

00:46:37.605 --> 00:46:38.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about it.

00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:39.642 align:middle line:90%
Oh, boy, do they.

00:46:39.642 --> 00:46:40.600 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about it.

00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:43.040 align:middle line:90%
So now we have as a country--

00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:46.600 align:middle line:84%
now this is kind of centric
to the United States.

00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:48.670 align:middle line:84%
The rest the world is
just watching thinking,

00:46:48.670 --> 00:46:51.640 align:middle line:84%
what just happened, and
how do we respond to this?

00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:53.260 align:middle line:84%
So that that's the
rest of the world,

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:55.759 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of people from around
the world are watching this.

00:46:55.759 --> 00:46:57.070 align:middle line:90%
It's not just the US.

00:46:57.070 --> 00:47:00.040 align:middle line:84%
But in the US, because
we are being watched

00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:01.720 align:middle line:84%
to see what's going
to happen now,

00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:06.999 align:middle line:84%
because of the amount
of chaos, unrest

00:47:06.999 --> 00:47:09.040 align:middle line:84%
within the government,
outside of the government,

00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:13.570 align:middle line:84%
and within the population,
as a person that understands

00:47:13.570 --> 00:47:16.450 align:middle line:84%
hypnosis and understands
the power of programming

00:47:16.450 --> 00:47:18.940 align:middle line:84%
the subconscious
mind, what would you

00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:21.970 align:middle line:84%
say is the unique
opportunity to a nation that

00:47:21.970 --> 00:47:28.750 align:middle line:84%
is in shock, traumatized,
jubilant, divided,

00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:32.070 align:middle line:84%
moving into deep
patterns of hatred?

00:47:32.070 --> 00:47:34.230 align:middle line:84%
What is the unique
opportunity for those

00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:38.430 align:middle line:84%
who exploit among a population
like this in this state of mind

00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:39.495 align:middle line:90%
right now?

00:47:39.495 --> 00:47:42.030 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: See now therein
comes the question that

00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:44.250 align:middle line:84%
is among my favorite,
and it leads

00:47:44.250 --> 00:47:48.960 align:middle line:84%
back to what you said about
why "Gotcha," if all your work

00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:51.240 align:middle line:90%
has been about self-help?

00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:53.890 align:middle line:84%
Spirituality is
what our lives are

00:47:53.890 --> 00:47:55.140 align:middle line:90%
about as far as I'm concerned.

00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:56.865 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your background
was also as a pastor.

00:47:56.865 --> 00:47:57.906 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: That's correct.

00:47:57.906 --> 00:48:00.787 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean you have a
deep interest, in your case,

00:48:00.787 --> 00:48:01.745 align:middle line:90%
Christian spirituality.

00:48:01.745 --> 00:48:03.440 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: I'm a
certified diplomat.

00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:04.972 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
spirituality, yeah.

00:48:04.972 --> 00:48:05.930 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: That's right.

00:48:05.930 --> 00:48:11.090 align:middle line:84%
So the bottom line
comes down to this.

00:48:11.090 --> 00:48:14.750 align:middle line:84%
If we're spiritual beings,
as we claim most of us

00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:19.310 align:middle line:84%
that we are, how can
all this animus, all

00:48:19.310 --> 00:48:25.740 align:middle line:84%
this froth of anger,
hate, including deceit,

00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:29.440 align:middle line:84%
how can we continue to
participate in that?

00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:34.390 align:middle line:84%
So what we have right now is a
trauma, and trauma, you know,

00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:37.510 align:middle line:84%
has this remarkable
healing power.

00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:39.770 align:middle line:84%
Trauma tends to send
us back to our roots.

00:48:39.770 --> 00:48:40.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does.

00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:43.630 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Trauma tends to
make us stop for a minute

00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:45.350 align:middle line:90%
and view what's important.

00:48:45.350 --> 00:48:48.270 align:middle line:84%
What's the most important
thing in our lives?

00:48:48.270 --> 00:48:52.090 align:middle line:84%
With the division that we
have in the world today,

00:48:52.090 --> 00:48:54.250 align:middle line:84%
we have the
opportunity to, instead

00:48:54.250 --> 00:49:02.220 align:middle line:84%
of continue calling who's
right and who's wrong, to heal.

00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:05.330 align:middle line:84%
But we can't do that
without a broader picture.

00:49:05.330 --> 00:49:11.530 align:middle line:84%
We have to get out of this
notion that one side won,

00:49:11.530 --> 00:49:14.780 align:middle line:84%
and another side lost, and
one side wants to do this,

00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:16.770 align:middle line:84%
and the other side
wants to do that.

00:49:16.770 --> 00:49:20.450 align:middle line:84%
We have to get out of that, and
we have to stop and look at,

00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:28.740 align:middle line:84%
this is one people, one world,
one god, one spiritual system.

00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:31.760 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter what
you believe, as long

00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:37.820 align:middle line:84%
as what you do is your very best
to serve your fellow mankind.

00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:39.710 align:middle line:90%
I sit at the top.

00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:42.860 align:middle line:90%
We're hardwired for giving.

00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:45.770 align:middle line:84%
I have a four-cornered
philosophy about life

00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:48.080 align:middle line:90%
that I spell out very simply.

00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:51.650 align:middle line:84%
It's based on 40
years of research,

00:49:51.650 --> 00:49:57.290 align:middle line:84%
but that fourth corner
is called service.

00:49:57.290 --> 00:50:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Years ago, I had a
woman come to my offices

00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:03.520 align:middle line:84%
in Las Vegas, Nevada, had been
referred by a psychiatrist,

00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:05.840 align:middle line:90%
and she was suicidal.

00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:09.800 align:middle line:84%
Self-flagellation was a
regular thing with her.

00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:13.306 align:middle line:84%
She was on all kinds of
drugs, and it'd basically

00:50:13.306 --> 00:50:14.930 align:middle line:84%
come to a point where
they weren't sure

00:50:14.930 --> 00:50:16.100 align:middle line:90%
what they could do.

00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:19.370 align:middle line:84%
So she came to me for
pastoral counseling.

00:50:19.370 --> 00:50:22.490 align:middle line:84%
When I looked at her intake
sheets, the first thing I saw

00:50:22.490 --> 00:50:26.990 align:middle line:84%
was that her first therapist
was Milton Erickson.

00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:28.640 align:middle line:90%
You know who Milton Erickson is.

00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:30.680 align:middle line:90%
To me, he walks on water.

00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:33.630 align:middle line:84%
So I honestly had one of these
moments, where I thought,

00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:36.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what I could
do or what I would--

00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:39.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean I don't know why
I would see this person.

00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:43.990 align:middle line:84%
If he, Milton Erickson, couldn't
help her, what would I do?

00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:47.020 align:middle line:84%
But you know sometimes
in those moments,

00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:49.160 align:middle line:90%
we receive inspiration.

00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:52.700 align:middle line:84%
And I believe I
received inspiration.

00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:54.880 align:middle line:84%
So I agreed to see
her in what's called

00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:58.120 align:middle line:84%
brief therapy, 10 sessions,
once a week for 10 weeks.

00:50:58.120 --> 00:51:01.420 align:middle line:84%
Now this was a
suicidal individual,

00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:03.250 align:middle line:90%
but we had to have a contract.

00:51:03.250 --> 00:51:06.740 align:middle line:84%
She had to have homework, and
she had to do the homework,

00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:09.400 align:middle line:84%
or I'd just stop seeing her,
period, end of quotation.

00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:11.590 align:middle line:90%
But it was simple homework.

00:51:11.590 --> 00:51:16.510 align:middle line:84%
She was to obtain a journal, and
the first day that first week,

00:51:16.510 --> 00:51:21.240 align:middle line:84%
she was to do one good
deed every single day.

00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:23.740 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the day, she was
to write that good deed down.

00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:27.850 align:middle line:84%
Now this good deed had to be
for somebody she didn't know,

00:51:27.850 --> 00:51:31.840 align:middle line:84%
so this had to be for a stranger
or maybe for a fellow employee

00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:34.300 align:middle line:90%
that she didn't really like.

00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:38.400 align:middle line:84%
So you had to go out of your
way to do the good deed.

00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:41.440 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of the
night when she'd retire,

00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:44.050 align:middle line:84%
she were to write that
down in her journal,

00:51:44.050 --> 00:51:47.530 align:middle line:84%
what the good deed was, how
she thought it made that person

00:51:47.530 --> 00:51:50.710 align:middle line:90%
feel, and how it made her feel.

00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:51.970 align:middle line:90%
Week two, it was two.

00:51:51.970 --> 00:51:53.230 align:middle line:90%
Week three, it was three.

00:51:53.230 --> 00:51:54.190 align:middle line:90%
Week four, it was four.

00:51:54.190 --> 00:51:56.580 align:middle line:90%
We got up to five.

00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:58.840 align:middle line:84%
And you know, to begin with,
some of these good deeds

00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:01.150 align:middle line:90%
were pretty paltry.

00:52:01.150 --> 00:52:04.510 align:middle line:84%
But by the time 10
weeks were over,

00:52:04.510 --> 00:52:08.170 align:middle line:84%
she was off a lot of her drugs
and was no longer suicidal,

00:52:08.170 --> 00:52:11.790 align:middle line:84%
because self-esteem
isn't something

00:52:11.790 --> 00:52:14.860 align:middle line:84%
I get from the number
of degrees I've earned

00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:20.500 align:middle line:84%
or the awards I've won, the
trophies, the property I own,

00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:22.240 align:middle line:90%
the car I drive.

00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:26.250 align:middle line:84%
Self-esteem is something
I get from what I give.

00:52:26.250 --> 00:52:28.050 align:middle line:90%
She was lacking self-esteem.

00:52:28.050 --> 00:52:30.360 align:middle line:84%
She didn't feel she
was worth living.

00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:33.570 align:middle line:84%
She had a real set
of circumstances,

00:52:33.570 --> 00:52:36.810 align:middle line:84%
where her sister
had died, and she

00:52:36.810 --> 00:52:40.240 align:middle line:84%
felt that it was she
who should have died.

00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And I won't go into the detail,
but she had real circumstances.

00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:47.250 align:middle line:84%
But what she learned over
the course of this time

00:52:47.250 --> 00:52:49.620 align:middle line:84%
is that her life
made a difference,

00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:54.570 align:middle line:84%
and in that process, she
began to build self-esteem.

00:52:54.570 --> 00:52:58.440 align:middle line:84%
She began to realize
that life did have value.

00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:01.470 align:middle line:84%
All right, we're faced
with an opportunity here.

00:53:01.470 --> 00:53:05.700 align:middle line:84%
Each of us can continue to feed
the narrative that is negative,

00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:09.570 align:middle line:84%
or we can begin to feed a
service-oriented negative.

00:53:09.570 --> 00:53:11.107 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what's
going to happen.

00:53:11.107 --> 00:53:11.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Narrative.

00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:14.610 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: I don't know
what Trump's going to do.

00:53:14.610 --> 00:53:16.620 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it will be
good for the country.

00:53:16.620 --> 00:53:18.390 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it won't be
good for the country.

00:53:18.390 --> 00:53:21.060 align:middle line:84%
But what is
absolutely devastating

00:53:21.060 --> 00:53:23.890 align:middle line:90%
the country is the division.

00:53:23.890 --> 00:53:28.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's time to step up and
start healing that division.

00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:31.080 align:middle line:84%
It's time to remind us
of what's important.

00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:34.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell you that
I've had the great opportunity

00:53:34.650 --> 00:53:39.690 align:middle line:84%
of dealing with elite athletes,
Hall of Fame athletes,

00:53:39.690 --> 00:53:43.690 align:middle line:84%
Fortune 500 executives
in my lifetime.

00:53:43.690 --> 00:53:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And they will all attest
to you that if what

00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:51.480 align:middle line:84%
you do in your life is about
service-- you're a plumber,

00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:52.800 align:middle line:90%
and you go to somebody's home.

00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And you ended up going there
just to collect your money

00:53:55.260 --> 00:53:58.320 align:middle line:84%
and fix a leaky faucet and
get on to the next house.

00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:00.870 align:middle line:84%
You can't wait until
lunchtime, but you're

00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:06.360 align:middle line:84%
going there to solve a
problem, to help this person.

00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:08.130 align:middle line:84%
If that's your
attitude, doesn't matter

00:54:08.130 --> 00:54:09.550 align:middle line:90%
what you do for a living--

00:54:09.550 --> 00:54:15.210 align:middle line:84%
plumber, electrician,
attorney, radio, TV host--

00:54:15.210 --> 00:54:19.170 align:middle line:84%
if that's your attitude,
you're there to help,

00:54:19.170 --> 00:54:23.200 align:middle line:84%
then your business will
prosper, and you will prosper,

00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:25.450 align:middle line:84%
because when you put your
head on the pillow at night,

00:54:25.450 --> 00:54:29.640 align:middle line:84%
you'll get this warm fuzzy
feeling, that feeling that

00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:32.680 align:middle line:84%
says, my life does
make a difference.

00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:34.240 align:middle line:84%
I was able to help
someone today.

00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:35.810 align:middle line:84%
I was able to go
to the aid of them,

00:54:35.810 --> 00:54:38.500 align:middle line:84%
and you are just
hardwired to then

00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:43.953 align:middle line:84%
be bathed with those wonderful
neurochemicals, the endorphins,

00:54:43.953 --> 00:54:46.055 align:middle line:90%
and you will feel better.

00:54:46.055 --> 00:54:47.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with you.

00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:49.459 align:middle line:84%
I think that was
brilliant strategy

00:54:49.459 --> 00:54:51.250 align:middle line:84%
that you used to work
with it, because it's

00:54:51.250 --> 00:54:52.825 align:middle line:90%
so simple but so true.

00:54:52.825 --> 00:54:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And I think of everything we've
talked about in this interview,

00:54:55.450 --> 00:54:57.130 align:middle line:84%
the most important
thing is exactly

00:54:57.130 --> 00:54:58.720 align:middle line:90%
that, what you've just said.

00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:02.080 align:middle line:84%
If we can find a way
to calm down the noise

00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:05.800 align:middle line:84%
and in our own way, offer
something of ourselves

00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:09.400 align:middle line:84%
into the world that we think
has some value to others,

00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:10.390 align:middle line:90%
then you're right.

00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:14.140 align:middle line:84%
That starts acting as a salve
and creating connective tissue

00:55:14.140 --> 00:55:15.580 align:middle line:90%
between people again.

00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:18.610 align:middle line:84%
I think that's very true,
because we've really--

00:55:18.610 --> 00:55:23.500 align:middle line:84%
that connective tissue has
been like totally broken down.

00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:27.707 align:middle line:84%
And so in your book,
really, I think

00:55:27.707 --> 00:55:30.040 align:middle line:84%
that's really what you're
working toward in that book is

00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:31.770 align:middle line:90%
this one thing.

00:55:31.770 --> 00:55:34.090 align:middle line:84%
You don't say it
in there, but how

00:55:34.090 --> 00:55:35.752 align:middle line:84%
do we build this
connective tissue?

00:55:35.752 --> 00:55:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And I only brought
it up, because I

00:55:37.210 --> 00:55:39.940 align:middle line:84%
think we do have a unique
situation being presented

00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:43.690 align:middle line:84%
to us as a culture right
now that could continue

00:55:43.690 --> 00:55:47.440 align:middle line:84%
to be traumatized by the
media in this divisiveness,

00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:49.430 align:middle line:84%
or it can-- and I
call it unplugged.

00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:51.260 align:middle line:84%
There are other
ways to get news--

00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:55.810 align:middle line:84%
unplug, and as you say, start
being of service to another.

00:55:55.810 --> 00:55:58.200 align:middle line:90%
Start employing classic virtues.

00:55:58.200 --> 00:55:59.950 align:middle line:90%
Start telling the truth.

00:55:59.950 --> 00:56:01.075 align:middle line:90%
That would be a good place.

00:56:01.075 --> 00:56:01.950 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Absolutely.

00:56:01.950 --> 00:56:04.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Don't let these
politicians be our guide.

00:56:04.180 --> 00:56:06.370 align:middle line:84%
Start telling the truth
through each other.

00:56:06.370 --> 00:56:09.970 align:middle line:84%
So is that kind of-- is
that more what you're really

00:56:09.970 --> 00:56:11.320 align:middle line:90%
working toward in your book?

00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:13.410 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: And I think the
conclusion of "Gotcha,"

00:56:13.410 --> 00:56:16.120 align:middle line:84%
I hope people get
that out of it--

00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:19.480 align:middle line:84%
obviously, I didn't tell this
very particular story in there,

00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:25.120 align:middle line:84%
but the bottom line is
the most important thing

00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:29.390 align:middle line:84%
we can do with our own
lives is contribute.

00:56:29.390 --> 00:56:30.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:56:30.190 --> 00:56:31.773 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: There is
no way in the world

00:56:31.773 --> 00:56:38.250 align:middle line:84%
we can go off in our closet or
in church once, twice a week

00:56:38.250 --> 00:56:42.340 align:middle line:84%
or how many times we pray
a day, be spiritual people

00:56:42.340 --> 00:56:44.320 align:middle line:90%
and be disengaged.

00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:49.770 align:middle line:10%
We need to be engaged, and
we need to help one another.

00:56:49.770 --> 00:56:53.550 align:middle line:10%
And to do that, we really
need to be informed and become

00:56:53.550 --> 00:56:54.350 align:middle line:10%
authentic.

00:56:54.350 --> 00:56:56.350 align:middle line:10%
Remember who we really are.

00:56:56.350 --> 00:56:57.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:56:57.610 --> 00:57:00.040 align:middle line:84%
I agree with you, and it's
a good note to end on,

00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:03.077 align:middle line:84%
and I think it's a lovely
sentiment to leave people with.

00:57:03.077 --> 00:57:03.910 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Wonderful.

00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:04.870 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:57:04.870 --> 00:57:06.790 align:middle line:84%
I've appreciated the
opportunity to share.

00:57:06.790 --> 00:57:08.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you, Eldon.

00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:11.290 align:middle line:10%
Again, the title of the book
is, "Gotcha: The Subordination
