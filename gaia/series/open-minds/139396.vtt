00:00:28.124 --> 00:00:30.290 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: Jack
Cary is back with us today.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.960 align:middle line:10%
In our last conversation, we
spoke about people disappearing

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.550 align:middle line:10%
from our US park lands.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.280 align:middle line:84%
And there's been some new
evidence in this arena, which

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.050 align:middle line:90%
we will pick up on today.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.140 align:middle line:84%
But meanwhile, we're going to
go on the search for Bigfoot.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.950 align:middle line:84%
And toward that end, let's take
a look at a little video clip.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.470 align:middle line:10%
>> Breaking news out of Texas--

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.220 align:middle line:10%
Bigfoot is real.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.270 align:middle line:10%
According to a group
of researchers.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.230 align:middle line:10%
They call themselves the
Sasquatch Genome Project,

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.510 align:middle line:10%
and they released what
they say is proof.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.150 align:middle line:10%
Several never-before-seen
short video clips

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.850 align:middle line:10%
of the legendary and
very shy creature.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.849 align:middle line:10%
The group spent five
years and $500,000

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:06.500 align:middle line:10%
coming to this conclusion.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.840 align:middle line:10%
One clip is of
Sasquatch sleeping,

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.260 align:middle line:10%
shot during the day in
Kentucky, back in 2005.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.790 align:middle line:10%
>> We've all had experiences
that have changed our lives.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, literally
shook the foundations

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.210 align:middle line:90%
of what we believe in.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.475 align:middle line:10%
>> Besides the video, they
say they also have DNA proof

00:01:23.475 --> 00:01:25.105 align:middle line:10%
of Bigfoot's existence.

00:01:25.105 --> 00:01:27.230 align:middle line:10%
One of the researchers
stressed that their work has

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.120 align:middle line:10%
been a, quote, "serious study."

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.457 align:middle line:90%


00:01:32.457 --> 00:01:34.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You know,
it's fascinating.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.670 align:middle line:84%
I've seen a little bit
of these clips before,

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.310 align:middle line:84%
and one of the things is the
naysayers always say, oh, it's

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.180 align:middle line:90%
just someone in a gorilla suit.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.980 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And this is always
the first thing

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.630 align:middle line:84%
that comes up is the
authentication of the videos.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.280 align:middle line:84%
And first, let's just talk about
that for a moment to the best

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.080 align:middle line:90%
you can.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.500 align:middle line:90%
>>JACK CARY: Sure.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.860 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:52.970 align:middle line:90%
I would appreciate that.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:53.770 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Sure.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.430 align:middle line:10%
Well, as in the case--

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.370 align:middle line:10%
the famous
Patterson-Gimlin film where

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.790 align:middle line:10%
they were stating that this
had to be an individual,

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.340 align:middle line:10%
all the skeptics-- this is a
guy in a gorilla suit walking

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.180 align:middle line:10%
along, had to have been faked.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.360 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting is they
never take into account the year

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.520 align:middle line:84%
in which that film was produced
and taken, which was 1967.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, in Hollywood at the
time, the best monkey suits

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.610 align:middle line:84%
anywhere in the world
were being utilized

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.525 align:middle line:84%
on the set of
"Planet of the Apes."

00:02:24.525 --> 00:02:26.150 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: "Planet
of the Apes," right.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Cost them
$1 million a day

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.140 align:middle line:84%
to dress those actors
in those uniforms,

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.250 align:middle line:84%
and they don't hold a
candle to the creature

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.110 align:middle line:90%
in the Patterson-Gimlin film.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.500 align:middle line:84%
Not one credible Hollywood
makeup artist has ever said,

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.850 align:middle line:90%
oh, yeah, that was me.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.284 align:middle line:84%
That's-- they would wear that
like a trophy had that ever--

00:02:44.284 --> 00:02:45.200 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They would.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.491 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Had that been the case.

00:02:46.491 --> 00:02:48.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's the kind of
technology it would take.

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, the arm itself is
beyond human length.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.410 align:middle line:90%
It's been measured.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.560 align:middle line:84%
And yet in one of the
frames, the creature

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.240 align:middle line:90%
squeezes its fingers.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, animatronics
were a thing that they

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.900 align:middle line:84%
were dreaming
about in that year,

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.820 align:middle line:84%
and yet that's the
kind of technology that

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.350 align:middle line:84%
would be required in order to
produce that kind of a hoax.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.250 align:middle line:84%
So in a lot of these videos,
like Matilda that you guys just

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.212 align:middle line:84%
showed in Kentucky, you have to
take into account the context

00:03:21.212 --> 00:03:22.295 align:middle line:90%
in which it's being shown.

00:03:22.295 --> 00:03:27.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, that film was always
presented along with actual DNA

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.430 align:middle line:90%
evidence to back it up.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.350 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, we're
going to get to that.

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.270 align:middle line:84%
The one with the Sasquatch
sleeping in the woods--

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --can you talk
about that a little bit?

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:36.470 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Sure.

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:37.940 align:middle line:90%
That's Matilda.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.730 align:middle line:84%
They were able to
basically tranquilizer her.

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.640 align:middle line:84%
Bait her and tranquillizer
her and walk right up to her.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.160 align:middle line:84%
They took samples of
fur right off of her,

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.650 align:middle line:84%
and then they filmed are
waking up at the end.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, the man who funded that
project, Adrian Erickson,

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.220 align:middle line:84%
spent $500,000 of his own
money in order to obtain those

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.440 align:middle line:84%
results just to prove
it to the public.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.940 align:middle line:84%
There was never any attempt by
which to regain that funding.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.300 align:middle line:84%
There was never any attempt
to profit from it whatsoever,

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.670 align:middle line:84%
which is what you would
expect if he were spending

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:11.754 align:middle line:90%
$500,000 on a monkey suit.

00:04:11.754 --> 00:04:13.753 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You'd think
he'd want his money back.

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:14.553 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:04:14.553 --> 00:04:15.353 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:04:15.353 --> 00:04:16.850 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: And instead
what he got was

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.950 align:middle line:84%
a day of worldwide publicity
where everybody was excited,

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.980 align:middle line:84%
everybody was beginning to
accept the notion that Bigfoot

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:25.970 align:middle line:90%
was real.

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.447 align:middle line:84%
And the next day, you
could hear crickets.

00:04:28.447 --> 00:04:29.280 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.040 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: There was nothing.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.350 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's how these
things always go though--

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.315 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --with
the mainstream media.

00:04:34.315 --> 00:04:36.060 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
that day itself.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.030 align:middle line:84%
I want to know about how
they knew where to find--

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Well, this was an
area that the property owner

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.540 align:middle line:90%
had seen them numerous times.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:46.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Numerous times, OK.

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: And they had Melba
Ketchum, Dr. Melba Ketchum,

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.600 align:middle line:84%
who did the first Bigfoot
genome study actually

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.900 align:middle line:84%
out to that property, in which
one day she saw five of them.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.140 align:middle line:84%
So there was an
entire family unit

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.550 align:middle line:90%
living on this remote property.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:03.350 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.000 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Where
was this located?

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: In
southeastern Kentucky,

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.600 align:middle line:84%
I believe, is where
that property is.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's just so heavily
wooded with very--

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.810 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: --very
few humans around.

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.682 align:middle line:84%
We suspect that that clan grew
up not even really fearing man.

00:05:19.682 --> 00:05:21.890 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, that's what
I was just going to say,

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:23.790 align:middle line:84%
because normally they're
so shy of humanity.

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:24.590 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And this particular
female, whether or not she

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.560 align:middle line:84%
had some kind of medical
issue or she just

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.885 align:middle line:84%
was never around humans, never
learned to fear them or what.

00:05:33.885 --> 00:05:36.260 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So they were able
to get pretty close in order

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.074 align:middle line:90%
to tranquilize her?

00:05:37.074 --> 00:05:38.240 align:middle line:90%
How did this all come about?

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.945 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: No, they left
meat with tranquilizers.

00:05:39.945 --> 00:05:40.880 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:41.240 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.670 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: --once they knew an
area she was hanging out in,

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.255 align:middle line:90%
they just nailed it to a tree.

00:05:45.255 --> 00:05:46.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, I see.

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.769 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: And she took it off
the tree, ate it, fell asleep.

00:05:48.769 --> 00:05:50.310 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Not
vegetarian, obviously.

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.480 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.917 align:middle line:90%
No, they're omnivorous.

00:05:52.917 --> 00:05:53.717 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:05:53.717 --> 00:05:54.517 align:middle line:90%
Right, right.

00:05:54.517 --> 00:05:57.110 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: They eat
deer and elk, mainly.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.126 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah, and they were
able to walk right up to her.

00:06:00.126 --> 00:06:03.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, this should have been
world wide reality-changing--

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:04.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You bet.

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:05.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: --news, you know.

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.470 align:middle line:84%
And yet the next day,
not a single story of it

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:10.967 align:middle line:90%
was running on mainstream media.

00:06:10.967 --> 00:06:13.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Amazing, considering
there's virtually not a person

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.410 align:middle line:84%
in the world that's had any
contact with humanity at all

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:18.290 align:middle line:84%
that's not curious
about this phenomenon.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:19.730 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right, exactly.

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:24.280 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, so let's get
onto the DNA sample itself.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.700 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Uh-huh, right.

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.640 align:middle line:90%
So the DNA is--

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.520 align:middle line:90%
it was part of a genome study.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.360 align:middle line:84%
This is-- that was the
first genome study.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.420 align:middle line:84%
There's been a second

different DNA deposits

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:43.760 align:middle line:84%
that JC Johnson and I, and a few
of the other members of Crypto

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.230 align:middle line:84%
Four Corners, were able to
get leads on right away.

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:50.300 align:middle line:84%
So within a 24-hour
period, we got calls

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.730 align:middle line:84%
from two separate
Navajo groups claiming

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.460 align:middle line:84%
that they had an eyewitness
who said that they

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.580 align:middle line:84%
saw DNA being left
by Ye'iitsoh, which

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.710 align:middle line:90%
is what they call Bigfoot.

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:01.970 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: DNA being left?

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:02.240 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.406 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: What's that mean?

00:07:03.406 --> 00:07:05.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: So on one
property, a gentleman

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.380 align:middle line:84%
had an old ramshackle
shack, lots

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:12.740 align:middle line:84%
of boards that had
all kinds of splinters

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.230 align:middle line:84%
and stuff coming
off the side of it.

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And this thing
rubbed up against it.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.205 align:middle line:84%
And when it did, it left
maybe 10,000 hair strands.

00:07:20.205 --> 00:07:22.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was literally
covered in fur.

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:23.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:27.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: And then it ran off,
leaving 16-inch footprints,

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:29.520 align:middle line:84%
which I have on my
website, by the way,

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.910 align:middle line:90%
which are just phenomenal.

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:31.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Take a look at this.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: I mean,
they're 16-inch prints.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:33.930 align:middle line:90%
If those don't--

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:34.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, that's amazing.

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And they're, you know,
three inches deep

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.230 align:middle line:90%
in this hardpan train.

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:42.360 align:middle line:84%
It was either Shaquille
O'Neal out there--

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:42.740 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.406 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: --bare-footing

00:07:44.406 --> 00:07:48.100 align:middle line:84%

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:48.900 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.630 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So we have two
verifiable DNA samples--

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:52.430 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --from

>>CARY: Right.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, what's interesting is
that during that same 24-hour

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:00.800 align:middle line:84%
period, we got another call
from a group of Navajos that

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:05.420 align:middle line:84%
were 80 miles apart in terrain
that was just brutal hardpan

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:09.440 align:middle line:84%
desert between these two
mountains of boreal forest.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.510 align:middle line:84%
And we arrived at
the second site,

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:14.150 align:middle line:84%
and here a group
of Navajo Indians

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:17.600 align:middle line:84%
had been using chainsaws
to cut down wood

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.289 align:middle line:90%
on one copse of trees.

00:08:20.289 --> 00:08:22.580 align:middle line:84%
And when they did, they
spooked one of these creatures.

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:25.580 align:middle line:84%
And it ran out the other
side of this copse of trees

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:29.330 align:middle line:84%
not realizing there was yet
another Navajo chopping wood

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.690 align:middle line:90%
with an axe on the other side.

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:35.690 align:middle line:84%
Sees that gentleman, takes
off in yet another direction

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:36.799 align:middle line:90%
looking over its shoulder.

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:39.799 align:middle line:84%
And when it did, it smacked
right into a seven-foot tree.

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:41.630 align:middle line:90%
Broken it right in half.

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:44.870 align:middle line:84%
Left all kinds of
blood, skin, and fur all

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:47.600 align:middle line:84%
over it, which was
still fresh when we

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.420 align:middle line:90%
arrived on scene that same day.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, we had Dr. Christopher
Dyer of the University

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:58.910 align:middle line:84%
of New Mexico with us,
supervising us, taking the DNA.

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:01.264 align:middle line:84%
So that we were absolutely
certain that there

00:09:01.264 --> 00:09:02.180 align:middle line:90%
was no contamination--

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:02.810 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No contamination.

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:04.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: --taking place.

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:05.420 align:middle line:90%
We wanted it to be pristine.

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:09.290 align:middle line:84%
So those went into a second
genome study in an attempt

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:10.460 align:middle line:90%
to verify the first.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:14.484 align:middle line:84%
And low and behold, it verified
the findings that Dr. Ketchum--

00:09:14.484 --> 00:09:15.650 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Of the first one?

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:17.191 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: --came up
with the first one.

00:09:17.191 --> 00:09:20.210 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: First of all,

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:21.582 align:middle line:90%
which labs did you use?

00:09:21.582 --> 00:09:22.790 align:middle line:90%
And what were they noted for?

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:23.950 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Dr. Ketchum's lab.

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:24.210 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:24.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Yeah.

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:24.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:25.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Yeah.

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:25.830 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:26.990 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Absolutely.

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:28.730 align:middle line:84%
A lot of geneticists
won't even touch it.

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:29.530 align:middle line:90%
Unless--

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:30.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
what I was wondering.

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:31.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:34.370 align:middle line:84%
Unless you send in as
an anonymous sample

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:37.220 align:middle line:84%
without them knowing what it
is looking for the result,

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:38.170 align:middle line:90%
which has been done.

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:42.110 align:middle line:84%
The problem is is that those
different laboratories always

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:43.940 align:middle line:84%
come back saying
it's contaminated,

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:46.220 align:middle line:84%
because it's showing
human DNA in it.

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:47.180 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:49.580 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: They refuse to
accept the fact that this

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.980 align:middle line:90%
is a human hybrid species.

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And even some of the more
established names like Todd

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Disotell and people like that
who have run their own genome

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:02.720 align:middle line:84%
studies keep saying, well,
this has got human DNA in it.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.840 align:middle line:90%
It must be contaminated.

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:05.640 align:middle line:90%
Well, no.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.720 align:middle line:84%
It has human DNA because
this creature interbred

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.430 align:middle line:90%
with archaic humans.

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And on the mitochondrial, or
the mother's lineage side,

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.530 align:middle line:84%
it shows that 12,000 to 15,000
years ago, during the Younger

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:22.880 align:middle line:84%
Dryas period, there was an
unmapped, uncatalogued hominid

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.940 align:middle line:84%
species that was
walking the earth.

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And when the comet
hit the earth, which

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:30.710 align:middle line:84%
is what defines the
Younger Dryas period,

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:33.110 align:middle line:84%
there was a megafaunal
extinction taking place

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:34.700 align:middle line:90%
all over the planet.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:39.110 align:middle line:84%
When that occurs, species
that have similar DNA makeups

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:40.570 align:middle line:90%
tend to interbreed--

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:41.370 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:43.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: --out of an
instinctive of survival.

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:45.560 align:middle line:90%
That's what happened this time.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.560 align:middle line:84%
This creature, this
non-documented hominid,

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.840 align:middle line:84%
interbred with
archaic human females,

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:54.410 align:middle line:84%
and they produced the
lineage that we call Bigfoot.

00:10:54.410 --> 00:11:01.400 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So how does this
compare genetically to, say,

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.080 align:middle line:90%
the ape?

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Well, in
apes, they don't

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:08.900 align:middle line:84%
have what we would describe
as modern human DNA.

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.869 align:middle line:84%
They came from the
same tree, you know--

00:11:11.869 --> 00:11:12.952 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Long, long ago.

00:11:12.952 --> 00:11:13.390 align:middle line:90%
Yes, exactly.

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:14.310 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: A long, long time ago.

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:15.110 align:middle line:90%
These things--

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:17.780 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So these are closer
to human than they are now

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:19.230 align:middle line:90%
to the great ancestral ape.

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:20.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:22.040 align:middle line:84%
You're talking 12,000
to 15,000 years ago.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.274 align:middle line:84%
It's a blink of an eye
an evolutionary terms.

00:11:24.274 --> 00:11:25.190 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:27.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: So the reason
why people always

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.030 align:middle line:84%
ask, well, how
come you can't just

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:30.560 align:middle line:90%
walk up on a group of them?

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.600 align:middle line:84%
You know, ask Dian
Fossey how long

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:36.410 align:middle line:84%
it took her to walk up on a
group of mountain gorillas.

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:40.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, these things are a
hundred times the capability

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:41.330 align:middle line:90%
of a mountain gorilla.

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.160 align:middle line:84%
They can smell you
from two miles away.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, and my
understanding is they have

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.560 align:middle line:90%
very--

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.100 align:middle line:84%
they're very capable in terms

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:48.900 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Absolutely.

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --their

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:52.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Absolutely.

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:55.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, we do have a lot
of what I would consider

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.620 align:middle line:84%
circumstantial evidence
that these creatures are

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:02.660 align:middle line:84%
able to admit ELF
wave frequencies--

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:05.300 align:middle line:90%
Extremely Low Frequencies.

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:08.600 align:middle line:84%
Much like an elephant would
communicate long distance.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.430 align:middle line:84%
These creatures also
have that ability.

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:13.460 align:middle line:84%
But with these
creatures, it appears

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:15.350 align:middle line:84%
as though they're able
to use this ability

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:18.110 align:middle line:90%
to even paralyze prey.

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:19.360 align:middle line:90%
Now, we've had many--

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.140 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Very interesting.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:20.360 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Yeah.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.430 align:middle line:84%
We've had many credible

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:24.417 align:middle line:90%
had this deer in my sights.

00:12:24.417 --> 00:12:26.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting ready
to pull the trigger.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.580 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden I see
this deer just freezes.

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:29.380 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:31.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: It's just frozen solid.

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And then the bushes
begin to rustle,

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:36.680 align:middle line:84%
and this big giant hairy man
stepped out of the bushes

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.810 align:middle line:84%

they were a little alarmed.

upright walking figures

Indian reservation land.

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:03.940 align:middle line:84%

a group of five or six

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:06.369 align:middle line:84%
of these creatures who
had dug a big hole,

00:17:06.369 --> 00:17:08.410 align:middle line:84%

But what was interesting
about his recounting

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:18.160 align:middle line:84%
was that they placed some kind
of objects down into the grave

And at the same time,
examining Native American lore.

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:04.600 align:middle line:84%
A long, long time ago,
when I was very young,

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:10.030 align:middle line:84%
I had a Cherokee medicine
man tell me, they're real.

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:12.560 align:middle line:90%
And they live underground.

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:13.810 align:middle line:90%
And that always stuck with me.

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:16.240 align:middle line:84%
I always thought that
was the strangest thing,

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.410 align:middle line:90%
this man telling me this.

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:18.580 align:middle line:90%
It had to be made up.

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:21.460 align:middle line:90%
Just had to be made up.

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And then we come to discover
on one of the properties

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:30.040 align:middle line:84%
where we found the first
DNA deposit, a cave up

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:33.100 align:middle line:90%
high on a cliff area.

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And when we entered the
cave, we found all kinds

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:39.790 align:middle line:84%
of evergreen bows that had
been snapped off and brought up

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:42.080 align:middle line:84%
there, cedar wood,
which was fascinating.

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:44.647 align:middle line:84%
And hair that matched
the hair that we

00:18:44.647 --> 00:18:45.730 align:middle line:90%
had collected at the site.

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:47.260 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And this
would obscure the opening

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:47.860 align:middle line:90%
to the cave?

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:48.670 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:51.580 align:middle line:84%
And we've also
discovered that they're

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:56.170 align:middle line:84%
using the millions of little
small undocumented cave systems

00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:58.840 align:middle line:90%
all through North America.

00:18:58.840 --> 00:18:59.880 align:middle line:90%
They're everywhere.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:02.980 align:middle line:84%
If you walk out into
the woods of Colorado

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:05.110 align:middle line:84%
in a random direction
off a trail,

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:07.030 align:middle line:84%
you're going to come
across a rock face

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:09.880 align:middle line:84%
at some point that's
peppered with little caves.

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:12.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, those are ideal
habitats for these things.

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:13.190 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:14.650 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: And we know that
they're doing something

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:15.520 align:middle line:90%
with their dead.

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:18.010 align:middle line:84%
There's a reason why we
don't find the remains out

00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:20.265 align:middle line:84%
in the wild, because these
things are actually--

00:19:20.265 --> 00:19:21.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They don't want
to be lab experiments.

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:22.300 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: That's right.

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:25.240 align:middle line:84%
They're being-- they dispose of
their dead because they value

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:26.837 align:middle line:90%
them as, you know whether--

00:19:26.837 --> 00:19:27.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: As we do.

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:28.470 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Yeah.

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:31.180 align:middle line:84%
They might even consume them
as a form of ancestor worship,

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:33.490 align:middle line:84%
which was something done
in many primitive cultures,

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:38.840 align:middle line:84%
you know, to absorb the powers
of your progenitors and so on.

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:42.550 align:middle line:84%
But we've also discovered that
in different areas where there

00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:44.800 align:middle line:84%
aren't caves
available, they will

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:47.922 align:middle line:84%
walk right up to a huge
boulder, a huge rock

00:19:47.922 --> 00:19:49.630 align:middle line:84%
face in the middle of
the woods, and they

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:54.790 align:middle line:84%
will dig out an enormous cavity
underneath that rock face.

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:59.140 align:middle line:84%
Then they reach up and pull
all the brush around them

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:00.910 align:middle line:84%
up over the hole
so you can't even

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:03.320 align:middle line:90%
tell that there's a hole there.

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:06.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Have they been
witnessed using tools?

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:09.310 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: In a number of
times we've witnessed them.

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:13.330 align:middle line:84%
And they've been witness using
rocks, sticks, things like--

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:17.820 align:middle line:84%
some of them have been seen
carrying a staff-like stick.

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:19.930 align:middle line:84%
Who knows what
they're doing with it.

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:24.010 align:middle line:84%
But they don't seem to have
any sort of, you know, use for,

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:25.104 align:middle line:90%
like, bone-made tools.

00:20:25.104 --> 00:20:26.395 align:middle line:90%
They're not making arrowheads--

00:20:26.395 --> 00:20:27.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:27.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: --and things like that.

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They have higher
technology at their disposal.

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:30.242 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:20:30.242 --> 00:20:31.825 align:middle line:84%
When you can just
freeze your prey--

00:20:31.825 --> 00:20:32.140 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:33.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: --why make an
arrowhead, you know?

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:34.840 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:38.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, and also, I mean, we've
all read, through the years,

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:40.030 align:middle line:90%
certain anecdotal stories.

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:42.160 align:middle line:84%
But from your
research, what are some

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:45.670 align:middle line:84%
of the more profound
types of direct encounters

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:49.090 align:middle line:84%
humans have had
with the species?

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:51.854 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Well, in some of the
more profound less scary--

00:20:51.854 --> 00:20:53.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, less scary.

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:56.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: --encounters,
there was a woman

00:20:56.500 --> 00:21:00.910 align:middle line:84%
who was around the Durango
area who was actually training

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:02.990 align:middle line:90%
llamas to be trail llamas.

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:03.910 align:middle line:90%
That was her job.

00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:06.337 align:middle line:84%
So you can rent a llama,
you put all your gear on it,

00:21:06.337 --> 00:21:08.170 align:middle line:84%
and then you take it
down the Colorado Trail

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:10.750 align:middle line:84%
and it carries all the weight
and you have all the fun.

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:12.277 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:21:12.277 --> 00:21:13.860 align:middle line:84%
Not so great for the
llama, but, yeah.

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:14.680 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:18.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, she picked out a--
she had a sick sheep,

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:22.390 align:middle line:84%
and she decided to just
hole up where she was,

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:26.200 align:middle line:84%
which was near the Jerosa
Mesa down in Durango.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of water
source and beautiful habitat

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:30.470 align:middle line:90%
down there.

00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:33.080 align:middle line:84%
So she picks out this
little opening in the woods,

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:35.070 align:middle line:90%
and she pitches her tent.

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And she's got a
little dog with her,

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:39.620 align:middle line:84%
and every once in a while
this dog keeps running off

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:44.550 align:middle line:84%
into the wood line and comes
back covered in feces each

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:45.350 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:46.320 align:middle line:90%
And she's like, oh, my god.

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.720 align:middle line:84%
Must have found
something-- it's just--

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:47.910 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's rolling.

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:48.710 align:middle line:90%
Dogs love that.

00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:51.105 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: --rolling and rolling
in this thing, you know.

00:21:51.105 --> 00:21:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And so that kind of put
her off a little bit.

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And she's there
for a day or two,

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:57.390 align:middle line:84%
and she keeps noticing
that her sheep are all

00:21:57.390 --> 00:22:01.245 align:middle line:84%
looking off in the same
direction every so often.

00:22:01.245 --> 00:22:04.620 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't happen
unless they collectively

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:07.680 align:middle line:90%
sense some kind of danger.

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And two days after
she had been there,

00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:16.530 align:middle line:84%
she steps out of her tent,
looks up, and looks over

00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:19.080 align:middle line:84%
across the tent and there's
a Sasquatch standing

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.990 align:middle line:90%
right there looking at her.

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:26.820 align:middle line:84%
And she said, in this amazingly
beautiful and loving way,

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:28.620 align:middle line:90%
she wasn't scared at all.

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:29.420 align:middle line:90%
Total peace.

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:31.485 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So they were
transmitting an intention--

00:22:31.485 --> 00:22:31.740 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:32.155 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --of peace.

00:22:32.155 --> 00:22:32.955 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:22:32.955 --> 00:22:35.160 align:middle line:84%
Total peace and love
is all she felt.

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden, a little one

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:41.490 align:middle line:84%
stepped out from behind the
mama and looked right at her.

00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And she said at that moment she
got such a pure feeling of joy

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:48.085 align:middle line:90%
and happiness in the world.

00:22:48.085 --> 00:22:49.710 align:middle line:84%
And she also made
the statement that it

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:52.320 align:middle line:84%
took about two blinks of
an eye for those things

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:55.080 align:middle line:84%
turned and took off
through the woods so fast

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.404 align:middle line:90%
that it was like a flash of--

00:22:56.404 --> 00:22:57.570 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, superhuman.

00:22:57.570 --> 00:22:58.050 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: --light.

00:22:58.050 --> 00:22:58.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:58.500 --> 00:22:58.650 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:22:58.650 --> 00:22:59.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: That kind
of speed, yeah.

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:00.400 align:middle line:90%
It's unbelievable.

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:04.380 align:middle line:84%
And then, conversely--
it's interesting.

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:06.090 align:middle line:84%
It was a woman, and
she wasn't afraid.

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:06.990 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:08.364 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What
are some of the--

00:23:08.364 --> 00:23:10.267 align:middle line:84%
maybe give an example
of an encounter that

00:23:10.267 --> 00:23:12.600 align:middle line:84%
may have been more frightening,
whether it was justified

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:13.934 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:23:13.934 --> 00:23:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Well, there
have been encounters

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:18.270 align:middle line:84%
where it appears as
though they've caused

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:19.830 align:middle line:90%
a death, a human death.

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:22.781 align:middle line:90%
We've had plenty of those occur.

00:23:22.781 --> 00:23:25.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What was the
circumstance though, I wonder?

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:27.180 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Well, it's--
guns are always involved.

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:28.350 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
what I would assume.

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:28.860 align:middle line:90%
There's a threat.

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:29.660 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:33.210 align:middle line:84%
In this particular case, this
guy who was shooting at--

00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:35.700 align:middle line:84%
he was on his way to go camping,
but he stopped at, like,

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:38.490 align:middle line:84%
a reservoir right on the
edge of the wilderness.

00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:42.830 align:middle line:84%
And he sets up a target, and he
starts shooting stuff, targets.

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:43.830 align:middle line:90%
And he's shooting there.

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:49.010 align:middle line:84%
He's right at twilight time,
and all they found was--

00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:50.760 align:middle line:84%
and we-- there was
like three, or four

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:52.350 align:middle line:84%
or five different
Bigfoot sightings

00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:55.510 align:middle line:84%
in that same area around the
area where he was shooting,

00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:57.930 align:middle line:84%
and they were going to-- he
was going to meet his sister

00:23:57.930 --> 00:24:00.490 align:middle line:84%
and her husband for
a night of camping.

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:03.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, they found him
turned upside down and bent

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:08.490 align:middle line:84%
backwards inside of
the driver's side car.

00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:12.960 align:middle line:84%
Literally broken in half
and then shoved down

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:17.939 align:middle line:84%
into this car, which would take,
you know, superhuman strength--

come across one of
these creatures that

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:29.739 align:middle line:84%
was very, very irritated that
he had a gun in that area.

00:24:29.739 --> 00:24:32.030 align:middle line:84%

Such a beautiful creature,

00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:55.030 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: In fact, when
he pulled his gun up,

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:57.120 align:middle line:84%

00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:00.067 align:middle line:84%

shoot, please don't shoot.

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:06.294 align:middle line:90%

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:23.850 align:middle line:90%
He's not.

>>CARY: Well, he said, well,
if I saw a baboon in the woods,

00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:39.810 align:middle line:84%
I would shoot it
as well, because it

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:40.830 align:middle line:90%
doesn't belong there.

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:41.190 align:middle line:90%

>>CARY: You know, he has
that kind of mentality.

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:47.190 align:middle line:90%
for something.

00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:50.020 align:middle line:84%

this mythical creature

come right out into
the road after they

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:01.670 align:middle line:90%

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:29.000 align:middle line:90%
DNA-wise.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.630 align:middle line:90%
And they want to be left alone.

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:33.620 align:middle line:84%
What is our moral responsibility

in the pursuit of verifying
publicly, worldwide,

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:50.190 align:middle line:84%
that this creature exists is
to push humanity into a corner,

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:53.460 align:middle line:84%
to make them come
to a realization

00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:55.980 align:middle line:84%
that the reality
that they live in

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:59.820 align:middle line:84%
isn't exactly what they've
come to believe that it is,

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:03.300 align:middle line:84%
that a creature like this
can exist still in a world

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:06.780 align:middle line:84%
where you have
skyscrapers and airplanes.

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:10.470 align:middle line:84%
And the expectation and

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:13.620 align:middle line:90%
to broaden their horizons.

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:18.900 align:middle line:84%
perhaps create a real problem
with their existing belief

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:21.180 align:middle line:84%
system, which will
then cause them

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:25.650 align:middle line:84%
to open doors of their
own mind, to become

00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:29.130 align:middle line:84%
accepting of the
universe and the reality

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:31.830 align:middle line:84%
that they're living in
instead of living basically

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:36.140 align:middle line:84%
like an ostrich with
their head in the sand.

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:38.590 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Perhaps to develop
respect for our difference.

00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:39.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Exactly.

00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, if a creature
like Bigfoot can exist,

00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:45.026 align:middle line:90%
then almost anything can.

00:27:45.026 --> 00:27:47.400 align:middle line:84%

>>CARY: That's right.

00:27:48.274 --> 00:27:49.800 align:middle line:90%
And it does exist.

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.810 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the
thing, to get them

00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:56.130 align:middle line:84%
to accept the idea that,
wow, these things can exist.

00:27:56.130 --> 00:28:00.120 align:middle line:84%
The universe is so much bigger,
so much more magical, so

much more beautiful than I
had ever imagined before.

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:09.120 align:middle line:84%

this species, of setting
up lands where they can

00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:17.310 align:middle line:84%
be left alone and studied
from a scientific perspective,

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:20.090 align:middle line:84%
without us imposing
our humanity on them.

you might as well
shoot a unicorn.

>>CARY: You know what I mean?

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:49.640 align:middle line:84%
You can go into public

and they'll laugh at you.

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:53.430 align:middle line:84%
And you just got away
with a major crime.

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:55.050 align:middle line:90%
This thing has human DNA.

00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:56.804 align:middle line:90%

what drives you is to get that

00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:05.535 align:middle line:90%
acceptance?

You know, even being a

and exposed to the constant
everyday strange and weird

00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:41.250 align:middle line:84%
in the world, to accept the
reality of an upright walking

00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:48.460 align:middle line:84%
canine species is a whole
different level of acceptance.

00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:51.880 align:middle line:84%
With Sasquatch, we have
a biological explanation

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:56.140 align:middle line:84%
for why a creature like
that can and does exist.

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:59.350 align:middle line:84%
There really isn't a
biological explanation

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:01.780 align:middle line:84%
for an upright walking
canine creature,

00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:05.530 align:middle line:84%

that, in our society, their
testimony in a court of law

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:21.520 align:middle line:90%
could convict someone.

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:30.520 align:middle line:90%
Explain what these are.

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:34.030 align:middle line:10%
>>CARY: So the earliest

beginning to see,

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:41.530 align:middle line:84%
as they spread across North
America, these upright walking

canine-like creatures.

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:52.450 align:middle line:84%
A Dog Man, we've discovered,
is a much better name

00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:54.250 align:middle line:84%
for what these things
are, because they

00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:58.620 align:middle line:84%
look more dog-like than
wolf-like in appearance.

00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:02.290 align:middle line:84%
They seem to have very,
very dog-like legs,

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:04.900 align:middle line:84%
but what's interesting
is that the legs seem

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:07.270 align:middle line:84%

that where, right now the dogs,

00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:23.110 align:middle line:84%
you have this very flat area
up where they're-- it kind

00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:26.320 align:middle line:84%
of extends from where
the pads of the feet are.

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:29.140 align:middle line:84%
That has now been pushed
down to the ground.

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:31.810 align:middle line:90%
So what you have are the paw--

00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:35.230 align:middle line:84%
the normal paw print
of a very large dog,

00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:36.760 align:middle line:90%
but with this very long--

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:37.560 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Back.

00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:43.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I see.

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:46.504 align:middle line:84%

part of this evolutionary leap

00:31:46.504 --> 00:31:47.420 align:middle line:90%

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:48.940 align:middle line:84%
&Gt;> REGINA: So
it's behind the pad?

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:49.740 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:51.010 align:middle line:90%

Very, very quickly run upright,
as though they have been

00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:00.250 align:middle line:90%
doing this for a long time.

00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:04.090 align:middle line:10%
Now, when you look into
the history of ancient dog

00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:06.310 align:middle line:10%
sightings, you come
across Marco Polo

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:09.370 align:middle line:10%
and his description
of Cynocephali,

00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:10.300 align:middle line:10%
is what it's called.

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:13.810 align:middle line:10%
And he claims to have seen
an entire island of this dog

00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:16.890 align:middle line:10%
species, that they
were trading with them.

00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:20.164 align:middle line:84%
There are ancient tapestries
depicting them that--

00:32:20.164 --> 00:32:21.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Trading
what with them?

00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:23.340 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: All kinds of goods.

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:28.310 align:middle line:84%
That they were that socialized
at one point in history,

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:30.010 align:middle line:90%
and that they had a society.

00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:32.130 align:middle line:84%
Called-- they gave it
a name, Cynocephali.

00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:34.720 align:middle line:84%
You can look it up, which
is just fascinating, right?

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:37.510 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So they were-- it
was not just natural goods

00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:38.625 align:middle line:90%
but manufactured goods?

00:32:38.625 --> 00:32:39.425 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Yeah.

00:32:43.824 --> 00:32:44.740 align:middle line:90%
that was being traded.

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:46.420 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, they would
certainly have a good sense

00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:47.503 align:middle line:90%

00:32:47.503 --> 00:32:48.950 align:middle line:84%

00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:49.240 align:middle line:90%

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:50.615 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: And it's

00:32:50.615 --> 00:32:53.020 align:middle line:84%
at these ancient tapestries

00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:54.376 align:middle line:90%
And you think to yourself--

00:32:54.376 --> 00:32:57.000 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so we're looking
at one of those tapestries now.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.760 align:middle line:90%
That-- that's amazing.

00:32:58.760 --> 00:32:59.770 align:middle line:90%
Where did you find this?

00:32:59.770 --> 00:33:00.650 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:03.040 align:middle line:84%
You can get it off a
simple Google search.

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And then when you begin to
actually look into Cynocephali

00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:07.570 align:middle line:84%
and all of the
historical references

00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:12.130 align:middle line:84%
to it that existed in ancient
history, it's just fascinating.

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And then we have these
modern day Dog Man

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:18.040 align:middle line:84%
accounts of these same
upright walking creatures.

00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:20.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's fascinating,
in North America,

00:33:20.890 --> 00:33:23.260 align:middle line:84%
in Wisconsin in
the late 1800s, you

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:26.770 align:middle line:84%
had the very first sightings
of these Dog Men-- documented

00:33:26.770 --> 00:33:29.590 align:middle line:90%
sightings-- by white settlers.

00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And in that same
area of Wisconsin

00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:36.910 align:middle line:84%
they have what's called
Aztalan State Park.

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:41.680 align:middle line:84%
At this state park,
they have step pyramids

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.140 align:middle line:84%
that were built by
an indigenous people.

00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:48.070 align:middle line:84%
They were discovered by a man
who had settled in that area,

00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:50.862 align:middle line:84%
and he named it Aztalan
State Park after the Aztecs--

00:33:50.862 --> 00:33:51.820 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:53.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: --because they
had seen the same step

00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:56.200 align:middle line:90%
pyramids in Mexico.

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:57.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, what's
fascinating is that when

00:33:57.970 --> 00:34:01.750 align:middle line:84%
you begin to study the
Aztec lore and oral history,

00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:05.710 align:middle line:84%
they claim that they
came from the far north

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:09.170 align:middle line:84%
and a place of snow and
a place that was icy.

00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:11.440 align:middle line:90%
A place like Wisconsin.

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:14.440 align:middle line:84%
And that one of their leaders
had a vision one night,

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:17.920 align:middle line:84%
and he claimed that he was
told that the tribe needed

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:23.110 align:middle line:84%
to uproot and to go south
until they saw an eagle eating

00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:26.380 align:middle line:84%
a snake on top of a
barbed tree, a symbol

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:29.830 align:middle line:84%
that you can still find on
the Mexican flag to this day.

00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:32.380 align:middle line:90%
They went that far south.

00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:35.650 align:middle line:84%
And these were
people who worshipped

00:34:35.650 --> 00:34:40.880 align:middle line:84%
an ancient being that was an
upright dog-headed man-like god

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:42.730 align:middle line:90%
named Xolotl.

00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:46.750 align:middle line:84%
And when I came across that
information-- and the fact

00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:48.880 align:middle line:84%
that you can trace their
migrational path down

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:52.659 align:middle line:84%
through the four corners, down
through the American south

00:34:52.659 --> 00:34:56.650 align:middle line:84%
and right into Mexico where you
have an entire pattern of Dog

00:34:56.650 --> 00:35:00.570 align:middle line:84%
Man sightings almost following
that same exact migrational

00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:01.750 align:middle line:90%
pattern.

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:03.940 align:middle line:84%
And so you have this
indigenous people

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:07.782 align:middle line:84%
who are worshipping an
upright walking canine god.

00:35:07.782 --> 00:35:08.740 align:middle line:90%
A man with a dog head--

00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:10.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: How's this different
from Egypt and Anubis?

00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:11.220 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:11.510 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:12.970 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I mean, these
characters have always

00:35:12.970 --> 00:35:13.240 align:middle line:90%
existed--

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:13.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Exactly.

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:16.310 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --within the realm
of those beings considered god

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:17.110 align:middle line:90%
and powerful.

00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:17.530 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:35:17.530 --> 00:35:18.370 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:35:18.370 --> 00:35:21.640 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're seeing
is a scenario by which

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:25.750 align:middle line:84%
these indigenous
people either invented

00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:29.500 align:middle line:84%
said creature and began to
worship it in such a way

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:33.040 align:middle line:84%
that it actually became
manifest in our reality,

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:37.660 align:middle line:84%
or they came across these
creatures and the wild,

00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:41.770 align:middle line:84%
began to deify them
as gods, and that's

00:35:41.770 --> 00:35:45.550 align:middle line:84%
how they became the
god of their culture.

00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:48.506 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What are they
said to have been capable of?

00:35:48.506 --> 00:35:49.630 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: All kinds of feats.

00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:52.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these things
can run like lightning

00:35:52.210 --> 00:35:53.040 align:middle line:90%
through the woods.

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:55.420 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: But, I mean,
as a god, or a deity,

00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:57.866 align:middle line:10%
usually you have to have
something a little more--

00:35:57.866 --> 00:35:59.740 align:middle line:10%
>>CARY: Just like Anubis,
it was the guardian

00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:04.570 align:middle line:10%
of the underworld, of death,
and therefore of life, too.

00:36:04.570 --> 00:36:08.260 align:middle line:84%
You know, the guardian of
the gate between the two.

00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:11.880 align:middle line:84%
So all of the different
aspects that go along with that

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:13.380 align:middle line:90%
godhood idea.

00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:15.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's-- that's been
found in multiple cultures.

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:18.072 align:middle line:90%
Like you said, like Egypt.

00:36:18.072 --> 00:36:20.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we're totally
distorted on our understanding

00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:22.160 align:middle line:84%
or the antiquity
of that culture.

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:22.960 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:23.760 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:26.800 align:middle line:84%
There was some gentlemen in
the general area of a Dog Man

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:30.490 align:middle line:84%
case I'm now working on, which
is down around Konawa and Ada

00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:32.440 align:middle line:90%
Oklahoma.

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:36.520 align:middle line:84%
Very, very Native
American rural setting.

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And these gentlemen
were driving,

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:43.000 align:middle line:84%
and I believe it was
southwest of Ada,

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.100 align:middle line:84%
which is the largest
town in that area--

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:47.350 align:middle line:84%
and it's still a
very small town--

00:36:47.350 --> 00:36:50.800 align:middle line:84%
and they claim to have
seen, like you say,

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:54.202 align:middle line:84%
an upright walking canine
that they described as Anubis.

00:36:54.202 --> 00:36:55.160 align:middle line:90%
These are a couple of--

00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:56.850 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This shows
up a lot, by the way.

00:36:56.850 --> 00:36:57.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:36:57.070 --> 00:36:58.120 align:middle line:90%

00:36:58.120 --> 00:36:58.770 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:01.120 align:middle line:84%
A couple of redneck hunters
out in the middle of nowhere.

00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:01.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: There's Anubis.

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:02.470 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Yeah.

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And there's Anubis walking
down the side of the road.

00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:07.930 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the shock,
you know, and dismay

00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:11.500 align:middle line:84%
that they encountered
over that, something

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:12.610 align:middle line:90%
that they'll never forget.

00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:13.870 align:middle line:90%
It caused sheer panic.

00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:16.610 align:middle line:84%
They described it as the
most horrifying thing

00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:17.860 align:middle line:90%
that they've ever come across.

00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:19.150 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Just because
they're not familiar with it.

00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:19.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:21.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It didn't do
anything to warrant that.

00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:22.660 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And so that ties in very
interestingly with a case

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:31.540 align:middle line:84%
I've received in the recent
months from Konawa, Oklahoma.

00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:35.270 align:middle line:84%
And a private investigator
down there sent me a package--

00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:37.840 align:middle line:84%
really thick package--
of information

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:43.550 align:middle line:84%
that she had collected over
a 25-year investigation.

00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:49.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the cemetery of
Konawa, there are headstones

00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:53.200 align:middle line:90%
dating from October of 1917.

00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:55.090 align:middle line:84%
And at the bottom
of those headstones

00:37:55.090 --> 00:38:00.220 align:middle line:84%
it reads the words
"murdered by human wolves."

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:03.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a town that
today only has 1,400 people.

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:07.330 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine how many
people were there in 1917.

00:38:07.330 --> 00:38:11.920 align:middle line:84%
So what's interesting about
this story is that apparently,

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:14.710 align:middle line:84%
over a 25-year period,
she was able to discover

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:20.560 align:middle line:84%
that there was a woman
named Katherine Cross who,

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:23.800 align:middle line:84%
they believe, had
become impregnated.

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:25.964 align:middle line:84%
And during that period,
if you weren't married

00:38:25.964 --> 00:38:27.380 align:middle line:84%
and you were going
to have a baby,

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:29.100 align:middle line:84%
you had a real
problem on your hands.

00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:31.110 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, let me guess
where this might be going.

00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:31.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:33.870 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Particularly
if it's a dog person.

00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:34.670 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:36.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, what's interesting
about this case

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:40.240 align:middle line:84%
is that although we've got a
lot of circumstantial evidence

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:43.030 align:middle line:84%
about all of this stuff,
this particular case

00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:48.400 align:middle line:84%
seems to have been covered
over by a mundane legal story.

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:52.360 align:middle line:84%
So basically the story
that she was able to obtain

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:54.730 align:middle line:84%
and that was published in
the papers at that time

00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:57.730 align:middle line:84%
was that a doctor, named
Dr. Yates, in the town

00:38:57.730 --> 00:39:01.090 align:middle line:84%
was charged with her
murder for conducting

00:39:01.090 --> 00:39:04.240 align:middle line:90%
an illegal operation.

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:06.790 align:middle line:84%
Back then, it was
common for doctors

00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:10.097 align:middle line:84%
to be charged with that
for conducting an abortion.

00:39:10.097 --> 00:39:10.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Abortion.

00:39:10.930 --> 00:39:11.410 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:12.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:17.290 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting is
that he was acquitted,

00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:20.650 align:middle line:84%
and the charges were
reduced from murder

00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:23.350 align:middle line:84%
to manslaughter before
he was even tried.

00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:25.870 align:middle line:84%
And then when he was
tried, he was acquitted.

00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:28.690 align:middle line:10%
Now, the same thing happens to
another woman in the same town.

00:39:28.690 --> 00:39:32.130 align:middle line:84%
Her name was Elise stone, which
we cannot find her headstone.

00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:34.720 align:middle line:90%
It's completely missing.

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:37.870 align:middle line:84%
But he again was
charged with her murder,

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:41.032 align:middle line:84%
and again was acquitted
of the same thing.

00:39:41.032 --> 00:39:41.990 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:45.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: So it makes us-- and
there are scant other details

00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:45.980 align:middle line:90%
other than that.

00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:47.660 align:middle line:10%
Other than these
headstones that read

00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:49.490 align:middle line:10%
"murdered by human wolves."

00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:52.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, that in and of itself
you might be able to dismiss.

00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:54.890 align:middle line:84%
But this lady went
down there and began

00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:57.530 align:middle line:90%
to investigate this case--

00:39:57.530 --> 00:39:59.750 align:middle line:84%
photographs of the
headstones and everything.

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:02.630 align:middle line:90%
Began to receive death threats.

00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And the people that were
sending death threats

00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:09.440 align:middle line:84%
claimed that they were, in fact,
had full knowledge of the Dog

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:12.080 align:middle line:84%
Men that were in the area,
and that other women had

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:13.700 align:middle line:90%
been murdered in that area.

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:16.970 align:middle line:84%
In fact, she claimed somewhere
in the neighborhood of 300

00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:19.500 align:middle line:84%
over the span of
time from 1917--

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:20.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: 25 years.

00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:21.929 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: --and that
a lot of them had

00:40:21.929 --> 00:40:24.110 align:middle line:84%
the words "murdered
by human wolves"

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:27.440 align:middle line:90%
carved into their torsos.

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:32.090 align:middle line:84%
She also had an eyewitness who
claims to have seen a man--

00:40:32.090 --> 00:40:36.200 align:middle line:84%
she described it as a naked man
on all fours with a dog-like

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:37.330 align:middle line:90%
face--

00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:39.470 align:middle line:84%
run so fast next
to her in the woods

00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:41.930 align:middle line:84%
and leap this wall
that it caused her,

00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:46.240 align:middle line:84%
you know, nightmares for
a year in that same area.

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And so what we have are these
historical documented Dog Man

00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:53.320 align:middle line:84%
sightings all through that
same area of Konawa and Ada,

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:54.800 align:middle line:90%
Oklahoma.

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:57.800 align:middle line:84%
A private investigator
who has compiled

00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:59.960 align:middle line:84%
a body of evidence
showing that there were

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:05.930 align:middle line:84%
other murders in this area, huge
amount of Dog Man sightings,

00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:08.690 align:middle line:84%
death threats, and then
we have these headstones

00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:11.270 align:middle line:84%
dating from that
same area stating

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:12.860 align:middle line:90%
"murdered by human wolves."

00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:14.990 align:middle line:84%
Such a weird
statement, you know?

00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:15.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, playing
devil's advocate, I--

00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:24.530 align:middle line:84%
because they had had
the sightings available,

00:41:24.530 --> 00:41:25.970 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that was known--

00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:27.150 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:29.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --could it have been
also human hi-jinks and using

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:31.490 align:middle line:90%
that as a scapegoat?

00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:33.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm just wondering what all
the possibilities are here.

00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:34.190 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Yeah.

00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:36.439 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What was their
motivation for murdering all

00:41:36.439 --> 00:41:37.430 align:middle line:90%
these women?

00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:40.760 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Well, I you look
at the skin walker culture

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:44.330 align:middle line:84%
in particular, a murder
must take place for you

00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:46.610 align:middle line:84%
to even be allowed
into the group.

00:41:46.610 --> 00:41:49.280 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're talking
about dark, black

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:52.250 align:middle line:84%
Native American
witchcraft practices.

00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And the murders are
part of that agenda.

00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:59.321 align:middle line:84%
You know, these are people that
are practicing extreme occult--

00:41:59.321 --> 00:42:00.320 align:middle line:90%

00:42:06.350 --> 00:42:08.060 align:middle line:84%

They were performing
these murders.

00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:29.240 align:middle line:90%
And the reason--

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:29.540 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Very interesting.

00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:31.623 align:middle line:84%

00:42:33.215 --> 00:42:35.600 align:middle line:84%
was because they don't
want any attention.

00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:38.160 align:middle line:84%
They want to be left alone
to their own practices.

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:39.770 align:middle line:84%

We've got a body of evidence

They're leaving physical

Sasquatch come across one, they

00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:18.740 align:middle line:84%
not only kill it,
they rip it to pieces

00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:22.130 align:middle line:84%

We don't have a biological

You know, what I'd like to

00:45:40.319 --> 00:45:42.860 align:middle line:84%

00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:47.450 align:middle line:84%
kind of a couple of
key points happening.

00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:48.866 align:middle line:84%

>> REGINA: Oh, the

00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:55.280 align:middle line:90%

>>CARY: Yeah.

00:45:57.530 --> 00:46:01.970 align:middle line:84%
A couple of key points, recently
the KNM Missing Project Group

00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:04.280 align:middle line:84%
came out and publicly
endorsed a theory

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:08.930 align:middle line:84%
that I had developed
concerning the mach effect

00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:12.410 align:middle line:84%
and the underlying topography
of these different areas

00:46:12.410 --> 00:46:15.375 align:middle line:84%
where cluster missing
people have occured.

00:46:15.375 --> 00:46:17.750 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And I want to take
a look at this cluster map.

00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:18.550 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:21.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And what has been the
unique discovery out of this?

00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:23.695 align:middle line:84%
Now that you can see
it in graphic detail?

00:46:23.695 --> 00:46:25.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Well, that we can
see it in graphic detail,

00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:30.500 align:middle line:84%
that you can lay a
map of those areas,

00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:34.070 align:middle line:84%
overlay it with a map of
topography of the underlying

00:46:34.070 --> 00:46:36.680 align:middle line:84%
rock strata and see
that all of those areas

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:41.190 align:middle line:84%
have huge quartz rock
crystal deposits.

00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:46.550 align:middle line:84%
Recently, David Paulides, who
brought attention to 411 cases,

00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:48.380 align:middle line:84%
was on a radio
program where he said

00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:52.040 align:middle line:84%
he discovered that, on the
same date and time as some

00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:55.790 align:middle line:84%
of the missing 411 cases,
they had also discovered

00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:58.940 align:middle line:84%
that, in the Bermuda
Triangle, ships and planes had

00:46:58.940 --> 00:46:59.740 align:middle line:90%
gone missing.

00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:00.540 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

Same time.

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:03.170 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:47:03.170 --> 00:47:05.960 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: That tells us
that what we're looking at

00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:08.180 align:middle line:84%
isn't a crypted
creature of some kind.

00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:11.720 align:middle line:84%
What we're looking at is a
global scientific phenomenon

00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:15.500 align:middle line:84%
of some kind whereby, I believe,
that these portals and doors

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:18.350 align:middle line:84%
are being opened by the
passage of the earth

00:47:18.350 --> 00:47:22.010 align:middle line:84%
through space, which is
what the mach effect is.

00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:25.400 align:middle line:84%
Mass fluctuations
create the mach effect,

00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:28.040 align:middle line:84%
which are these tiny
fluctuations in mass that

00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:30.620 align:middle line:84%
occur as a body
travels through space.

00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And those fluctuations
actually can

00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:35.510 align:middle line:90%
be used as a propulsion system.

00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:37.790 align:middle line:84%
One of the principles
of that occurrence

00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:41.360 align:middle line:84%
is the production
of benign wormholes.

00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And that would explain
why, in some of the cases,

00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:48.987 align:middle line:84%
children have been discovered
alive in the missing 411 cases.

00:47:48.987 --> 00:47:50.570 align:middle line:84%
But they're three
mountain ranges away

00:47:50.570 --> 00:47:51.880 align:middle line:90%
from where they went missing.

00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:52.680 align:middle line:90%

Right.

00:47:56.044 --> 00:47:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And it is interesting,
because if you're

00:47:57.710 --> 00:48:00.200 align:middle line:84%
talking about that effect,
you're talking about simply,

00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:04.370 align:middle line:84%
you know, a shift in densities
and then movement, activity,

00:48:04.370 --> 00:48:06.330 align:middle line:84%
on the other side of
the veil, and then, you

00:48:06.330 --> 00:48:08.220 align:middle line:84%

a work called "The

00:51:12.090 --> 00:51:15.330 align:middle line:84%

the fact that many

00:51:15.330 --> 00:51:18.630 align:middle line:84%
of these missing person
cases had occurred where

00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:20.670 align:middle line:90%
there were devil place names.

00:51:20.670 --> 00:51:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And that matches up beautifully
with a book published

00:51:23.370 --> 00:51:26.520 align:middle line:84%
by Loren Coleman in
the early 1980s called

00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:27.780 align:middle line:90%
"Mysterious America."

he takes a flight to Antarctica
without telling anybody.

00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:47.690 align:middle line:90%
Then had to be medevaced.

00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:52.010 align:middle line:84%
There is a huge discovery
going on in Antarctica.

00:52:52.010 --> 00:52:55.580 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is they
have discovered pyramids.

00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:59.000 align:middle line:84%
One of them appears to
be 20 times the size

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.610 align:middle line:90%
of the great pyramid at Giza.

00:53:01.610 --> 00:53:03.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's fascinating
about Antarctica

00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:04.990 align:middle line:84%
is that we have
ancient maps from--

00:53:15.784 --> 00:53:17.450 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: But this
ancient map, it clearly

00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:20.330 align:middle line:84%
shows the coastline

underneath the ice.

00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:27.260 align:middle line:84%
You know, they have
satellites that

00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:28.280 align:middle line:90%
can see underneath the ice--

00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:28.370 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:53:28.370 --> 00:53:29.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: --and they've
mapped that coastline.

00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:30.800 align:middle line:90%
It matches perfectly.

00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:34.790 align:middle line:84%
So these were people that had
created a map of Antarctica

00:53:34.790 --> 00:53:37.280 align:middle line:90%
at a time when it was ice-free.

00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And at some point,
it was up around

00:53:41.150 --> 00:53:43.490 align:middle line:84%
where Australia
is and would have

00:53:43.490 --> 00:53:47.010 align:middle line:84%
supported ancient civilizations
and so on and so forth.

00:53:47.010 --> 00:53:50.000 align:middle line:84%
What's fascinating about
this particular discovery

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:54.170 align:middle line:84%

00:54:11.690 --> 00:54:18.830 align:middle line:84%
there, but that there is an
untouched existing ancient

00:54:18.830 --> 00:54:23.730 align:middle line:84%

within this pyramid.

00:54:23.730 --> 00:54:24.530 align:middle line:90%

And they have predicted
it for a really long time.

00:54:31.690 --> 00:54:35.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's interesting
is that about a year ago,

00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:39.050 align:middle line:84%
Linda Moulton Howe was
approached by a military

00:54:39.050 --> 00:54:41.570 align:middle line:84%

he had been recruited--

00:54:41.570 --> 00:54:43.430 align:middle line:84%
this was an
electrical engineer--

00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:46.160 align:middle line:84%
that he had been recruited
to examine what he called

00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:49.910 align:middle line:84%
the Black Pyramid in
Alaska, and that it, too,

00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:51.465 align:middle line:90%

And then the Webbot
coming and making

00:55:01.310 --> 00:55:04.460 align:middle line:84%
the prediction that not only was
this power source rediscovered,

00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:09.620 align:middle line:84%
but that it will be
the source of wealth

00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:32.220 align:middle line:90%
of those technologies.

00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:33.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Yes.

00:55:33.020 --> 00:55:33.820 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:55:33.820 --> 00:55:34.790 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Absolutely.

00:55:34.790 --> 00:55:36.890 align:middle line:84%
He does also-- the
Webbot also claims

00:55:36.890 --> 00:55:40.790 align:middle line:84%
that at some point in March,
before full disclosure

00:55:40.790 --> 00:55:44.390 align:middle line:84%
of this entire
discovery is made,

00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:48.380 align:middle line:84%
a few more celebrities
will make unannounced trips

00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:49.700 align:middle line:90%
to Antarctica.

00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And when that
occurs, you'll know

00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:52.660 align:middle line:90%
that the disclosure of the--

00:55:52.660 --> 00:55:53.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Is near.

00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:54.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: --discoveries
is at hand.

00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:55.366 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's fascinating.

00:55:55.366 --> 00:55:58.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in my own-- my own
life and my esoteric journey

00:55:58.580 --> 00:56:00.380 align:middle line:84%
through life, I've
been in contact

00:56:00.380 --> 00:56:03.100 align:middle line:84%
with a certain group of
beings for a long time,

00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:03.980 align:middle line:90%
about 30 years.

00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And they told us things
through the years.

00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things,
back then even,

00:56:08.690 --> 00:56:13.430 align:middle line:84%
was that you have a very
large number of pyramids

00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:16.170 align:middle line:84%
that are sitting in undisclosed
places at this point,

00:56:16.170 --> 00:56:20.420 align:middle line:84%
including, and mostly,
underneath the silt and sand,

00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:22.280 align:middle line:90%
that are active.

00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And they have yet
to be rediscovered

00:56:24.500 --> 00:56:26.110 align:middle line:84%
with the technologies
buried in them.

00:56:26.110 --> 00:56:26.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:56:26.910 --> 00:56:29.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so it's fun,
as time goes on, all these

00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:31.400 align:middle line:84%
different things we
were told of in those--

00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:32.980 align:middle line:84%
in the mid-'80s
are all now coming.

00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:33.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:56:33.780 --> 00:56:35.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I mean, many
things-- including science

00:56:35.570 --> 00:56:38.300 align:middle line:84%
and understanding of gravity,
things we were told back then--

00:56:38.300 --> 00:56:40.580 align:middle line:84%
start popping up in the
news, the various research

00:56:40.580 --> 00:56:41.930 align:middle line:90%
teams and science teams.

00:56:41.930 --> 00:56:45.080 align:middle line:84%
It seems that it really
is the time of rediscovery

00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:46.130 align:middle line:90%
of all of this now.

00:56:46.130 --> 00:56:47.171 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Oh, it really is.

00:56:47.171 --> 00:56:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And this year promises to be
a huge year of discovery--

00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:51.540 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: How exciting.

00:56:51.540 --> 00:56:52.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: --and revelation.

00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:53.270 align:middle line:90%
It really does.

00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:55.603 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: With all the chaos
and everything going on, I

00:56:55.603 --> 00:56:58.620 align:middle line:84%
mean, you really can't have what
is perceived as dark without

00:56:58.620 --> 00:56:59.420 align:middle line:90%
light.

00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:01.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everything has
to show up in pairs.

00:57:01.580 --> 00:57:05.010 align:middle line:84%
It's just kind of how this dual
nature reality of ours works.

00:57:05.010 --> 00:57:05.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Absolutely.

00:57:05.810 --> 00:57:07.910 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So we may have
some challenging things going

00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:10.430 align:middle line:84%
on globally, we may have parts
of our character that are

00:57:10.430 --> 00:57:14.180 align:middle line:84%
coming up to be examined, and
then you have these beautiful

00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:16.190 align:middle line:90%
offerings into our future.

00:57:16.190 --> 00:57:17.040 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Absolutely.

00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:17.915 align:middle line:90%
And that's the thing.

00:57:17.915 --> 00:57:20.710 align:middle line:84%
When you read the alter
reports from the Webbot is,

00:57:20.710 --> 00:57:23.420 align:middle line:84%
yeah, you get the
dire predictions.

00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:26.900 align:middle line:84%
But there's also a lot of really
cool, really interesting things

00:57:26.900 --> 00:57:28.620 align:middle line:90%
about to occur for humanity.

00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:29.420 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:57:29.420 --> 00:57:31.579 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: And that's something
to keep focused on.

00:57:31.579 --> 00:57:33.245 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Anything
else from Clif High?

00:57:33.245 --> 00:57:34.870 align:middle line:84%
I actually have been
dialed away from--

00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:38.130 align:middle line:84%
I haven't been dialed into
Webbot for a while now.

00:57:38.130 --> 00:57:39.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Well, I
can tell you the--

00:57:39.730 --> 00:57:43.340 align:middle line:84%
there's ongoing predictions
for the exponential value

00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:44.141 align:middle line:90%
of Bitcoin--

00:57:44.141 --> 00:57:44.940 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:46.160 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: --to increase.

00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And you can kind of begin
to see that now with the--

00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:50.910 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Certain
banks are starting to--

00:57:50.910 --> 00:57:51.710 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Yeah.

00:57:51.710 --> 00:57:54.565 align:middle line:10%
The implosion of the Italian
banking system is at hand,

00:57:54.565 --> 00:57:57.080 align:middle line:10%
and that's going to cause
a panic all through Europe,

00:57:57.080 --> 00:58:01.460 align:middle line:10%
which will then cause a lot
more investment into Bitcoin.

00:58:01.460 --> 00:58:03.617 align:middle line:84%
And they predict that
and precious metals, too.

00:58:03.617 --> 00:58:05.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So are you
going to start looking

00:58:05.450 --> 00:58:07.355 align:middle line:84%
to cryptocurrencies,
not just cryptozoology?

00:58:07.355 --> 00:58:09.470 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right, right.

00:58:09.470 --> 00:58:11.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You're a
crypto kind of guy.

00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:12.210 align:middle line:84%
All right, we're
out of time, Jack,

00:58:12.210 --> 00:58:13.535 align:middle line:90%
but this has been fascinating.

00:58:13.535 --> 00:58:14.910 align:middle line:84%
And thank you,
again, for coming.

00:58:14.910 --> 00:58:18.200 align:middle line:84%
I know there's much more we can
talk about in a future episode.

00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:20.030 align:middle line:90%
So until then, thanks again.

00:58:20.030 --> 00:58:21.480 align:middle line:90%
This has been really fun.

00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:23.720 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Thank you so much,
Regina, for having me.

00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:25.250 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: For those of you
who haven't seen my first

00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:27.940 align:middle line:10%
conversation with Jack, you may
want to look it up in the Gaia
