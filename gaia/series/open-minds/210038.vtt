from so many different types

the client I have

who comes from a place
where they don't grow up.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.730 align:middle line:84%
They are childlike in the
healthiest way permanently.

Interplanetary souls, often
have trouble with relationships

00:00:30.503 --> 00:00:31.920 align:middle line:84%

come from a place

Dr. Linda Backman was a
practicing psychologist

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.760 align:middle line:10%
when she began noticing
clients speak of past lives.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.850 align:middle line:84%
Curious, she began studying
with Michael Newton, whom

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.550 align:middle line:84%
she became a co-teacher with
in the practice of past life

regression.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.860 align:middle line:84%
As time went on, she
noticed something else.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.580 align:middle line:84%
Some of those past
lives were not on Earth.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.520 align:middle line:10%
She details this discovery
and its implications

Linda, welcome.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.530 align:middle line:84%
It's the first time you've
been with me on Open Minds.

>>REGINA: Now, we've had
other dealings with each other

00:01:37.512 --> 00:01:39.000 align:middle line:84%
and gotten to know
each other a bit

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.960 align:middle line:84%
and had some absolutely
fascinating discussions.

And what we're going
to talk about today

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.540 align:middle line:84%
is an introduction to
you, to our audience,

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.890 align:middle line:84%
because we're going to be
having you back, of course,

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.900 align:middle line:84%
because you do so many cases,
that this story is constantly

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.310 align:middle line:90%
progressing.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.460 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about that--
or just briefly just

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.450 align:middle line:84%
touch on how you started, as
a pretty straight psychologist

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.780 align:middle line:84%
there to help people, suddenly
hearing about some pretty

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.100 align:middle line:90%
far-off places.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.259 align:middle line:84%
And was there a certain amount
of disbelief in the beginning?

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.510 align:middle line:90%
How did that work for you?

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And what brought you
into the comfort zone

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.840 align:middle line:90%
of saying, yeah, this is real?

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.940 align:middle line:10%
>>BACKMAN: So,
actually Regina, when

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.510 align:middle line:10%
I fell into this kind
of work, primarily,

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.950 align:middle line:10%
it didn't come from clients.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.080 align:middle line:84%
It came from the passing of a
very dear colleague who died.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I was rather conventional.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.510 align:middle line:10%
He died, and he began to talk
to me from the other side

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.430 align:middle line:10%
and show me scenes
of past lives.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.520 align:middle line:10%
In the beginning, I thought
that was extremely unusual

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.403 align:middle line:10%
and kind of strange.

00:02:40.403 --> 00:02:42.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you weren't
all on-board with it?

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.220 align:middle line:90%
That took a while.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.093 align:middle line:84%
So now when did it
start showing up?

00:02:45.093 --> 00:02:46.760 align:middle line:84%
When did you start
recognizing that what

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.010 align:middle line:84%
your clients were telling
you was not of this Earth?

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.330 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: I began to recognize
that, actually initially, tied

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.300 align:middle line:84%
to my own spouse, to my
husband, because when

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.100 align:middle line:84%
I started having
these experiences tied

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.875 align:middle line:84%
to the passing of my
colleague, I asked my husband

00:03:04.875 --> 00:03:06.000 align:middle line:90%
what he thought about that.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.720 align:middle line:84%
My husband also was conventional
and a university professor.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me,
oh, now I remember--

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.540 align:middle line:84%
my husband said that-- when
he was about 10 years old,

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.940 align:middle line:84%
he remembered his own
past lives in detail.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.875 align:middle line:84%
He'd completely
forgotten about that.

00:03:21.875 --> 00:03:24.528 align:middle line:84%
That was actually the
beginning credibility for me.

00:03:24.528 --> 00:03:26.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, because
you trusted your husband.

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:27.830 align:middle line:90%
You knew he wasn't nuts.

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And he wasn't trying to
put on a show for you.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.900 align:middle line:84%
So now it starts coming
from your clients.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And I was regressed by
Dolores Cannon years ago.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.950 align:middle line:84%
And I know that when
she was working with me,

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.700 align:middle line:84%
we were getting to a
pretty critical point

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.430 align:middle line:84%
in the regression, and
there was a lack of clarity.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.760 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk about
that from your experience

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:47.690 align:middle line:90%
as a regressionist.

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.370 align:middle line:84%
When someone's
bringing up something

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.100 align:middle line:84%
that's not in the
normal wheelhouse,

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.533 align:middle line:84%
how do you know where
they are, and then

00:03:54.533 --> 00:03:56.450 align:middle line:84%
to continue guiding them
until they can really

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.700 align:middle line:84%
hit the spot that
they are, and you're

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.062 align:middle line:90%
in rapport with each other?

00:04:00.062 --> 00:04:01.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: I think
there's probably

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.860 align:middle line:90%
two or three answers to that.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:03.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: One is that the
regression therapist has

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.910 align:middle line:84%
to be tapped into
their own intuition

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.470 align:middle line:84%
as they're working
with the client,

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.760 align:middle line:84%
and to be just getting a sense
of this, almost just a feeling.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:14.870 align:middle line:90%
This feels right.

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.310 align:middle line:90%
This doesn't feel right.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.790 align:middle line:90%
So that's one piece.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.460 align:middle line:84%
The other piece would be, I have
to say, years of experience.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.330 align:middle line:84%
As I kept learning, oh,
I've heard this from 2 or 3

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.320 align:middle line:84%
or 4 or 10 other clients,
oh, it must not be made up.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.960 align:middle line:84%
Or oh, this color and this
experience in the higher realm

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.270 align:middle line:84%
is something I've
already heard before.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.270 align:middle line:84%
But those clients didn't
talk to each other.

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: So it's
years of fitting

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.480 align:middle line:84%
together, client to
client to client.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so this
is-- before we get

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.430 align:middle line:90%
into the basis of this topic.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.520 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I wonder about
is the human fascination with

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.520 align:middle line:84%
the kind of Disney
tales, a "Disney-esque"

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.000 align:middle line:84%
life where animals speak to
you, where the flowers are

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.450 align:middle line:84%
beautiful, where you have
true love that lasts forever--

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.410 align:middle line:84%
is that unusual for IP
clients to come in with?

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk-- and we're
talking about the people

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.150 align:middle line:84%
that find out they have had
lives and started elsewhere,

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.560 align:middle line:90%
called interplanetary.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.840 align:middle line:84%
You call them-- your
guide said, just give them

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.562 align:middle line:90%
the term, IP, Interplanetary.

00:05:22.562 --> 00:05:24.020 align:middle line:84%
So that's what
we're talking about.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.430 align:middle line:84%
How do they relate to the
whole notion of beauty and ease

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.830 align:middle line:84%
and grace and true
love, in general,

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.340 align:middle line:90%
compared to Earth-based people?

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.180 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: I would say that
Earth-based people have almost

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.690 align:middle line:90%
more of that Pollyanna view.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:40.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.170 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:44.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well, I mean,
we have Western religion.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.900 align:middle line:84%
So not to put down
religion, necessarily,

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.300 align:middle line:84%
but Western religion,
in many ways, teaches us

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.570 align:middle line:84%
a Pollyanna view which,
in my humble opinion,

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.350 align:middle line:90%
is a bit inaccurate.

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:59.780 align:middle line:84%
So the uniqueness of IP
souls, Interplanetary souls--

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.140 align:middle line:84%
and for people listening,
we could call them ETs.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.703 align:middle line:90%
We could call them star seeds.

00:06:04.703 --> 00:06:05.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interdimensionals.

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:06.890 align:middle line:90%
It's the whole bag.

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: It's all
the same terminology.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.530 align:middle line:84%
IP souls come from so many
different types of cultures,

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:17.840 align:middle line:84%
that some are not exactly
what we might say,

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.900 align:middle line:84%
mother, God, and apple
pie, but some of them

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.650 align:middle line:84%
come from pure
locations of nature,

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.580 align:middle line:90%
pure locations of forgiveness.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.240 align:middle line:84%
But others come from locations
where they're warrior souls.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.472 align:middle line:84%
They're not necessarily
these happy-go-lucky--

00:06:36.472 --> 00:06:37.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.180 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: --perspective.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:38.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:42.050 align:middle line:84%
It's all over in every ET class,
every interdimensional class,

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:43.920 align:middle line:90%
different dimensions.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.520 align:middle line:84%
So you were just doing that,
and that was titillating me,

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.500 align:middle line:84%
so I know it'll titillate
the audience too.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And you said, pure nature
class, for example.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.750 align:middle line:84%
Can you give us a few more
on each end of the spectrum

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:01.250 align:middle line:84%
of the dominant themes from some
of the places people come from?

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.470 align:middle line:84%
You just mentioned, there
are some who are really

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.030 align:middle line:90%
totally related to nature.

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:08.480 align:middle line:84%
Some are relating
to war and warriors,

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.190 align:middle line:84%
just kind of some
generalizations

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:13.290 align:middle line:84%
like that so people can kind of
feel themselves in the story.

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:14.090 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.300 align:middle line:84%
And I hope people will think
about how different we are,

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.780 align:middle line:90%
person to person to person.

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:22.970 align:middle line:84%
So if we think about that,
think about personality

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:28.590 align:middle line:84%
from the perspective of,
there are some very loving,

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:32.790 align:middle line:84%
compassionate people, and that
is their persona, honestly,

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:34.020 align:middle line:90%
almost 24/7.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:34.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:35.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: But there
are people that

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:36.390 align:middle line:90%
are completely the opposite.

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:40.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, the same is true for,
what I like to call, home base.

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:43.840 align:middle line:84%
So I know that interplanetary
souls have a home base.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:48.810 align:middle line:84%
So one home base might
be a home base that has--

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:51.300 align:middle line:84%
where there's been
experience with that,

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.070 align:middle line:84%
just for the sake of
example, let's say

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:54.720 align:middle line:90%
that home base is a planet.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:59.910 align:middle line:84%
That might be a planet
where the beings that

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:08.820 align:middle line:84%
come from that planet are in
charge of mitigating issues

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:10.320 align:middle line:90%
with another location.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.400 align:middle line:90%
So there are battles.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.485 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Disagreements--
we could call them wars.

00:08:15.485 --> 00:08:18.765 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Mediator
races, and so forth.

00:08:18.765 --> 00:08:20.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: But on
the other hand,

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:22.470 align:middle line:84%
the opposite end of the
spectrum, as you mentioned,

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:24.330 align:middle line:90%
is there too.

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:26.160 align:middle line:84%
I always think about
the client I have

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.860 align:middle line:84%
who comes from a place
where they don't grow up.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:33.840 align:middle line:84%
They are childlike in the
healthiest way, permanently.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.429 align:middle line:84%
And then these
people come to Earth

00:08:35.429 --> 00:08:38.260 align:middle line:84%
and have to function
in human culture.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.919 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How is that
working out for this person?

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:43.049 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Difficult.
Well, when I

00:08:43.049 --> 00:08:48.900 align:middle line:84%
say difficult, difficult from
a physiological standpoint,

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:54.720 align:middle line:84%
difficult from almost an
attitudinal standpoint.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.160 align:middle line:84%
The one person
I'm thinking about

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.040 align:middle line:84%
is a highly educated
medical doctor

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:03.390 align:middle line:84%
who does in-depth
research on issues

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:06.270 align:middle line:84%
related to the
gastrointestinal tract

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:08.500 align:middle line:90%
because she has these issues.

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And so she's highly educated,
she's highly motivated,

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:16.180 align:middle line:84%
she's highly
trusted in her work.

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.240 align:middle line:84%
But when she's at
home by herself,

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.070 align:middle line:90%
she gets to be who she is.

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:21.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And how is she?

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:22.048 align:middle line:90%
Who is she?

00:09:22.048 --> 00:09:23.090 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Well, I mean--

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:24.298 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: She's like a child.

00:09:24.298 --> 00:09:26.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: She's
like a child in--

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.803 align:middle line:84%
when we say that, I want
people to think about children

00:09:29.803 --> 00:09:30.720 align:middle line:90%
in the healthiest way.

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:31.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:31.880 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yeah.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:35.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Magical, fun,
creative, they like sugar,

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:36.850 align:middle line:90%
a lot of sugar.

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:37.650 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Right.

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.390 align:middle line:90%
They truly-- they like sugar.

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:40.920 align:middle line:90%
They like toys.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:44.380 align:middle line:84%
They like, literally,
stuffed animals.

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:48.615 align:middle line:84%
But they're not child
in a dysfunctional way.

00:09:48.615 --> 00:09:49.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's interesting.

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:53.820 align:middle line:84%
I have a male friend like
that, a British male friend.

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:56.560 align:middle line:84%
His place-- and I was going
to ask you about this.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.790 align:middle line:84%
Are there domains where
art and creativity

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:01.560 align:middle line:84%
are the dominant
theme, that you've

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.720 align:middle line:84%
seen among your
clients, where it's just

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:09.240 align:middle line:84%
color and brightness and
creativity, light, art, music?

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: I mean, that brings
up a really wonderful point,

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:14.830 align:middle line:84%
and that is that we have
to think about energy.

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:15.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:19.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: And so,
energy is color.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:23.520 align:middle line:84%
Outside of Earth, when
we think about frequency,

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:27.810 align:middle line:84%
frequency meaning level of
evolution of the energy,

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:30.520 align:middle line:90%
then that connotes color.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.820 align:middle line:84%
So what people
don't understand is

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:34.890 align:middle line:84%
if we think about the
colors of the rainbow,

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:37.230 align:middle line:84%
those are an
increasing frequency.

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:39.750 align:middle line:84%
So often, when I
regress a client who's

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:43.060 align:middle line:84%
an interplanetary
soul, and they go home,

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:47.250 align:middle line:84%
they're often in pure
and energetic color.

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:48.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.640 align:middle line:84%
Interesting, yet the
person I'm thinking of,

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.970 align:middle line:84%
his favorite color is orange,
wears a lot of orange,

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:59.580 align:middle line:84%
and spends his days painting
wonderful-- it's not abstract.

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:03.930 align:middle line:84%
But it's the most
vital colorful art

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:07.620 align:middle line:84%
that just captures the essence
of people, places, animals.

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:10.045 align:middle line:84%
And his room is full
of stuffed animals.

00:11:10.045 --> 00:11:11.170 align:middle line:90%
And he's just a little kid.

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:12.960 align:middle line:84%
He's never been
married, you know?

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And it won't ever be married,
doesn't really get any of that.

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:19.150 align:middle line:84%
Never had a really
long-term relationship.

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:19.950 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:22.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: And
again, it's beautiful

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:25.500 align:middle line:84%
because as you bring things
up, then so many experiences

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:27.420 align:middle line:90%
with clients pop into my mind.

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:32.080 align:middle line:84%
One would be that home
base, if it is pure energy,

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.100 align:middle line:84%
it may be a pure
color of an energy.

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And so that the energy
is used with purpose,

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:41.710 align:middle line:84%
and that's the
reason for the color.

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:42.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:44.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: But then
also, Regina, you

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:46.770 align:middle line:90%
bring up relationships.

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:50.640 align:middle line:84%
Interplanetary souls often have
trouble with relationships,

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:54.450 align:middle line:84%
often the greatest trouble
with romantic relationships

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:56.040 align:middle line:84%
because they may
come from a place

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.380 align:middle line:84%
where there is no
such thing, that there

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:02.820 align:middle line:84%
isn't spouses or marriage
or that kind of thing.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And so it's always
important for humans

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:08.400 align:middle line:84%
to try not to kind
of lay a template--

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.500 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: --over humans.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.330 align:middle line:84%
Like, oh, this is how
all humans should be.

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:14.737 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is how we do it.

00:12:14.737 --> 00:12:15.120 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:15.920 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Exactly.

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:19.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we can see by
the sheer divorce rate, no less

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.810 align:middle line:84%
the occasional murder,
that obviously, it

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:24.630 align:middle line:90%
doesn't work for everybody.

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And we'll get into
that in the nature

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:30.070 align:middle line:84%
of what kind of combinations
work well together.

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:33.030 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
the notion that--

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:34.440 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about
the three types.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.910 align:middle line:90%
You just mentioned Earth-based.

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:37.770 align:middle line:90%
We've mentioned interplanetary.

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:40.560 align:middle line:84%
So speak a little bit more
about Earth-based souls,

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.210 align:middle line:84%
which you are, you
and your husband

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:44.820 align:middle line:84%
are Earth-based souls,
ancient, been around forever,

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:46.360 align:middle line:84%
from previous
conversations, right?

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.160 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.260 align:middle line:84%
So to define an
Earth-based soul--

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:53.370 align:middle line:84%
and I always say to people,
be careful about that term

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:55.800 align:middle line:84%
because people think
I'm saying Earth-bound,

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.340 align:middle line:84%
and that connotes
something else.

00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:58.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:00.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Sometimes
connotes, supposedly,

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.450 align:middle line:84%
a stuck soul, which would be
a whole other conversation.

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:06.090 align:middle line:84%
Earth-based souls
simply means, a soul

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:10.110 align:middle line:84%
that came from somewhere else,
probably tens of thousands

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:13.470 align:middle line:84%
of years ago, came to
Earth, and then stayed.

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean stayed
and had one life,

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:19.980 align:middle line:84%
but stayed and continued
to incarnate here almost--

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:21.870 align:middle line:90%
underscore almost-- exclusively.

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:24.240 align:middle line:90%
That's an Earth-based soul.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:27.000 align:middle line:84%
Interplanetary soul,
we've talked about.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.090 align:middle line:84%
An interplanetary
soul is, basically,

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:32.220 align:middle line:90%
not designed to come to Earth.

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:35.490 align:middle line:84%
But interplanetary souls
come to Earth for one--

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:37.620 align:middle line:84%
I can almost make this
totally black and white--

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:38.550 align:middle line:90%
one reason.

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's to
bring their wisdom,

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:43.710 align:middle line:84%
their advanced perspective
to Earth because we need it,

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:45.240 align:middle line:90%
because humanity needs it.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Then lastly, and this is not
the kind of in-depth discussion

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:53.550 align:middle line:84%
we're having, but angelic
souls are the third type.

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And those are souls
that specifically

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:58.590 align:middle line:84%
come from the angelic
realm that serves

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:03.250 align:middle line:84%
the divine or higher frequency
that seeks to guide Earth,

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:04.050 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:06.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And as
we've talked before,

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:10.120 align:middle line:84%
this is through a type of loving
kindness that is just really

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:10.920 align:middle line:90%
almost--

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.610 align:middle line:90%
it's endemic to who they are.

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:13.410 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:16.200 align:middle line:84%
They are love and
compassion souls.

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.910 align:middle line:90%
And yet, what's tricky--

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:20.250 align:middle line:84%
and this is where it's
hard to tweak apart--

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:24.180 align:middle line:84%
is that we have a
soul energy, or we

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:26.430 align:middle line:84%
have a soul
archetype, all of us,

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:28.320 align:middle line:84%
and we have a
personality archetype.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:29.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Two different things.

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:30.420 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And so if I come
upon an angelic soul,

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.930 align:middle line:84%
they may be leading with
their love and kindness soul

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:37.740 align:middle line:90%
archetype.

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:41.160 align:middle line:84%
Or they may be leading with
their personality archetype,

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:45.670 align:middle line:84%
which, to some extent,
overshadows their love

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:46.470 align:middle line:90%
and compassion.

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:48.053 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
it seems like they

00:14:48.053 --> 00:14:49.360 align:middle line:90%
would be uber sensitive.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:54.030 align:middle line:84%
So to be thrown off and have
your personality affected

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:57.930 align:middle line:84%
by being so deeply wounded and
traumatized by walking around

00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:01.290 align:middle line:84%
the surface of Earth, it seems
like they'd be particularly

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:03.897 align:middle line:90%
vulnerable to that.

00:15:03.897 --> 00:15:04.730 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: They are.

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:06.890 align:middle line:90%
Yes, is the simple answer.

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:10.610 align:middle line:84%
They are very vulnerable
to human behavior,

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:16.330 align:middle line:84%
as we all well know, that is not
loving kindness and compassion,

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:17.130 align:middle line:90%
in fact.

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:19.140 align:middle line:90%
It's often anything but that.

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:19.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And so they're going to
have a unique set of issues

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:26.910 align:middle line:84%
that are going to come through
in the physical, as well.

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And so we're going
to talk about that.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:32.180 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about, first
of all, since there--

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:34.130 align:middle line:84%
there are fewer numbers,
as I understand,

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:36.830 align:middle line:90%
of the angelic realm incarnate?

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:40.040 align:middle line:84%
Or are they just newer
to the process than IPs

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.790 align:middle line:90%
and Earth-based?

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:43.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: My
understanding about numbers

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:48.900 align:middle line:84%
is that approximately 5%
of the human population

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:51.960 align:middle line:84%
are either Earth-based,
interplanetary,

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.460 align:middle line:90%
or angelic realm.

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:56.040 align:middle line:84%
And then-- and I've
asked clients this time

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:56.860 align:middle line:90%
and time again.

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:59.820 align:middle line:84%
So I'm looking for, where is
the overlap in the information

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:01.590 align:middle line:90%
that I receive.

00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:04.470 align:middle line:84%
So 5% of the human
population are

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:08.640 align:middle line:84%
what we might call experienced
souls, EB, IP, and AR,

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:10.830 align:middle line:90%
if we can put it that way.

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:15.330 align:middle line:84%
Split that in half, 2.5%
of that 5% are Earth-based.

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:19.410 align:middle line:84%
The other 2.5% has to
be split in half again.

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:24.150 align:middle line:84%
1 and 1/4 IP, 1 and 1/4
angelic realm, approximately.

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:27.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But there are 95% of
the others that live on Earth.

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:28.671 align:middle line:90%
Who are they?

00:16:28.671 --> 00:16:31.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: They are
souls of about--

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:33.770 align:middle line:84%
I like to put it on a
scale to make it simple,

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:35.150 align:middle line:90%
so a 10-point scale.

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:40.190 align:middle line:84%
They are souls at a level of
evolution, probably between a 4

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:41.510 align:middle line:90%
and a 6.

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:42.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:43.820 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Of advancement.

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.740 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't mean there's
anything wrong with them.

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:46.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's all learning.

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:47.910 align:middle line:84%
It's like you're
in kindergarten,

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:48.830 align:middle line:90%
then you're in second grade.

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:49.250 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: That's right.

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:50.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
you graduate, you

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:52.500 align:middle line:84%
get your postgraduate
degree down the road.

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.620 align:middle line:84%
It's just a lot of work
and a lot of experience.

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:56.327 align:middle line:90%
There is no hierarchy in that.

00:16:56.327 --> 00:16:57.410 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: That's correct.

00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:59.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's just
about learning.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.673 align:middle line:90%
And I do want to say--

00:17:00.673 --> 00:17:02.090 align:middle line:84%
because you touched
on it earlier,

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:04.010 align:middle line:90%
and it's important to note.

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:06.020 align:middle line:84%
Nobody-- well, except
for maybe someone

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:10.460 align:middle line:84%
who's been in severe trauma,
we're not Earth-bound as souls.

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:12.030 align:middle line:84%
We can move on to
other dimensions.

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:14.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we can move
on to other realms.

00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:17.420 align:middle line:84%
Between incarnations, we don't
have to make the decision

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:18.530 align:middle line:90%
to come back here.

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:20.220 align:middle line:90%
We can go elsewhere.

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:23.420 align:middle line:84%
So we're not stuck,
per se, right?

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:25.740 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Complicated answer.

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:27.800 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I want to
be sure people understand

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:31.010 align:middle line:84%
that when we're in body,
whether it's Regina or Linda,

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:34.070 align:middle line:84%
we have a slice of
our soul that causes--

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:36.680 align:middle line:84%
you have a slice of your soul
that causes you to be alive.

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:39.230 align:middle line:90%
And I am the same.

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:41.720 align:middle line:84%
The remainder of our
soul is our higher self.

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:47.030 align:middle line:84%
So our higher self is our, you
could call it our divine self.

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:49.370 align:middle line:84%
When we finish an
incarnation and we

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:52.310 align:middle line:84%
get ready to consider
incarnating again,

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:54.530 align:middle line:84%
we have a conference
with our guides.

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And then we decide what's
going to happen next.

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:01.310 align:middle line:84%
If you're an Earth-based
soul, you're more than likely

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:03.050 align:middle line:90%
going to come back to Earth.

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:05.207 align:middle line:90%
If you're an IP soul--

00:18:05.207 --> 00:18:06.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Maybe not.

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:06.460 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: That's so funny.

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:07.840 align:middle line:90%
I want to say it's up for grabs.

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:08.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's up for grabs.

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:09.405 align:middle line:90%
Well, it makes sense.

00:18:09.405 --> 00:18:11.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, depending on
the degree of difficulty

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:14.212 align:middle line:84%
in being here in a
body, you might say,

00:18:14.212 --> 00:18:15.670 align:middle line:84%
I need to take a
break for a while,

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:18.370 align:middle line:84%
go to something a little more
comfortable, a little less

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:21.020 align:middle line:84%
challenging, and then
I'll head on back.

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:24.350 align:middle line:84%
It could be that kind of
thing too, just a rest.

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:25.150 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:27.230 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
tricky part is, even

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:30.790 align:middle line:84%
in you and me having this
conversation, we only have

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:32.810 align:middle line:90%
our human brain to utilize.

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:33.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:37.300 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: So I think we
can easily, you might say,

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:40.090 align:middle line:84%
anthropomorphize-- to use
a big, long, fancy word--

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:44.440 align:middle line:84%
we humanize that
perspective, oftentimes,

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:47.860 align:middle line:84%
for souls that are like,
let's just say a 7 and above.

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:51.100 align:middle line:84%
When we go back, when
we finish a life--

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:53.860 align:middle line:84%
I can give a recent example
that I know a little bit

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:55.460 align:middle line:90%
about in a moment.

00:18:55.460 --> 00:19:02.800 align:middle line:84%
But when we go back, then the
needs of humanity and the needs

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.110 align:middle line:90%
of--

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:08.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're on Earth-- so
the needs of humanity are huge.

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:09.340 align:middle line:90%
They're huge.

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:11.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And a
soul will generally

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:15.100 align:middle line:84%
re-up if that has been
their mission by design.

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:16.750 align:middle line:90%
I do get that.

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:19.870 align:middle line:84%
But it's interesting
because so many people

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:22.280 align:middle line:84%
that I talked to-- and now
this audience is different.

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.880 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be talking
to a lot of IP souls

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:28.000 align:middle line:84%
in this audience, a lot of
EBs, a lot of angelic types

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.550 align:middle line:84%
because they're gathering
here and attracted

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:32.035 align:middle line:90%
to this message for a reason.

00:19:32.035 --> 00:19:32.207 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Right.

00:19:32.207 --> 00:19:32.380 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:33.797 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we
already know that.

00:19:33.797 --> 00:19:35.810 align:middle line:84%
It's a higher
percentage of that.

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:39.670 align:middle line:84%
But even among
these lovely beings,

00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:41.530 align:middle line:84%
I hear so many
people say, I'm done.

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:43.180 align:middle line:90%
I am never coming back.

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:46.130 align:middle line:84%
Now I get this is
personality speaking.

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:49.570 align:middle line:84%
But when it gets to super
challenging times like this,

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:51.250 align:middle line:84%
historically, what
have you noticed

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:52.450 align:middle line:90%
in some of your clients?

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:55.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well, I
hear that a lot myself.

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.860 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I'm
never coming back.

00:19:56.860 --> 00:20:00.880 align:middle line:84%
Or what I hear so
often is, I just

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:02.710 align:middle line:90%
know this is last lifetime.

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:04.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I hear
that all the time.

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:05.950 align:middle line:90%
And I think, probably not.

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:07.510 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And the comment I so often
make, along with probably

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:15.640 align:middle line:84%
not because I totally agree with
that, the other comment I often

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:19.510 align:middle line:84%
make is that people don't stop
and think about, or understand,

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:22.880 align:middle line:84%
that their soul is working
in the higher realm--

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:23.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.550 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: --right now.

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:27.340 align:middle line:90%
So we think, oh well, I'm done.

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:29.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go back to
wherever I came from,

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:32.140 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to eat pizza
and drink beer all afternoon

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:33.220 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:34.580 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work that way.

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:36.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, it does
not work that way.

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:37.930 align:middle line:84%
But just wanted to
put it out there.

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:42.820 align:middle line:84%
No one's trapped, but be
patient because your other more

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:45.650 align:middle line:84%
elevated half
understands, it's OK.

00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:46.450 align:middle line:90%
You're OK.

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:48.367 align:middle line:84%
You're just not happy
with what you're dealing

00:20:48.367 --> 00:20:49.750 align:middle line:90%
with on the ground right now.

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:51.970 align:middle line:84%
And yes, you have a
choice, if you really

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:53.830 align:middle line:90%
wanted to, as a soul.

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:54.847 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Right.

00:20:54.847 --> 00:20:55.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To go elsewhere.

00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:59.200 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: The soul that comes
to my mind as we're talking--

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.810 align:middle line:84%
and I actually know this
is an Earth-based soul--

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:03.547 align:middle line:84%
is the soul of Ruth
Bader Ginsburg.

00:21:03.547 --> 00:21:04.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:06.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: So she's
a great example.

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:09.760 align:middle line:84%
She is not an IP soul, to
the best of my understanding.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.790 align:middle line:84%
But think about
Ruth Bader Ginsburg

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:15.700 align:middle line:84%
and how she fought
through illness

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:18.880 align:middle line:84%
and did not retire, didn't
leave the Supreme Court,

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:23.630 align:middle line:84%
and basically, died because
her body just gave up on her.

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:26.770 align:middle line:84%
So that's the way more
experienced souls function.

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:28.930 align:middle line:90%
She's a perfect example of that.

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:30.683 align:middle line:84%
And if she were an
IP, I don't know

00:21:30.683 --> 00:21:32.350 align:middle line:84%
that it would be
dramatically different.

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:33.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:34.270 align:middle line:90%
Perfect example.

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:35.410 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:36.430 align:middle line:90%
Purpose matters.

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:38.890 align:middle line:84%
Purpose and dedication
to what's happening

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:41.980 align:middle line:84%
with the human species in our
evolution and development, all

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:43.180 align:middle line:90%
of us, wherever we're from--

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:43.420 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Right.

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:45.087 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --is of
tantamount importance.

00:21:45.087 --> 00:21:48.370 align:middle line:84%
So now let's get into
some of the challenges

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:53.038 align:middle line:84%
that you notice because there's
a reason people watching

00:21:53.038 --> 00:21:54.205 align:middle line:90%
this are watching right now.

00:21:54.205 --> 00:21:55.660 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Right.

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:57.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's first talk
about Earth-based souls

00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:59.980 align:middle line:84%
and how they deal
with incarnating here,

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:02.080 align:middle line:90%
because they've been here a lot.

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And so, are there any particular
challenges, in general,

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:07.600 align:middle line:90%
for Earth-based souls?

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:10.690 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Well, yes.

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:12.430 align:middle line:84%
That's easy for me
to answer because I'm

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:13.390 align:middle line:90%
an Earth-based soul.

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:15.130 align:middle line:90%
So Earth-based souls that--

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:16.450 align:middle line:90%
and it's always easy.

00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:18.550 align:middle line:84%
I always hate to pigeonhole
this with numbers.

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:20.950 align:middle line:84%
But Earth-based souls
that are sevens and above,

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:24.070 align:middle line:84%
or eights and
above, will usually

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:27.400 align:middle line:84%
be very sensitive to
energy, whether that's

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:30.700 align:middle line:84%
natural disaster, whether
it's a huge crowd of people

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:32.680 align:middle line:90%
with a lot of unhealthy energy.

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And they may have
difficulty, as do I at times.

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:39.970 align:middle line:84%
Earth-based souls
sometimes have to be

00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:43.690 align:middle line:90%
somewhat cautious about diet.

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:45.020 align:middle line:90%
It's still very different.

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:47.590 align:middle line:84%
I know we'll talk
about IPs in a moment.

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:52.210 align:middle line:84%
So, advanced Earth-based
souls don't just live, day in

00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:58.660 align:middle line:84%
and day out with no challenges,
no, what we might call mind,

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:02.260 align:middle line:90%
body, spirit issues.

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:05.120 align:middle line:84%
It still doesn't
look like an IP soul.

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:08.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know for
myself, when something's

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:11.870 align:middle line:84%
going on on the planet,
I will be very affected.

00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:14.600 align:middle line:84%
I'll either have more
anxiety during the day

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.100 align:middle line:90%
than I normally would have.

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:20.010 align:middle line:84%
I'll have a more challenging
night of sleep than I might.

00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:21.780 align:middle line:90%
So that does exist.

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:26.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So energy
at large, and locale,

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:30.200 align:middle line:84%
and in general, whether it's
a personal energetic field

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.750 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's something
at large, Earth-based souls

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:35.100 align:middle line:84%
tend to really
tap into energies.

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:36.980 align:middle line:90%
OK, now let's talk about--

00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:39.740 align:middle line:84%
which can be destabilizing
or it can feed you.

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:42.270 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about IP souls
now, which as we already said,

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:43.070 align:middle line:90%
are a mixed bag.

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:44.630 align:middle line:90%
They're the Cantina band.

00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:46.110 align:middle line:90%
They're from everywhere.

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:46.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:50.441 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
makes them so unique,

00:23:50.441 --> 00:23:51.860 align:middle line:90%
unique in terms of gifts.

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:55.160 align:middle line:84%
So I know we're not
talking about gifts,

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:58.530 align:middle line:90%
but the gifts of IPs are broad.

00:23:58.530 --> 00:23:59.337 align:middle line:90%
And so that's

00:23:59.337 --> 00:24:00.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: From-- No.

00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:01.337 align:middle line:90%
Please talk about the gifts.

00:24:01.337 --> 00:24:03.672 align:middle line:84%
We don't just have to
speak of challenges.

00:24:03.672 --> 00:24:05.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well, the gifts,
of course, are important.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:07.670 align:middle line:10%
So the gifts are
anything from music

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:15.230 align:middle line:10%
to art to politics to
organic gardening to--

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:18.020 align:middle line:10%
I want people to think
about IP souls gifts

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:23.720 align:middle line:10%
as not necessarily what they
might label as extraordinary,

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:26.000 align:middle line:10%
except they might be an
extraordinary parent.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.480 align:middle line:84%
They might be an extraordinary
neighbor, whatever.

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.570 align:middle line:84%
So it's always
important-- because I

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:34.760 align:middle line:84%
find, humans, it's
like, well, what have

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.510 align:middle line:90%
I accomplished with my life?

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:38.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you've been
a wonderful neighbor

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:44.030 align:middle line:84%
or you ran the
best trash disposal

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:47.445 align:middle line:84%
service in your community,
that's extraordinary.

00:24:47.445 --> 00:24:48.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.120 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yeah.

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:51.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's very
important that we understand,

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:53.300 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't have to
look like something

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:56.030 align:middle line:84%
on the cover of a magazine
to be truly extraordinary.

00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:57.710 align:middle line:90%
We overlook these things.

00:24:57.710 --> 00:25:01.610 align:middle line:84%
People that show up
and do their lives

00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:03.950 align:middle line:84%
in a way that offers
some excellence,

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:07.940 align:middle line:84%
and as you say, some wisdom
along with it, to me,

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:10.520 align:middle line:90%
that's the ultimate beauty.

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:16.030 align:middle line:84%
And it seems like it's becoming
a more rare kind of resource

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:17.060 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:18.918 align:middle line:84%
So many people seem
to show up and not

00:25:18.918 --> 00:25:20.710 align:middle line:84%
be doing what they're
supposed to be doing,

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:23.170 align:middle line:84%
showing up in jobs,
half prepared,

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:24.650 align:middle line:90%
or not caring anymore.

00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:26.260 align:middle line:84%
We're going to--
maybe you can comment

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:27.710 align:middle line:90%
on that in a little bit.

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:30.740 align:middle line:84%
But we seem to be going through
such a slippery time where

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:31.540 align:middle line:90%
quality--

00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:33.790 align:middle line:84%
offering our quality
selves doesn't

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:36.593 align:middle line:84%
seem to be coming forward as
much as it did in the past.

00:25:36.593 --> 00:25:39.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: I think that reflects
the problems in humanity.

00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:39.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:44.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Is that we've
become so ego-based as to,

00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:45.460 align:middle line:90%
what kind of work do you do?

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:47.260 align:middle line:90%
Or how much money do you make?

00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:49.840 align:middle line:84%
But I'm flashing in my
mind, just a quick example.

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:52.480 align:middle line:84%
We've recently had
a major renovation

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.490 align:middle line:90%
in the back of our house.

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:57.835 align:middle line:84%
And my husband is a major
yard and gardening person.

00:25:57.835 --> 00:25:58.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's wonderful.

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:01.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: He loves that,
and it's his therapy.

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And so he found a man
who works for a yard

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:08.380 align:middle line:84%
company that does
sprinkler systems and all

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:09.200 align:middle line:90%
that kind of thing.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:12.700 align:middle line:84%
So this man arrives, and now
he's probably been to our yard

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:13.570 align:middle line:90%
any number of times.

00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:15.010 align:middle line:90%
But this man arrives.

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:18.070 align:middle line:84%
He's rather-- not big,
heavy, not that matters.

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:19.900 align:middle line:84%
But he's a big,
broad-shouldered man.

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And he's got earrings and
tattoos and all of that,

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:27.010 align:middle line:90%
which is also perfectly fine.

00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:32.840 align:middle line:84%
He's the kindest, gentlest,
most nature-oriented person.

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And so he came to repair a
sprinkler or two in our yard,

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:40.082 align:middle line:84%
and he glanced over
at our lilac bushes

00:26:40.082 --> 00:26:42.040 align:middle line:84%
and he said to my husband--
and they've kind of

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:43.870 align:middle line:90%
built this lovely rapport.

00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:49.150 align:middle line:84%
And he said, could I suggest
how you trim those lilac bushes?

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:52.040 align:middle line:84%
And so now that my husband
has trimmed the lilac bushes,

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:53.470 align:middle line:84%
they're doing a
whole lot better.

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:55.340 align:middle line:84%
My guess is this
man was an IP soul.

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:56.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:56.140 --> 00:27:00.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: I don't know that
for a fact, obviously, but kind,

00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:04.150 align:middle line:84%
gentle, wise, and,
on the surface--

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:08.020 align:middle line:84%
what we, as conventional people
might say, unusual looking.

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:10.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, unusual,
kind of a rough presence,

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:11.620 align:middle line:90%
and he's just a sweetie pie.

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:12.420 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Exactly.

00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:14.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you can't judge
that way, that's for sure.

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:16.570 align:middle line:84%
I know a couple of
people in my life,

00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:20.180 align:middle line:84%
and they're just so
good at what they do.

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And one that I just
ran into him recently,

00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:25.390 align:middle line:84%
he's a young man,
maybe 19-years-old,

00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:29.110 align:middle line:84%
working at a coffee shop, taking
orders, and making drinks.

00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:33.370 align:middle line:84%
He is, I would think,
an angelic type being.

00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:37.360 align:middle line:84%
That's the first thing I saw is
these shiny eyes and pale skin

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:40.030 align:middle line:84%
and the kindest
disposition, just

00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:41.920 align:middle line:90%
in, how can I make that for you.

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:44.170 align:middle line:84%
And just everything
about him was just

00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:46.760 align:middle line:90%
oozing light and kindness.

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And I have such appreciation,
he made a beautiful drink,

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:50.740 align:middle line:90%
perfectly.

00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:53.290 align:middle line:84%
Just little things
like that, someone

00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:57.500 align:middle line:84%
taking time to do something
well or even perfectly,

00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:59.620 align:middle line:84%
that is the greatest
joy right now on Earth,

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:01.527 align:middle line:90%
just to witness this for me.

00:28:01.527 --> 00:28:03.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: I mean, I think
that as humans, sadly--

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:05.740 align:middle line:84%
and I do this probably
as much as anybody--

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:07.090 align:middle line:90%
we pigeonhole people.

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:07.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:08.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: So it's
like, oh, why does

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:09.880 align:middle line:90%
that person look so different?

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:12.470 align:middle line:84%
Or oh, why are they
behaving quite like that?

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:14.530 align:middle line:90%
And I'm a student of people.

00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:16.090 align:middle line:90%
That's why I do what I do.

00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, I could
sit in an airport

00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:20.870 align:middle line:84%
and watch people
for hours and hours.

00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:21.670 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And my mind is, who
are they, where do they

00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:26.380 align:middle line:90%
come from, why are they here?

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:30.310 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean, do they
come from Iowa or France?

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:31.990 align:middle line:90%
And understand them.

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:35.950 align:middle line:84%
And just the way you're
describing this barista that

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:37.930 align:middle line:90%
works in your coffee shop.

00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:41.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so, let's
go now to IP souls

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:43.795 align:middle line:84%
and some of the
challenges they have.

00:28:43.795 --> 00:28:46.270 align:middle line:84%
We just talked about
the fact that they

00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:50.440 align:middle line:84%
bring a certain amount of
wisdom, and perhaps talent

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:52.810 align:middle line:84%
to the table, that
can be utilized

00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:54.490 align:middle line:90%
on Earth in a variety of ways.

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:58.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well, when you ask
that, Regina, it causes me to--

00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:01.990 align:middle line:84%
I like to kind of sit here
and think about two hats

00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:02.800 align:middle line:90%
that I wear.

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And so, obviously, I wear
a hat as a psychologist,

00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:08.620 align:middle line:90%
and used to be conventional.

00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:11.870 align:middle line:84%
But I'm trained in abnormal
psychology and all of that.

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:13.780 align:middle line:84%
And then I wear
this spiritual hat

00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:16.480 align:middle line:84%
where I understand
people and souls.

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:19.600 align:middle line:84%
So I'm thinking about
a particular client.

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:21.280 align:middle line:90%
This is a man--

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:23.110 align:middle line:84%
when I first met him,
I think in his 20s.

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:26.110 align:middle line:90%


00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:29.980 align:middle line:84%
Conventionally, and what we
would call-- fancy word again--

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:33.370 align:middle line:84%
psychopathologically,
meaning abnormal psychology,

00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:37.180 align:middle line:84%
he probably would
have been labeled

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:39.400 align:middle line:84%
on the borderline
of schizophrenia,

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:41.050 align:middle line:84%
on the borderline
of something called

00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:44.050 align:middle line:84%
schizoid, which is
related to schizophrenia

00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:48.850 align:middle line:84%
because his difficulty
being out in public.

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:53.330 align:middle line:84%
So I had to figure out-- to
make this a little bit shorter.

00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:58.480 align:middle line:84%
I had to figure out when I first
met him, OK, where does he fit?

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And flipping back and forth with
my hats, way too articulate,

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:10.290 align:middle line:84%
way too worldly
knowledgeable, didn't

00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:12.990 align:middle line:84%
have any, what I would
call, formal schizophrenic

00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:14.640 align:middle line:90%
characteristics.

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:20.070 align:middle line:84%
IP soul-- hard to go out
in public, very, very wise,

00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:24.120 align:middle line:84%
reads three or four
digital newspapers a day,

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:27.500 align:middle line:90%
not schizophrenic.

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:29.330 align:middle line:84%
But he wanted to
become educated.

00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:31.460 align:middle line:84%
He wanted either to
become an attorney

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:33.830 align:middle line:90%
or get an advanced degree.

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:35.600 align:middle line:84%
He already had an
undergraduate degree.

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:38.130 align:middle line:84%
Very tricky for him to
be out in the world.

00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:42.500 align:middle line:84%
So he's an example
of an IP soul.

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:48.590 align:middle line:84%
He's one type of example
that struggles with energy.

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:51.750 align:middle line:84%
Physiologically, which
I'll speak to in a second.

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:57.530 align:middle line:84%
But he doesn't struggle a lot
with actual physical anomalies

00:30:57.530 --> 00:31:00.980 align:middle line:84%
or issues or problems,
but energy is--

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:03.660 align:middle line:84%
and people's energy--
is really hard for him.

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:06.450 align:middle line:90%
So that's one example.

00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:09.530 align:middle line:84%
Another example, though,
would be many clients

00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:15.050 align:middle line:84%
that I have that are IPs, where
their diet is very, very narrow

00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:18.950 align:middle line:84%
because there's almost nothing
they can eat that doesn't upset

00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:20.780 align:middle line:90%
their whole GI system.

00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:24.050 align:middle line:90%


00:31:24.050 --> 00:31:29.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Would that be one of
the most common traits for IPs,

00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:33.280 align:middle line:84%
in terms of very obvious
challenges, once you peel back

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:36.220 align:middle line:84%
the layers and, in a regression,
are chatting with them?

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:38.200 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: When you
asked that, it's

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:40.060 align:middle line:84%
like, OK, trying
to make it simple

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:43.490 align:middle line:90%
and really give you an answer.

00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:45.910 align:middle line:84%
I would say the
traits would be either

00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:53.280 align:middle line:84%
physiological like allergies,
but serious allergies.

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And let's couple that,
try to make it simple,

00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:57.030 align:middle line:90%
with autoimmune disorders.

00:31:57.030 --> 00:31:58.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, yeah.

00:31:58.350 --> 00:32:01.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: And then the
other, basically, would

00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:08.040 align:middle line:84%
be the autistic spectrum, the
entire broad-based autistic

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:09.090 align:middle line:90%
spectrum.

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:10.890 align:middle line:90%
Often, those are IP souls.

00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:12.090 align:middle line:90%
So that's not--

00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:13.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could say
the autistic spectrum

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:15.000 align:middle line:90%
is physiological.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.390 align:middle line:84%
But it's really more
neurological in nature.

00:32:19.390 --> 00:32:23.280 align:middle line:84%
So, we have a lot
of fabulous children

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:26.005 align:middle line:84%
that are, in my
opinion, misdiagnosed--

00:32:26.005 --> 00:32:26.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:30.000 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: --as mom
took the wrong pill

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.255 align:middle line:84%
when she was pregnant or the
wrong vaccine or whatever.

00:32:33.255 --> 00:32:35.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK,
that's interesting.

00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:36.610 align:middle line:90%
Suzy Miller-- do you know Suzy?

00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:37.410 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: I do.

00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:39.618 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I'm going to
be bringing her back here.

00:32:39.618 --> 00:32:41.040 align:middle line:90%
We haven't met in a few years.

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:43.350 align:middle line:84%
But as she continues
to do her work,

00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:47.550 align:middle line:84%
we were talking privately
the other day, and she said,

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:49.890 align:middle line:84%
I didn't talk about that
much in the early days.

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:52.680 align:middle line:84%
But most of my clients,
they're not from here.

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:55.450 align:middle line:84%
Most of these people, these
kids aren't from here.

00:32:55.450 --> 00:33:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk about the fact
that we're seeing an increase,

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:05.592 align:middle line:90%
now, in IP incarnations.

00:33:05.592 --> 00:33:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And this is through a lot
of different people's work.

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:09.210 align:middle line:90%
I interview a lot of people.

00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:10.800 align:middle line:90%
This is picking up.

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:13.500 align:middle line:84%
And I believe it's
for a good reason.

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:15.250 align:middle line:90%
We need the help right now.

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And as these souls mature
and bring with them

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:20.200 align:middle line:84%
some specific knowledge,
technological, wisdom,

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:23.670 align:middle line:84%
love, it's going to
start, over time,

00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:27.780 align:middle line:84%
inculcating that into society
and creating our next evolution

00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:28.650 align:middle line:90%
as humans.

00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:31.140 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of them
appear to be autistic.

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:33.570 align:middle line:84%
And more and more
people that are born

00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:35.190 align:middle line:84%
are going to appear
to be autistic.

00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:37.090 align:middle line:90%
This is a big deal.

00:33:37.090 --> 00:33:40.540 align:middle line:90%
This is a big problem.

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:43.333 align:middle line:84%
So how are we going to
begin approaching this?

00:33:43.333 --> 00:33:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's partly why I wanted
to talk to you on this show

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:50.173 align:middle line:84%
today, for parents of people
with autistic kids to start--

00:33:50.173 --> 00:33:52.340 align:middle line:84%
really, let's look at this,
frame this in a new way.

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:54.560 align:middle line:84%
What is the genius
that resides within?

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:56.330 align:middle line:84%
And we know, we're
talking Asperger's

00:33:56.330 --> 00:34:01.190 align:middle line:84%
to lower functioning,
almost disabled autism

00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:02.300 align:middle line:90%
and different thing.

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:03.600 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about this.

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:06.790 align:middle line:90%
What are we going to do?

00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:08.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: So if
we can, let's first

00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:13.560 align:middle line:84%
put this in maybe a slightly
broader frame, if you will.

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:15.480 align:middle line:84%
Broader frame, as
I understand it--

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:19.080 align:middle line:84%
and this is coming almost faster
and more furiously through

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:21.239 align:middle line:90%
my clients--

00:34:21.239 --> 00:34:26.080 align:middle line:84%
there is a guiding
force that I have

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:27.880 align:middle line:90%
been taught to call the Manu.

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:35.380 align:middle line:84%
This is a group soul
of advanced souls

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:38.400 align:middle line:84%
that have never been
incarnate on Earth,

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:44.080 align:middle line:84%
that are charged with doing
what they can to guide humanity.

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:46.620 align:middle line:90%
And so, again, these are IPs.

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:48.179 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they've been around--

00:34:48.179 --> 00:34:51.828 align:middle line:84%
I can't even-- if you
said, how old are they?

00:34:51.828 --> 00:34:54.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We won't go there
because time is irrelevant.

00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:54.840 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Exactly.

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:55.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:55.820 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Exactly.

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:58.890 align:middle line:90%
So, they-- the Manu--

00:34:58.890 --> 00:35:00.480 align:middle line:84%
people can use any
term they want.

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:02.063 align:middle line:84%
They could call it
the source, call it

00:35:02.063 --> 00:35:03.810 align:middle line:90%
what they want to call it.

00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:08.010 align:middle line:84%
They are constantly, you
might say brainstorming,

00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:10.880 align:middle line:90%
what can we do to help Earth?

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And so that speaks to-- the
reason I'm saying that is,

00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:18.520 align:middle line:84%
that speaks to why
we're seeing more--

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:22.672 align:middle line:84%
we're only talking about one
area of challenge for IP souls.

00:35:22.672 --> 00:35:24.130 align:middle line:84%
But that speaks to
why we're seeing

00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:27.550 align:middle line:84%
more and more IPs on
the autistic spectrum

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:31.860 align:middle line:84%
because the Manu
doesn't know how

00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:33.540 align:middle line:90%
to solve humanity's problems.

00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:37.920 align:middle line:84%
The Manu, who are
very, very, very wise,

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:39.570 align:middle line:90%
they're experimenting.

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:42.150 align:middle line:90%
And so they're bringing more--

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:44.160 align:middle line:84%
one means of trying
to help Earth.

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:46.920 align:middle line:84%
They're bringing more
IP souls to Earth.

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:49.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Recruiting
more IP souls.

00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:51.450 align:middle line:90%
And so how does this work now?

00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:55.080 align:middle line:84%
You have more and more of
these beings that really

00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:57.430 align:middle line:90%
struggle with being in a body.

00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And now, you have
parents that don't

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:00.850 align:middle line:90%
understand what's going on.

00:36:00.850 --> 00:36:04.550 align:middle line:84%
And they're being taken to
allopathic, you know, MDs.

00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:05.350 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Right.

00:36:05.350 --> 00:36:07.803 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they're
being drugged.

00:36:07.803 --> 00:36:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I'm
saying, this is

00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:12.490 align:middle line:84%
going to be a bigger problem in
the future than it is even now.

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:16.540 align:middle line:84%
So how do-- let's say, we have
some parents listening to this.

00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:21.110 align:middle line:90%


00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:24.770 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: I'm trying to decide
whether to bring this up,

00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:26.330 align:middle line:90%
and I will.

00:36:26.330 --> 00:36:29.670 align:middle line:84%
So my husband and I have
children and grandchildren.

00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:32.660 align:middle line:84%
One of our grandchildren
spent some years

00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:35.660 align:middle line:90%
going to a beautiful school--

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:37.610 align:middle line:90%
I'll just say in the Bay Area--

00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:41.300 align:middle line:84%
for children with, what we call
today, learning difficulties.

00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:43.535 align:middle line:90%
That's the current PC lingo.

00:36:43.535 --> 00:36:46.500 align:middle line:90%


00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:51.840 align:middle line:84%
The children at this school
are fantastic children.

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:54.230 align:middle line:84%
I spent many times going
to grandparents day

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:56.010 align:middle line:90%
and meeting these children.

00:36:56.010 --> 00:37:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And so that's one way
this is being dealt with,

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:04.760 align:middle line:84%
many of these children,
including our own grandson,

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:08.570 align:middle line:84%
because of the focus
of this school,

00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:12.200 align:middle line:84%
they helped these
children learn how to--

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:14.420 align:middle line:84%
use the word focus again--
focus on their work

00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:16.190 align:middle line:90%
because there's a lot of ADHD.

00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:17.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:19.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: So, as
humans, we have

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:24.950 align:middle line:84%
to keep broadening
schools for children.

00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:26.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is huge.

00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:31.070 align:middle line:84%
Big bug of mine is education has
to be completely reformed now

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:33.800 align:middle line:84%
to accommodate where
we're going as a species,

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:36.350 align:middle line:90%
and these new humans coming in.

00:37:36.350 --> 00:37:38.120 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Well, yes.

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And sadly, I mean, you
and I, and probably

00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:45.980 align:middle line:84%
most of the listeners, are
not the norm in our culture.

00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:46.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yep.

00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:51.460 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: So we belong to a
certain subset of humanity.

00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to say and,
not but, because I always

00:37:54.490 --> 00:37:55.900 align:middle line:90%
like the word and, not but.

00:37:55.900 --> 00:38:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And you and me and listeners,
it's our responsibility--

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:03.190 align:middle line:90%
in my humble opinion--

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:07.690 align:middle line:84%
to expand the perspective, to
start more schools like this,

00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:11.110 align:middle line:84%
to encourage people
that, maybe once

00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:13.810 align:middle line:84%
thought they wanted to go
to a formal MD program,

00:38:13.810 --> 00:38:18.200 align:middle line:84%
and they end up going into
a homeopathic MD program.

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:19.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: And to encourage that
because we need more of that,

00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:28.060 align:middle line:84%
or to teach conventionally
trained MDs to collaborate

00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:34.090 align:middle line:84%
with the local homeopath
or chiropractor

00:38:34.090 --> 00:38:36.220 align:middle line:90%
or whoever, or acupuncturist.

00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:38.540 align:middle line:90%
That has to broaden.

00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:39.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:40.140 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:42.130 align:middle line:84%
So here, we're talking
about a specific group

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:44.560 align:middle line:84%
of people that
appear as autistic

00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:47.140 align:middle line:90%
or appear as learning disabled.

00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:51.130 align:middle line:84%
But there is a plethora
of types of beings

00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:53.920 align:middle line:84%
that are IPs that are
struggling here where it's not

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:58.312 align:middle line:84%
so obvious, where the
child shows up and says,

00:38:58.312 --> 00:38:59.770 align:middle line:84%
well, I don't want
to eat anything.

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:00.910 align:middle line:90%
I know this one girl.

00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:04.090 align:middle line:84%
I won't eat anything-- she won't
do anything that isn't white.

00:39:04.090 --> 00:39:06.220 align:middle line:84%
White bread, white
noodles, milk.

00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:08.260 align:middle line:84%
She won't eat
anything with color.

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And she's gone on to grow up,
have children who are healthy,

00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:11.920 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And you're thinking,
oh, my God, what's

00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:15.295 align:middle line:84%
going to happen to this
person down the road?

00:39:15.295 --> 00:39:18.670 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about what
happens when your body can't

00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:22.712 align:middle line:84%
tolerate foods, where
kids are saying,

00:39:22.712 --> 00:39:23.920 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to go to school.

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:24.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm bored.

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:26.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm not learning anything there.

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:28.570 align:middle line:90%
It's just so slow for me.

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:31.690 align:middle line:84%
These would be more
garden-variety types

00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:35.650 align:middle line:90%
of qualities of IPs.

00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:37.930 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:39:37.930 --> 00:39:40.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have to educate
teachers to understand this.

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:41.300 align:middle line:90%
We have to--

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:42.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:45.400 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: We have to
stop pigeonholing people.

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:49.150 align:middle line:84%
And sadly, and it's
not just in America.

00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:52.340 align:middle line:84%
Many countries
pigeonhole people.

00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:54.665 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to
broaden that perspective.

00:39:54.665 --> 00:39:56.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How is this
going to happen, Linda?

00:39:56.540 --> 00:40:00.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, who is going to go into
the education system and say,

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:02.770 align:middle line:84%
are you aware we have
beings incarnating

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:06.160 align:middle line:84%
from vast regions of the
universe to help out right now

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.510 align:middle line:90%
and they're having trouble?

00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:09.520 align:middle line:84%
Right, that conversation
is not happening.

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:10.690 align:middle line:90%
You're doing your part.

00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:10.930 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Right.

00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:12.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're doing
everything you can.

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:15.740 align:middle line:84%
We're all doing each
thing as individuals.

00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:17.500 align:middle line:90%
What's it going to take before--

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:19.660 align:middle line:84%
well, like you say,
starting a school,

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:22.330 align:middle line:84%
making a different choice to
go into homeopathy, perhaps,

00:40:22.330 --> 00:40:24.700 align:middle line:90%
instead of allopathic.

00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:27.700 align:middle line:84%
But everyone here right now
can make decisions regarding

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:29.680 align:middle line:84%
their loved ones,
friends, and family

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:34.040 align:middle line:90%
in recognizing the differences.

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:38.995 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: I mean, what pops
into my mind as you say that--

00:40:38.995 --> 00:40:41.120 align:middle line:84%
yeah, I'm going to go down
this road because that's

00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:45.710 align:middle line:84%
what my guides just-- it
brings my mind to what

00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:47.630 align:middle line:90%
we call democracy.

00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:50.030 align:middle line:84%
So what's the
foundation of democracy?

00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And I'm speaking
about things that I

00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:54.830 align:middle line:84%
know are going on in the higher
realm, as well as on Earth.

00:40:54.830 --> 00:40:57.320 align:middle line:84%
So what's the
foundation of democracy?

00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:00.690 align:middle line:90%
It's that every person matters.

00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:02.340 align:middle line:84%
That's really what
democracy is about.

00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:03.990 align:middle line:90%
It's like, my vote matters.

00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:06.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:07.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: So
then-- and I happen

00:41:07.830 --> 00:41:11.430 align:middle line:84%
to be a very
politically-oriented person

00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:14.820 align:middle line:84%
in following politics,
and obviously, people

00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:17.980 align:middle line:84%
would imagine I'm quite
liberal in that respect.

00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:19.870 align:middle line:90%
We have to look at--

00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:24.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this may sound like
a soapbox, but it's like,

00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:26.190 align:middle line:90%
as we come up--

00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:29.410 align:middle line:84%
in any culture, if we
live in a democracy,

00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:34.920 align:middle line:84%
we're going to vote for people
that have a broad perspective.

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:36.600 align:middle line:90%
Vote for people that are--

00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:37.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Inclusive.

00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:38.950 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: That's right.

00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:39.750 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:44.430 align:middle line:84%
That's right, because
that's where we can--

00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:47.370 align:middle line:84%
to use a phrase that's used a
lot-- make our voices heard.

00:41:47.370 --> 00:41:48.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:49.540 align:middle line:90%
No, that makes perfect sense.

00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:52.920 align:middle line:84%
Just that simple distinction,
are you exclusive?

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:57.960 align:middle line:84%
Are you excluding entire groups
of people, as a politician,

00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:59.290 align:middle line:90%
or are you inclusive?

00:41:59.290 --> 00:42:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And I think if you don't
look at a politician

00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:04.380 align:middle line:84%
any other way than
exclusive versus inclusive,

00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:07.680 align:middle line:84%
then you at least have somewhere
to go in this crazy world we're

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:09.670 align:middle line:90%
in, as to who to support.

00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:10.750 align:middle line:90%
So thank you for that.

00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:12.330 align:middle line:84%
And I know your
husband, Earl, was

00:42:12.330 --> 00:42:15.090 align:middle line:84%
in political science, a
professor of political science.

00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:16.870 align:middle line:84%
You guys understand
how this works.

00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:17.670 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Right.

00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:20.970 align:middle line:84%
And I might just add in,
because I have some awareness

00:42:20.970 --> 00:42:24.000 align:middle line:84%
through clients and through
intuitive information,

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:29.430 align:middle line:84%
that the higher
realm is working on--

00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:31.800 align:middle line:84%
the way I hear it is
they're called task forces.

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:35.250 align:middle line:84%
The higher realm, which
means a group of the higher

00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:38.820 align:middle line:84%
selves of many souls,
are coming together

00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:42.660 align:middle line:84%
to work on, I'll
call it guidance,

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:44.730 align:middle line:84%
because the higher realm
doesn't come down here.

00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:46.440 align:middle line:90%
You can make changes down here.

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:47.820 align:middle line:90%
I can make changes down here.

00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:49.740 align:middle line:90%
But our souls can only guide.

00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:55.830 align:middle line:84%
The higher realm is focused on
climate change and democracy

00:42:55.830 --> 00:42:58.810 align:middle line:84%
right now because
that's so crucial.

00:42:58.810 --> 00:43:00.480 align:middle line:84%
So we think about
climate change,

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:02.340 align:middle line:90%
and then we think about IPs.

00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:07.920 align:middle line:84%
And IPs struggle with
inhalants, toxins in the air.

00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:10.590 align:middle line:84%
If we don't deal
with climate change,

00:43:10.590 --> 00:43:13.050 align:middle line:84%
then how do we aid
these advanced souls

00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:14.670 align:middle line:84%
that are coming
in, that might be

00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:19.020 align:middle line:84%
IPs, that are so sensitive
to toxins in the air?

00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:20.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Also,
just as an overlay

00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:22.660 align:middle line:84%
to that, when we're talking
about climate change,

00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:25.690 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about,
in particular,

00:43:25.690 --> 00:43:28.920 align:middle line:84%
the things that humankind is
doing by way of pollutants.

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:31.230 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
putting garbage

00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:32.850 align:middle line:84%
in our water,
garbage in our air,

00:43:32.850 --> 00:43:34.410 align:middle line:90%
garbage in our food sources.

00:43:34.410 --> 00:43:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And these things are
toxic to all of humanity,

00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:39.750 align:middle line:84%
but particularly,
to sensitive souls.

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:42.280 align:middle line:84%
And they're having an
impact on the environment.

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:45.120 align:middle line:84%
This is not to be
discarding the notion

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:47.820 align:middle line:84%
that our planet goes through
climate change on its own.

00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:50.110 align:middle line:84%
It goes through cyclical
warming and cooling.

00:43:50.110 --> 00:43:51.840 align:middle line:84%
So let's just put
that on the table.

00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:54.180 align:middle line:84%
We're in a crazy
period of change.

00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:59.070 align:middle line:84%
But we don't have to be adding
all of this toxic exposure

00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:01.330 align:middle line:84%
to the environment
and ourselves.

00:44:01.330 --> 00:44:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what they're
coming in to look at, right,

00:44:04.050 --> 00:44:05.820 align:middle line:90%
and to help change?

00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:07.660 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Exactly.

00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:08.460 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:10.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even just
this morning as I

00:44:10.110 --> 00:44:13.380 align:middle line:84%
was driving around and
listening to Sirius radio

00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:17.820 align:middle line:84%
and listening to news,
they were talking about,

00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:20.640 align:middle line:84%
there isn't as much
pushback as there--

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:22.380 align:middle line:84%
this is obviously in
the United States.

00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:25.500 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't as much
pushback on the acceptance

00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:28.750 align:middle line:84%
of global warming in
the last year or two,

00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:30.640 align:middle line:90%
which we have to look at that.

00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:32.738 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We do have to
look at it because people

00:44:32.738 --> 00:44:34.530 align:middle line:84%
don't want to change
their ways, especially

00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:35.610 align:middle line:90%
if they profit by them.

00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:37.330 align:middle line:90%
And this is about profit.

00:44:37.330 --> 00:44:40.080 align:middle line:84%
This is about poisoning
the planet for profit.

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:42.000 align:middle line:84%
Now when we talk
about climate change

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.290 align:middle line:84%
because it's so loaded with
politics and carbon tax credits

00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:49.230 align:middle line:84%
and poor countries getting
screwed in the process,

00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:51.480 align:middle line:84%
that's not what we're talking
about when we're talking

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:53.490 align:middle line:90%
about dealing with the climate.

00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the
extraterrestrial souls

00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:59.400 align:middle line:84%
that would show up from other
planets and other places,

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:02.310 align:middle line:84%
the one thing they,
historically, for decade

00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:05.130 align:middle line:84%
after decade, before the word
climate change ever happened,

00:45:05.130 --> 00:45:09.630 align:middle line:84%
showed was, you can't keep
doing this stuff to your planet.

00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:14.370 align:middle line:84%
Little greys were showing this
to people, to tall whites,

00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:15.630 align:middle line:90%
to Venutians.

00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:17.250 align:middle line:84%
They all came with
the same message,

00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:19.370 align:middle line:90%
stop pooping on your planet.

00:45:19.370 --> 00:45:20.170 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Right.

00:45:20.170 --> 00:45:22.462 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so you're saying
now, some of these souls

00:45:22.462 --> 00:45:26.190 align:middle line:84%
coming in are going to see to
it that we stop these practices.

00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:28.290 align:middle line:90%
That's their mission.

00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:29.730 align:middle line:90%
Good for you.

00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:31.380 align:middle line:84%
Good for everyone
that is working

00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:35.580 align:middle line:84%
toward allowing the beautiful
Earth to be her healthy self.

00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:38.430 align:middle line:10%
>>BACKMAN: Yes, and
it's a monumental task.

00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:43.620 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I've heard many
times that Earth, humanity,

00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:47.850 align:middle line:10%
is an experiment to
see if we, as humans--

00:45:47.850 --> 00:45:50.670 align:middle line:10%
that's why I focus
on souls in body.

00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:53.220 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I focus on what are our
higher selves doing as well.

00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:57.240 align:middle line:84%
But that it's you and
me and everybody else

00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:58.870 align:middle line:90%
out there that can make change.

00:45:58.870 --> 00:45:59.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:01.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: No one
else creates change.

00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:04.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, and there are
no ETs coming to save us.

00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:04.910 align:middle line:90%
We are them.

00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:05.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: That's right.

00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:06.920 align:middle line:90%
That is correct.

00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:09.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're all
already here to save us.

00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:10.290 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:46:10.290 --> 00:46:11.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Linda,
we're out of time.

00:46:11.770 --> 00:46:13.620 align:middle line:10%
So any final thought
before we go,

00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:15.450 align:middle line:10%
because we have so
much more that we can

00:46:15.450 --> 00:46:19.100 align:middle line:10%
discuss in a future interview?

00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:21.050 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: I guess,
I would just say,

00:46:21.050 --> 00:46:24.230 align:middle line:84%
Regina, that, for
all of us, myself

00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:28.190 align:middle line:84%
included, if we come
upon someone, obviously

00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:30.530 align:middle line:84%
in human life, that
seems different,

00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:35.680 align:middle line:84%
that seems what we might
call unusual, think again.

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And consider, who
is this person?

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.810 align:middle line:84%
What is this soul
about that's in body?

00:46:43.810 --> 00:46:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And why are they here, because
we're always here with purpose.

00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And so that we don't judge and
inappropriately classify people

00:46:54.730 --> 00:46:56.215 align:middle line:90%
we come into contact with.

00:46:56.215 --> 00:46:58.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And create
more isolation for them.

00:46:58.090 --> 00:46:58.890 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Exactly.

00:46:58.890 --> 00:47:00.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the point
of, not just that,

00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:02.620 align:middle line:84%
but of ourselves,
as individuals,

00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:05.380 align:middle line:84%
that hear this
message, understanding

00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:06.700 align:middle line:90%
you're not flawed.

00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:07.630 align:middle line:90%
You're OK.

00:47:07.630 --> 00:47:10.270 align:middle line:84%
You're just wired
differently in order

00:47:10.270 --> 00:47:13.060 align:middle line:84%
to be able to be here
and do your thing.

00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:14.322 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it might not be as fun.

00:47:14.322 --> 00:47:16.780 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you can't have ice cream
anymore because dairy is not

00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:18.070 align:middle line:90%
working, so deal with it.

00:47:18.070 --> 00:47:20.570 align:middle line:90%
But find an alternative.

00:47:20.570 --> 00:47:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's the point, is how
we, ourselves, can kind of take

00:47:24.130 --> 00:47:26.320 align:middle line:84%
some of the pressure off,
or how we have somehow

00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:28.300 align:middle line:84%
failed ourselves
because we're not

00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:31.150 align:middle line:84%
fitting in on one
level or another.

00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:32.680 align:middle line:84%
I think it's
important both ways.

00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:34.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Look
for your purpose.

00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And where you find
your purpose, you're

00:47:36.010 --> 00:47:37.340 align:middle line:90%
looking at your passions.

00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:39.010 align:middle line:90%
What are you passionate about?

00:47:39.010 --> 00:47:41.320 align:middle line:90%
That leads us to our purpose.

00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:42.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Here, here.

00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:45.130 align:middle line:84%
On that note, until next time,
thank you so much, Linda.
