00:00:17.896 --> 00:00:19.770 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Lee
Harris is back with me

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.010 align:middle line:10%
again to talk about the intense
energies that are mounting.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.230 align:middle line:10%
Certain theme words
keep popping up

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.889 align:middle line:10%
at this time, one being truth.

00:00:26.889 --> 00:00:28.680 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go to
the Zs in a little bit

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.620 align:middle line:84%
and learn how this energy
is supporting our growth.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:32.940 align:middle line:90%
And it's interesting.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.890 align:middle line:84%
The word truth is so
loaded these days.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have all this
awful stuff out in the world,

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.710 align:middle line:84%
in the mainstream media
and politics, tweeting

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.600 align:middle line:90%
and so forth, fake news.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.890 align:middle line:84%
But the bottom line is
it's not all external.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.060 align:middle line:90%
It's internal.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.670 align:middle line:84%
We're feeding ourself
fake news all the time.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.120 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we're feeding ourself
fake news almost all day

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.470 align:middle line:84%
everyday in our own internal
dialogue based on programming,

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.057 align:middle line:84%
based particularly on fear,
projections about the future.

00:01:03.057 --> 00:01:04.890 align:middle line:84%
That's why I thought
this conversation could

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.380 align:middle line:84%
be really good,
with the Zs today,

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.850 align:middle line:84%
to start really launching into
the information streams that

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.910 align:middle line:84%
are affecting our
reality so deeply.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:15.960 align:middle line:90%
So welcome back.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE HARRIS: Hi.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:17.700 align:middle line:90%
Good to be back.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And also, before
we even talk to the Zs,

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.890 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to chat with you a
little bit about the themes

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.200 align:middle line:84%
that you're noticing
among your clientele

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.870 align:middle line:84%
and the workshops and groups
you do around the world.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.520 align:middle line:84%
You must be seeing
certain themes

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.710 align:middle line:84%
emerging, kind of like the
search word, so to speak,

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.410 align:middle line:90%
of the subconscious psyche.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:35.550 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes, yes.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.110 align:middle line:10%
And for the group that resonate
with the work that I do,

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.620 align:middle line:10%
there have been a few
different themes coming up.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.080 align:middle line:84%
The big one that has come
up in the last few months

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.930 align:middle line:84%
is a phrase that came
through the Zs, which

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.380 align:middle line:84%
is you are needed,
and now is your time.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.147 align:middle line:84%
And I think in many ways,
we've heard this a lot,

00:01:52.147 --> 00:01:53.730 align:middle line:84%
and we've always
heard that this shift

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.250 align:middle line:84%
time would be a time
that people really

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.580 align:middle line:90%
have to stand in their power.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.520 align:middle line:84%
But for me, from
my perspective, I

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.770 align:middle line:84%
work a lot with sensitives,
empaths, intuitives, healers,

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.190 align:middle line:84%
people who have always had
a high degree of sensitivity

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.290 align:middle line:84%
and a high connection
with all realms,

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.410 align:middle line:90%
as well as the human realm.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.420 align:middle line:84%
The big message is
how are you dealing

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.060 align:middle line:84%
with the grounded stuff,
because you nail it,

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.520 align:middle line:84%
really, when you talk
about our programming.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.380 align:middle line:84%
We can understand
spiritual concepts,

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.300 align:middle line:84%
but we still bring
it back into the body

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.760 align:middle line:84%
and have to deal
with where we have

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.860 align:middle line:84%
been programmed by society,
by what happened to us.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.750 align:middle line:84%
So for example, a spiritual
truth for me could be you

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.300 align:middle line:84%
are free to create
everything in the universe.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.910 align:middle line:84%
And as I absorb that and
take that into my body,

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.310 align:middle line:84%
up comes the voice
that said, no, you

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.230 align:middle line:84%
have to work really
hard, and you're always

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.990 align:middle line:84%
going to have to work
hard if you want freedom.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.010 align:middle line:84%
I think we all are burning
through those things

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.810 align:middle line:90%
at the moment.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.790 align:middle line:84%
But there is a
rise in power, I'm

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.480 align:middle line:84%
noticing, for people who are
awakened, sensitive, empathic,

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.270 align:middle line:84%
but it's a grounded power
versus an energetic power.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.520 align:middle line:84%
I always think that the
people I've worked with

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.380 align:middle line:84%
and the time that
I've lived through,

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.900 align:middle line:84%
there was a lot about
accessing higher consciousness.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.180 align:middle line:84%
Bringing higher consciousness
down into the body.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And the last few years,
one of the messages

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.990 align:middle line:84%
that I've been called to work
on and with with people is OK,

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.926 align:middle line:90%
it's in here now.

00:03:18.926 --> 00:03:20.300 align:middle line:84%
How are we going
to alchemize it?

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.680 align:middle line:90%
And that's far harder.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.630 align:middle line:84%
It's far easier to
meditate out or to have

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.810 align:middle line:84%
a visionary moment that
takes you into other realms.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.720 align:middle line:84%
This stuff in the body, that's
really intense emotionally

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.480 align:middle line:84%
on the planet right now
too, because even people who

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.400 align:middle line:84%
are unconscious of
what's going on for them

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.730 align:middle line:84%
are highly emotional,
highly charged.

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.090 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of fear and a
lot of anxiety, much of which

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.770 align:middle line:84%
is perpetrated and
some of which I think

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.240 align:middle line:84%
is natural, because
I think we're

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.281 align:middle line:84%
seeing so many things
going on on the planet that

00:03:49.281 --> 00:03:50.340 align:middle line:90%
are distressing.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.817 align:middle line:90%
So how are we navigating that?

00:03:52.817 --> 00:03:55.400 align:middle line:84%
And the one big thing I'm always
called to work on with people

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.650 align:middle line:84%
is boundaries, because
that was a weak area for me

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.600 align:middle line:90%
as an empath and a sensitive.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And the thing I learn
over and over again

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.600 align:middle line:84%
is if you know who you are,
what you're here to do,

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.270 align:middle line:84%
and you can hold
that, you're going

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.110 align:middle line:84%
to be able to play your
part at this time in the way

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.020 align:middle line:84%
that you are designed
to play your part.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.529 align:middle line:84%
We're all part of
the jigsaw puzzle,

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:18.519 align:middle line:84%
and we all have
our piece to play.

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.870 align:middle line:84%
But empaths, sensitives,
intuitives, they

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.090 align:middle line:90%
can get lost in other people.

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.800 align:middle line:90%
I call it the abandoned self.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.957 align:middle line:84%
You know, a good
empath or a good--

00:04:26.957 --> 00:04:28.790 align:middle line:84%
because empaths are
usually good connectors,

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.480 align:middle line:84%
good healers, but
what part of ourself

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.220 align:middle line:84%
do we have to abandon
in order to be that.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.920 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm with you,
and you're angry,

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.690 align:middle line:84%
I have to get rid
of my joy, or I

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.450 align:middle line:84%
have to get rid of my own
natural state of peace

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.250 align:middle line:84%
in order to have a
connection with you

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.680 align:middle line:84%
because there's no
way your anger is

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.970 align:middle line:90%
going to be receptive to that.

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.680 align:middle line:84%
And what's the
cost to the empath

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.676 align:middle line:84%
or the sensitive of doing
that over and over again?

00:04:51.676 --> 00:04:52.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.290 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes it's just really--

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.630 align:middle line:84%
as you say, grounded
decisions we

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.540 align:middle line:84%
have to make about how we
choose to live our life.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just a
simple thing about--

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.100 align:middle line:84%
in fact, you triggered something
that happened yesterday

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.660 align:middle line:90%
at the airport, in my mind.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, it does come
down to these simple things

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.150 align:middle line:84%
that we were so conditioned
within a society toward,

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.970 align:middle line:84%
we don't even think about,
and I had a conversation

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.920 align:middle line:84%
with a man who worked
at the airport who

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.050 align:middle line:90%
was from South Sudan.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.475 align:middle line:84%
He had a huge smile, and I
said, so how are you doing?

00:05:24.475 --> 00:05:25.850 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh,
it's a good day.

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.070 align:middle line:84%
I said, where are
you from initially?

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.620 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, I'm
from South Sudan.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And I said, how do
you like it here?

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.570 align:middle line:84%
And he said-- he said
something interesting.

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.000 align:middle line:90%
He said, it's much safer.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And he said, but I have to work
so hard to have that safety.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.390 align:middle line:84%
He said, my cousins and my
friends at home in Sudan,

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:48.750 align:middle line:90%
we don't have to go to work.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.760 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't
even have jobs.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.250 align:middle line:84%
We can talk to
each other all day

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.610 align:middle line:84%
and enjoy one another's
company, but we might be killed.

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.290 align:middle line:90%
It's very unsafe.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And so just this one
lens of this one man

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.110 align:middle line:84%
and how his
priorities had to go,

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.030 align:middle line:84%
he's working his
tail off in America

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.379 align:middle line:84%
so he can just feel a sense
of safety inside his life.

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:11.420 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, I know it's
a bit of a non sequitur,

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.250 align:middle line:84%
but at the same
time, we're not even

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.400 align:middle line:84%
stopping to examine
the simple truth of how

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.140 align:middle line:90%
we lay our own lives out.

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.895 align:middle line:84%
Just that program alone is
dictating a lot of what we are.

00:06:20.895 --> 00:06:21.770 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Completely.

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:22.650 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.410 align:middle line:84%
I had a personal example
of that recently.

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.800 align:middle line:84%
The last two months, I've
been working very, very hard

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.160 align:middle line:90%
on lots of different things.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And it was one of those
cascade effect things.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.340 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't that I
planned it, but I

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.800 align:middle line:84%
had a team member who
suddenly got sick and was out.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And I caught myself about two
weeks ago just running stress.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.220 align:middle line:84%
About every two days, I would
have this highly intense

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:50.150 align:middle line:84%
emotional reaction, and it would
last for 20 minutes to an hour,

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:51.620 align:middle line:90%
depending on how I managed it.

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.410 align:middle line:90%
And I had that thought of just--

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:58.660 align:middle line:84%
my friend calls it Western
mania, and how we in the West

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:02.460 align:middle line:84%
are so used to or programmed
around working hard

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.800 align:middle line:84%
or this is what we
do in the world.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.310 align:middle line:84%
And I really had to
bring myself down

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:10.140 align:middle line:84%
off the ledge in those moments
because on the one hand,

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:11.900 align:middle line:90%
what I'm doing feels purposeful.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.990 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, you have
to watch your own self-care.

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:19.047 align:middle line:84%
But even more than that,
I noticed just this--

00:07:19.047 --> 00:07:20.630 align:middle line:84%
I feel that there
is an energy crackle

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:22.588 align:middle line:84%
in the world at the moment
that there are times

00:07:22.588 --> 00:07:25.240 align:middle line:84%
that you can feel very peaceful,
and you can focus peace

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.920 align:middle line:84%
for yourself, and you may
have shared peace with others,

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.710 align:middle line:84%
and then there are other
times when you'll sit quietly

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:33.150 align:middle line:84%
in the garden or by
yourself for a moment,

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:35.210 align:middle line:84%
and you can feel
the [STATIC NOISE]..

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:37.970 align:middle line:84%
Not your own intensity
or uncertainty,

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:40.850 align:middle line:84%
but just the ripple effect
that's going across the planet

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:42.950 align:middle line:84%
because everything is
so fast, and we've never

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:47.150 align:middle line:84%
had to keep up with this level
of change, transformation.

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.030 align:middle line:84%
You talking about the
inner shadow that we have,

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:52.790 align:middle line:84%
that I think we're in this
period of shadow cleanse.

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:56.300 align:middle line:84%
So it's very confrontational
to you and yourself,

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.650 align:middle line:90%
around oh, wow.

00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:59.280 align:middle line:84%
There's a better
way I can do that.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.950 align:middle line:84%
I didn't need to say it
that way to that person.

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And I often notice
because of other people.

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.220 align:middle line:84%
I notice the way
someone reacts to me,

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.120 align:middle line:84%
and that sometimes
gives me information.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:09.920 align:middle line:90%
Oh, wow.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm really in hyperproductive
mode right now,

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:15.200 align:middle line:84%
and I noticed that was a
little jarring to them,

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.610 align:middle line:90%
so I need to soften.

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:19.340 align:middle line:84%
But I think there's this
massive change going

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:21.530 align:middle line:84%
on that's really very
actualized versus

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:23.930 align:middle line:84%
conceptual, whereas for
me, personally, if I

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:27.360 align:middle line:84%
go back 10 years, we were
bringing a lot more concept

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.160 align:middle line:90%
down.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's personal
for me, but I think

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:31.910 align:middle line:90%
I see that change happening.

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:33.590 align:middle line:90%
The rubber meets the road.

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:35.419 align:middle line:84%
And with everything
going on the ground,

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:39.500 align:middle line:84%
that's become far more
divisive, far more apparent

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.909 align:middle line:84%
conflict energy
right in front of us

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:45.890 align:middle line:84%
and people going through trauma,
whether it's world events,

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:48.470 align:middle line:90%
world disasters, politics.

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:50.730 align:middle line:84%
Just what that's doing
to us as a collective,

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:52.790 align:middle line:84%
I think it's
confusing and scary,

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:56.420 align:middle line:84%
and self-care becomes huge
for people who are not only

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:58.970 align:middle line:84%
picking up on that for
themselves and conscious of it

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:01.820 align:middle line:84%
in themselves, but they're
either working that

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:05.240 align:middle line:84%
in or for others or
noticing that in others.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's why
what I brought up earlier

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:13.160 align:middle line:84%
does matter in that if we
can't start with, really,

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.730 align:middle line:84%
the basement of our lives, which
is the foundational elements

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:20.420 align:middle line:84%
of how we choose to live and
how much stress and energy can

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:23.330 align:middle line:84%
be demanded of us at this
time and make those really

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:26.254 align:middle line:84%
essential decisions
on the ground,

00:09:26.254 --> 00:09:28.670 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to be of much
good to anybody else trying

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:30.959 align:middle line:84%
to hyperprocess
cosmic information,

00:09:30.959 --> 00:09:32.750 align:middle line:84%
because you're not
going to have the energy

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:35.110 align:middle line:84%
or clarity to even
do anything with it.

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:37.200 align:middle line:90%
And this is a problem right now.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And just like this man
saying I feel safer,

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:43.080 align:middle line:90%
but I miss my cousins.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.590 align:middle line:84%
And why shouldn't we be
able to have a cup of tea

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:48.020 align:middle line:84%
with our cousin in
the middle of the day?

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:51.440 align:middle line:84%
Our birthright is to
listen, to connect,

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.020 align:middle line:84%
to enjoy this planet and
everything that it offers

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:55.310 align:middle line:90%
in the five sensory world.

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:57.260 align:middle line:84%
We're in a five sensory
body, and yet we

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.170 align:middle line:84%
keep escaping, trying to go
to the cosmic and divine,

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:02.660 align:middle line:84%
and ineffectively
at that, because we

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:04.302 align:middle line:90%
can't ground ourselves.

00:10:04.302 --> 00:10:06.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And for me,
the cosmic and the divine

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:07.980 align:middle line:90%
is such a rabbit hole.

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:11.590 align:middle line:84%
The more you learn, the
more it just keeps going.

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:13.650 align:middle line:90%
So I think it is ineffective.

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:18.360 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bit like going
to a tarot reader or a healer

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.880 align:middle line:90%
for relief rather than growth.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.640 align:middle line:84%
I think it's great to get some
relief when you have a healing

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.530 align:middle line:84%
session, and that's
important, but if you're

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:27.780 align:middle line:84%
alchemizing the information
and taking away and going,

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:28.579 align:middle line:90%
oh, right.

00:10:28.579 --> 00:10:30.730 align:middle line:84%
So they've given me
some sense of direction,

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:32.920 align:middle line:84%
and now how do I want to
actively work with that.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:36.090 align:middle line:84%
People giving their
power over to seeing

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:38.700 align:middle line:84%
the healer as being the person
that's going to bring them

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:39.570 align:middle line:90%
relief.

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:40.470 align:middle line:90%
That time is over.

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:44.830 align:middle line:84%
You can't live that way anymore
and self-sustain and grow.

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's where
there is a certain intensity,

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:50.730 align:middle line:84%
because it gets us
into our traumas,

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:53.010 align:middle line:84%
whether you experience
those as past life

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:55.350 align:middle line:84%
or whether you experience
those as this lifetime.

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And the nature of growth
is that the more you evolve

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:01.380 align:middle line:84%
and the more that
you uncover the gunk,

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:04.230 align:middle line:84%
the more this memory
comes up from age 13.

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, oh my
god, I didn't really

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:10.110 align:middle line:84%
feel that at that time the way
I can feel it and process it now

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:12.000 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't
have a framework.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.740 align:middle line:84%
So I think that rapid fire
of releasing the shadow

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:17.680 align:middle line:90%
has to happen.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And I've always maintained this
and felt this in my own life.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:24.240 align:middle line:84%
When we induce and
absorb a lot of light

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.400 align:middle line:84%
or a lot of
transformation, there's

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.740 align:middle line:84%
going to be a lot of
[VOCALIZATION] on the back end.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:33.210 align:middle line:84%
Because if you elevate
and bring in light,

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:35.740 align:middle line:84%
higher frequencies, then
what the body does is it

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:36.540 align:middle line:90%
goes, oh, OK.

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:36.780 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.610 align:middle line:90%
Well, I can now get rid of this.

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:40.860 align:middle line:84%
I can get rid of this
depressive pattern.

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And we often go
through that in layers.

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:45.060 align:middle line:84%
I think sometimes
people think, oh, great.

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:48.894 align:middle line:84%
Well, I went to this workshop,
and I got rid of this aspect.

00:11:48.894 --> 00:11:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen that with
certain people who will say,

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:53.700 align:middle line:90%
I've now healed myself of this.

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.290 align:middle line:90%
And I'm always kind of--

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:57.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, great if they did.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.120 align:middle line:84%
I personally never make
any of those proclamations

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.620 align:middle line:90%
because life is a spiral path.

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:03.990 align:middle line:84%
You never know when
your issue with money

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:06.720 align:middle line:84%
is going to come around again
in an even bigger way now

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.860 align:middle line:84%
that you've cracked
it on that level.

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:13.840 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's very humbling,
and I think it's hard for us

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:14.640 align:middle line:90%
to feel humble.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.848 align:middle line:84%
Because when we're humble,
we're vulnerable, and were

00:12:16.848 --> 00:12:20.280 align:middle line:84%
vulnerable to [GASPS] oh my
god, this planet is wondrous,

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.882 align:middle line:84%
and there's great stuff,
and Jesus, there's

00:12:22.882 --> 00:12:24.090 align:middle line:90%
all this other stuff as well.

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:29.220 align:middle line:84%
So for me that has been a
personal process and a process

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:30.450 align:middle line:90%
that I lead other people to.

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:35.200 align:middle line:84%
It's like how can we sit in the
all of it and be more centered,

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.000 align:middle line:90%
be more balanced.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.520 align:middle line:84%
Because it takes time
to steer yourself there

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:42.480 align:middle line:84%
and uncover the original
wounds and the past wounds.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.240 align:middle line:84%
But also to have
some levity about it

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:47.340 align:middle line:84%
rather than constantly
try and heal yourself.

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:49.410 align:middle line:84%
To try and laugh
and go, OK, well,

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:52.836 align:middle line:84%
today I'm watching a comedy,
or this moment with this man

00:12:52.836 --> 00:12:54.210 align:middle line:84%
that you are having
is beautiful.

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:55.740 align:middle line:90%
And that's what life is for.

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:57.630 align:middle line:90%
It's like, oh, wow, that was--

00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:59.160 align:middle line:90%
you had a magic moment.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.210 align:middle line:90%
I love those moments.

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:01.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And again, it comes
back to if you

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:07.140 align:middle line:84%
can get your base secured,
whatever that base looks

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.450 align:middle line:84%
like for you, and
again, this gets down

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:11.980 align:middle line:90%
to our societal conditioning.

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:13.990 align:middle line:84%
What our life is
supposed to look like.

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:16.230 align:middle line:84%
What it's supposed to look
like at a certain age,

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:18.854 align:middle line:84%
a certain stage, once you
have kids, and so forth.

00:13:18.854 --> 00:13:20.520 align:middle line:84%
We have to throw all
that out the window

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.830 align:middle line:84%
and look at ourselves
individually and say

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:26.910 align:middle line:84%
what does my being
need to sustain me

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:30.300 align:middle line:84%
so that I can be whole and
begin working on these things

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:31.860 align:middle line:90%
within and without?

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:34.170 align:middle line:84%
And so that that's a whole
different set of inquiry

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:36.150 align:middle line:84%
that really has to
start from the bottom.

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:38.250 align:middle line:90%
How do I choose to live?

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:39.960 align:middle line:90%
Where do I choose to live?

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:41.610 align:middle line:84%
Can I live with other
people so I don't

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:43.710 align:middle line:90%
have this huge burden on me?

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:46.560 align:middle line:84%
All these basic questions
need to be answered even

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.810 align:middle line:84%
before the big
spiritual journey,

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:51.766 align:middle line:84%
and we're kind of doing it
back asswards a lot of times.

00:13:51.766 --> 00:13:53.640 align:middle line:84%
We're in a hurry to get
out of the pain we're

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:56.774 align:middle line:84%
in from that life we've
created, so we go out there,

00:13:56.774 --> 00:13:59.190 align:middle line:84%
and then you can't really use
what's out there because you

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:02.156 align:middle line:84%
still have to go back down
to work for a 10-hour shift,

00:14:02.156 --> 00:14:03.780 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is
that's bothering you,

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:06.990 align:middle line:84%
a bad relationship or
whatnot that you haven't

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:08.287 align:middle line:90%
found your way out of yet.

00:14:08.287 --> 00:14:10.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I love that you're
saying that because I think

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:13.290 align:middle line:84%
that's what this
phrase you are needed

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:15.160 align:middle line:90%
and now is your time is about.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.220 align:middle line:84%
It's a call to arms,
but it's a call

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:19.980 align:middle line:84%
to arms about sort
your life out.

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:23.790 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of
sensitives, people

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:27.300 align:middle line:90%
who can feel tough stuff.

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:31.290 align:middle line:84%
But I'm always, I hope,
lovingly tough on them

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:33.570 align:middle line:84%
if they tell me they've
been depressed for a year.

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:35.787 align:middle line:84%
I know what it's like to
be god awful depressed

00:14:35.787 --> 00:14:37.620 align:middle line:84%
and not know if you
want to continue living,

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:39.632 align:middle line:84%
and you have to get
yourself out of it.

00:14:39.632 --> 00:14:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And there will be support, and
there will be magic moments,

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:43.714 align:middle line:84%
but you can't just
pray for the angels.

00:14:43.714 --> 00:14:46.777 align:middle line:84%
You can't just get
mad at the universe.

00:14:46.777 --> 00:14:48.360 align:middle line:84%
Good to get mad at
the universe if you

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.950 align:middle line:84%
need to get mad at the
universe for an hour

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:51.074 align:middle line:90%
and get it out your system.

00:14:51.074 --> 00:14:52.740 align:middle line:84%
It's good to pray
for the angels,

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:55.740 align:middle line:84%
but it's also about recognizing
that where you've been

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:58.890 align:middle line:84%
can be transformed, but
that it will take time.

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And that if you're willing to
put in the diligence and to go,

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:05.520 align:middle line:84%
OK, I really wish
I had money now

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:08.870 align:middle line:84%
because my money pain is
so strong that I just want

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:10.930 align:middle line:90%
to get rid of this money pain.

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:14.480 align:middle line:84%
It might take you two
years to really concentrate

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.390 align:middle line:84%
on looking at your patterns,
being honest about, oh yeah.

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:19.849 align:middle line:84%
Well, I never look at my bank
account because it scares me.

00:15:19.849 --> 00:15:21.931 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have to
look at your bank account.

00:15:21.931 --> 00:15:24.140 align:middle line:84%
Because the only way that
you're going to change

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:28.400 align:middle line:84%
that fear-victim state is
to look at the parts of it.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's true for all of us,
no matter how advanced you are.

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:33.170 align:middle line:90%
I've never met anybody--

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:35.830 align:middle line:84%
I've met some really enlightened
people, but if you're human

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:37.790 align:middle line:84%
and you're on the planet,
there should always

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:39.110 align:middle line:90%
be a next phase of growth.

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think sometimes
there's this illusionary idea

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:45.590 align:middle line:84%
that you can go back and be
spirit embodied on the earth.

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:47.160 align:middle line:90%
No, that's called death.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.740 align:middle line:90%
So for me, it's like, OK.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:53.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, the gift of us working
our own life and recognizing we

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:57.890 align:middle line:84%
can make changes, we then become
an energetic ambassador of it

00:15:57.890 --> 00:15:58.820 align:middle line:90%
for others.

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:01.970 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to tell Uncle
Jim, who hates spirituality,

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:03.620 align:middle line:90%
all about the spiritual world.

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:05.840 align:middle line:84%
But just you being
in his presence,

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.122 align:middle line:84%
when you've cleared up
whatever ambivalence

00:16:08.122 --> 00:16:09.830 align:middle line:84%
you've got in that
relationship with him,

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:12.020 align:middle line:84%
and you're working
on your own life,

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:14.390 align:middle line:84%
you'll find year after
year, at those Thanksgiving

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:16.534 align:middle line:84%
parties or Christmas
parties, he will slowly

00:16:16.534 --> 00:16:18.200 align:middle line:84%
get a little bit more
interested in you.

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.240 align:middle line:84%
Not because of your
concepts or your beliefs.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.680 align:middle line:90%
He may never want those.

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:24.680 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that you are
loving and supportive toward him

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.600 align:middle line:84%
because your own
compassion grows

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.111 align:middle line:84%
through really looking at
the rubber meets the road

00:16:29.111 --> 00:16:30.860 align:middle line:84%
stuff in yourself and
going, oh god, yeah.

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:32.568 align:middle line:84%
I'm terrified to look
at my bank account.

00:16:32.568 --> 00:16:36.380 align:middle line:84%
OK, this year, I'm going to look
at my bank account once a week.

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And it will hurt,
and I won't like it,

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.430 align:middle line:84%
and it won't feel as
nice as when I meditate,

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:42.530 align:middle line:84%
but if I walk into
this, I'm going

00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:45.330 align:middle line:84%
to release the life force back
into this dented or wounded

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:46.130 align:middle line:90%
area.

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:47.330 align:middle line:90%
Because we all have them.

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:48.663 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I couldn't agree more.

00:16:48.663 --> 00:16:53.660 align:middle line:84%
And I have a friend who is
just, she's a wonderful mystic.

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:55.190 align:middle line:90%
Old druid, you know.

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:56.180 align:middle line:90%
Lots of knowledge.

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:57.650 align:middle line:90%
Practical, rounded knowledge.

00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:02.190 align:middle line:84%
Great understanding of roots
and herbs and far beyond that.

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:06.349 align:middle line:84%
But she's trapped in this thing
where she cannot look at her

00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:09.660 align:middle line:84%
finances and waits for her home
to be taken away every day,

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:11.810 align:middle line:84%
year after year, waiting
for someone to come knock

00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:15.560 align:middle line:84%
on the door and take her home
away from her because she

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.224 align:middle line:90%
can't engage with the world.

00:17:17.224 --> 00:17:18.599 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And
that's interesting.

00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:21.589 align:middle line:84%
Because I always say that the
starving healer is the same

00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:23.030 align:middle line:90%
as the starving artist.

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:25.492 align:middle line:84%
Most people know about the
starving artist syndrome.

00:17:25.492 --> 00:17:27.200 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well, I'm
just here to create,

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.300 align:middle line:90%
so I'm rejecting society.

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:31.760 align:middle line:84%
That's brilliant if you're
the happiest person I've seen.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And I've met some like
that who really do happily

00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:37.120 align:middle line:84%
reject society, and
they have an alive life.

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:40.960 align:middle line:84%
But I see a lot of people bitter
and resentful about the part.

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And with healers, there
is this whole idea,

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:47.540 align:middle line:84%
I'll occasionally
see criticism, why

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:48.920 align:middle line:90%
are you charging for the truth?

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:51.586 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of-- you want to roll
your eyes, because you're like,

00:17:51.586 --> 00:17:54.620 align:middle line:84%
well actually, I spend
a lot of time and money

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:56.870 align:middle line:84%
making free work
for you, so why are

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:59.690 align:middle line:84%
you annoyed at the work that's
going to pay the bills for me

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:01.220 align:middle line:90%
and my team over here.

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:02.880 align:middle line:84%
But you can't have
that argument.

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.510 align:middle line:84%
But I think that that
energy in the world

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:07.700 align:middle line:84%
is what makes a lot of
healers feel that they have

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:09.750 align:middle line:90%
to heal the pain of the world.

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:12.560 align:middle line:84%
And at the root of it
it's the part of them

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:16.560 align:middle line:84%
that has so absorbed the pain
and the suffering of the world

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:18.440 align:middle line:84%
or so absorbed the
pain and the suffering

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.390 align:middle line:84%
of the alcoholic
parent that they first

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:24.080 align:middle line:84%
cut their teeth on as a kid that
they can't see beyond it, where

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:27.290 align:middle line:84%
they can not only turn
off the healer mode,

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:29.750 align:middle line:84%
but also that they
can be human too.

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:33.470 align:middle line:84%
I know for me, when I was
full blown in my healer,

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:34.850 align:middle line:90%
things were difficult for me.

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And I really realized I had
to know how to switch it off.

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:39.770 align:middle line:90%
I had to know how to ground.

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:42.650 align:middle line:84%
I had to allow money in,
even though every time I

00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:44.600 align:middle line:84%
put my session rate
up, I was mortified,

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.910 align:middle line:84%
and I was worried about the
people I was pricing out.

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:50.210 align:middle line:84%
So point being, these
transformations, they do

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:51.890 align:middle line:90%
come with emotional residue.

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:53.480 align:middle line:90%
They do come with fear.

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:54.380 align:middle line:90%
So they should.

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:57.055 align:middle line:84%
Because usually, if we're
going through a breakthrough,

00:18:57.055 --> 00:18:59.180 align:middle line:84%
it will only be a breakthrough
if there's something

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:00.260 align:middle line:90%
we have to move through.

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.840 align:middle line:84%
So it's why I'm
always saying are you

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.580 align:middle line:84%
scared to paint a
painting or sing a song?

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:06.380 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:07.180 align:middle line:90%
Do it.

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:10.010 align:middle line:84%
Not because the painting
or the song has to be good,

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:13.340 align:middle line:84%
but the growth you will get
through walking into your fear,

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:15.761 align:middle line:84%
it will affect all other
areas of your life.

00:19:15.761 --> 00:19:17.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's a good point.

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:19.469 align:middle line:84%
And I think also we compare it
because we compare ourselves

00:19:19.469 --> 00:19:20.268 align:middle line:90%
to others.

00:19:20.268 --> 00:19:22.160 align:middle line:84%
We think, how come I
can't get it together?

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.610 align:middle line:90%
They got it together.

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And then you look at the
great cultural icons,

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:28.040 align:middle line:84%
for example, of society, which
are usually on the covers

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:30.205 align:middle line:84%
in like "Forbes"
magazine, which usually

00:19:30.205 --> 00:19:33.140 align:middle line:84%
is centered around the material
world and money, right?

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'm reminded of
a friend of mine.

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:38.685 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to get a new
project going a number of years

00:19:38.685 --> 00:19:41.060 align:middle line:84%
ago, maybe 20 years ago,
because I'm always trying to get

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:42.710 align:middle line:90%
new projects going, right?

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:44.310 align:middle line:90%
And I'm always nervous about it.

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:45.890 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
I'll succeed or fail

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:48.132 align:middle line:84%
or if anyone's going to
buy in and support it.

00:19:48.132 --> 00:19:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And so I must have been
expressing this to him.

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I
just don't know if I

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.330 align:middle line:90%
can make this leap this time.

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:56.370 align:middle line:84%
And he said, let me
tell you something.

00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:59.210 align:middle line:84%
He said, there was
a Fortune 500 survey

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:03.565 align:middle line:84%
that was done of the CEOs of
the Fortune 500 companies.

00:20:03.565 --> 00:20:04.940 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
question in there

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:07.130 align:middle line:84%
that said what is
your greatest fear.

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And the most reflected
fear was that they

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:12.660 align:middle line:84%
were going to be found
out for the frauds

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:14.524 align:middle line:90%
that they actually were.

00:20:14.524 --> 00:20:16.065 align:middle line:84%
They were living in
that same anxiety

00:20:16.065 --> 00:20:19.200 align:middle line:84%
of being toppled by
the board of directors,

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.810 align:middle line:84%
feeling like they're not
as competent as the people

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:23.500 align:middle line:90%
around them.

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:27.210 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
it is to be human.

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:30.840 align:middle line:84%
You can't help but look around
you and hope that you somehow

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:32.590 align:middle line:90%
add up in some world.

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:33.390 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:35.473 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: A great example
of that for me is Adele,

00:20:35.473 --> 00:20:37.590 align:middle line:10%
the British singer/songwriter
who I just think

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:38.830 align:middle line:10%
is fabulous on every level.

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:39.630 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I do too.

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:40.963 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: So good for the world.

00:20:40.963 --> 00:20:43.640 align:middle line:10%
And I loved it
because in that year

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:47.310 align:middle line:10%
where she had just dominated
the whole world with an album--

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:49.080 align:middle line:10%
I'm a musician, so
I track this stuff.

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.980 align:middle line:84%
Albums don't sell
the way they used to.

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:52.920 align:middle line:84%
And she was selling
albums all over the world

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.230 align:middle line:84%
because people were
connecting with her.

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I keep
thinking someone's

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.060 align:middle line:90%
going to take it away.

00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:59.643 align:middle line:84%
And I remember reading
that and going,

00:20:59.643 --> 00:21:02.010 align:middle line:84%
it's so good that she
says that to people.

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And as a reminder
for any of us, that

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.980 align:middle line:84%
was the gift for me of
doing sessions with people.

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:12.060 align:middle line:84%
I started 14 years ago,
and I was blown away

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:15.060 align:middle line:84%
by what the very
rich or very famous

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:19.080 align:middle line:84%
person or the mother who had
the three kids she had always

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.584 align:middle line:84%
wanted, and the
husband, and the home,

00:21:21.584 --> 00:21:23.250 align:middle line:84%
all the people that
I would have thought

00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:26.000 align:middle line:84%
got their dream, the stuff
they were dealing with.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.924 align:middle line:84%
And it was very
humbling to see, oh,

00:21:28.924 --> 00:21:30.090 align:middle line:90%
everybody's got their stuff.

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:31.830 align:middle line:90%
We've all got our stuff.

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And comparison is just a
disease that's in our minds.

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:37.170 align:middle line:84%
I catch it in myself
sometimes, and I

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:40.660 align:middle line:84%
have to remember it's
misplaced admiration.

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:43.240 align:middle line:84%
So if ever I'm focusing on
someone, going, oh, wow.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.302 align:middle line:10%
It's like, OK, great.

00:21:44.302 --> 00:21:46.260 align:middle line:84%
There's something in that
that you would either

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:50.100 align:middle line:84%
like to become or experience,
so invite yourself to it.

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:52.230 align:middle line:84%
And then oftentimes,
it's not real anyway.

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:55.260 align:middle line:84%
It's just we get caught
in that comparison mind,

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:56.670 align:middle line:90%
and that takes us down.

00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:58.620 align:middle line:84%
That always takes
our energy down.

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:00.510 align:middle line:84%
So if I feel that
happening in my body

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:02.316 align:middle line:84%
because of something
I'm thinking,

00:22:02.316 --> 00:22:03.690 align:middle line:84%
I have to try and
do the reverse.

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:04.800 align:middle line:90%
It's like, OK.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.560 align:middle line:84%
Celebrate them and
invite yourself

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.120 align:middle line:90%
to be part of that energy too.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:12.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing how if you do
that diligently with your mind,

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:15.540 align:middle line:84%
it changes your
energy very quickly.

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:18.120 align:middle line:84%
And that really circles right
back to where we started.

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:21.720 align:middle line:84%
There are all these societal
diseases and programming

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:23.760 align:middle line:84%
that you can't love and
light your way out of.

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:24.593 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You can't.

00:22:24.593 --> 00:22:28.140 align:middle line:84%
You have to actually examine
it in the raw light of morning.

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:30.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's like these
cultural icons

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:34.680 align:middle line:84%
and like these business
icons and people.

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:37.590 align:middle line:10%
I saw a movie recently,
the one on the story

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:39.570 align:middle line:10%
of the kidnapping
of J. Paul Getty

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:42.630 align:middle line:10%
Jr. Which was an amazing film.

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:49.080 align:middle line:10%
And the part of J. Paul Getty
was just played exquisitely

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:50.400 align:middle line:10%
by Christopher Plummer.

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
scene in it where

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:55.020 align:middle line:84%
the kind of consigliere of
the family, the one who's

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:57.840 align:middle line:84%
running the money, trying
to deal with the kidnappers,

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.870 align:middle line:84%
basically said,
you're, at this moment,

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:03.180 align:middle line:84%
considered the richest
man in the world.

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:05.940 align:middle line:84%
Your grandson, the one that
you love, has been kidnapped.

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:08.280 align:middle line:90%
Essentially, I'm paraphrasing.

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:10.260 align:middle line:84%
And all it takes is
a few million dollars

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:12.090 align:middle line:90%
for you to cure this thing.

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:14.070 align:middle line:10%
What is it you're looking for?

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:15.785 align:middle line:10%
And he just said, more.

00:23:15.785 --> 00:23:17.910 align:middle line:10%
>> How much would you pay
to release your grandson,

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:19.920 align:middle line:10%
if not $17 million?

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:21.295 align:middle line:90%
>> Nothing.

00:23:21.295 --> 00:23:23.970 align:middle line:90%


00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:28.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There was never enough
to fill the hole in his being.

00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And these are the people
we're often looking up to.

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:32.740 align:middle line:84%
That said, on the
other side of the coin,

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:36.390 align:middle line:84%
we do see the creative efforts
of people that do manifest

00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:39.000 align:middle line:90%
with this lens of fear.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.809 align:middle line:90%
To me the key is--

00:23:40.809 --> 00:23:42.850 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people will say,
oh, it's easy for them.

00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:44.430 align:middle line:90%
They don't have any fear.

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:45.600 align:middle line:90%
They have courage.

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:46.870 align:middle line:90%
That is not true.

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:48.780 align:middle line:84%
Most of the people that
have done something

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:52.680 align:middle line:84%
beautiful with their lives have
fear, but you do it anyway.

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Once you feel this as your
calling, whatever it is,

00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:58.610 align:middle line:84%
you don't let fear stop
you from what you're doing.

00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:00.816 align:middle line:84%
And that's a really
key element here.

00:24:00.816 --> 00:24:02.940 align:middle line:84%
You think if you have fear,
it must not be for you.

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:03.480 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:04.620 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No, not at all.

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And for me, there's a difference
between fear and terror.

00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:11.850 align:middle line:84%
So if I feel terror about
something, I'm not ready.

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:14.940 align:middle line:84%
If my body's all
alarms about something,

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:18.220 align:middle line:84%
maybe it's an instinct,
maybe it's I'm not ready.

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And I really try
and trust my body.

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:22.714 align:middle line:84%
I don't want my intuitive
mind to become dominant

00:24:22.714 --> 00:24:23.880 align:middle line:90%
with my body's senses there.

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:25.480 align:middle line:90%
But what you said is so true.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:28.590 align:middle line:84%
Because people
often assume that--

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:30.600 align:middle line:84%
you know, they'll say,
oh, you're fearless.

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, no,
not necessarily.

00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:36.780 align:middle line:84%
It's just you have to learn
when to lead with courage

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:38.730 align:middle line:90%
while dragging fear behind you.

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:41.460 align:middle line:84%
Like fear might be walking
into the room with you,

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:45.330 align:middle line:84%
but you've just got enough
momentum that you're like, ooh.

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what I meant
earlier by work with your fear.

00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:51.600 align:middle line:84%
Because the more you start
to do things that scare you--

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:55.590 align:middle line:84%
for example, I always
recommend new business owners

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:57.009 align:middle line:90%
to go and learn something new.

00:24:57.009 --> 00:24:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And they're always
like, I haven't got time

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.745 align:middle line:84%
to learn salsa, and
I'm terrified of salsa.

00:25:00.745 --> 00:25:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, yeah,
go and learn salsa.

00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:04.800 align:middle line:84%
Because you're going to take
your mind off this thing

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:06.610 align:middle line:84%
that you're putting
all this weight onto.

00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:08.140 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
learn another skill.

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:10.765 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be in a position
where someone is teaching you,

00:25:10.765 --> 00:25:12.980 align:middle line:84%
and that learning is
transference into the business.

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:13.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Brilliant.

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:15.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It also just cuts
the mind from the focus.

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:16.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:18.190 align:middle line:90%
I think that's brilliant.

00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:19.667 align:middle line:90%
Well, we could chat all day.

00:25:19.667 --> 00:25:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And so we now want to chat
with the Zs for a little bit,

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.371 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to continue
this conversation with them.

00:25:24.371 --> 00:25:26.370 align:middle line:84%
So are you good with going
away for a little bit

00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:27.250 align:middle line:90%
and let them come on in?

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:28.050 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I definitely am.

00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:28.904 align:middle line:90%
I'll just--

00:25:28.904 --> 00:25:30.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Have a sip of tea.

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:36.780 align:middle line:90%


00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:40.190 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It will just
take a moment, OK?

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:46.980 align:middle line:90%
[BREATHING DEEPLY] Hm.

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:47.950 align:middle line:90%
Hm.

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:48.490 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:49.290 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:52.690 align:middle line:84%
A pleasure to be in this
collective conversation,

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:55.375 align:middle line:84%
for that is what a
channeled experience is.

00:25:55.375 --> 00:25:56.860 align:middle line:90%
It is a collective conversation.

00:25:56.860 --> 00:26:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And in many ways,
there is a perception

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:02.830 align:middle line:84%
that the entity or the energy
or the higher self that

00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:04.900 align:middle line:84%
is being channeled is
in charge of the words,

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:06.940 align:middle line:90%
but that is not true.

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:10.270 align:middle line:84%
The energy or entity
or higher self

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:13.540 align:middle line:84%
is simply speaking the words
that the collective need

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:14.760 align:middle line:90%
to rise into.

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:18.760 align:middle line:84%
So in many ways, the
channeled being or channeller

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:21.580 align:middle line:84%
is in pure service to
the conversational mind

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.110 align:middle line:90%
of the group that are gathered.

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very
potent time on Earth.

00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:29.770 align:middle line:84%
We would call it a time of
golden abundance for those

00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:35.080 align:middle line:84%
of you who are wayshowers, light
seekers, spiritually-minded,

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:38.360 align:middle line:84%
or even those who do not
identify with spirituality

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:42.310 align:middle line:84%
but have strong activist
or humanitarian leanings.

00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:45.160 align:middle line:84%
Those of you who have felt
dissatisfied with the world

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:47.830 align:middle line:84%
you were born into and
the way it was going,

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:49.600 align:middle line:90%
this is your time.

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And yes, it may not be
exactly how some of you

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:53.380 align:middle line:90%
might have imagined it.

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:56.140 align:middle line:84%
Some of you thought that this
place would have transformed

00:26:56.140 --> 00:27:00.110 align:middle line:84%
into more of a paradise when
you felt most in your fire

00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:00.910 align:middle line:90%
and in your power.

00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:03.190 align:middle line:90%
No, that is not the case.

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:05.920 align:middle line:84%
Part of your work, as
the transitionary team,

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:08.980 align:middle line:84%
is to rub up against
and rearrange

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:11.680 align:middle line:84%
some of these what you
would call lower vibrations

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:13.490 align:middle line:90%
or darker areas of humanity.

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:16.340 align:middle line:90%
And it takes time.

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:18.940 align:middle line:10%
There is a very strong
desire for so many of you

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:22.060 align:middle line:10%
to be able to click your
fingers and wish that it had all

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:24.130 align:middle line:10%
changed overnight,
or could change,

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:27.970 align:middle line:10%
or I am not re-entering
society until it changes.

00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:29.890 align:middle line:84%
That will be very
painful for you

00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:31.990 align:middle line:84%
if that is your
approach at this point.

00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:35.680 align:middle line:84%
If you are nursing a wound
of the world is a bad place.

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:36.700 align:middle line:90%
The world is not for me.

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:37.824 align:middle line:90%
The world does not want me.

00:27:37.824 --> 00:27:39.790 align:middle line:84%
The world does not
want what I'm offering.

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:42.869 align:middle line:84%
We tell you, you are in a
dark illusion in yourself.

00:27:42.869 --> 00:27:45.160 align:middle line:84%
And we say that with some
compassion, for we know to be

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:47.200 align:middle line:90%
in a dark illusion is painful.

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:50.410 align:middle line:84%
It feels like a loss,
disconnection, loneliness,

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:52.150 align:middle line:90%
acute loneliness.

00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:54.400 align:middle line:90%
Being cut off from your tribe.

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:56.830 align:middle line:84%
If that is your story, and
you are listening to this,

00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:59.260 align:middle line:84%
we tell you, you are needed,
and now is your time.

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:02.710 align:middle line:84%
But it's going to require
you getting in the trenches

00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:05.530 align:middle line:84%
and learning how to
walk in a brand new way.

00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:09.400 align:middle line:84%
For your society as you knew it
is radically different to how

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:11.980 align:middle line:90%
it was even seven years ago.

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:15.070 align:middle line:84%
The energetic and collective
makeup of your society

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:18.460 align:middle line:84%
is in a dismantling and
disillusion phase, which yes,

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:21.400 align:middle line:84%
produces confusion,
anxiety, and fear, which

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:23.230 align:middle line:84%
some of the agendas
on your planet like,

00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:25.360 align:middle line:84%
because of course then
they can, they think,

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:27.520 align:middle line:84%
manipulate things the way
they want things to go.

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:30.140 align:middle line:84%
But they are not surviving
in these energies either.

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:33.310 align:middle line:84%
For the, we will say,
uprising of the light

00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:35.080 align:middle line:84%
and the consciousness
in people is

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.850 align:middle line:84%
going to far outweigh
any who would

00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:38.440 align:middle line:90%
like to control or manipulate.

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:40.880 align:middle line:90%
It will just take time.

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:42.970 align:middle line:84%
So this coming seven
or eight year period,

00:28:42.970 --> 00:28:45.730 align:middle line:84%
and this is being
recorded in 2018,

00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:50.620 align:middle line:84%
so we are looking ahead
to your 2024, 2025,

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:53.470 align:middle line:84%
you are going to feel
a golden abundance

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:56.290 align:middle line:84%
about living that
you have never felt

00:28:56.290 --> 00:28:58.010 align:middle line:90%
before in quite the same way.

00:28:58.010 --> 00:29:01.270 align:middle line:84%
But that is not prescriptive
that everything is,

00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:03.910 align:middle line:84%
to use Lee's phrase,
just love and light.

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:07.930 align:middle line:84%
It means you will feel very
alive, very purposeful,

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:10.600 align:middle line:84%
very in your body and your
spirit at the same time.

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And many of you are transmitters
of that frequency for others.

00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:15.760 align:middle line:84%
Remember too that
it goes both ways.

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:17.710 align:middle line:84%
Many of you, as light
workers, focus on what

00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:19.450 align:middle line:90%
you are doing for the planet.

00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:21.610 align:middle line:84%
Are you grateful
enough for those

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:23.440 align:middle line:90%
who are harvesting your food?

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.180 align:middle line:84%
The doctors who
have kept you alive

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:26.860 align:middle line:90%
or brought you through diseases?

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:29.740 align:middle line:84%
Are you grateful enough
for those on the ground?

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:31.750 align:middle line:84%
For you are all part
of a jigsaw puzzle.

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And a tendency with
the spiritually-minded

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:38.110 align:middle line:84%
can be to be equally as
arrogant as those who are not

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:40.360 align:middle line:90%
"spiritual," quote, unquote.

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And we would argue all
of these terms anyway.

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:45.340 align:middle line:84%
For to be a human in the body
with a soul that is active

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:46.570 align:middle line:90%
is to be spiritual.

00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:51.400 align:middle line:84%
So many of you in the quote,
unquote, "spiritual world"

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:54.670 align:middle line:84%
are having a bit of
a crash awakening

00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:57.940 align:middle line:84%
at the moment and a
certain loss of a dream.

00:29:57.940 --> 00:29:59.496 align:middle line:90%
A certain loss of an illusion.

00:29:59.496 --> 00:30:01.120 align:middle line:84%
An illusion that you
thought everything

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:04.540 align:middle line:84%
was going to transform without
too much effort on your part

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:07.220 align:middle line:84%
or without you having
to get in the trenches.

00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:09.880 align:middle line:84%
We will tell you that
being in the body is good.

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:13.450 align:middle line:84%
Those who are about to die,
they see this very clearly.

00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:15.670 align:middle line:84%
They suddenly have
the realization

00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:18.310 align:middle line:84%
that all of this
societal isms and schisms

00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:21.010 align:middle line:84%
and diseases that you all
have to run through your minds

00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:23.290 align:middle line:84%
and your ways of
being hold you back

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:26.060 align:middle line:84%
from the sensory
wonder of this planet.

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:28.540 align:middle line:84%
So if you are somebody
who is leaning heavily

00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:31.780 align:middle line:84%
into the depressive of
what your planet is losing

00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:34.450 align:middle line:84%
or how things are
going, you will not

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:36.800 align:middle line:90%
be part of the solution.

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:40.000 align:middle line:84%
We should be clear here
that much wonderful activism

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.670 align:middle line:84%
and humanitarian
acts are done because

00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:46.347 align:middle line:84%
of that activist or humanitarian
getting angry or upset

00:30:46.347 --> 00:30:47.430 align:middle line:90%
about what they're seeing.

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:51.300 align:middle line:84%
But the most effective
change makers on your planet

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:54.150 align:middle line:84%
do not forget the
importance of joy.

00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:55.740 align:middle line:84%
They do not forget
the importance

00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:58.410 align:middle line:84%
of whether it is
meditation or laughter

00:30:58.410 --> 00:31:00.240 align:middle line:90%
or connection with others.

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:03.540 align:middle line:84%
They believe in being
in this messy planet,

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:05.070 align:middle line:90%
this messy collective.

00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:08.100 align:middle line:84%
You may look at them and think
they are gracefully gliding

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:10.050 align:middle line:90%
along, bonding with everybody.

00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:11.400 align:middle line:90%
No, it does not work that way.

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:12.750 align:middle line:90%
You are all individuals.

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:14.760 align:middle line:84%
That is the irony
of this planet.

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:17.760 align:middle line:84%
You are a collective that can
constantly combine and connect

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:20.010 align:middle line:84%
with each other, but you
are also highly individual,

00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:24.120 align:middle line:84%
so it is healthy to feel
alone from time to time.

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:26.820 align:middle line:84%
It is healthy to feel
bonded from time to time.

00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:29.430 align:middle line:84%
You are supposed to dance
in and out of all of it.

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And the most effective
change makers

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:35.250 align:middle line:84%
are those who are no
longer afraid of the side

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:36.990 align:middle line:90%
that they have perhaps avoided.

00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And we say this
with no judgment.

00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:40.500 align:middle line:84%
Suffering and pain
on your planet

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:45.370 align:middle line:84%
is intense to feel in
the body and is ancient.

00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:47.250 align:middle line:84%
So for many of you,
it takes time for you

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:49.500 align:middle line:84%
to let your bodies
come online again

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:52.350 align:middle line:84%
once you have left those
bodies in order to avoid

00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:55.020 align:middle line:84%
the trauma of the world that
you are feeling and to try

00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:58.290 align:middle line:84%
and breathe again spiritually
so that your soul does not

00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:00.040 align:middle line:84%
feel like it wants
to wither and die.

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:02.040 align:middle line:84%
That story that many of
you have that you do not

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.930 align:middle line:90%
want to be here anymore.

00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:05.880 align:middle line:84%
Oh, this is your
time to be here.

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:09.426 align:middle line:84%
This is your time to be here in
a bigger way than ever before.

00:32:09.426 --> 00:32:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And for some of
you, that big way

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:13.200 align:middle line:84%
will involve going
out into the world

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:16.080 align:middle line:84%
and being perhaps more
extrovert or connected or seen

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:17.400 align:middle line:90%
than you ever have.

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And for others among you that
will involve working on feeling

00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:24.660 align:middle line:84%
and sensing in a way that
you never have before,

00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:27.810 align:middle line:84%
bringing your senses, your
feeling, and your appreciation

00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:33.130 align:middle line:84%
of life internally to the
fore in a very profound way.

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:35.640 align:middle line:84%
So if we could give you one
piece of advice for this time,

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:38.160 align:middle line:84%
and it will be very
hard to ingrain,

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:41.070 align:middle line:84%
try to stay out of the
rights and the wrongs.

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:44.790 align:middle line:84%
It will be very tempting for you
to think this person is right,

00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:46.140 align:middle line:90%
that person is wrong.

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:49.090 align:middle line:84%
Even those of you who consider
yourselves quite advanced.

00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:49.890 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:53.210 align:middle line:84%
Because the amount of emotion
that is being put behind right

00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:56.310 align:middle line:84%
and wrongs at this
time is volcanic.

00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:58.980 align:middle line:84%
And remember, you do
not respond to words.

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:00.810 align:middle line:90%
You respond to emotion.

00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:02.724 align:middle line:84%
There are a million
ways to say I love you.

00:33:02.724 --> 00:33:04.140 align:middle line:84%
You can say it in
a very dead way.

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:04.940 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:05.880 align:middle line:90%
Means nothing.

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:08.730 align:middle line:84%
You can say I love you in a
big, passionate, heartfelt way.

00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:10.230 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:12.450 align:middle line:84%
It is the energy that you
listen to, not the words.

00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And the energy around
right and wrong,

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:17.670 align:middle line:84%
at this point, with all of the
division that is taking place

00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:20.880 align:middle line:84%
on your planet, is
highly seductive,

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:23.370 align:middle line:84%
and it is pulling so many
of you off your own centers.

00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:25.920 align:middle line:84%
We say that not as
a judgment, just

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:29.070 align:middle line:84%
as a reminder that the
reason you sometimes feel off

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:31.710 align:middle line:84%
is because you are not
recognizing the ocean

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:32.880 align:middle line:90%
has changed.

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:35.350 align:middle line:84%
The undertow has
become a lot stronger.

00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:37.830 align:middle line:84%
So you will need to
swim better and know

00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:41.010 align:middle line:84%
when you need to go to
the shore to lie and rest.

00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And rest is very
important, but it need not

00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:46.590 align:middle line:84%
be three weeks at a spa because
you have burned yourself out

00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:47.530 align:middle line:90%
in life.

00:33:47.530 --> 00:33:51.390 align:middle line:84%
It should be 30 minutes
a day of peace, silence,

00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:52.920 align:middle line:90%
tending to yourself.

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:54.720 align:middle line:84%
When you do this
with regularity,

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.430 align:middle line:90%
you do not burn out.

00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:59.100 align:middle line:84%
But remember, you
are in a society

00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:00.315 align:middle line:90%
where this is not the norm.

00:34:00.315 --> 00:34:02.190 align:middle line:84%
There are certain cultures
in the world where

00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:04.470 align:middle line:84%
this is celebrated
and practiced,

00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:07.680 align:middle line:84%
and you are so influenced by
the society that you are in,

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:09.370 align:middle line:90%
you would not believe it.

00:34:09.370 --> 00:34:11.690 align:middle line:84%
That is how you regularly
lose your center.

00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:14.550 align:middle line:84%
And there is nothing wrong
with that in and of itself,

00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:16.679 align:middle line:84%
but we are telling
you this is the time

00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:20.590 align:middle line:84%
that you need to deepen
your self-care, your needs.

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:22.350 align:middle line:84%
They are very
important so that you

00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:26.820 align:middle line:84%
can be strong and magnetic
and useful in this time

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:28.995 align:middle line:90%
where you are needed.

00:34:28.995 --> 00:34:30.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's beautiful.

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:31.739 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:34:31.739 --> 00:34:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And I would like to continue
on the theme you spoke

00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:36.193 align:middle line:84%
about a moment ago, where
so many people said they

00:34:36.193 --> 00:34:37.520 align:middle line:90%
don't want to be here anymore.

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:41.310 align:middle line:84%
Probably I think one of the
most common phrases I hear

00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:43.500 align:middle line:84%
is oh, I'm not
incarnating again.

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:44.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm done with Earth.

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And I say, where do
you think you're going?

00:34:46.830 --> 00:34:48.540 align:middle line:90%
What do you think happens then?

00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And so I would love it
if you would explain

00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:54.420 align:middle line:84%
to us the truth about what
happens once you've said,

00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:58.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm done, I'm not coming back,
because you're frustrated.

00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:00.750 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
what the options are

00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:04.790 align:middle line:84%
if you didn't come
back and what the draw

00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:06.879 align:middle line:90%
is to continue coming back.

00:35:06.879 --> 00:35:09.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, first of all,
we will say, think of that time

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:12.750 align:middle line:84%
where you have booked a vacation
or a trip on your planet,

00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:15.480 align:middle line:84%
and you are excited about
that vacation or the trip.

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And then the day
comes, and most of you

00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:19.830 align:middle line:84%
get a little
anxious about going.

00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:21.360 align:middle line:84%
This thing that
you say you wanted,

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:23.460 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden,
the uprooting of it

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:25.544 align:middle line:84%
is a little bit of a shock
to your nervous system.

00:35:25.544 --> 00:35:28.043 align:middle line:84%
Either because you've been very
busy, or because many of you

00:35:28.043 --> 00:35:29.830 align:middle line:84%
get very rooted where
you are, and there

00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:32.880 align:middle line:84%
is a certain safety in the
patterning of the routine

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:33.870 align:middle line:90%
that you had.

00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:37.320 align:middle line:84%
So to interrupt that routine,
it is quite normal, especially

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:39.150 align:middle line:84%
if this trip or this
vacation is going

00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:43.020 align:middle line:84%
to infuse you with certain
positive or educational growth

00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:43.920 align:middle line:90%
energies.

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:46.000 align:middle line:84%
There will always
be some hesitation.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.860 align:middle line:84%
There will always
be some part of you

00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:49.480 align:middle line:84%
that goes through
a strange period

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:53.050 align:middle line:84%
as you have to leave one
reality and come to another.

00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:56.290 align:middle line:84%
For those people who run
this story, a lot of I'm

00:35:56.290 --> 00:36:00.160 align:middle line:84%
not supposed to be here, we
will tell you, you truly are.

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:01.960 align:middle line:84%
If you are on the
planet, you are

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:03.332 align:middle line:90%
supposed to be on the planet.

00:36:03.332 --> 00:36:04.540 align:middle line:90%
We have said this many times.

00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:06.160 align:middle line:90%
It is so easy to die.

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.740 align:middle line:84%
There are so many times in
your life that you can die.

00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:12.490 align:middle line:84%
Most people have 80 plus
options in their lifetime

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:14.440 align:middle line:84%
across the time of
their life where

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:17.080 align:middle line:84%
they can pop out at any
moment, and for others, it

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:18.700 align:middle line:90%
is hundreds and hundreds.

00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:21.290 align:middle line:84%
So you can always be
whisked off the planet.

00:36:21.290 --> 00:36:23.800 align:middle line:84%
What we would say is yes,
there are other dimensions.

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:25.240 align:middle line:90%
There are other realities.

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:29.200 align:middle line:84%
But for those of us in this
group that Lee is connected to,

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:30.405 align:middle line:90%
we are energetics.

00:36:30.405 --> 00:36:31.780 align:middle line:84%
It does not mean
that we have not

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:35.290 align:middle line:84%
been incarnate on Earth or
other places, for in this group,

00:36:35.290 --> 00:36:38.230 align:middle line:84%
there are members
who have been that.

00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:40.180 align:middle line:84%
However, what we
try to remind you

00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:43.240 align:middle line:84%
is there is nothing
like the emotional

00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:46.990 align:middle line:84%
or the sensory frequency of
this planet that you are on now.

00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:49.420 align:middle line:84%
And more importantly,
some of you

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:52.750 align:middle line:84%
seem to forget that it
is a job to be on Earth.

00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:54.670 align:middle line:84%
Some of you have this
ingrained in your mind,

00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:58.180 align:middle line:84%
but part of what you are
doing here is cleaning.

00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:02.440 align:middle line:84%
And we say that not to
disappoint or deglamorize

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:03.410 align:middle line:90%
the process.

00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:04.785 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is
part of what you

00:37:04.785 --> 00:37:07.630 align:middle line:84%
are trying to do is help clean
up and change the frequency.

00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:11.140 align:middle line:84%
So many of you who feel
like you shouldn't be here,

00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:14.290 align:middle line:84%
you have been the kinds
of energies, if you like,

00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:17.320 align:middle line:84%
that can work
areas of the world.

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:20.770 align:middle line:84%
So for example, there are
many unembodied beings

00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:25.000 align:middle line:84%
who are clearing energies of
your planet or other planets,

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.590 align:middle line:84%
but for many of
you, it is far more

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:28.220 align:middle line:84%
interesting to
drop into the body.

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:30.370 align:middle line:84%
But if you are highly
sensitive, if you

00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:33.490 align:middle line:84%
have strong angelic
leanings, it is a shock

00:37:33.490 --> 00:37:37.360 align:middle line:84%
to be back in the
density and the--

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:40.020 align:middle line:84%
we will say aggression
of this place.

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:41.740 align:middle line:84%
For it is a very
aggressive place,

00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:44.650 align:middle line:84%
and we do not just
mean aggressive actions

00:37:44.650 --> 00:37:48.160 align:middle line:84%
or destructive people
killing each other.

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:52.360 align:middle line:84%
We mean the aggression of the
energy on the physical senses

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:53.980 align:middle line:90%
is very, very strong.

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:55.610 align:middle line:84%
Whereas when you
are out of the body,

00:37:55.610 --> 00:37:59.020 align:middle line:84%
when you are back to
source, or your soul body,

00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:01.630 align:middle line:84%
everything is far
more fluid and open,

00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:04.960 align:middle line:84%
and things are not as
staccato as they are

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:06.850 align:middle line:90%
when you are in the human body.

00:38:06.850 --> 00:38:07.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:10.630 align:middle line:84%
And to manage it, what
a lot of people do

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:13.240 align:middle line:90%
is turn to intrigue for escape.

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:16.930 align:middle line:84%
It can be anything from
watching movies and playing

00:38:16.930 --> 00:38:20.810 align:middle line:84%
video games to tapping
into intriguing spiritual

00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:21.610 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:38:21.610 --> 00:38:22.410 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:25.840 align:middle line:90%
It's still intrigue to escape.

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:28.690 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is the truth
seems to be sitting there,

00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:31.960 align:middle line:84%
but we don't know how to discern
it waiting for our attention.

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:36.460 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about this tendency
towards flight from our reality

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:40.900 align:middle line:84%
and what we need to do to
anchor back into genuine truths

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:44.120 align:middle line:84%
and be able to discern
one from the other.

00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:46.010 align:middle line:90%
The intrigue from the truth.

00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:47.590 align:middle line:90%
The useful truth.

00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:50.860 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: We appreciate
your analysis,

00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:53.140 align:middle line:84%
and we would just
like to offer one

00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:56.180 align:middle line:84%
other aspect, a way of seeing
this escape, as you call it.

00:38:56.180 --> 00:39:00.100 align:middle line:84%
For it is true that many escape,
and they do it mindlessly.

00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And for some, it
becomes a numbing act.

00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:05.590 align:middle line:90%
But we will also say this.

00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:08.950 align:middle line:84%
Entertainment,
information, these

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:11.080 align:middle line:84%
are what we would
call dream states.

00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And they are ways
that many people

00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:16.120 align:middle line:84%
have got used to giving their
dream or their visionary power

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:16.920 align:middle line:90%
over to.

00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:20.150 align:middle line:84%
So there are certain high
frequency experiences

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.950 align:middle line:90%
that can be had.

00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:24.460 align:middle line:84%
For example, Regina, we
will use you and your show.

00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:27.700 align:middle line:84%
Are there some people
who escape through coming

00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:29.990 align:middle line:84%
to you for comfort and
clarity and a feeling of home?

00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:30.790 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:33.580 align:middle line:84%
Are there others, in fact,
more in the majority, who

00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:36.820 align:middle line:84%
use it to anchor in what
home should feel like,

00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:39.310 align:middle line:84%
and then they have a sense
in their body of what

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:41.830 align:middle line:84%
is more normal to them
than what they are

00:39:41.830 --> 00:39:43.180 align:middle line:90%
presented in the outside world.

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And do they then alchemize
and galvanize that feeling

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:51.070 align:middle line:84%
and start to identify it in
other areas of their life,

00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:52.630 align:middle line:90%
consciously and unconsciously?

00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:53.470 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:56.980 align:middle line:84%
So what we would say is there is
a disconnect between the vision

00:39:56.980 --> 00:40:00.670 align:middle line:84%
and the dream state in the human
and the creative in the human.

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:03.400 align:middle line:84%
This is why creativity
is so essential.

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:05.110 align:middle line:90%
All of you need to create.

00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And not to order or
because you are being paid,

00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:11.290 align:middle line:84%
but you need to create
to express and to run

00:40:11.290 --> 00:40:13.000 align:middle line:84%
your own energy
through your system

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.460 align:middle line:84%
and put it back into
form on the earth.

00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:17.860 align:middle line:84%
So for example, somebody
might write a poem.

00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:20.230 align:middle line:84%
Somebody might
create a magical meal

00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:22.210 align:middle line:84%
for their loved
ones or themselves.

00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:24.760 align:middle line:84%
Somebody might create in
the Earth, in the garden,

00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:27.070 align:middle line:84%
somebody might carve
something from wood.

00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:29.050 align:middle line:84%
When you go into
these states, you

00:40:29.050 --> 00:40:32.280 align:middle line:84%
are running source energy
through your own body,

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:33.620 align:middle line:90%
and this is very important.

00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:36.370 align:middle line:84%
So what you are
differentiating is the part

00:40:36.370 --> 00:40:40.420 align:middle line:84%
of the nervous system that has
to shut down and go completely

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:41.290 align:middle line:90%
out of the body.

00:40:41.290 --> 00:40:44.030 align:middle line:84%
You often call this
fight or flight.

00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:47.920 align:middle line:84%
But equally, it is not so much
that the flight out of the body

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:49.190 align:middle line:90%
is the problem.

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:52.330 align:middle line:84%
The problem is the
lack of continuum

00:40:52.330 --> 00:40:55.450 align:middle line:84%
between the state of trauma
and the state of elation.

00:40:55.450 --> 00:40:58.090 align:middle line:84%
It is the middle
cylinder that links

00:40:58.090 --> 00:41:01.780 align:middle line:84%
those two that is actually what
all of you need to develop.

00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:04.810 align:middle line:84%
This is why it's so
important to, as a society,

00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:07.660 align:middle line:84%
talk about the things that
you are now speaking about.

00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:10.120 align:middle line:84%
The discomforts you have,
the worries, the concerns.

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:12.790 align:middle line:10%
For that had been homogenized
out of your culture

00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:15.916 align:middle line:10%
and only given to art, whereas
your society is becoming

00:41:15.916 --> 00:41:17.290 align:middle line:10%
a bit more adept
at what we would

00:41:17.290 --> 00:41:18.920 align:middle line:10%
call emotional communication.

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:20.350 align:middle line:10%
So that is helping.

00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:21.940 align:middle line:90%
People need their bodies back.

00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:23.780 align:middle line:84%
And what is happening
is their bodies

00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:28.060 align:middle line:84%
are either being taken hostage
by society or their work

00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:30.850 align:middle line:84%
or them having to detach
from how they really

00:41:30.850 --> 00:41:33.490 align:middle line:84%
feel about something
in order to see

00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:36.040 align:middle line:84%
through a commitment
with a person or a job

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:39.860 align:middle line:84%
or some role they have that
they're struggling to fulfill.

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:41.740 align:middle line:84%
So we would say that
the problem is not

00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:45.850 align:middle line:84%
so much where people escape to
or the trauma that they have.

00:41:45.850 --> 00:41:48.160 align:middle line:84%
It's there is a lack of
development of what we

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:50.170 align:middle line:90%
would call the middle ground.

00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:52.360 align:middle line:84%
So that propulsive
fight or flight

00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:54.280 align:middle line:84%
which takes a lot of
energy from a person

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:57.010 align:middle line:84%
and pulls them off their own
sense of center and ground

00:41:57.010 --> 00:41:59.980 align:middle line:84%
can start to dissipate the
more that people are creating

00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:01.690 align:middle line:90%
from inside themselves.

00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And for many, this
can start by simply

00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:05.620 align:middle line:90%
being artistically creative.

00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:08.170 align:middle line:84%
But we assure you that
the act of creativity

00:42:08.170 --> 00:42:10.014 align:middle line:90%
is a necessity, not a luxury.

00:42:10.014 --> 00:42:12.430 align:middle line:84%
It is something that all of
you are in touch with when you

00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:14.590 align:middle line:90%
first come into this planet.

00:42:14.590 --> 00:42:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And depending on
how it is supported

00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:21.700 align:middle line:84%
by the individuals who raised
you and also the kind of work

00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:24.700 align:middle line:84%
that you have in the
world and the lifestyle,

00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:26.950 align:middle line:84%
it is something that most
of you lose somewhere

00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:28.780 align:middle line:90%
between the ages of 7 and 16.

00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:29.840 align:middle line:90%
You disconnect from it.

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:32.320 align:middle line:84%
And also the inner critic
has a lot to do with this.

00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:35.170 align:middle line:84%
And that inner critic
is an inner voice

00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:38.410 align:middle line:84%
that you have developed
through listening

00:42:38.410 --> 00:42:40.820 align:middle line:90%
to all of the outer voices.

00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:41.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Here, here.

00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:43.540 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely beautifully said.

00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:45.160 align:middle line:90%
Creativity is our native state.

00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:45.960 align:middle line:90%
And you're right.

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:51.160 align:middle line:84%
We get so easily cut off
with it to go with function.

00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And so going back to the notion
of truth and finding our truth.

00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:57.976 align:middle line:84%
This is a confusing area
for a lot of people,

00:42:57.976 --> 00:42:59.350 align:middle line:84%
especially if you
expose yourself

00:42:59.350 --> 00:43:02.540 align:middle line:84%
to massive amounts of
conflicting information.

00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:04.769 align:middle line:84%
And I get these
questions all the time.

00:43:04.769 --> 00:43:06.310 align:middle line:84%
You interview someone
that says this,

00:43:06.310 --> 00:43:08.350 align:middle line:84%
you interview someone
that says this.

00:43:08.350 --> 00:43:11.920 align:middle line:84%
Another person or host or
magazine article says this.

00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:15.620 align:middle line:84%
And people end up frozen,
in a state of confusion.

00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:18.100 align:middle line:84%
How do we use our
being and our body

00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:22.690 align:middle line:84%
as a tuning fork for
essential truths?

00:43:22.690 --> 00:43:25.810 align:middle line:84%
What is our guide to
finding truth again?

00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:29.050 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Does it light you up,
or does it put you into fear?

00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:31.570 align:middle line:84%
Now sometimes things
can put you into fear

00:43:31.570 --> 00:43:33.340 align:middle line:84%
when you first have a
shocking revelation,

00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:35.542 align:middle line:84%
and you then come
through that shock.

00:43:35.542 --> 00:43:37.000 align:middle line:84%
But what we would
say is if you are

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.060 align:middle line:84%
someone who says you
are seeking the truth,

00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:42.110 align:middle line:90%
it is an impossibility.

00:43:42.110 --> 00:43:44.050 align:middle line:84%
Meaning there are so
many perspectives,

00:43:44.050 --> 00:43:47.800 align:middle line:84%
and this very multi-dimensional
universe that you live in

00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:51.400 align:middle line:84%
is far more complex than the
human is allowed to experience.

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And we say that not
to be forbidding,

00:43:53.470 --> 00:43:56.620 align:middle line:84%
this word allow, it is just part
of the gravity belt of being

00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:57.850 align:middle line:90%
a human in the Earth.

00:43:57.850 --> 00:44:00.780 align:middle line:84%
There is only so much
that you are supposed to

00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:02.890 align:middle line:90%
or are designed to access.

00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:05.560 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you can have cosmic,
multi-dimensional experiences,

00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:07.600 align:middle line:90%
and all of that is a truism.

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:09.880 align:middle line:84%
But if you are
looking for the truth,

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:11.680 align:middle line:84%
you are going to run
yourself into trouble.

00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And some part of you that
is looking for the truth

00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:18.460 align:middle line:84%
has not yet identified the
traumatized or fight or flight

00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:20.430 align:middle line:84%
part of you that
is trying to find

00:44:20.430 --> 00:44:24.280 align:middle line:84%
an outer solution for the inner
pain or the inner discomfort.

00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:26.830 align:middle line:84%
If you are looking
for your truth,

00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:29.350 align:middle line:84%
or if a person is
looking for their truth,

00:44:29.350 --> 00:44:31.450 align:middle line:84%
their truth about
life that gets them

00:44:31.450 --> 00:44:33.040 align:middle line:84%
back in their body
in a way that they

00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:39.020 align:middle line:84%
are feeling more well-being,
more happy, more of service,

00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:41.890 align:middle line:84%
naturally and joyously,
more that they

00:44:41.890 --> 00:44:44.550 align:middle line:84%
are able to receive some
of the gifts of life,

00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:48.100 align:middle line:84%
and that their heart is not
afraid to be touched by others.

00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:50.920 align:middle line:84%
Are you somebody who always
pushes the compliment away?

00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:51.730 align:middle line:90%
Stop it.

00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:53.950 align:middle line:84%
You have to recognize
you are always

00:44:53.950 --> 00:44:55.420 align:middle line:84%
pushing the compliment
away, and it

00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:57.340 align:middle line:84%
is safe to receive
and feel compliments.

00:44:57.340 --> 00:45:00.490 align:middle line:84%
And if it isn't safe to you,
yes, be curious about what

00:45:00.490 --> 00:45:02.650 align:middle line:84%
in the past has stopped
you feeling safe,

00:45:02.650 --> 00:45:04.840 align:middle line:84%
while also opening
up to the now, which

00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:06.680 align:middle line:90%
is a very different time.

00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:09.130 align:middle line:84%
So we would say that truth
seekers are not actually

00:45:09.130 --> 00:45:12.140 align:middle line:84%
seeking truth, they're
seeking themselves.

00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:13.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:13.880 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:16.720 align:middle line:84%
Our truth, the truth that
is at the base of what we

00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:18.550 align:middle line:90%
need for our own development.

00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And interests, I
totally agree with you

00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:24.670 align:middle line:84%
in that I experience it
on a level of expansion

00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:26.100 align:middle line:90%
versus contraction.

00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:27.670 align:middle line:84%
When there is huge
contraction, it's

00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:29.770 align:middle line:84%
something that usually
is not resonating

00:45:29.770 --> 00:45:31.970 align:middle line:84%
with me for this
time, for my learning

00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:34.010 align:middle line:84%
and what I need to
contribute to the world.

00:45:34.010 --> 00:45:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And so I think the way you
said it is very accurate.

00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:41.330 align:middle line:84%
Something that lights you up or
something that shuts you down.

00:45:41.330 --> 00:45:44.050 align:middle line:84%
So instead, another area
that I think a lot of people

00:45:44.050 --> 00:45:46.220 align:middle line:84%
are intrigued with, and
it's come to surface a bit,

00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:48.260 align:middle line:84%
and people get all
excited about it,

00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:50.810 align:middle line:90%
is the notion of disclosure.

00:45:50.810 --> 00:45:53.990 align:middle line:84%
Around Christmas
of this last year,

00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:55.670 align:middle line:84%
there was an article
that came out--

00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:57.530 align:middle line:84%
old, old news, but
for people reading

00:45:57.530 --> 00:45:59.238 align:middle line:84%
"The New York Times"
that had never heard

00:45:59.238 --> 00:46:03.170 align:middle line:84%
of any of this, that there
were government panels working

00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:05.770 align:middle line:90%
with the study of alien agendas.

00:46:05.770 --> 00:46:07.670 align:middle line:84%
And now for the first
time, the public,

00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:10.340 align:middle line:84%
are one of the first times the
public is suddenly saying, see?

00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:12.230 align:middle line:90%
I told you so at a dinner party.

00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:13.710 align:middle line:90%
I told you they existed.

00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:18.080 align:middle line:84%
So we get in a
big intrigue, kind

00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:20.810 align:middle line:84%
of mass intrigue
around other beings

00:46:20.810 --> 00:46:24.440 align:middle line:84%
that are here and their place
over our lives and such while

00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:26.910 align:middle line:84%
still avoiding, often,
looking at our own lives.

00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:29.450 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about the
interface of this whole notion

00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:32.030 align:middle line:84%
of disclosure, the awareness
that other beings have

00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:36.280 align:middle line:84%
been on this planet, and
what our place is within that

00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:37.557 align:middle line:90%
now from your perspective.

00:46:37.557 --> 00:46:39.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, there are
multiple truths to this.

00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And first of all, disclosure,
of course, will come,

00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:44.510 align:middle line:84%
but it will happen
over a far longer time

00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:47.060 align:middle line:84%
than would satisfy most
of the, we would say,

00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:48.890 align:middle line:90%
avid disclosure seekers.

00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:50.600 align:middle line:84%
If you are an avid
disclosure seeker,

00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:52.580 align:middle line:84%
investigate what you
are missing in yourself.

00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:56.030 align:middle line:84%
We are not judging your
seeking, for like any group

00:46:56.030 --> 00:47:00.350 align:middle line:84%
on your planet that is
very hell-bent on talking

00:47:00.350 --> 00:47:02.030 align:middle line:84%
about a certain
subject or bringing it

00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:04.490 align:middle line:84%
into the consciousness, there
is a certain puzzle piece

00:47:04.490 --> 00:47:05.540 align:middle line:90%
that they are playing.

00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:08.510 align:middle line:84%
They are being people who
are passionate and activist

00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:11.269 align:middle line:84%
about a certain aspect of life
that has either been hidden,

00:47:11.269 --> 00:47:13.060 align:middle line:84%
suppressed, or not put
into the mainstream.

00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:16.920 align:middle line:84%
So there is an aspect of their
avid nature that is true.

00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:18.350 align:middle line:84%
But there is also
another aspect,

00:47:18.350 --> 00:47:20.810 align:middle line:84%
which is they are looking
for disclosure to bring

00:47:20.810 --> 00:47:24.980 align:middle line:84%
the freedom to them and the
world that they think it needs

00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:27.320 align:middle line:84%
or that they themselves
are not feeling.

00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:30.590 align:middle line:84%
So it is always good, if you
are obsessive about anything

00:47:30.590 --> 00:47:33.260 align:middle line:84%
in life, to check
your obsession.

00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:36.170 align:middle line:84%
What we will say is
that disclosure will not

00:47:36.170 --> 00:47:39.780 align:middle line:84%
change the world in the 360
way that many of those people

00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:40.580 align:middle line:90%
crave.

00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:43.070 align:middle line:84%
However, it will
certainly shake it up 180,

00:47:43.070 --> 00:47:45.320 align:middle line:84%
and this is part of the
reason that the suppression

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:49.880 align:middle line:84%
has been, by a small number
of people, encouraged.

00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:52.940 align:middle line:84%
Because what will happen
to humanity once there

00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:55.460 align:middle line:84%
is more awareness of
life on other planets

00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:58.910 align:middle line:84%
is the stranglehold
of what we would call

00:47:58.910 --> 00:48:01.040 align:middle line:84%
revealed shadow
government will start

00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:02.870 align:middle line:90%
to lose power and authority.

00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:05.840 align:middle line:84%
Because at the moment,
not unlike the god

00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:08.300 align:middle line:84%
that you are given through
your religious sources

00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:11.600 align:middle line:84%
that you are all supposed to
bow down to and be separate from

00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:14.870 align:middle line:84%
and not have any sense
of personal power around,

00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:17.780 align:middle line:84%
so too have those who are
running this very culture that

00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:20.210 align:middle line:84%
runs you ragged,
this very culture

00:48:20.210 --> 00:48:22.640 align:middle line:84%
that you and Lee were
addressing earlier that

00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:24.530 align:middle line:84%
does not leave any of
you space to breathe,

00:48:24.530 --> 00:48:26.990 align:middle line:84%
for you are in the
machine, and that you all

00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:31.340 align:middle line:84%
have to work hard to
survive, most of you.

00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:33.920 align:middle line:84%
That very culture
that has been created

00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:35.750 align:middle line:90%
is designed to keep you small.

00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And once you realize you are
part of a wider universe, which

00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:41.360 align:middle line:90%
all human beings know at heart.

00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:45.170 align:middle line:84%
So this also starts to
rapidly undo the programming

00:48:45.170 --> 00:48:46.250 align:middle line:90%
of the human being.

00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:48.860 align:middle line:84%
Once the human being is
reminded of the wider source

00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:52.170 align:middle line:84%
truth of universal
life and this,

00:48:52.170 --> 00:48:55.460 align:middle line:84%
shall we say, interplay
between human and other planets

00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:58.730 align:middle line:84%
for many, many, many,
many generations,

00:48:58.730 --> 00:49:03.507 align:middle line:84%
suddenly the glass
ceiling starts to crack.

00:49:03.507 --> 00:49:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And there are a small
number of people

00:49:05.090 --> 00:49:07.730 align:middle line:84%
who do not want the
glass ceiling to crack,

00:49:07.730 --> 00:49:11.930 align:middle line:84%
but there is an energy movement
among this group of human souls

00:49:11.930 --> 00:49:15.360 align:middle line:84%
that you are now part of
in this incarnation that

00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:18.890 align:middle line:84%
are on the back of the evolution
of all of the prior human souls

00:49:18.890 --> 00:49:21.410 align:middle line:84%
who have been building this
fever pitch of what you might

00:49:21.410 --> 00:49:23.330 align:middle line:90%
call consciousness or awakening.

00:49:23.330 --> 00:49:24.470 align:middle line:90%
It cannot hold.

00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:25.940 align:middle line:90%
It has to break.

00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:29.180 align:middle line:84%
So we would say, like
anything, like any obsession

00:49:29.180 --> 00:49:32.300 align:middle line:84%
about disclosure,
there is good and bad.

00:49:32.300 --> 00:49:36.500 align:middle line:84%
But we would say, at best, it
has been a very important part

00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:38.270 align:middle line:84%
of this world, being
liberated from some

00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:43.280 align:middle line:84%
of the financial and energetic
and emotional control

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:46.460 align:middle line:84%
that humans have been put
under that is not best designed

00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:48.320 align:middle line:90%
for humans or the planet.

00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:49.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hm.

00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:51.020 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:52.880 align:middle line:84%
We have only time for
one more question.

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And looking at us as human
beings, because we're

00:49:56.180 --> 00:49:57.650 align:middle line:90%
such a unique species.

00:49:57.650 --> 00:50:00.560 align:middle line:84%
We have the greatest
and the lowest behaviors

00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:03.790 align:middle line:90%
in our grasp at any time.

00:50:03.790 --> 00:50:05.900 align:middle line:84%
What are we undervaluing
in ourselves

00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:09.590 align:middle line:84%
in terms of our strengths,
our beauty, and our abilities?

00:50:09.590 --> 00:50:12.910 align:middle line:84%
What are the most common things
we undervalue in ourselves,

00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:13.770 align:middle line:90%
our own species?

00:50:13.770 --> 00:50:16.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: You've all been taught
to undervalue your hearts.

00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And if you steer a society
away from their hearts,

00:50:20.490 --> 00:50:21.620 align:middle line:90%
they lose the power center.

00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:23.749 align:middle line:84%
The heart is the
center of the body.

00:50:23.749 --> 00:50:25.790 align:middle line:84%
The heart chakra is the
power center of the body.

00:50:25.790 --> 00:50:30.410 align:middle line:84%
For we see your bodies
extending a good 12 to 20 inches

00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:32.750 align:middle line:90%
above your physical heads.

00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:36.406 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, the heart is
the energy center of the body.

00:50:36.406 --> 00:50:38.780 align:middle line:10%
And if you can get people
disconnected from their hearts,

00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:40.571 align:middle line:10%
either through fear or
through telling them

00:50:40.571 --> 00:50:42.050 align:middle line:10%
they aren't good
enough, or through

00:50:42.050 --> 00:50:43.880 align:middle line:10%
creating a comparison
culture, which

00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:46.880 align:middle line:10%
you see being highly
encouraged and activated,

00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:49.250 align:middle line:10%
creating a culture of
judgment without healing.

00:50:49.250 --> 00:50:50.322 align:middle line:90%
We should say this.

00:50:50.322 --> 00:50:52.280 align:middle line:84%
There are many things
going down on your planet

00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:54.680 align:middle line:84%
right now that people are
in shock horror about,

00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:57.900 align:middle line:84%
and there is judgment
rising to the surface.

00:50:57.900 --> 00:50:59.490 align:middle line:90%
Everything is perspective based.

00:50:59.490 --> 00:51:01.970 align:middle line:84%
We are not in any
way trying to say

00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:05.780 align:middle line:84%
that certain people who have
committed acts against others

00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:07.940 align:middle line:84%
that have caused them
pain and suffering

00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:10.340 align:middle line:84%
should just be let
off those acts.

00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:14.120 align:middle line:84%
But this hard line,
right/wrong judgment,

00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:16.340 align:middle line:84%
without recognizing
that some of these acts

00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:19.130 align:middle line:84%
have been perpetrated by those
who are playing out the biggest

00:51:19.130 --> 00:51:23.000 align:middle line:84%
shadows of the culture you are
all in, even if you yourself

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.460 align:middle line:84%
are not embodying that
shadow to that level,

00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:28.530 align:middle line:84%
that judgment is part of the
separation and the division.

00:51:28.530 --> 00:51:30.834 align:middle line:84%
So you have to be very
careful with judgment.

00:51:30.834 --> 00:51:33.500 align:middle line:84%
Judgment is one of the ways that
you have all been kept separate

00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:36.160 align:middle line:84%
from each other, and steering
you away from your hearts

00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:38.690 align:middle line:84%
is how you have been kept
away from your power.

00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:41.480 align:middle line:84%
With men, it is to discourage
them and confuse them

00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:43.850 align:middle line:84%
about their feelings,
and with women, it

00:51:43.850 --> 00:51:47.390 align:middle line:84%
has been to devalue their place,
for they are strong in feeling.

00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:49.040 align:middle line:90%
We will say this.

00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:51.380 align:middle line:84%
There is this
common misconception

00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:54.219 align:middle line:84%
that men are far less
emotional than women.

00:51:54.219 --> 00:51:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And we would say it's actually
the opposite way around.

00:51:56.510 --> 00:51:58.836 align:middle line:84%
Women have been emotional
about the lack of power

00:51:58.836 --> 00:52:01.460 align:middle line:84%
and the injustice that they have
had to suffer for a long time,

00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:03.168 align:middle line:84%
and that is what can
make them emotional,

00:52:03.168 --> 00:52:06.196 align:middle line:84%
for they have not been given
voices or authority in areas

00:52:06.196 --> 00:52:07.820 align:middle line:84%
that that emotion
would have gone down.

00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:11.180 align:middle line:84%
Men are naturally far
more emotional than women,

00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:12.800 align:middle line:84%
but they have been
discouraged from it

00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:14.420 align:middle line:90%
and shamed away from it.

00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:17.270 align:middle line:84%
This is why when you have
little boys and little girls,

00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:19.820 align:middle line:84%
you will often see it is
the boys who get more upset

00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:22.730 align:middle line:84%
and stay upset for
longer than the girls.

00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:26.480 align:middle line:84%
So this is an important thing
for all of you to understand.

00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:28.940 align:middle line:84%
You have all been
told a lie about who

00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:29.960 align:middle line:90%
you are supposed to be.

00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And we say that not to get
the conspiracy theorists all

00:52:32.930 --> 00:52:33.890 align:middle line:90%
aflame.

00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:35.834 align:middle line:84%
Because conspiracy
theorists have a tendency

00:52:35.834 --> 00:52:37.250 align:middle line:84%
to live in their
head, their mind,

00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:39.440 align:middle line:84%
and want to escape
to the information.

00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:41.510 align:middle line:84%
We are not putting all
of them in that camp.

00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:43.700 align:middle line:84%
There are some wonderful
activist warriors

00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:47.240 align:middle line:84%
for certain what you would call
conspiracy or shadow, hidden

00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:48.900 align:middle line:90%
elements on your planet.

00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:52.400 align:middle line:84%
But what all of you need is
your hearts, your vulnerability,

00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:53.570 align:middle line:90%
your feelings.

00:52:53.570 --> 00:52:56.000 align:middle line:84%
When you let this come
back into the body,

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:59.780 align:middle line:84%
and when you actively start to
encourage, invite, and seek it,

00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:02.240 align:middle line:84%
it changes who you
are as a person.

00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:05.180 align:middle line:84%
It changes the way you interact
with the rest of the world.

00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And if each of you start
changing the way you interact,

00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:11.120 align:middle line:84%
an osmosis will occur
across the planet that

00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:14.630 align:middle line:84%
will unleash a power in
humanity the likes of which you

00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:15.710 align:middle line:90%
will have never seen.

00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:18.290 align:middle line:84%
This is where this word
humanitarian will come from.

00:53:18.290 --> 00:53:22.190 align:middle line:84%
Those that you hail as
humanitarians, they are you.

00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:24.770 align:middle line:84%
They are how all of you are
naturally designed to be.

00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:26.875 align:middle line:84%
They are just the ones
who, for whatever reason

00:53:26.875 --> 00:53:31.130 align:middle line:84%
in their life, circumstance,
training, focus and dedication,

00:53:31.130 --> 00:53:33.680 align:middle line:84%
have allowed the
humanitarian in themselves

00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:35.400 align:middle line:90%
to come out to the fore.

00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:38.240 align:middle line:84%
But that is actually how
all of you are designed.

00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:40.520 align:middle line:84%
And the pain that you
feel and the disconnection

00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:42.860 align:middle line:84%
from each other and the
separation from each other

00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:46.370 align:middle line:84%
is because that design has
been diminished from the way

00:53:46.370 --> 00:53:47.900 align:middle line:90%
that you're allowed to be.

00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:51.950 align:middle line:84%
This next 10, 20, 30
years is the rebirth

00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:57.706 align:middle line:84%
of that design unfolding into
your collective once more.

00:53:57.706 --> 00:54:00.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it's been an
absolutely lovely conversation.

00:54:00.310 --> 00:54:04.190 align:middle line:84%
I thank you so much for taking
the energy to come through Lee

00:54:04.190 --> 00:54:07.400 align:middle line:84%
and join us here today to
inspire so many people that

00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:08.570 align:middle line:90%
will be watching this later.

00:54:08.570 --> 00:54:11.710 align:middle line:84%
And with that, I say, go
well, and thank you so much.

00:54:11.710 --> 00:54:14.022 align:middle line:84%
And we can have
Lee back anytime.

00:54:14.022 --> 00:54:20.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: [BREATHING DEEPLY] Hi.

00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:22.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That was good.

00:54:22.650 --> 00:54:24.600 align:middle line:90%
I enjoyed that very much.

00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:26.960 align:middle line:84%
A lot of very grounded,
useful information.

00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:32.060 align:middle line:84%
It's a time to take stock
and to take action and take

00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:34.410 align:middle line:84%
some time for rest, so
we had time for action.

00:54:34.410 --> 00:54:35.590 align:middle line:90%
We have the energy for it.

00:54:35.590 --> 00:54:36.160 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Fire.

00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:36.660 align:middle line:90%
It's funny.

00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:38.868 align:middle line:84%
The one thing I've really
noticed with them recently,

00:54:38.868 --> 00:54:41.920 align:middle line:84%
and partly my own
evolution and partly them,

00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:43.350 align:middle line:84%
that there's this
fire that comes

00:54:43.350 --> 00:54:44.390 align:middle line:90%
through them that's really on.

00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:47.000 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like that's the fire
that we're all tapping into.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:47.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I totally agree.

00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:48.950 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: That you
are needed fire.

00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:50.354 align:middle line:90%
So we do need rest from it too.

00:54:50.354 --> 00:54:51.770 align:middle line:10%
Because it activates
you, and then

00:54:51.770 --> 00:54:52.978 align:middle line:10%
you need to rest and recover.

00:54:52.978 --> 00:54:54.100 align:middle line:10%
And then it activates you.

00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:54.990 align:middle line:90%
And so yeah.

00:54:54.990 --> 00:54:57.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Full willingness,
full responsibility,

00:54:57.260 --> 00:54:58.540 align:middle line:90%
and honoring our own truth.

00:54:58.540 --> 00:54:59.340 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:01.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And Lee,
we're out of time.

00:55:01.230 --> 00:55:02.030 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:04.420 align:middle line:84%
I think that was my favorite
conversation with the Zs ever.

00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:05.060 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I feel the same way.

00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:06.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And maybe I
say that every time,

00:55:06.650 --> 00:55:07.608 align:middle line:90%
but this is really was.

00:55:07.608 --> 00:55:10.190 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Until next time, Lee.

00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:12.120 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:14.750 align:middle line:84%
I hope you enjoyed words
from the Zs And Lee, both.

00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:16.970 align:middle line:84%
We'll certainly be getting
back together again.

00:55:16.970 --> 00:55:18.900 align:middle line:84%
