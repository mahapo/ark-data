[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.500 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
I've come to learn over

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.920 align:middle line:10%
the course of my work
that some of my colleagues

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.410 align:middle line:10%
and interviewees have
been obtaining insights

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.410 align:middle line:10%
from great seers and channelers.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.260 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this has
always been the case

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.820 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to great
insights and creations

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.510 align:middle line:84%
as we're always in relationship
with the unseen realms,

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.090 align:middle line:90%
whether we know it or not.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.950 align:middle line:84%
The wise among us
have always known this

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.170 align:middle line:84%
and used it, from
kings and queens

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.110 align:middle line:84%
to presidents, shamans, mystics,
artists and the rest of us.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.710 align:middle line:84%
Joan Walker was more
surprised than anyone

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.250 align:middle line:84%
when a being from
another dimension

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.880 align:middle line:90%
began speaking through her.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.870 align:middle line:84%
This began a 40 year
relationship with other realms,

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.610 align:middle line:90%
and she's here with us today.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's so good to see you,
Joan, here on the set finally.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.844 align:middle line:84%
Because I just have to share
this little bit of back story.

00:01:10.844 --> 00:01:12.510 align:middle line:84%
People don't know
your name or your face

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.560 align:middle line:84%
because you're the one
behind a lot of people

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.640 align:middle line:90%
whose faces we have seen.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.850 align:middle line:84%
And you're the one that has
very quietly been offering

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.310 align:middle line:84%
her services all these years
with no need for recognition.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.540 align:middle line:84%
But a few of us have asked
you to please come out

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.460 align:middle line:84%
of the closet and share
this with the rest of us.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.250 align:middle line:10%
>>JOAN WALKER: Well,
it's been probably

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.580 align:middle line:10%
about a 10 year evolution
to come out of the closet.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.660 align:middle line:10%
It was like I was very happy
to stay in the background

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.037 align:middle line:10%
and just do what I
do and lead my life.

00:01:46.037 --> 00:01:48.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, well, your
life took an abrupt turn

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.040 align:middle line:90%
a while back.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.998 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Yeah, it did.

00:01:49.998 --> 00:01:52.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I love the story
of how this all began

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.420 align:middle line:84%
and how you finally
got your husband,

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.490 align:middle line:90%
Johnny Walker's, attention.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.260 align:middle line:84%
So just give us a little
background of who you were,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.770 align:middle line:84%
what your life was like,
how this affected you,

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.260 align:middle line:84%
and what happened on
that particular day

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.820 align:middle line:84%
when Johnny recognized
something was up.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:14.210 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: Well, you know,
I was a mother, and a wife,

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.490 align:middle line:84%
and a business owner,
and raising four kids.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.210 align:middle line:84%
So needless to stay, I had
a very stressful, busy life.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And I had to find something
to kind of level that out.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.330 align:middle line:84%
So I turned to meditation,
which helped me tremendously.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And as I would meditate,
I would hear things

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.240 align:middle line:90%
or I would know things.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And one time I was
in a book store,

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.490 align:middle line:84%
and you know, you've
heard the story,

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.780 align:middle line:90%
books fall off onto your hands.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.030 align:middle line:84%
So I picked it up and I
took it home and I read it.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.870 align:middle line:90%
It was Opening to Channel.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.855 align:middle line:90%
And I started reading it.

00:02:57.855 --> 00:03:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And I think I only got into
like first two chapters.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.960 align:middle line:84%
And I said to my husband
John, I said, "I can do that.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.620 align:middle line:90%
I know I can do that."

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.930 align:middle line:90%
He said, "Well good for you.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:09.800 align:middle line:90%
You just go for it."

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:15.220 align:middle line:84%
So a few days later, I
decided I would try that.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And I was in our
living room and he

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.950 align:middle line:84%
was in our bedroom
watching a football game.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.530 align:middle line:90%
So I started the process.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.310 align:middle line:84%
I said a prayer and I
called in my guardian angel.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.015 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
I was getting

00:03:34.015 --> 00:03:38.530 align:middle line:84%
this weird, weird feeling in
my body, in my solar plexus.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.790 align:middle line:84%
It was just really hard,
and it kind of scared me.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.880 align:middle line:84%
So I went into the
room where John was,

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.300 align:middle line:84%
and I said, "Something's
happening really weird

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.140 align:middle line:84%
in my body, and
I don't like it."

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.186 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "Oh,
you'll be fine.

00:03:52.186 --> 00:03:54.560 align:middle line:84%
Go lay down on the bed,"
because he was really interested

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.140 align:middle line:90%
in the ball game.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.240 align:middle line:90%
And so I did.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:06.290 align:middle line:84%
And the minute I lay down, this
booming voice came out of me

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.670 align:middle line:90%
and start speaking.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, needless to say
John turned that TV off

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.210 align:middle line:90%
in a New York minute.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And ran-- he had
this little recorder

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.860 align:middle line:84%
that he would dictate
letters to his secretary on.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And he grabbed that
and came to the bedside

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.585 align:middle line:84%
and started recording
what I had said.

00:04:23.585 --> 00:04:26.950 align:middle line:84%
And who it was, it
was three of my guide

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.130 align:middle line:84%
that I had not known
on a conscious level.

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.900 align:middle line:84%
One in particular stayed
with me for over 10 years

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.600 align:middle line:90%
and would speak through me.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.320 align:middle line:84%
And it was mostly
things that pertained

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.990 align:middle line:84%
to my life and my
growth in consciousness,

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.470 align:middle line:84%
not so much from a universal
level or a collective level.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.520 align:middle line:84%
And it helped me tremendously
because-- his name was Eris,

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.770 align:middle line:84%
and he was such a support
system and a teacher

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.270 align:middle line:84%
to me that I came to
really depend on him.

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.410 align:middle line:84%
So this went on for
a number of years.

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.600 align:middle line:84%
It was in the late '90s,
I got a change in guides.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And archangel Ariel
started working with me.

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And she's a very dynamic
being, and really represents

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.010 align:middle line:90%
a very strong feminine presence.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And she taught me a
tremendous amount about myself

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:30.490 align:middle line:84%
and my thinking process in
regards to me as a woman,

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:36.680 align:middle line:84%
as a business owner, and
helping me to own my strengths.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:42.230 align:middle line:84%
So then I, all along this--
sometimes I would speak it.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:43.630 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes I would write it.

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.640 align:middle line:84%
I would ask questions
and it would

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.729 align:middle line:84%
be like I would take
dictation and they

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:49.770 align:middle line:90%
would give me the answer.

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And the agreement always was
you have to tell me who you are,

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.770 align:middle line:90%
why you're here.

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.320 align:middle line:90%
And then I'll decide.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.570 align:middle line:84%
Because I knew from
the very beginning

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.760 align:middle line:84%
that my body belonged to
me and it was my choice.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.670 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the way
I've always operated.

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:14.710 align:middle line:84%
And they've been very,
very kind and supportive.

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I initially
found out about you

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:20.670 align:middle line:84%
through our dear mutual
friend Sandie Sedgbeer.

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:26.100 align:middle line:84%
And when I experienced
the channeling,

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.010 align:middle line:84%
physically with you
in the room-- and this

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.954 align:middle line:84%
also happened at the Human
Origins-- little Human Origins

00:06:31.954 --> 00:06:33.870 align:middle line:84%
conference we put together
here, a small group

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.440 align:middle line:90%
of people including yourself.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And to me, this is
a real hallmark.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.880 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times people
believe they're channeling.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.230 align:middle line:84%
But I'm kind of strict
about that definition.

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:49.150 align:middle line:84%
That's why I generally don't
have too many people that

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:50.960 align:middle line:90%
do these things on the show.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.750 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise it's
really more to-- it's

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.510 align:middle line:84%
nice that someone
can do that but it's

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:59.290 align:middle line:84%
more for promoting business
and so to speak than it often

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:01.550 align:middle line:84%
is for getting
clarity on the whole.

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes it's not what
I call truly channeling.

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:05.971 align:middle line:90%
It is more-- doing a reading.

00:07:05.971 --> 00:07:07.470 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing
wrong with that.

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:09.136 align:middle line:84%
There are great seers
and great readers.

00:07:09.136 --> 00:07:11.320 align:middle line:84%
But channeling is really
quite a different thing

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.940 align:middle line:84%
where there has to be
this state of allowing.

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And to me, the mark of
a really full experience

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.460 align:middle line:84%
as the witness to it
is how the room feels.

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.910 align:middle line:84%
Because normally when that
being comes into the space

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:29.230 align:middle line:84%
to work through you, and
another woman who is also

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:32.100 align:middle line:84%
an excellent channeler that I
know, the whole room changes.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:33.992 align:middle line:84%
The energy is
distinctly different.

00:07:33.992 --> 00:07:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And if it's a different
being that comes,

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.030 align:middle line:84%
the whole room's energy
is completely different.

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:40.390 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
happens with you.

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:43.270 align:middle line:84%
In fact one time, I remember
when we had our human origins

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:47.130 align:middle line:84%
conference, I was knocked out
when they were talking to us.

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:49.850 align:middle line:84%
It was hard to get up out
of my little chair and go.

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:51.350 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: Well,
sometimes it depends

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:55.950 align:middle line:84%
on the being and the
context of the message,

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:58.100 align:middle line:90%
as to the energetics of it.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:01.010 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes it's very big.

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And it does--
people fall asleep.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.790 align:middle line:90%
There is definitely a shift.

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And the type of thing I do-
I don't do readings, per se,

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:11.750 align:middle line:90%
or any of that.

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:17.640 align:middle line:84%
It's more of a teaching, what
humanity needs to know now

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:22.460 align:middle line:84%
in this time of change
and ascension process.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.330 align:middle line:84%
There are certain
things that humanity

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:28.800 align:middle line:84%
needs to know about
themselves, and how

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:35.610 align:middle line:84%
to alter this third
dimensional, dense matrix

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:37.630 align:middle line:90%
they've been operating on.

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:41.429 align:middle line:84%
So that's really, over
the last 10 years,

00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:44.410 align:middle line:84%
these transmissions are
all related to that.

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they--
most, I have to say,

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:50.990 align:middle line:84%
all the time, they
apply to me as well as

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:53.430 align:middle line:90%
to the collective consciousness.

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:59.210 align:middle line:84%
So I've been very honored to
have, once I opened that door

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:05.570 align:middle line:84%
and said, OK, I can do this
and I put no limits on it,

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:11.780 align:middle line:84%
then I've had a full association
with many, many beings

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.360 align:middle line:84%
that come for
specific-- they may only

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:19.230 align:middle line:84%
come for short periods of time
or to relay a certain message.

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And my thinking on
that, all along, was I

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:25.410 align:middle line:90%
had to get out of the way.

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:28.600 align:middle line:84%
If I was going to do this,
and I was going to allow it,

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:35.260 align:middle line:84%
I needed to vacate my body and
allow them to come into my body

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.800 align:middle line:84%
so that, energetically,
they were present,

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:42.220 align:middle line:84%
as well as using
my voice to teach.

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And so I kind of stand
over to the side.

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.290 align:middle line:84%
It takes me a few
minutes to get into it--

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:49.890 align:middle line:90%
not for as long as you'd think.

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:51.660 align:middle line:90%
And I move away.

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And I can feel, as I do that,
the being coming into my field.

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:02.680 align:middle line:84%
And then he comes into,
or she, comes in this way

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.500 align:middle line:84%
and into my body
and out this way.

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:05.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you can feel it.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:08.640 align:middle line:84%
Anyone in the room, certainly,
if you have any sensitivities,

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:09.520 align:middle line:90%
it's very obvious.

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:10.540 align:middle line:90%
You can feel that.

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And your personality,
as I've gotten

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:14.772 align:middle line:84%
to know you a little
bit, is very much

00:10:14.772 --> 00:10:16.730 align:middle line:84%
as I was saying off
camera, kind of like water.

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:18.220 align:middle line:90%
It's very flowing.

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:21.620 align:middle line:84%
So you would seem to me to
be the ideal kind of person

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:24.220 align:middle line:84%
that information could
easily flow through.

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:28.480 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: Well, that has
always been my intention,

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.360 align:middle line:90%
that I stay out of the way.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:34.200 align:middle line:90%
I keep my opinions out of it.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.770 align:middle line:84%
That this has nothing
to do with me.

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:39.550 align:middle line:90%
I am only the vehicle.

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:41.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was it hard to get
over the potential ridicule

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:45.630 align:middle line:84%
factor, initially, when people
learned what you were doing?

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:49.110 align:middle line:84%
Because channeling has always
had such a big giggle factor.

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:53.100 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: Well, that's
why I was in the closet.

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:58.150 align:middle line:84%
So anybody that could use
the information, a teacher

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:07.460 align:middle line:84%
or people that did that type of
thing, that was perfectly OK.

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:10.600 align:middle line:84%
Because then I didn't have to
subject myself to the ridicule.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:17.930 align:middle line:84%
And in the area in which I live
in, it's a very rigid area.

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:19.536 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's part
of the Bible Belt.

00:11:19.536 --> 00:11:20.160 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Yeah.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't discuss with
my neighbors or my friends

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:25.470 align:middle line:90%
what I do.

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:26.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I
don't think we have

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:27.780 align:middle line:84%
to worry about them
being on Gaiam TV

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:28.980 align:middle line:84%
because they
probably will not be.

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: No, they absolutely
will not be visiting it.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
you're still safe.

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.665 align:middle line:84%
You're still safe in
your neighborhood.

00:11:33.665 --> 00:11:35.390 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: It's not
that I feel not safe.

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:36.630 align:middle line:90%
They don't understand.

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:40.614 align:middle line:84%
And it would take
too much of my energy

00:11:40.614 --> 00:11:42.530 align:middle line:84%
to try to explain something
that they couldn't

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:45.090 align:middle line:84%
understand or wouldn't
be willing to understand,

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:45.841 align:middle line:90%
so why bother.

00:11:45.841 --> 00:11:46.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:47.630 align:middle line:90%
No, I agree.

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:50.600 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: So this
has to go to people,

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:54.460 align:middle line:90%
like people who watch Gaiam.

00:11:54.460 --> 00:12:00.780 align:middle line:84%
Who are open, and receptive,
and want to hear what

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:04.260 align:middle line:84%
these beautiful
beings have to say.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:10.220 align:middle line:84%
They are so devoted to
humanity and so love us

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:14.350 align:middle line:84%
that they are there, even
though we're not conscious,

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:19.121 align:middle line:84%
because they really want
to be of assistance.

00:12:19.121 --> 00:12:20.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're
going to talk about,

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:23.900 align:middle line:84%
you had mentioned this before,
about where humanity is going,

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:25.786 align:middle line:90%
how we've evolved, and so forth.

00:12:25.786 --> 00:12:27.660 align:middle line:84%
That's the nature of
the line of questioning.

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:30.710 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do a live
channeling session here.

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And that is going to be the
line of questioning, on behalf

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:36.660 align:middle line:84%
of all of us, to learn
more about our nature

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:40.470 align:middle line:84%
as human beings and as
spirits and matter together.

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:42.880 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd like to
do is, we're going

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.449 align:middle line:84%
to let Joan take a minute
or two to get into her state

00:12:46.449 --> 00:12:47.740 align:middle line:90%
and let the being come through.

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:49.867 align:middle line:84%
We don't know
exactly who it'll be.

00:12:49.867 --> 00:12:51.950 align:middle line:84%
It'll be a surprise for
all of us, including Joan.

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:54.120 align:middle line:84%
So we'll allow a minute
or two for that to happen.

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.285 align:middle line:84%
And then we will be
back in just a moment.

00:12:56.285 --> 00:13:00.260 align:middle line:90%


00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.070 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Greetings.

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:02.910 align:middle line:90%
It is I, Metatron.

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:06.160 align:middle line:90%


00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:12.120 align:middle line:84%
I come to you at this
time as the overseer

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:16.540 align:middle line:84%
of all realms of creation
that are related to form.

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:19.160 align:middle line:90%


00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:29.190 align:middle line:84%
It is my duty to manage the
energies of all realms of form

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:36.880 align:middle line:84%
at these times, to promote a
transformation and an ascension

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:44.690 align:middle line:84%
not only of consciousness but
of the body, and the earth,

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:54.330 align:middle line:84%
and form itself-- to accelerate
that form into a more

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:59.560 align:middle line:84%
refined, energetic
configuration.

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:06.690 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning,
the creation of form

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:13.030 align:middle line:84%
was created to exemplify
the divine image,

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:16.790 align:middle line:90%
the plan for all creation.

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:27.510 align:middle line:84%
But with the expertise of
many creators, creator gods,

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:34.650 align:middle line:84%
to bring it into a form
that expressed individuality

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:42.525 align:middle line:84%
of many beings who only knew
themselves as part of the all

00:14:42.525 --> 00:14:48.770 align:middle line:84%
that is, as part of a
collective consciousness.

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:54.180 align:middle line:84%
So when it was decided
by prime creator

00:14:54.180 --> 00:15:00.560 align:middle line:84%
to begin to expand
creation and include

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:06.170 align:middle line:84%
this individualized
expression in denser forms,

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:13.040 align:middle line:84%
however still maintaining
that higher refined frequency

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:22.430 align:middle line:84%
of the nature of spirit to
be present while experiencing

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:23.013 align:middle line:90%
individuality.

00:15:23.013 --> 00:15:26.120 align:middle line:90%


00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:35.530 align:middle line:84%
So this is why many realms, many
galaxies, many universes that

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:41.210 align:middle line:84%
have form were
created, and grew,

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:44.840 align:middle line:84%
and expanded
throughout creation.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:52.070 align:middle line:90%


00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Should I ask
a question at this time,

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:56.590 align:middle line:90%
or would you like to continue?

00:15:56.590 --> 00:16:00.510 align:middle line:90%


00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:04.490 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: I would like to
continue here for a little bit

00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:13.570 align:middle line:84%
longer to engage you in
a space where you begin

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:22.010 align:middle line:84%
to shift your perception of who
you are, each one of you, who

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:28.040 align:middle line:90%
you are as that divine essence.

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:35.820 align:middle line:84%
Experiencing life fully and
wholly from that perspective,

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:38.010 align:middle line:84%
as that individualized
expression.

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:40.680 align:middle line:90%


00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:48.640 align:middle line:84%
When humanity fall-- fell
on earth, planet Earth,

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:55.030 align:middle line:84%
it was a great,
devastating event.

00:16:55.030 --> 00:17:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And that separation was
magnified to such an extent

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:07.650 align:middle line:84%
individuals could not
see themselves as divine,

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:13.410 align:middle line:84%
could not see that they
were massive beings

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:16.520 align:middle line:90%
with great potential.

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:20.430 align:middle line:84%
They could only see and
experience their separation.

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:23.710 align:middle line:90%


00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:29.710 align:middle line:84%
We have come, in these times
of change, for many of you

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:34.440 align:middle line:84%
have begun to alter the
patterning of the energetics

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:40.260 align:middle line:84%
of the earth and receive
the guidance, the light that

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:47.000 align:middle line:84%
comes from the godhead,
to begin to shift

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:54.986 align:middle line:84%
those old paradigms of rigid
fear, separation, unworthiness,

00:17:54.986 --> 00:17:55.485 align:middle line:90%
survival.

00:17:55.485 --> 00:17:58.320 align:middle line:90%


00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:03.010 align:middle line:84%
As you have accepted the light
and have begun to see yourself

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:12.350 align:middle line:84%
differently from the perspective
of a more divine, vaster

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:19.980 align:middle line:84%
expression, many things have
been altered and changed.

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:25.320 align:middle line:84%
This must continue,
dear ones, in order

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:31.500 align:middle line:84%
for this full ascension
process to occur.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:36.230 align:middle line:84%
The process is not just
your conscious awareness

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:37.590 align:middle line:90%
that's involved.

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:44.090 align:middle line:84%
It is all of the physical
realms of creation.

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And this takes a being
embodied in a body

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:56.470 align:middle line:84%
to bring about these
changes, for it

00:18:56.470 --> 00:19:01.500 align:middle line:84%
is the soul spirit,
embodied in a body,

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:07.210 align:middle line:84%
that will make that shift
at a physical level.

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:11.140 align:middle line:84%
Archangels, masters,
lords of light,

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:16.170 align:middle line:90%
creator gods cannot do this.

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:23.020 align:middle line:84%
It is you who are in possession
of a physical vehicle that

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:29.010 align:middle line:84%
will shift that frequency
range of the vehicle itself

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:33.610 align:middle line:84%
and bring about
this transformation.

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:36.497 align:middle line:90%
Now I will take your questions.

00:19:36.497 --> 00:19:37.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:39.410 align:middle line:84%
That was beautifully
put and you already

00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:41.700 align:middle line:84%
answered the first three,
as a matter of fact.

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:45.260 align:middle line:84%
But I would like to
backtrack just a little bit.

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:49.000 align:middle line:84%
The nature of the fall of human
consciousness, this bringing

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.570 align:middle line:84%
together of spirit and
matter that occurred,

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:55.810 align:middle line:84%
what was chiefly responsible
for the separation of spirit

00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:59.410 align:middle line:84%
and matter that created
this great separation

00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:03.310 align:middle line:84%
and this possibility for
us to fall into fear,

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:07.650 align:middle line:84%
to succumb to outside, even
manipulations, and so forth,

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:11.670 align:middle line:84%
because we weren't
whole any longer?

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:18.440 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: It did not happen
in a day, a year, a month,

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.960 align:middle line:90%
100 years.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:29.080 align:middle line:84%
It took billions of years for
that final cataclysm to occur.

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:33.140 align:middle line:84%
There were many
experiments as beings

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:41.290 align:middle line:84%
took form, very elevated
beings, 12th dimensional beings

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:47.470 align:middle line:84%
of light, who took form
to experience themselves

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:51.430 align:middle line:84%
not as separate but as
individual expressions,

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:54.813 align:middle line:84%
creating various
life experiences.

00:20:54.813 --> 00:20:57.970 align:middle line:90%


00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:01.760 align:middle line:84%
There were also
many creator gods

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:05.970 align:middle line:84%
who experimented with
the energetics that

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:12.130 align:middle line:90%
were now in play to create form.

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:19.730 align:middle line:84%
At first, Earth was a gaseous,
beautiful configuration

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:26.680 align:middle line:84%
of various light frequencies
where these elevated beings

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:30.590 align:middle line:84%
could come and
express themselves.

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:37.110 align:middle line:84%
And then it began to
take on denser forms.

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:41.380 align:middle line:84%
Not in the denseness that
you are familiar with today,

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:45.110 align:middle line:90%
but denser forms.

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And as they experimented with
these-- creating these denser

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:57.240 align:middle line:84%
forms, their initial
purpose in this

00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:04.940 align:middle line:84%
was to see how dense they
could create form energetically

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:10.190 align:middle line:84%
and still maintain that
12th dimensional matrix

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:12.480 align:middle line:90%
or consciousness.

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:16.100 align:middle line:84%
So that many beings
from the far reaches

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:20.710 align:middle line:84%
of creation, that had never
experienced themselves separate

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:28.960 align:middle line:84%
from, or as unique, could
come and experience themselves

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:31.855 align:middle line:84%
as individual expressions
of the divine.

00:22:31.855 --> 00:22:34.720 align:middle line:90%


00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:43.030 align:middle line:84%
So these creators had
a blueprint to follow.

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:48.390 align:middle line:84%
It was the original
blueprint for creation.

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:51.990 align:middle line:84%
And they strayed
from that blueprint

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:58.840 align:middle line:84%
as they created various
energetics to make denser form.

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:03.220 align:middle line:90%
Many experiments were done.

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And as they experimented,
as you can imagine,

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:15.370 align:middle line:84%
some of these experiments
were faulty-- didn't work.

00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:20.560 align:middle line:84%
So instead of
eliminating them totally,

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:23.370 align:middle line:90%
they pushed them aside.

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And what happened
was these forms

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:30.900 align:middle line:84%
that they had created that
had anomalies within them

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:38.360 align:middle line:84%
energetically were just floating
out in the realms of creation,

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:41.260 align:middle line:84%
especially in the
vicinity of those

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:44.820 align:middle line:90%
that had some semblance of form.

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:51.890 align:middle line:84%
And because they were
creative energetics,

00:23:51.890 --> 00:24:01.410 align:middle line:84%
these anomalies began to
mutate and begin to replicate.

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:03.920 align:middle line:90%


00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:07.245 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
contributed to the fall

00:24:07.245 --> 00:24:13.530 align:middle line:84%
in consciousness, because
the environment became

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:15.450 align:middle line:90%
contaminated.

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:19.100 align:middle line:90%
It became more dense.

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:22.220 align:middle line:84%
And these energies
of separation,

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:26.340 align:middle line:84%
rather than individuality,
began to replicate

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:28.700 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over again.

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:32.400 align:middle line:90%


00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:37.370 align:middle line:84%
Many of the archangels
were called forth

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:42.540 align:middle line:84%
to stop these mutations
and these replications

00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:45.820 align:middle line:84%
within these various
experiments that

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:49.350 align:middle line:90%
had gone wrong energetically.

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:52.370 align:middle line:84%
And they worked very
diligently because they

00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:58.760 align:middle line:84%
are masters of light
energy, masters of energy.

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:03.020 align:middle line:84%
Many creator gods, the
original creator gods,

00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:08.750 align:middle line:84%
came over hundreds
of thousands of years

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:15.800 align:middle line:84%
of what you perceive as time
to stop this replication

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:20.485 align:middle line:84%
because these anomalies
kept mutating as themselves

00:25:20.485 --> 00:25:21.360 align:middle line:90%
and then replicating.

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:25.910 align:middle line:90%


00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:33.010 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't until
2003 of your time

00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:37.740 align:middle line:84%
before those replications
were successfully stopped.

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:40.480 align:middle line:84%
So these anomalies
could not continue

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:44.570 align:middle line:90%
to replicate like themselves.

00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And this was due
to many who were

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:54.400 align:middle line:84%
able to receive these higher
frequencies of light that

00:25:54.400 --> 00:26:00.060 align:middle line:84%
have been continually bombarding
your planet for a long time

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:02.040 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:07.620 align:middle line:84%
So when this
replication was ceased,

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:16.320 align:middle line:84%
many changes could occur,
and are occurring, now

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:22.050 align:middle line:84%
where people,
beings, humans, also

00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:27.080 align:middle line:84%
beings from other
planetary systems,

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:33.580 align:middle line:84%
began to see the beauty
of their soul spirit.

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:37.830 align:middle line:84%
Began to see the
complexities of themselves,

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:45.020 align:middle line:84%
the layeredness of their
energetic configuration.

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And began to open and
flower their consciousness.

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:54.936 align:middle line:90%
This is what is occurring now.

00:26:54.936 --> 00:27:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And it is a beautiful
process to observe

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:05.170 align:middle line:84%
as we stand to
support, and to guide,

00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:10.070 align:middle line:84%
and to teach in
these coming times.

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:14.180 align:middle line:84%
Here again, you
have experienced--

00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:19.420 align:middle line:84%
the worlds of form have
experienced themselves

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:29.790 align:middle line:84%
in separation, in fear,
in less than, unable to.

00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And they don't recognize
themselves as the creators

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:34.870 align:middle line:90%
that they are.

00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:40.350 align:middle line:84%
They don't recognize the
beauty of who they are.

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:44.140 align:middle line:84%
But they are beginning
to open and to see

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:47.566 align:middle line:84%
that there's more here
than they realized.

00:27:47.566 --> 00:27:50.320 align:middle line:90%


00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And as this process occurs, it
stimulates others to follow.

00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:02.450 align:middle line:90%


00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:10.100 align:middle line:84%
In these times of
denseness and separation,

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:14.100 align:middle line:84%
humanity has experienced
every configuration

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:20.240 align:middle line:84%
they could possibly
create in that separation.

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:25.010 align:middle line:84%
It is like a rubber band that
has been pulled and extended

00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:27.440 align:middle line:90%
to their limits.

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:32.900 align:middle line:84%
They have experienced themselves
in great fear, in separation,

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:37.620 align:middle line:84%
in unworthiness, fearful
of their survival--

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:41.020 align:middle line:90%
in every possible way.

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And now they are letting go so
the band begins to contract.

00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:57.080 align:middle line:84%
And they are seeing
themselves totally different.

00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:03.386 align:middle line:84%
They are seeing themselves
more in the configuration

00:29:03.386 --> 00:29:07.760 align:middle line:90%
of who they were created to be.

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:12.860 align:middle line:84%
It is a beautiful event that
is transpiring on your planet.

00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:15.055 align:middle line:90%


00:29:15.055 --> 00:29:16.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What a
beautiful explanation.

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:18.490 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Metatron.

00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:22.100 align:middle line:84%
I would like to also
know-- this process you

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:26.680 align:middle line:84%
talk about it of this-- the
creative process can be messy,

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:28.440 align:middle line:84%
as you just spoke
about, especially

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:31.440 align:middle line:84%
distorted through
vast amounts of time.

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.890 align:middle line:84%
Is this a process
that also occurs

00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:38.670 align:middle line:84%
in other universes, solar
systems, planetary systems

00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:39.755 align:middle line:90%
and so forth?

00:29:39.755 --> 00:29:46.080 align:middle line:84%
Or is there something unique
to what happened here on Earth?

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:50.170 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: Unique in
that Earth is unique.

00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:51.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why so?

00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:54.080 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: Earth is
a Christed planet.

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:55.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What does that mean?

00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:59.260 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: Now, yes,
I'm glad you said that.

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:03.560 align:middle line:84%
Does not relate to
a being, a person.

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:08.136 align:middle line:90%
Christed means anointed.

00:30:08.136 --> 00:30:15.620 align:middle line:84%
A Christed being, as
is all humans in form

00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:17.430 align:middle line:90%
are Christed beings.

00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:24.460 align:middle line:84%
They are the image of the
wholeness of the divine,

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:31.150 align:middle line:84%
of the all that is, as is
that planet, as Earth is.

00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:38.560 align:middle line:10%
It was created
billions of years ago

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:45.330 align:middle line:10%
in a 12th dimensional matrix,
very high frequency matrix,

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:51.930 align:middle line:10%
to exemplify the original
template for creation

00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:54.340 align:middle line:10%
in its perfection.

00:30:54.340 --> 00:31:00.840 align:middle line:84%
But yet with the allowances made
for individualized expression

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:03.860 align:middle line:90%
of the soul spirit.

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:09.020 align:middle line:84%
It was created because
many other worlds of form,

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:12.370 align:middle line:84%
many other galaxies,
universes, had

00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:21.100 align:middle line:84%
begun to stray greatly from
that original blueprint

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:26.370 align:middle line:84%
or matrix, energetic
matrix of the original plan

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:28.740 align:middle line:84%
of the expansion of
creation, whether it

00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:32.290 align:middle line:90%
be physical or nonphysical.

00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:38.630 align:middle line:84%
So there were many solar
systems that strayed.

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:42.070 align:middle line:84%
And the solar system of
which Earth is a part

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:47.420 align:middle line:90%
was a huge factor in that.

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:51.740 align:middle line:84%
In this sector of the universe--
there are many universes,

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:54.660 align:middle line:84%
but in this sector
of the universe that

00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:59.670 align:middle line:84%
is composed of many galaxies
and many, many solar systems,

00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:06.710 align:middle line:84%
Earth was created to exemplify
that original template,

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:12.540 align:middle line:84%
the original blueprint
for expansion of creation

00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:19.950 align:middle line:84%
in the perfection in which it
stemmed from prime creator.

00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:24.490 align:middle line:84%
So it reflected to
within the solar system

00:32:24.490 --> 00:32:30.290 align:middle line:84%
and within the galaxy,
and in all galaxies

00:32:30.290 --> 00:32:33.980 align:middle line:90%
in this sector of the universe.

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:37.140 align:middle line:84%
It reflected that
image that they

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:41.440 align:middle line:84%
had lost because of the
anomalies they created.

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And because they
could no longer see

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:50.010 align:middle line:84%
the perfection of who they were,
and the blueprint that they

00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:53.330 align:middle line:84%
were to follow for
their creation.

00:32:53.330 --> 00:33:00.720 align:middle line:84%
So this was a great impetus
for these planetary systems

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:04.480 align:middle line:84%
to come back into their
wholeness of expression

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:09.670 align:middle line:84%
and creation, which
many of them did.

00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:16.570 align:middle line:84%
And it was of a grand
escalation that took place

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:20.480 align:middle line:84%
within various solar
systems as Earth continually

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:24.340 align:middle line:90%
reflected that image.

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And when the earth began
to create more density,

00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:38.100 align:middle line:84%
with the intention of expressing
that through the density,

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:42.570 align:middle line:84%
then anomalies were
created on Earth.

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And gradually, very
gradually, the consciousness,

00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:53.130 align:middle line:84%
the dimensions that were
available began to decline.

00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And as it declined, the
light and the perfection

00:33:56.950 --> 00:34:02.450 align:middle line:84%
that was once emanated
could not be maintained.

00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:07.020 align:middle line:84%
So many beings from these
other planetary systems,

00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:11.969 align:middle line:84%
who had benefited greatly
from Earth as the Christed

00:34:11.969 --> 00:34:20.449 align:middle line:84%
reflection, would come
to try to show a better

00:34:20.449 --> 00:34:27.310 align:middle line:84%
way, to show some of these
creators who were manipulating

00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:34.510 align:middle line:84%
various energetics of the
Earth to create this density.

00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:38.429 align:middle line:84%
And for a while they
were successful.

00:34:38.429 --> 00:34:42.370 align:middle line:84%
But this could
not be maintained.

00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:49.360 align:middle line:84%
So when it declined to
lower than an 8th dimension,

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:55.830 align:middle line:84%
these beings left, because it
was no longer energetically

00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:59.400 align:middle line:90%
compatible for them to stay.

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And the decline continued until
the time that those on Earth

00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:17.780 align:middle line:84%
were about to destroy that
beautiful Christed planet,

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:23.140 align:middle line:84%
and it would cease to exist,
it would be no longer.

00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:24.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: When was that?

00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:28.065 align:middle line:84%
At what point in our
history was that?

00:35:28.065 --> 00:35:30.390 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: That was about
a billion years ago

00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:33.720 align:middle line:90%
in what you perceive of time.

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:38.700 align:middle line:84%
Sanat Kumara, Lord Sanat
Kumara, came forward

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:46.050 align:middle line:84%
and petitioned the vast realms
of creation, prime creator,

00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:52.120 align:middle line:84%
to not allow this total
disintegration of what

00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:59.170 align:middle line:84%
had originally been created,
because it would go into just

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:04.100 align:middle line:84%
vast particles to
be recycled, again

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:07.020 align:middle line:90%
into some other creative form.

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:09.910 align:middle line:90%


00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:17.190 align:middle line:84%
He said one of the missing links
was this element of love which

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:21.290 align:middle line:84%
brings about a unity
within creation,

00:36:21.290 --> 00:36:26.010 align:middle line:84%
that he would hold that
frequency range for Earth

00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:35.490 align:middle line:84%
until Earth could hold it
for themselves, which he did.

00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And he held it for hundreds
of thousands and millions

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:42.660 align:middle line:90%
of years.

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:46.280 align:middle line:84%
At that time, to prevent
the total disintegration,

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:51.290 align:middle line:84%
because so many
earth energies had

00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:59.990 align:middle line:84%
been part of this energetic
decline, the realms of form

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:09.160 align:middle line:84%
were so deteriorated that a new
matrix had to be put in place.

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:13.440 align:middle line:84%
And that matrix, it was decided,
was a third dimensional matrix.

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And there were many
downsides to this.

00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:20.130 align:middle line:84%
It would save the
denseness of the planet

00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:27.880 align:middle line:84%
where it could be maintained
energetically and physically,

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:32.800 align:middle line:84%
but it was so dense
it would take millions

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:40.620 align:middle line:84%
of years for humanity
to extricate themselves

00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:50.850 align:middle line:84%
from that dense separation
fear based matrix.

00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:53.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think many people
listening to your words

00:37:53.130 --> 00:37:57.170 align:middle line:90%
relate very strongly to that.

00:37:57.170 --> 00:37:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes it
feels-- and I would

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:02.310 align:middle line:84%
like you to speak to the
individual souls listening

00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:06.220 align:middle line:84%
to this, on that level, because
many times these days people

00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:07.660 align:middle line:90%
will say, that's it.

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:09.330 align:middle line:90%
This is my final incarnation.

00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:10.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going back.

00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:13.310 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
the nature of what

00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:15.410 align:middle line:84%
happens when a soul has
committed through such

00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:18.930 align:middle line:84%
a process and then
becomes, essentially,

00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:22.830 align:middle line:84%
trapped in that process through
a lowering of frequencies.

00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And the process of
moving ourselves back,

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:28.040 align:middle line:84%
as you said in the beginning,
we're beginning to do that--

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:30.130 align:middle line:84%
through love and
allowing our awareness

00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:33.420 align:middle line:84%
to expand into lighter realms
of knowledge, it's starting.

00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:35.310 align:middle line:84%
But can you talk to
individual souls?

00:38:35.310 --> 00:38:36.990 align:middle line:90%
Many are depressed.

00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:40.040 align:middle line:84%
There are some who leave
their bodies intentionally.

00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:45.150 align:middle line:84%
Many who are dying earlier than
usual right now, at young ages,

00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:48.820 align:middle line:90%
because it's so hard to handle.

00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:52.160 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: Yes, the shifts
are tremendous that

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:55.580 align:middle line:84%
are taking place, on a
physical level as well

00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:56.870 align:middle line:90%
as an energetic level.

00:38:56.870 --> 00:39:02.740 align:middle line:84%
And it brings about a memory
in these beautiful beings who

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:05.720 align:middle line:84%
have been here
since the beginning.

00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:06.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:09.440 align:middle line:84%
People need to respect
themselves for this journey.

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:14.650 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: And they
know what it was prior.

00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:22.620 align:middle line:84%
And they know how they were
caught in the denseness

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:26.910 align:middle line:84%
and how grief stricken
they have been.

00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:30.150 align:middle line:84%
Because there is such
variances in the energetics

00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:35.010 align:middle line:84%
right now, as they are
realigning, coming more

00:39:35.010 --> 00:39:40.290 align:middle line:84%
into a more functional
fifth dimensional state,

00:39:40.290 --> 00:39:51.140 align:middle line:84%
that memory of the trauma and
the devastation that took place

00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:55.810 align:middle line:84%
is ignited in many
of these beings.

00:39:55.810 --> 00:39:59.590 align:middle line:90%
And they say, that's it.

00:39:59.590 --> 00:40:01.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm done.

00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:05.340 align:middle line:90%
I cannot do this again.

00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:13.370 align:middle line:84%
And the memory and the anguish
is very real in their space.

00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:16.890 align:middle line:84%
Even though it may look
like, on the surface,

00:40:16.890 --> 00:40:24.800 align:middle line:84%
that things are aligning
in the same configuration,

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:28.690 align:middle line:90%
know that they are not.

00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:32.190 align:middle line:90%
There is a vast difference here.

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:35.720 align:middle line:84%
And that difference
is, first of all,

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:39.720 align:middle line:84%
the amount of light
frequencies that are available

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:43.490 align:middle line:84%
and the more refined nature
of those frequencies.

00:40:43.490 --> 00:40:49.770 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, the number of beings
embodied, the unnamed masters

00:40:49.770 --> 00:40:54.610 align:middle line:84%
that walk the Earth
at this time, who

00:40:54.610 --> 00:40:58.350 align:middle line:84%
are able to maintain
a consciousness

00:40:58.350 --> 00:41:03.350 align:middle line:84%
of their individuality at a
much different level-- they

00:41:03.350 --> 00:41:04.840 align:middle line:90%
are making the difference.

00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:10.710 align:middle line:84%
They are holding, very stablely,
those higher frequencies

00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:14.350 align:middle line:84%
so that they can
grow and expand.

00:41:14.350 --> 00:41:20.150 align:middle line:84%
Also, since these mutations
have been altered and stopped,

00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:22.505 align:middle line:90%
the decline cannot occur.

00:41:22.505 --> 00:41:25.710 align:middle line:90%


00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:30.000 align:middle line:84%
So even though on the
surface it may feel the same

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:36.420 align:middle line:84%
and it may look the
same, it is not the same.

00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:39.750 align:middle line:84%
These beings who
feel like that, that

00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:45.950 align:middle line:84%
are in the vast majority
of beings who embodied

00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:59.300 align:middle line:84%
through 19-- your 1970s
were here before then.

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:01.150 align:middle line:90%
They're very courageous beings.

00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:07.670 align:middle line:84%
They had an option,
early on in the decline

00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:14.220 align:middle line:84%
of this planet, when it began to
fall beneath eighth dimension.

00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:15.690 align:middle line:90%
And many vacated.

00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:16.535 align:middle line:90%
Many left.

00:42:16.535 --> 00:42:19.040 align:middle line:90%


00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:25.780 align:middle line:84%
They were courageous and said
no, I can make a difference.

00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:28.090 align:middle line:90%
I will ride this out.

00:42:28.090 --> 00:42:31.920 align:middle line:90%
And they did, but to no avail.

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:33.880 align:middle line:90%
It fell.

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:41.220 align:middle line:84%
So lifetime after lifetime
they came back again

00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:45.430 align:middle line:90%
because they felt they failed.

00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:48.055 align:middle line:84%
And they had to
continue because that

00:42:48.055 --> 00:42:53.920 align:middle line:84%
is the intention, the
vow that they made,

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:55.500 align:middle line:84%
that they would
make a difference.

00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:59.300 align:middle line:84%
So every embodiment
keeps them coming back

00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:03.360 align:middle line:84%
because there is a part
of their consciousness

00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:07.060 align:middle line:90%
that believes they failed.

00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:11.695 align:middle line:84%
I am here to tell
you, you did not fail.

00:43:11.695 --> 00:43:15.310 align:middle line:90%


00:43:15.310 --> 00:43:19.050 align:middle line:84%
And every lifetime that
you have come back,

00:43:19.050 --> 00:43:24.330 align:middle line:84%
even though it has been
what you would judge

00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:32.620 align:middle line:84%
as a horrific lifetime,
there was a presence of love,

00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:38.540 align:middle line:84%
a presence of light that you
held in that incarnation that

00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:46.040 align:middle line:84%
made a difference as does this
one that you are in right now.

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:50.040 align:middle line:90%


00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:53.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When you're talking
about that remembrance,

00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:59.010 align:middle line:84%
one of the ways that I witnessed
humanity and their remembrance

00:43:59.010 --> 00:44:03.040 align:middle line:84%
is that it brings
tears to our eyes

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:08.660 align:middle line:84%
when we see moments of extreme
beauty, compassion, love,

00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:10.100 align:middle line:90%
beauty of any kind.

00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:12.270 align:middle line:84%
There is something
about it that transcends

00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:14.320 align:middle line:90%
our daily experience.

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:16.810 align:middle line:84%
That-- and I mean
genuine, authentic beauty

00:44:16.810 --> 00:44:20.160 align:middle line:84%
whether it's on an
emotional, behavioral level,

00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:23.030 align:middle line:90%
a physical level, a sound level.

00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:27.650 align:middle line:84%
It seems as though that is the
indicator of our remembrance.

00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:28.520 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Yes.

00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:31.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The tears that happen.

00:44:31.130 --> 00:44:33.940 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: And the
remembrance of the beauty.

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:36.400 align:middle line:84%
And you may equate that
with physical beauty,

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:45.460 align:middle line:84%
but there is a beauty beyond
that, that the soul remembers.

00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:47.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You hear an
angelic voice, for example,

00:44:47.970 --> 00:44:51.170 align:middle line:84%
someone with an angelic voice,
and everyone bursts into tears.

00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:53.600 align:middle line:84%
They just-- they don't
know where it comes from.

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:55.020 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: Because
of the frequency

00:44:55.020 --> 00:45:01.160 align:middle line:84%
range that that being has
been able to exemplify.

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:06.220 align:middle line:84%
And that remembrance
is triggered.

00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:10.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It seems that the
whole aspect you talked about,

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:15.090 align:middle line:84%
about fear that has overrun
the planet now for however

00:45:15.090 --> 00:45:17.670 align:middle line:84%
long, hundreds of thousands,
millions of years,

00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:20.560 align:middle line:84%
however long that has been--
throughout the earlier

00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:27.320 align:middle line:84%
incarnations, in Lemuria,
Mu, Atlantis, and so forth,

00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:33.410 align:middle line:84%
and into Egypt and then on now
into modern history-- at what

00:45:33.410 --> 00:45:36.090 align:middle line:84%
point did the fear really
start taking control of us

00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:39.580 align:middle line:84%
to where we couldn't
find ourselves anymore?

00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And is that the part,
now, that is going away

00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:45.550 align:middle line:84%
because-- are you saying
that we can't be manipulated

00:45:45.550 --> 00:45:49.490 align:middle line:84%
from other realms and within in
the same way, now, since 2003?

00:45:49.490 --> 00:45:52.110 align:middle line:90%
Or what?

00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:53.360 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Correct.

00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:58.340 align:middle line:84%
Because those
mutations have stopped.

00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:00.690 align:middle line:84%
They still are present,
so you're still

00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:06.190 align:middle line:84%
seeing such variances
in the acting

00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:12.210 align:middle line:84%
out of certain
dimensional realms now.

00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:16.840 align:middle line:84%
But the anomalies
themselves cannot replicate.

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:23.380 align:middle line:84%
So, that fear, that separation,
that survival pattern

00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:25.544 align:middle line:90%
eventually will be eliminated.

00:46:25.544 --> 00:46:27.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that
will be a good day.

00:46:27.210 --> 00:46:29.685 align:middle line:84%
Because right now,
everything that's in our view

00:46:29.685 --> 00:46:33.820 align:middle line:84%
is-- it almost seems like it's
placed there to propagate fear.

00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:34.710 align:middle line:90%
There are exceptions.

00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:37.800 align:middle line:84%
There are beautiful beings and
there are beautiful sources

00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:40.240 align:middle line:84%
of music, literature,
information.

00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:43.930 align:middle line:84%
But in the common sense,
for the masses of people,

00:46:43.930 --> 00:46:49.190 align:middle line:84%
in mass media in particular,
it seems like the whole point

00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:52.782 align:middle line:84%
is to continue to
reinforce fear.

00:46:52.782 --> 00:46:53.610 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Yes.

00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:59.140 align:middle line:84%
So it's important that those
of you who are waking up,

00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:07.300 align:middle line:84%
who are awake, begin to
look around and notice

00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:12.720 align:middle line:84%
what is occurring that
contributes to this ascension

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:14.130 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:47:14.130 --> 00:47:20.740 align:middle line:84%
Not from the glamorization of
this old negative patterning

00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:26.260 align:middle line:84%
that is in your media, in
the forefront of your media.

00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:31.550 align:middle line:84%
You need to notice,
in your everyday life,

00:47:31.550 --> 00:47:35.650 align:middle line:84%
your interactions, how
you made a difference.

00:47:35.650 --> 00:47:42.350 align:middle line:84%
If it is so as simple
as being in a store,

00:47:42.350 --> 00:47:48.390 align:middle line:84%
saying to the attendant,
"Have a nice day.

00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:50.430 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for helping me."

00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:54.380 align:middle line:84%
And you made a shift
in that person's life

00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:59.670 align:middle line:84%
because the person before
you argued with them

00:47:59.670 --> 00:48:03.360 align:middle line:90%
or told them they were stupid.

00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:05.980 align:middle line:90%
And you changed that.

00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:10.030 align:middle line:84%
It's important for you
to notice these things.

00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:14.670 align:middle line:84%
Notice how when you
are in groups and you

00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:21.850 align:middle line:84%
gather with like-minded
people, the benefit of that.

00:48:21.850 --> 00:48:27.600 align:middle line:84%
Notice and draw
attention to things

00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:32.130 align:middle line:84%
that are not very
well publicized

00:48:32.130 --> 00:48:39.750 align:middle line:84%
about people who are gathering
together to help others,

00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:48.880 align:middle line:84%
to change a system
that is so dense.

00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:52.920 align:middle line:84%
Notice these things
and tell others.

00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:58.630 align:middle line:84%
For it's in noticing them that
you expand and magnify them.

00:48:58.630 --> 00:49:02.830 align:middle line:84%
If you only focus
on what is wrong,

00:49:02.830 --> 00:49:06.560 align:middle line:84%
you will never see
the beautiful things

00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:09.760 align:middle line:90%
that are being created now.

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:12.990 align:middle line:90%
And you can then build on those.

00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:17.740 align:middle line:84%
Because as you tell others, "Did
you see what this group did?

00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:21.360 align:middle line:90%
We can do this over here."

00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to create with
these higher frequencies

00:49:26.350 --> 00:49:32.610 align:middle line:84%
of light, altering
the energetics,

00:49:32.610 --> 00:49:39.050 align:middle line:84%
sustaining the energetics
of fifth dimension

00:49:39.050 --> 00:49:42.750 align:middle line:90%
so it can be more present.

00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:46.160 align:middle line:90%
This is a beautiful dimension.

00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:49.770 align:middle line:84%
Fifth dimension is such
a beautiful dimension

00:49:49.770 --> 00:49:55.030 align:middle line:84%
of energetics, of
possibilities for creation.

00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:58.440 align:middle line:84%
You have to notice those
possibilities in order

00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:00.660 align:middle line:90%
to use them.

00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:04.090 align:middle line:84%
But there's multiples
upon multiples

00:50:04.090 --> 00:50:07.530 align:middle line:90%
of avenues to create right now.

00:50:07.530 --> 00:50:10.432 align:middle line:90%
Time becomes more circular.

00:50:10.432 --> 00:50:14.180 align:middle line:90%
It is no longer linear.

00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:17.790 align:middle line:84%
You are more in
the present moment.

00:50:17.790 --> 00:50:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And this is the only place
you can create, beloved.

00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:25.320 align:middle line:84%
You can't create from an
event that happened before.

00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:27.690 align:middle line:90%
It's already done.

00:50:27.690 --> 00:50:34.510 align:middle line:84%
Create from the now and
you alter your future.

00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:40.760 align:middle line:84%
But you must notice what
it is you are creating

00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:46.315 align:middle line:84%
and how you're creating it, and
how you share it and expand it.

00:50:46.315 --> 00:50:49.280 align:middle line:90%


00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:51.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I would
like to now talk

00:50:51.630 --> 00:50:55.290 align:middle line:84%
about everything you've
mentioned, condensing it down

00:50:55.290 --> 00:50:58.330 align:middle line:84%
into our physical and
emotional reality.

00:50:58.330 --> 00:51:02.230 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems as though
there are neurological changes

00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:06.090 align:middle line:84%
that are taking place within our
brains and within our bodies.

00:51:06.090 --> 00:51:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you can share, because
some people think they're sick

00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:12.470 align:middle line:84%
or they're ill, something
terrible is going on.

00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:15.370 align:middle line:84%
Other people are finding,
as this one here,

00:51:15.370 --> 00:51:18.330 align:middle line:84%
that their bodies are
now relieved of pain.

00:51:18.330 --> 00:51:20.960 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's experiencing
it differently.

00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:23.970 align:middle line:84%
So can you talk about
what to be aware

00:51:23.970 --> 00:51:28.520 align:middle line:84%
of in our neurological changes
and our emotional changes?

00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:31.920 align:middle line:84%
And then what we can do with
the physical bodies to help

00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:35.310 align:middle line:84%
prepare ourselves for more
refinement on this level.

00:51:35.310 --> 00:51:38.300 align:middle line:90%


00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:44.600 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: When Earth fell, and
this third dimensional matrix

00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:51.790 align:middle line:84%
encased it, there were
many repercussions of that,

00:51:51.790 --> 00:51:56.970 align:middle line:84%
not only to the Earth itself
in this dense configuration,

00:51:56.970 --> 00:52:00.390 align:middle line:90%
but to the human body.

00:52:00.390 --> 00:52:07.150 align:middle line:84%
Everything no longer
functioned as a unit.

00:52:07.150 --> 00:52:14.240 align:middle line:84%
The brain, the neurological
system, became fragmented,

00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:17.800 align:middle line:90%
and only parts of it functioned.

00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:20.960 align:middle line:84%
The DNA strands
were disconnected.

00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:26.490 align:middle line:84%
Only two function that
related to being in a body

00:52:26.490 --> 00:52:30.680 align:middle line:84%
through replication
or regeneration

00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:32.860 align:middle line:90%
of that physical body.

00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:36.510 align:middle line:84%
All the other ones
were not viable.

00:52:36.510 --> 00:52:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And some of your scientists
even today say it's junk DNA.

00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:45.900 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it is not.

00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:50.770 align:middle line:84%
Your mental body, your
emotional body, was separated.

00:52:50.770 --> 00:52:58.130 align:middle line:84%
Do you know, as creators
in form, the way you create

00:52:58.130 --> 00:53:02.490 align:middle line:84%
is through thought coupled
with an emotion that

00:53:02.490 --> 00:53:04.800 align:middle line:90%
creates the reality?

00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:10.560 align:middle line:84%
If those two bodies are
operating in fear and density,

00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:16.710 align:middle line:84%
you cannot create
as a Christed being.

00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:21.460 align:middle line:84%
So all of these things, as
more refined light frequencies

00:53:21.460 --> 00:53:25.450 align:middle line:84%
are available, as more
beings are awakening,

00:53:25.450 --> 00:53:30.910 align:middle line:84%
these things are beginning
to come back into that unity.

00:53:30.910 --> 00:53:35.240 align:middle line:84%
So unity consciousness
does not--

00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:40.370 align:middle line:84%
it is a far reaching
unity, a unification that

00:53:40.370 --> 00:53:44.810 align:middle line:84%
has to be taken in the
body, in the physicality,

00:53:44.810 --> 00:53:46.990 align:middle line:90%
at a cellular level.

00:53:46.990 --> 00:53:51.620 align:middle line:84%
So as the brain, the
neurological system,

00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:56.140 align:middle line:84%
begins to become more unified
and draw from the higher

00:53:56.140 --> 00:53:59.630 align:middle line:84%
realms of creation, the
mind of the all that

00:53:59.630 --> 00:54:04.280 align:middle line:84%
is, that neurological
system has to come online

00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:12.850 align:middle line:84%
in a new configuration to bring
in those thoughts and feelings

00:54:12.850 --> 00:54:15.200 align:middle line:90%
into the body.

00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And the being, the human, begins
to learn to use their thoughts

00:54:21.570 --> 00:54:26.210 align:middle line:84%
and their emotions differently
from a much different level,

00:54:26.210 --> 00:54:30.070 align:middle line:84%
rather than that dense,
lower, fear-based level.

00:54:30.070 --> 00:54:39.740 align:middle line:84%
They begin to operate from
happiness, from confidence,

00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:42.710 align:middle line:90%
from I can instead of I can't.

00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:45.640 align:middle line:90%


00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:48.650 align:middle line:84%
So there's a whole
new level of thought

00:54:48.650 --> 00:54:50.120 align:middle line:90%
that begins to come online.

00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:58.610 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole new level of
emotions that get accessed.

00:54:58.610 --> 00:55:05.430 align:middle line:84%
When that happens, the body is
still a third dimensional body,

00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:10.380 align:middle line:84%
and it has a difficult
time with these changes,

00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:15.520 align:middle line:84%
especially if they're
happening in rapid succession.

00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:19.020 align:middle line:84%
Because as people
awake, they become

00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:23.430 align:middle line:90%
very-- they're in a hurry.

00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:26.110 align:middle line:90%
I want it all and I want it now.

00:55:26.110 --> 00:55:30.440 align:middle line:84%
So they start to work
with their energetics.

00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:34.180 align:middle line:84%
And as they do, then that
has effect on the physical.

00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:37.210 align:middle line:84%
So as these parts
of the brain begin

00:55:37.210 --> 00:55:44.260 align:middle line:84%
to open and be stimulated by the
soul spirit of that individual,

00:55:44.260 --> 00:55:51.930 align:middle line:84%
sometimes the body as the
brain is being expanded

00:55:51.930 --> 00:55:55.790 align:middle line:84%
and these cavities within
the brain are activated,

00:55:55.790 --> 00:55:58.385 align:middle line:90%
they will feel ill.

00:55:58.385 --> 00:56:00.730 align:middle line:90%
They are not.

00:56:00.730 --> 00:56:04.010 align:middle line:84%
They will feel-- they
will have headaches,

00:56:04.010 --> 00:56:05.640 align:middle line:84%
either in the
front of their head

00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:12.310 align:middle line:84%
or in the back of their
head or above their ears.

00:56:12.310 --> 00:56:18.980 align:middle line:84%
They will feel
parts of their body

00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:23.860 align:middle line:84%
begin to give them trouble
because of this unification

00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:25.770 align:middle line:90%
that has to take place.

00:56:25.770 --> 00:56:32.930 align:middle line:84%
The whole chemical system
has to be realigned,

00:56:32.930 --> 00:56:35.420 align:middle line:90%
chemically reconfigured.

00:56:35.420 --> 00:56:39.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, it stands to
reason your body's going

00:56:39.020 --> 00:56:42.490 align:middle line:90%
to have a big challenge in this.

00:56:42.490 --> 00:56:47.010 align:middle line:84%
When you have to produce
a different chemical,

00:56:47.010 --> 00:56:50.300 align:middle line:84%
you have to produce
a different way

00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:54.260 align:middle line:90%
in which the cell functions.

00:56:54.260 --> 00:56:58.730 align:middle line:84%
So the digestive
system is compromised

00:56:58.730 --> 00:57:03.370 align:middle line:84%
because you can't
take all that in.

00:57:03.370 --> 00:57:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And you feel nauseous
because the digestive system

00:57:10.070 --> 00:57:16.980 align:middle line:84%
can't assimilate very
quickly these changes that

00:57:16.980 --> 00:57:18.810 align:middle line:84%
are occurring on
a cellular system.

00:57:18.810 --> 00:57:25.970 align:middle line:84%
But I assure you that
if you bring in light

00:57:25.970 --> 00:57:28.840 align:middle line:84%
and you send it to those
areas in the body that

00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:34.160 align:middle line:84%
are compromised, you don't
try to move too quickly,

00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:41.120 align:middle line:84%
you rest when you feel you
must rest, and most importantly

00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:46.310 align:middle line:84%
begin to see that all
of this has purpose

00:57:46.310 --> 00:57:50.660 align:middle line:84%
in the unification of
you at a physical level.

00:57:50.660 --> 00:57:55.440 align:middle line:84%
So that body, then, is upgraded
to a fifth dimensional level

00:57:55.440 --> 00:58:01.080 align:middle line:84%
that is far less dense
and operates in more unity

00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:05.913 align:middle line:84%
so that you have health,
well being, longevity.

00:58:05.913 --> 00:58:08.960 align:middle line:90%
And you know what else happens?

00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:17.630 align:middle line:84%
That birth-death configuration
of third dimension is altered

00:58:17.630 --> 00:58:23.070 align:middle line:84%
and the body does
not age as it once

00:58:23.070 --> 00:58:28.220 align:middle line:84%
did because of this
unification, this alteration

00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:32.590 align:middle line:84%
at a cellular and
a molecular level.

00:58:32.590 --> 00:58:37.530 align:middle line:84%
The neurological
system is a big part

00:58:37.530 --> 00:58:45.220 align:middle line:84%
of that, in that communication
between the all that is

00:58:45.220 --> 00:58:50.220 align:middle line:84%
and the body, and the amount
of energetic templates that

00:58:50.220 --> 00:58:55.490 align:middle line:84%
are transmitted to help
alter that configuration.

00:58:55.490 --> 00:59:02.790 align:middle line:84%
It can happen in ease if you
don't focus on the fear of oh

00:59:02.790 --> 00:59:05.195 align:middle line:84%
my gosh, what is
happening in my body.

00:59:05.195 --> 00:59:08.550 align:middle line:90%


00:59:08.550 --> 00:59:11.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I would think,
this building you're in,

00:59:11.850 --> 00:59:15.760 align:middle line:84%
this company here was
originally founded and based

00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:17.870 align:middle line:90%
in the practice of yoga.

00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:20.970 align:middle line:84%
And historically, I would
think that that's probably

00:59:20.970 --> 00:59:24.500 align:middle line:84%
a very good way to keep
the neurological, physical,

00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:27.640 align:middle line:84%
and emotional systems starting
to come into alignment.

00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:29.130 align:middle line:90%
Is that a good practice?

00:59:29.130 --> 00:59:30.080 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Absolutely.

00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:36.960 align:middle line:84%
The breath is an integral part
of this process, the oxygen

00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:40.330 align:middle line:90%
that is brought into the system.

00:59:40.330 --> 00:59:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And as it begins to
flow within the system,

00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:53.740 align:middle line:84%
it helps you to alter
the fluids in the body.

00:59:53.740 --> 01:00:00.340 align:middle line:84%
Through the oxygenation
that is present in the blood

01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:04.610 align:middle line:84%
you can add frequencies
of light that

01:00:04.610 --> 01:00:11.650 align:middle line:84%
begin to then flow
more energetically,

01:00:11.650 --> 01:00:15.850 align:middle line:84%
coherently throughout
the body and begin

01:00:15.850 --> 01:00:21.860 align:middle line:84%
to diminish that carbon base
so that the blood then flows

01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:27.220 align:middle line:84%
to the various organs,
to the glandular system,

01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:32.430 align:middle line:84%
and more efficiently begins
to make these changes.

01:00:32.430 --> 01:00:42.530 align:middle line:84%
So relaxation, breathing,
moving the body slowly but very

01:00:42.530 --> 01:00:45.850 align:middle line:84%
intentionally teaches
you many things.

01:00:45.850 --> 01:00:53.270 align:middle line:84%
It teaches you to focus
your thoughts, to be aware,

01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:59.420 align:middle line:84%
and in that focus you better
create your life experience

01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:02.840 align:middle line:84%
because you choose the
thought that you will think.

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:07.100 align:middle line:84%
You choose the feeling
that you adhere to it.

01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:10.900 align:middle line:84%
Yoga, through the breath,
through relaxation,

01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:17.410 align:middle line:84%
teaches you to focus
the mind and disengage

01:01:17.410 --> 01:01:20.840 align:middle line:84%
that rational part
that is continually

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:27.320 align:middle line:84%
chattering and
causing fragmentation.

01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:27.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

01:01:27.970 --> 01:01:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
traits of humanity

01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:34.260 align:middle line:84%
has been that we have had
it instilled into to us

01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:37.030 align:middle line:84%
that what's responsible
is to do our duty

01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:39.650 align:middle line:84%
and be responsible
citizens of this planet.

01:01:39.650 --> 01:01:43.670 align:middle line:84%
No one ever says be joyful
citizens of this planet.

01:01:43.670 --> 01:01:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And so as we wrap up this
part of our conversation

01:01:47.710 --> 01:01:50.290 align:middle line:84%
and whatever you would
like to also impart,

01:01:50.290 --> 01:01:54.740 align:middle line:84%
can you speak to our
need for joy and play

01:01:54.740 --> 01:01:57.025 align:middle line:90%
versus responsibility and duty?

01:01:57.025 --> 01:01:59.960 align:middle line:90%


01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:07.580 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: You don't have to
eliminate your sense of duty

01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:14.800 align:middle line:84%
and responsibility to have joy,
because they go hand in hand.

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:17.880 align:middle line:84%
What you do have
to do is you have

01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:20.790 align:middle line:90%
to live in the present moment.

01:02:20.790 --> 01:02:28.790 align:middle line:84%
Because this is the only
place that you will find joy,

01:02:28.790 --> 01:02:35.990 align:middle line:84%
is in observing yourself
as spirit in the moment.

01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:43.280 align:middle line:84%
This is where you will find
joy, where you will feel joy.

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:46.890 align:middle line:90%
Vastly different from happiness.

01:02:46.890 --> 01:02:51.170 align:middle line:84%
Happiness has a
upside and a downside.

01:02:51.170 --> 01:03:00.650 align:middle line:84%
Joy is pure and radiant and
of a much different frequency.

01:03:00.650 --> 01:03:05.020 align:middle line:84%
It emanates outward
into the environment

01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:10.610 align:middle line:84%
and engages others
to want to follow,

01:03:10.610 --> 01:03:15.150 align:middle line:84%
because you model what
it's like to create

01:03:15.150 --> 01:03:18.880 align:middle line:90%
in the present moment in joy.

01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:22.100 align:middle line:84%
And yes, that is
being responsible.

01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:22.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:26.820 align:middle line:84%
That is a new type
of responsibility.

01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:29.420 align:middle line:84%
Metatron, is there
a final comment

01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:32.880 align:middle line:84%
on this topic range that you
would like to make at this time

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:35.720 align:middle line:90%
before we get Joan back?

01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:37.960 align:middle line:90%
And thank you.

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:46.770 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: I would like to
encourage all embodied beings

01:03:46.770 --> 01:03:54.130 align:middle line:84%
to notice their beauty,
to notice their power,

01:03:54.130 --> 01:04:00.900 align:middle line:84%
to notice how complex
of a being you are.

01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:04.925 align:middle line:84%
You have known for some time
you are not just your body.

01:04:04.925 --> 01:04:08.220 align:middle line:90%


01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:15.700 align:middle line:84%
Begin to notice how you use
your body under the direction

01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:22.280 align:middle line:84%
of your soul spirit, how
you create beauty everywhere

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:31.840 align:middle line:84%
you walk if you operate in
the present moment with focus

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:41.025 align:middle line:84%
and intention to expand creation
and to exemplify your Christed

01:04:41.025 --> 01:04:41.525 align:middle line:90%
nature.

01:04:41.525 --> 01:04:44.770 align:middle line:90%


01:04:44.770 --> 01:04:51.060 align:middle line:84%
Many have gathered
to support you,

01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:55.990 align:middle line:84%
but this one thing you
must do for yourself.

01:04:55.990 --> 01:04:57.470 align:middle line:90%
We will support you.

01:04:57.470 --> 01:04:59.290 align:middle line:90%
We will love you.

01:04:59.290 --> 01:05:04.170 align:middle line:84%
We will send you vast
frequencies of light,

01:05:04.170 --> 01:05:10.100 align:middle line:84%
but you must take
this step for you.

01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:12.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Indeed,
and Metatron, thank

01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:15.030 align:middle line:84%
you so much for coming
here and gracing us

01:05:15.030 --> 01:05:19.140 align:middle line:84%
all with your wisdom, and love,
and energies in this space.

01:05:19.140 --> 01:05:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And until next time, thank
you on behalf of all of us.

01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:25.340 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: You are most welcome.

01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:30.400 align:middle line:84%
I am honored to have
been here today.

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:30.900 align:middle line:90%
Blessings.

01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:44.270 align:middle line:90%


01:05:44.270 --> 01:05:45.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Welcome back.

01:05:45.370 --> 01:05:46.750 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Thank you.

01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:48.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That was beautiful.

01:05:48.210 --> 01:05:49.460 align:middle line:90%
That was really lovely.

01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:51.750 align:middle line:84%
I think that many,
many people are

01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:54.140 align:middle line:84%
going to share that
information with others.

01:05:54.140 --> 01:05:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And I certainly encourage
anyone to let their loved ones

01:05:59.490 --> 01:06:02.800 align:middle line:84%
know about these messages
that have just come through

01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:05.485 align:middle line:90%
for all of us, very important.

01:06:05.485 --> 01:06:08.590 align:middle line:10%
>>WALKER: That's what it's
all about, it's just noticing,

01:06:08.590 --> 01:06:13.204 align:middle line:10%
noticing what's right instead
of what's need to be changed.

01:06:13.204 --> 01:06:14.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, indeed.

01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:18.390 align:middle line:84%
And you and I are going to
have another conversation,

01:06:18.390 --> 01:06:21.060 align:middle line:90%
a little later, another program.

01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:24.075 align:middle line:84%
And so for now, thank
you so much Joan

01:06:24.075 --> 01:06:26.580 align:middle line:84%
for coming out of the closet
and joining us publicly,

01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:28.250 align:middle line:84%
on camera, doing
your channeling.

01:06:28.250 --> 01:06:28.750 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Thank you.

01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:29.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know it's
a big breakthrough.

01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:31.780 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: I am very
delighted and honored.

01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:34.370 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I hope this has given
you a lot of food for thought.

01:06:34.370 --> 01:06:36.200 align:middle line:10%
I'm planning on having
Joan back again,

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:37.640 align:middle line:10%
as I've already told you.

01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And she's going to bring through
her associates on other topics.

01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:44.418 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.

01:06:44.418 --> 01:07:03.567 align:middle line:90%
