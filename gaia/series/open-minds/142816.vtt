00:00:27.424 --> 00:00:29.340 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: One
of the great conundrums

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.220 align:middle line:10%
is our widely misunderstood
notion of time

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.140 align:middle line:10%
as it interfaces
with our reality,

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.300 align:middle line:10%
including our ability to heal.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.690 align:middle line:84%
The truth is that you can
heal nearly instantly,

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.560 align:middle line:84%
that you're not confined
to time nor space.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.750 align:middle line:84%
Bill McKenna is with us today
to explain the simple reality

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.000 align:middle line:84%
that we can do what
appear to be miracles.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.965 align:middle line:84%
And I say appear to be,
because as you know,

00:00:49.965 --> 00:00:53.900 align:middle line:84%
once you start working
with basic principles that

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.510 align:middle line:84%
do transcend time and space,
these aren't miracles anymore,

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.056 align:middle line:84%
and anybody can do
this stuff, right?

00:00:59.056 --> 00:01:00.180 align:middle line:90%
>>BILL MCKENNA: Absolutely.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.510 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.520 align:middle line:84%
And by the end of
the program, you'll

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.039 align:middle line:90%
be actually able to do it.

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:06.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And not only that,
at breakfast this morning,

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.220 align:middle line:84%
I just overheard
you say you actually

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.990 align:middle line:84%
taught the lady that was
waiting on you how to do this.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: I share it with
as many people as I can.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's because you're
irrepressibly thrilled that you

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.380 align:middle line:90%
have come into this ability.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And we want to talk about how
this whole thing happened.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.800 align:middle line:84%
Because you had an
experience that really

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.360 align:middle line:90%
kind of got you going.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.067 align:middle line:84%
Tell us just a thumbnail
sketch of what your life was

00:01:30.067 --> 00:01:31.650 align:middle line:84%
like before that,
what you were doing,

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.180 align:middle line:84%
so people get a
feel of who you are.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.790 align:middle line:10%
>>MCKENNA: So thank you.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.680 align:middle line:10%
Thank you for having
me on, because I'm

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.620 align:middle line:10%
very excited about doing this.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:46.620 align:middle line:10%
My life, I guess,
prior to 2008 is

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.120 align:middle line:10%
kind of when I had my
awakening, if you will.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.820 align:middle line:84%
Very much motivated
in the physical realm.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.929 align:middle line:84%
You know, Black Bell helicopter
pilot and airplane pilot, and--

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:03.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The material
world was working for you.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Very-- very material
and very focused, right?

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And all the standard matrix
that one would think of,

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.420 align:middle line:84%
I was going after
and accomplishing.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.580 align:middle line:84%
Around 2008, I had an
accident in Mexico.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.930 align:middle line:90%
I wrecked my yacht.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.520 align:middle line:90%
And it forced me to stop.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.650 align:middle line:84%
You know, when that happened,
I was just intuitive enough

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.740 align:middle line:84%
to say, you know, God, this
has got to be for a reason,

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.347 align:middle line:84%
because this is a
ridiculous accident.

00:02:33.347 --> 00:02:34.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Did you hurt yourself?

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.885 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: No, but I
sure did hurt the yacht.

00:02:36.885 --> 00:02:38.115 align:middle line:90%
That was-- yeah.

00:02:38.115 --> 00:02:39.937 align:middle line:90%
It stopped me for almost a year.

00:02:39.937 --> 00:02:40.736 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:40.736 --> 00:02:43.750 align:middle line:90%
So none too happy.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.800 align:middle line:90%
So anyway, it stopped me.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.920 align:middle line:84%
There was a woman that
we had been on and off,

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.330 align:middle line:90%
could never get along with.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.380 align:middle line:84%
It forced me to stop in
the town where she was at.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And basically, got
back together with her.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.500 align:middle line:84%
Really wanted to make
it work, and I really

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.770 align:middle line:84%
wanted to kind of
understand her better.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.470 align:middle line:84%
In an effort to
understand her better,

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.540 align:middle line:84%
I ended up noticing that
she was extremely intuitive.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.224 align:middle line:84%
Like, crazy amounts
of intuition.

00:03:15.224 --> 00:03:17.640 align:middle line:84%
I would say-- you know, we'd
play games, and I'd say, hey,

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.550 align:middle line:90%
you know--

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:19.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What color
am I thinking of?

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.945 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:03:19.945 --> 00:03:20.400 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.650 align:middle line:90%
I said, what am I thinking of?

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.250 align:middle line:84%
And she was like, um, it's an
orange, it's a fruit-- no, no.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.050 align:middle line:90%
It's a lemon.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.709 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, lemon.

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:27.750 align:middle line:90%
I don't even like lemons.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:28.833 align:middle line:90%
I was thinking of a lemon.

00:03:28.833 --> 00:03:30.420 align:middle line:84%
You know, I don't
use lemons, nothing.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.280 align:middle line:90%
So I was like, wow.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.770 align:middle line:90%
Well, anyway, it was nonstop.

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you name
it, it was nonstop.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.820 align:middle line:84%
And so anyway, I
thought, well, gosh.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:40.620 align:middle line:90%
Maybe that's it.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.110 align:middle line:84%
If I just understand what
it means to be intuitive,

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.890 align:middle line:84%
I will be able to get along
better, and we'll get married.

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.077 align:middle line:90%
And take you to the end.

00:03:48.077 --> 00:03:49.410 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we got married, had a baby.

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.250 align:middle line:90%
It's all good.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.322 align:middle line:90%
So that's a happy ending.

00:03:51.322 --> 00:03:52.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you for that.

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: So I started
getting a bunch of books.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.280 align:middle line:84%
I got maybe 15
books, and started

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.580 align:middle line:84%
reading about
psychic development,

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.660 align:middle line:90%
you know, and basics of that.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.610 align:middle line:84%
And I read one,
two, five, 10, 15.

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And I started to
notice a pattern.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:11.310 align:middle line:84%
And the pattern
that I noticed was

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.890 align:middle line:84%
that if you want to
have this ability, then

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.107 align:middle line:90%
you need to forgive.

00:04:18.107 --> 00:04:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, you know,
that was the very last thing--

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.815 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
that's interesting,

00:04:21.815 --> 00:04:24.180 align:middle line:84%
because you were talking
about a variety of books,

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.830 align:middle line:84%
different authors,
different takes.

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.920 align:middle line:84%
But this was a kind
of an emerging message

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.120 align:middle line:90%
that tied them all together?

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.720 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Absolutely.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.820 align:middle line:84%
And now I knew it
was true, because I

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.280 align:middle line:84%
had life experience that I
could see somebody doing this.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.065 align:middle line:90%
And it was no kidding, you know?

00:04:41.065 --> 00:04:43.440 align:middle line:84%
The odds of something, the
things they would come up with

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.860 align:middle line:90%
are trillions to one.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.689 align:middle line:90%
So I was like, it's real.

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:49.230 align:middle line:84%
And if they're saying I can have
access, and all I need to do

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.480 align:middle line:84%
is just start to
forgive, you know--

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.860 align:middle line:90%
uh, I don't want to.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.300 align:middle line:90%
You know, I was very much--

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.170 align:middle line:90%
very resentful.

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Attached
to your resentments.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.010 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Whoo!

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.850 align:middle line:84%
You know, I was-- you
know, angry doesn't even

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.890 align:middle line:90%
hardly describe it, you know?

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry to
everybody, by the way.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.000 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.290 align:middle line:90%


00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.830 align:middle line:84%
So these-- I started
forgiving, and reaching up

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.000 align:middle line:90%
for kind of guidance.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.730 align:middle line:84%
And I was just ill
prepared for what happened.

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.868 align:middle line:90%


00:05:17.868 --> 00:05:22.530 align:middle line:84%
I ended up becoming
very intuitive.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.434 align:middle line:90%
Enrolled in a school, you know--

00:05:24.434 --> 00:05:25.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To enhance
it even more.

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:26.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Enhance it even more.

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.061 align:middle line:90%
The Berkeley Psychic Institute.

00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:30.620 align:middle line:84%
There was a derivative
of it in San Diego

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.270 align:middle line:90%
called Intuitive Insights.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And went through
all their programs

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.690 align:middle line:84%
for a couple years
in record time,

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.710 align:middle line:84%
and ended up teaching,
and read a lot of books.

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.330 align:middle line:84%
Ran into people that
would be considered

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.290 align:middle line:84%
masters, saints, like the
laws of physics no longer

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:49.460 align:middle line:90%
apply-type people.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.470 align:middle line:84%
Like, I never would
have believed it,

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.730 align:middle line:90%
but it actually happened.

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:57.380 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, the next thing
that kind of happened

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:03.560 align:middle line:84%
was that I ran into a
guy, Burt Goldman, who

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.790 align:middle line:84%
I saw him basically
give a bottle of water

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:12.530 align:middle line:84%
to a woman with fibromyalgia
that had it for 35 years.

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And she drank the water and
she walked around a little bit,

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.320 align:middle line:90%
and it was gone.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.620 align:middle line:90%
And I was like--

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.210 align:middle line:84%
next day, I saw her
and I said, hey.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:25.730 align:middle line:90%
Is that-- are you really better?

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.890 align:middle line:90%
And she was like, it's gone.

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:32.290 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, about a
week later, I end up--

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:35.420 align:middle line:84%
what I end up doing is
someone asked me, hey,

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.720 align:middle line:84%
what did you learn
last weekend from Burt?

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.910 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
this is what he did.

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:47.222 align:middle line:84%
And he just basically saw
the person as perfect,

00:06:47.222 --> 00:06:48.460 align:middle line:90%
and then they were.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:49.940 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, whoa.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.120 align:middle line:84%
So it was incredible
to watch him.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.690 align:middle line:84%
He said, oh, why
don't you do it?

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:54.789 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK.

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:55.830 align:middle line:90%
Has anybody got any pain?

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.850 align:middle line:90%
And one guy stood up.

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:01.850 align:middle line:84%
He was at a level eight
of pain in his lower back,

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:03.940 align:middle line:84%
and had been there
for over a decade.

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:04.790 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:06.370 align:middle line:90%
I did it.

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:10.430 align:middle line:84%
And held the thought for about
three, four minutes or so.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.520 align:middle line:90%
And you know, I opened my eyes.

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.892 align:middle line:90%
I said, oh, huh?

00:07:13.892 --> 00:07:15.690 align:middle line:90%
And he's like, it's gone.

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:16.955 align:middle line:90%
I was like, whoa.

00:07:16.955 --> 00:07:17.755 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:07:17.755 --> 00:07:17.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:19.570 align:middle line:84%
As a newbie no
less, you did this.

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:20.115 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:20.115 --> 00:07:20.915 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:07:20.915 --> 00:07:25.010 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, that was
kind of the start of it.

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:27.590 align:middle line:84%
But all the sudden, the
pieces of the puzzle

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:29.630 align:middle line:90%
started to fit together.

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:33.500 align:middle line:84%
All these things that
I had read from all

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.140 align:middle line:84%
these different teachers,
all of the sudden,

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:39.920 align:middle line:84%
the pieces of the puzzle
started to fit together in a way

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.590 align:middle line:84%
that I could understand
the bigger picture,

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:45.782 align:middle line:84%
and why it works, and
how to expand this.

00:07:45.782 --> 00:07:51.050 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing
that I went back to

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:52.880 align:middle line:90%
is I had read the works of--

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.920 align:middle line:90%


00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.030 align:middle line:90%
"The Power of Now."

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:57.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:58.490 align:middle line:90%
Eckhart Tolle.

00:07:58.490 --> 00:07:59.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Eckhart Tolle, yes.

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:05.420 align:middle line:84%
And I recalled, he talked about
that the ego represents itself

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:06.590 align:middle line:90%
in three ways.

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:09.200 align:middle line:84%
Either wanting,
thwarted wanting,

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:13.580 align:middle line:84%
I didn't get what I
want, or indifference.

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:15.080 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, OK.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And this methodology
of doing this healing,

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:23.200 align:middle line:84%
it is where you're
unattached to an outcome.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And all these over here,
I started thinking about.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:28.380 align:middle line:90%
I was like, huh.

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:32.000 align:middle line:84%
You're not watching anything,
you're not afraid of anything,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.870 align:middle line:84%
and you're certainly
not disinterested.

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:41.110 align:middle line:84%
It also brought into
my understanding--

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:46.220 align:middle line:84%
I had basically bought every
book that Dr. David Hawkins--

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:47.334 align:middle line:90%
he passed away--

00:08:47.334 --> 00:08:48.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: "Power vs. Force."

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:48.710 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:49.970 align:middle line:90%
"Power vs. Force."

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:52.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Were you using
his calibration method?

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:53.090 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes.

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:53.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:55.050 align:middle line:84%
So you were already
that far along.

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:55.850 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:56.270 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:56.900 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:57.700 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And so his-- and everybody can
look it up on the internet.

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:06.110 align:middle line:84%
But it's basically as a chart,
levels of consciousness.

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:07.820 align:middle line:90%
Zero to 1,000.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:09.560 align:middle line:90%
It starts off in the bottom.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.930 align:middle line:90%
Shame, guilt, humiliation.

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:14.510 align:middle line:84%
One of the other pieces
of the puzzle that I

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:18.740 align:middle line:84%
had come in and
filled it in for me

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:23.540 align:middle line:84%
was all the "Power vs. Force,"
Dr. David Hawkins' works.

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:27.290 align:middle line:84%
And he has a chart of the
levels of consciousness.

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:29.930 align:middle line:84%
And levels of
consciousness also, I

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:32.090 align:middle line:84%
was able to get
another understanding

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:34.430 align:middle line:84%
of, what is a level
of consciousness?

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And that is, it is
the understanding

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:42.050 align:middle line:84%
that I've been able to
come to thus far in life.

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:47.510 align:middle line:84%
So for me, that really worked,
where I now understood things

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:48.980 align:middle line:90%
a little bit differently.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And my understanding of life
was kind of fear and anger

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:55.670 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, the world
reflected in that way

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:56.470 align:middle line:90%
back to me.

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:56.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:59.260 align:middle line:84%
Which is why you were having
problems with your sweetie pie.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:09:59.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes.

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:00.023 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:00.023 --> 00:10:00.823 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:00.823 --> 00:10:02.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: And a lot
of other problems.

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:06.320 align:middle line:90%
So the work that he did was--

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:11.580 align:middle line:84%
it starts off at shame, guilt,
humiliation, fear, anger,

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:14.180 align:middle line:90%
and it goes on up.

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:20.335 align:middle line:84%
80%-some or below a level
of 200, meaning that--

00:10:20.335 --> 00:10:21.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Survival
consciousness.

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:23.668 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Survival
consciousness, everything's

00:10:23.668 --> 00:10:26.445 align:middle line:84%
in fear, and life happens
through some degree of force.

00:10:26.445 --> 00:10:27.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:29.091 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Beyond that
there's forgiveness.

00:10:29.091 --> 00:10:33.960 align:middle line:84%
So I had accidentally
jumped into the mid 300s.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:39.570 align:middle line:84%
And what I had read about
was that at 540, there

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:41.835 align:middle line:90%
was unconditional love.

00:10:41.835 --> 00:10:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And that level of
understanding, about 4/10

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:50.130 align:middle line:84%
of 1% of the population
is at that level.

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:53.160 align:middle line:84%
Over that, at around
560, is the realm

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.150 align:middle line:84%
of saints that are
commonly called saints,

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:59.190 align:middle line:84%
and that kind of
things that know--

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:02.040 align:middle line:84%
the rules of physics
no longer apply.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:05.230 align:middle line:84%
You know, they're operating
in a different way,

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:08.290 align:middle line:84%
and the miraculous
becomes commonplace.

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:11.460 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, the way
this fit together

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:16.590 align:middle line:84%
was that I realized that
anybody can access this.

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And the access is
done through shifting

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:23.850 align:middle line:90%
what I would call dimensions.

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:28.290 align:middle line:90%
Third dimension is related to--

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:32.730 align:middle line:84%
it's characterized, I should
say, by a conditional love.

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:36.630 align:middle line:84%
It's characterized by
laws, rules, separation.

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.210 align:middle line:84%
Our ego is an
absolute perfect fit.

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:41.560 align:middle line:84%
If we go back to it, it's
wanting, thwarted wanting,

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:42.750 align:middle line:90%
or indifference.

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:44.580 align:middle line:84%
So I've got all this
separation going on

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:46.170 align:middle line:90%
in the third dimension.

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:47.955 align:middle line:90%
And also time.

00:11:47.955 --> 00:11:51.240 align:middle line:84%
Time, which I'm going to
get to later in the program,

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.620 align:middle line:90%
is how to bend it.

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:54.900 align:middle line:84%
It's because time in
the third dimension

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:58.380 align:middle line:84%
is characterized by linear
time, one thing after the next.

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:01.680 align:middle line:84%
But our particular focus
is either in the past

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.190 align:middle line:90%
or in the future.

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And with whatever happens right
now is kind of a reaction.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.660 align:middle line:84%
In the fourth and
fifth dimensions,

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:14.970 align:middle line:84%
time starts to become
malleable, we're nonjudgmental,

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:17.550 align:middle line:84%
and we're focused
on now, whatever's

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:19.550 align:middle line:90%
going on in the present moment.

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:23.070 align:middle line:84%
In the fifth dimension, it's
instantaneous, I think--

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:25.540 align:middle line:90%
and it actually is.

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:31.050 align:middle line:84%
So the neat thing about this
is that it's extraordinarily

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:39.810 align:middle line:84%
simple to start to manipulate
matter in a positive way

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:44.070 align:middle line:84%
when I jump to
unconditional love,

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:46.360 align:middle line:90%
and some derivative of it.

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.090 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people think,
oh, I could never

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:49.650 align:middle line:90%
do unconditional love.

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:53.130 align:middle line:84%
But really, what it is
is merely unconditional--

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:57.480 align:middle line:84%
another word for it could
be unattached to an outcome.

00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:59.310 align:middle line:90%
That's all it is.

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:02.340 align:middle line:84%
I have a positive feeling
unattached to an outcome.

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:04.860 align:middle line:90%
I don't want anything, right?

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:08.370 align:middle line:84%
Wanting is part of our
ego or [INAUDIBLE], right?

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:14.865 align:middle line:84%
So what this does
is that we become--

00:13:14.865 --> 00:13:17.760 align:middle line:90%


00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:22.590 align:middle line:84%
have the ability to
actually affect a person

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:25.350 align:middle line:90%
without them believing a thing.

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
that this works is

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:33.390 align:middle line:84%
because we jump into kind
of the common thread that

00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:35.790 align:middle line:90%
is between all of us.

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:37.710 align:middle line:90%
You've heard God is love.

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:41.430 align:middle line:84%
You've heard the universe
is love. you are love.

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:43.480 align:middle line:90%
Well, actually, it's true.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's just that it's
not a sentimentalized version

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:48.600 align:middle line:90%
of what we think of as love.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:52.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Well,
sentimentalized version, right?

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:55.340 align:middle line:90%
That is back down in our ego--

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:56.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:57.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: --meaning wanting.

00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:02.250 align:middle line:84%
That's why, unfortunately,
romantic love is

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:04.527 align:middle line:90%
conditional, typically, right?

00:14:04.527 --> 00:14:05.610 align:middle line:90%
I want something from you.

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:09.510 align:middle line:84%
If I don't get it, then you
know, whatever that want is,

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:11.430 align:middle line:84%
there's wanting and
thwarted wanting

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:15.210 align:middle line:84%
parts of that conditional love,
and therefore, third dimension.

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:18.120 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, how many of
us have been in a romantic

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.790 align:middle line:84%
relationship where we just want
so bad for the other person

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:24.420 align:middle line:84%
to start behaving
right, and they don't.

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:28.950 align:middle line:84%
Or it could be
anything in our lives,

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:32.470 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a business
meeting or romantic love

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:33.950 align:middle line:90%
or a condition in our life.

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:35.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But there's
an anxiety and fear

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:38.400 align:middle line:84%
attached to the
wanting, and that's

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.709 align:middle line:90%
going to skew your results.

00:14:39.709 --> 00:14:41.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Which is
thwarted wanting.

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:42.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:42.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Right?

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:42.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:43.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Right.

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:49.896 align:middle line:84%
So the way that we
can do a healing--

00:14:49.896 --> 00:14:51.270 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
now's a good time

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:54.340 align:middle line:84%
to talk about the
healing aspect of it.

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:55.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:57.670 align:middle line:84%
We can go through and
talk about that now, yeah.

00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:58.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: OK.

00:14:58.470 --> 00:14:59.270 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:06.300 align:middle line:84%
So quite simply, all one needs
to do is a few easy steps.

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.630 align:middle line:84%
The very first thing I
do is ask the person,

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:14.186 align:middle line:84%
give me your pain on
a scale of one to 10.

00:15:14.186 --> 00:15:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And let's say their knee hurts
or they've got a headache.

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:19.890 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to
say, oh, it's a seven.

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:20.700 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:21.500 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.920 align:middle line:84%
By the way, I don't want you to
believe diddly ding dang dong.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:26.510 align:middle line:90%
Just, you've got a seven.

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:28.040 align:middle line:90%
If it goes away, it goes away.

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:30.140 align:middle line:90%
If it doesn't, it doesn't.

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:33.050 align:middle line:84%
So all you do is you put
the tip of your tongue

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:34.280 align:middle line:90%
to the roof of your mouth.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:36.470 align:middle line:90%
It closes an energy circuit.

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:39.510 align:middle line:90%
You see the person as perfect.

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:40.310 align:middle line:90%
They're happy.

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:42.018 align:middle line:84%
You're not thinking
about their headache.

00:15:42.018 --> 00:15:45.730 align:middle line:84%
All you're thinking about
is they are perfect,

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:50.030 align:middle line:84%
they're so blissful, and
you want absolutely nothing

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:50.960 align:middle line:90%
from them.

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:53.430 align:middle line:84%
You don't even want a thank
you, an acknowledgment.

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:55.740 align:middle line:84%
You are just focused
on one thing,

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:59.060 align:middle line:90%
and that is, they are in bliss.

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And as you hold that thought,
you hold it for maybe,

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:06.980 align:middle line:84%
if you can, maybe three,
four minutes, and then you

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:07.870 align:middle line:90%
check in with them.

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:08.990 align:middle line:90%
What is it now?

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:13.050 align:middle line:84%
Oh, it'll be-- instead of the
seven, it'll be down to a five.

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:15.600 align:middle line:84%
Hold it again for another
three or four minutes, and--

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:15.930 align:middle line:90%
[SNAPS FINGERS]

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:16.340 align:middle line:90%
--boom.

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:17.310 align:middle line:90%
It'll be gone.

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:19.312 align:middle line:90%
It'll walk it right down.

00:16:19.312 --> 00:16:22.030 align:middle line:84%
If you just get it
from a seven to a six,

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:24.720 align:middle line:84%
you got it on the run,
and it'll be gone.

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.752 align:middle line:90%
It'll be gone very soon.

00:16:26.752 --> 00:16:28.460 align:middle line:84%
There is another way
to do it, which I've

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:31.490 align:middle line:90%
found is actually even quicker.

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:36.350 align:middle line:84%
Meaning the results seem to
come even faster than me just

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:42.590 align:middle line:84%
thinking it, and that is for me
to just see it in your water,

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:49.550 align:middle line:84%
and see the water lit up, and
see you in that blissful state.

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:50.930 align:middle line:90%
And then they drink the water.

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:53.870 align:middle line:84%
Helps if they walk
around for a little bit.

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And that actually, instead
of it being something like,

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:00.650 align:middle line:84%
you know, seven minutes
or so, you know,

00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:03.170 align:middle line:84%
time is maybe one
or two minutes.

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:07.160 align:middle line:84%
So very, very quick,
these things happen.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.800 align:middle line:84%
In my experience,
now, you know, I

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:12.680 align:middle line:84%
stopped counting at about
1,000 people helping them.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:18.230 align:middle line:84%
And my experience is
that somewhere over 90%

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:20.630 align:middle line:90%
of the time, this works.

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:24.140 align:middle line:84%
There is a small percentage of
the time where it doesn't work.

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:28.339 align:middle line:84%
It also-- some of the
people, it's permanent.

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:31.850 align:middle line:84%
I'll check in with them
years later, and it's gone.

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:34.760 align:middle line:90%
Some of them, it's 15 minutes.

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:36.560 align:middle line:90%
So do I have a reason for it?

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:37.400 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.200 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:41.510 align:middle line:84%
But what I did find
was more effective

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:43.920 align:middle line:84%
is setting the intention that
I want it to be permanent.

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:44.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:45.520 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.050 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the part
about nonattachment

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:50.120 align:middle line:84%
is interesting,
because like you say,

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:53.630 align:middle line:84%
you set up the mindset of the
person that you're working with

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:55.880 align:middle line:84%
and say, you don't have
to believe any of this.

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:58.010 align:middle line:84%
So they don't
particularly have--

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:00.440 align:middle line:84%
necessarily have an
attachment to outcome.

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:01.880 align:middle line:90%
Some may, some may not.

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:03.680 align:middle line:84%
Some may want it
so badly, they do

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.270 align:middle line:90%
have an attachment to outcome.

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm hearing you say
is, regardless of their mindset,

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:11.750 align:middle line:84%
your lack of
attachment to outcome

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:14.880 align:middle line:84%
will override that and allow
the healing to take place.

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: That's exactly it.

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:16.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:18.170 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: That's exactly it.

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:23.660 align:middle line:84%
And the way I describe it is
that because you in this higher

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:27.470 align:middle line:84%
dimension, in this fourth
or fifth dimension,

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:31.370 align:middle line:84%
and it's just being in
a state of seeing them

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:35.360 align:middle line:84%
as blissful and
unattached to the outcome,

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:39.200 align:middle line:90%
they will come to your--

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:43.040 align:middle line:84%
the way that you see them
is what they will become.

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:44.762 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely amazing.

00:18:44.762 --> 00:18:45.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It really is.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And the whole notion
of time, again,

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:51.770 align:middle line:84%
the fact that this
happens so quickly,

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:54.470 align:middle line:84%
if we look into the
higher aspect of what

00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:57.510 align:middle line:84%
we are as human beings, that
is a higher dimensional aspect.

00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:58.960 align:middle line:90%
No doubt about it, right?

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:02.930 align:middle line:84%
It has amazing amounts of
intelligence and creativity,

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:05.270 align:middle line:84%
and does create at
the speed of thought.

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:07.850 align:middle line:84%
But we're encased in
the third dimension,

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:09.680 align:middle line:84%
in the physical
realm as well, which

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:13.430 align:middle line:84%
I think makes us such a unique
and interesting species,

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:17.750 align:middle line:84%
this dichotomy squished into
one type of-- one being.

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:21.260 align:middle line:84%
So the capability to be able to
switch gears from that survival

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.560 align:middle line:84%
mode, that consciousness on
David Hawkins' scale of 200

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:28.610 align:middle line:84%
and below and start reaching up
into the 300s, 400s, and 500s

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:31.550 align:middle line:84%
is a direct reflection
of our ability

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:34.280 align:middle line:84%
to move between kind of
the animal portion of life

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:38.030 align:middle line:84%
and into the sublime
portion of who we are.

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And the frustration that
people have in creation

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:43.066 align:middle line:84%
is that it's not
happening fast enough.

00:19:43.066 --> 00:19:44.690 align:middle line:84%
No matter what you're
trying to create,

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:49.190 align:middle line:84%
it's like, so slow on Earth
trying to create oftentimes.

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:52.520 align:middle line:84%
But what you said is once
the thought is established,

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:56.690 align:middle line:84%
once a clear intention
and thought, surrounded

00:19:56.690 --> 00:20:00.130 align:middle line:84%
with those emotions you talk
about, this unconditional love,

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:04.070 align:middle line:84%
nonattachment are out there
and clear, it just takes time.

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:05.330 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it just takes time.

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:07.262 align:middle line:84%
It may show up
slightly differently.

00:20:07.262 --> 00:20:08.720 align:middle line:84%
But you have already
begun creating

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:10.460 align:middle line:90%
at the speed of thought, right?

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:11.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Correct.

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:12.100 align:middle line:90%
Correct.

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:13.550 align:middle line:84%
If you can do that,
you will start

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:15.390 align:middle line:90%
to create very, very fast.

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:17.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
create anything.

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:19.058 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter what
you're trying to create.

00:20:19.058 --> 00:20:20.510 align:middle line:90%
This goes far beyond healing.

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:24.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Oh, absolutely.

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:26.400 align:middle line:84%
The most ridiculous--
you know, it

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.986 align:middle line:90%
gets more and more ridiculous.

00:20:28.986 --> 00:20:31.640 align:middle line:84%
As I have progressed
through this,

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:33.600 align:middle line:84%
I've found it more and
more ridiculous and more

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.100 align:middle line:90%
and more unbelievable.

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:36.825 align:middle line:90%
But it's true.

00:20:36.825 --> 00:20:39.640 align:middle line:90%
It's actually true.

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And what I would
say to the viewers

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:45.420 align:middle line:84%
is that it's not true until
it's true in your experience.

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:46.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:49.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: So actually
doing it, you'll

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:51.690 align:middle line:84%
find out that this
thing is true.

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:54.540 align:middle line:90%


00:20:54.540 --> 00:21:00.030 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that happened
is that during this, you know,

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:03.700 align:middle line:84%
I discovered this
and put it together.

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:06.360 align:middle line:84%
And I called a friend,
and I was like, hey.

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:10.230 align:middle line:84%
Hey, you know-- he's
in a board of directors

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:13.640 align:middle line:84%
of many big companies, public
companies and otherwise.

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And I said, hey, you know, I can
do this, and I can teach this.

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:19.570 align:middle line:90%
And it works.

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:22.380 align:middle line:84%
I've taught classes,
and this works.

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:24.720 align:middle line:90%
And he was like, eh, no.

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:25.781 align:middle line:90%
People in--

00:21:25.781 --> 00:21:27.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The corporate world.

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:29.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Corporate world, they
don't give a diddly ding ding

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:29.940 align:middle line:90%
dong if you're--

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:31.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're in pain.

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:33.175 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: --you're in
pain, you've got a headache.

00:21:33.175 --> 00:21:34.254 align:middle line:90%
Get to work, you know?

00:21:34.254 --> 00:21:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And then I kept
thinking about it.

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And my thought was,
well, what they

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:38.912 align:middle line:90%
do care about is business--

00:21:38.912 --> 00:21:39.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Productivity.

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:42.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: --productivity,
business processes, profit.

00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:47.190 align:middle line:84%
Hey, is everybody getting along
so that things will actually

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:48.660 align:middle line:90%
happen in the business?

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:51.960 align:middle line:84%
But so often in businesses,
people are acting passive

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:55.950 align:middle line:84%
aggressive, they're doing things
they shouldn't, they're stuck

00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:59.640 align:middle line:84%
in their thoughts, and they
cannot control themselves.

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:06.450 align:middle line:84%
So this materially impacts
productivity and profitability.

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:09.360 align:middle line:84%
One day I was up in
front of a group.

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:10.770 align:middle line:90%
It was 30 people.

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:12.149 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK.

00:22:12.149 --> 00:22:13.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to try something out.

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:16.590 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, again,
don't believe this--

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:18.450 align:middle line:84%
you know, I told all
the crowd, I don't

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:20.280 align:middle line:90%
want you to believe anything.

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:23.970 align:middle line:90%
This is an experiment.

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:26.490 align:middle line:84%
I had them all stand
up, and I said,

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:29.790 align:middle line:84%
I want you to think
of the thing that

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:31.540 align:middle line:90%
is the big problem for you.

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:34.290 align:middle line:84%
You've got an emotional
problem, some stuck something

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:38.400 align:middle line:84%
in your life that
is a big problem.

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:39.200 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And sit down if and only if
that problem goes away or ceases

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:48.310 align:middle line:84%
to exist or changes,
and you feel better.

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:50.430 align:middle line:90%
I closed my eyes.

00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:55.470 align:middle line:84%
I saw everybody in the crowd as
absolutely perfect, peaceful,

00:22:55.470 --> 00:23:00.402 align:middle line:90%
at peace, content, happy.

00:23:00.402 --> 00:23:03.900 align:middle line:84%
I got tapped on the shoulder
about two and a half minutes

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:04.950 align:middle line:90%
later.

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:07.080 align:middle line:90%
And I opened my eyes.

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:09.740 align:middle line:84%
All-- everybody in
the audience sat down.

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:11.800 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, ooh!

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:12.600 align:middle line:90%
Ooh!

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:13.746 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:23:13.746 --> 00:23:14.750 align:middle line:90%


00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:16.180 align:middle line:90%
I was like, hey.

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:18.250 align:middle line:84%
Could you tell me
what happened to you?

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:20.222 align:middle line:90%
And each one of them said--

00:23:20.222 --> 00:23:22.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As their pain went
away, each one sat down.

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:22.690 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:23.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:24.480 align:middle line:90%
They all sat down.

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:27.000 align:middle line:10%
And I asked them, hey,
what happened to you?

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.150 align:middle line:10%
And one person was like, you
know, I started laughing,

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:33.060 align:middle line:10%
because it was just stupid.

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:35.060 align:middle line:84%
The next one, I saw
a new perspective,

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:37.810 align:middle line:90%
and I know how to solve that.

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:40.390 align:middle line:84%
Another one was, I couldn't
even think of it anymore.

00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:42.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what I
was thinking about.

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And it went like that,
through the whole crowd.

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:50.730 align:middle line:84%
So my point is that this
is useful in a business

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:51.897 align:middle line:90%
environment, in your family.

00:23:51.897 --> 00:23:52.771 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:23:52.771 --> 00:23:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Can you imagine--
hey, Thanksgiving's coming up.

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:58.440 align:middle line:84%
How would you like a
peaceful Thanksgiving, right?

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:00.720 align:middle line:84%
It is a matter of just
seeing it that way

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:03.210 align:middle line:84%
and holding it, and
not wanting anything.

00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:06.580 align:middle line:90%
I wanted nothing from anyone.

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:08.710 align:middle line:90%
And that's what made it happen.

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:11.220 align:middle line:84%
I didn't fear the outcome,
and I didn't want anything.

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:12.299 align:middle line:90%
I just saw it that way.

00:24:12.299 --> 00:24:14.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know, that's
beautiful, and you're right.

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:18.390 align:middle line:84%
Because you know, oftentimes,
we take better care of our pets

00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:20.580 align:middle line:90%
than we do our employees.

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:22.500 align:middle line:84%
You know, the kind
of stress and strain

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:25.110 align:middle line:84%
we put on our employees,
the lack of respect

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:28.110 align:middle line:84%
that employees often go through
at the corporations they're

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:30.810 align:middle line:84%
working with, not
feeling seen or heard.

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:36.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a very
disempowering relationship

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:39.750 align:middle line:84%
between the managers
or the owners often,

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:41.100 align:middle line:90%
and the employees.

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:43.150 align:middle line:90%
Maybe more often than not.

00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:45.630 align:middle line:84%
And so to me, for you to
use your skills in that way

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:49.500 align:middle line:84%
and go into that environment
is just tremendously helpful,

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:52.260 align:middle line:84%
because it also reduces
anxiety of people wanting

00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:53.704 align:middle line:90%
to go to work the next day too.

00:24:53.704 --> 00:24:54.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Absolutely.

00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:56.582 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine being
productive and at peace?

00:24:56.582 --> 00:24:58.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, doing
that exact exercise

00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:01.560 align:middle line:84%
in a corporate environment
and see if all of them

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:04.950 align:middle line:84%
were taught to see this
as a peaceful experience

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:06.720 align:middle line:90%
that they could work within.

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine how
much more beautiful life

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.860 align:middle line:90%
and everyday jobs would be?

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:12.330 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Absolutely.

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:13.730 align:middle line:90%
And it can only--

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:17.880 align:middle line:84%
presently, it really can only be
that way, the way it is today.

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:19.470 align:middle line:90%
Because think about it.

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:20.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm a boss.

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.290 align:middle line:90%
I want something.

00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:26.240 align:middle line:84%
I didn't get what
I needed, right?

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.120 align:middle line:90%
I need it.

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:28.190 align:middle line:90%
I didn't get it.

00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:31.660 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm thinking about
what's your repercussions.

00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:32.600 align:middle line:90%
Or, hey.

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.100 align:middle line:84%
I found out what Joe
Blow's making a year.

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:36.580 align:middle line:90%
Wah, wah, wah.

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:37.500 align:middle line:90%
Thwarted wanting.

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:39.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thwarted
wanting, yeah.

00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And finally when all else
fails, absolute indifference.

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:43.580 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes.

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:44.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I give up.

00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:45.470 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:46.424 align:middle line:90%
It's a paycheck.

00:25:46.424 --> 00:25:47.840 align:middle line:84%
But you know, and
a lot of people,

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:49.160 align:middle line:84%
that's where a lot
of people end up.

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:49.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:50.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:51.650 align:middle line:90%
So this is beautiful.

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:52.940 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: It's empowering.

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:59.330 align:middle line:84%
It's empowering and that
everybody-- this kind of leads

00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:03.680 align:middle line:84%
to some things around
religion, and that

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:07.790 align:middle line:84%
is that we're all sitting
here-- you know, and I'm guilty.

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:10.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm brought up Catholic, right?

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:11.994 align:middle line:90%
Traditional Irish Catholic.

00:26:11.994 --> 00:26:13.827 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You were
raised on guilt, like me.

00:26:13.827 --> 00:26:14.681 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah, yeah.

00:26:14.681 --> 00:26:15.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I was Lutheran.

00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:17.153 align:middle line:90%
I was raised on guilt too.

00:26:17.153 --> 00:26:18.020 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:18.820 align:middle line:90%


00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:22.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: So the whole thing
is like, please, please, please,

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:23.490 align:middle line:90%
please, please.

00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:24.530 align:middle line:90%
It's outside of me.

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:26.250 align:middle line:90%
Please.

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:31.820 align:middle line:84%
But part of my understanding
through all my studying,

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:37.590 align:middle line:84%
I found that when
people were saying, hey,

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:41.360 align:middle line:84%
just ask for it in Jesus' name,
and it'll be given, actually,

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:46.070 align:middle line:90%
in Aramaic, it's [ARAMAIC].

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:52.424 align:middle line:84%
The word is, ask for
it in the method of.

00:26:52.424 --> 00:26:53.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
was the method?

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:57.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: The method of it,
and you'll see it in the Bible,

00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:02.150 align:middle line:84%
is that Jesus saw the
perfection in people

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:03.615 align:middle line:90%
and had unconditional love.

00:27:03.615 --> 00:27:04.415 align:middle line:90%
Unconditional--

00:27:04.415 --> 00:27:06.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And did not believe
in intermediaries of any kind,

00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:07.930 align:middle line:90%
including rabbis.

00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:08.730 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Correct.

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:11.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everyone has a direct
relationship with the divine.

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:12.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Right.

00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:12.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:15.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: And unconditional
was unattached to an outcome.

00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:18.960 align:middle line:84%
I saw perfection, I was
unattached to the outcome.

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:19.760 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:20.990 align:middle line:90%
It happens.

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And so through that, just
that little piece, obviously,

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:28.430 align:middle line:84%
it has enslaved
millions of people,

00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:32.080 align:middle line:84%
because they're looking at
it as, I'm not powerful.

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:32.880 align:middle line:90%
I can't do it--

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:33.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But if
I use your name,

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:34.820 align:middle line:84%
maybe I'm going to
get a better result.

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:35.217 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:27:35.217 --> 00:27:37.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah, I'm going
to ask for some help.

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:39.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying,
don't ask for help.

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:45.670 align:middle line:84%
But I'm saying that you are way
more powerful than you think.

00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:48.170 align:middle line:84%
And people often
say that, but they

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:50.090 align:middle line:84%
don't have a method
to get to it,

00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:51.510 align:middle line:84%
and here's a method
to get to it.

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:53.551 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because we need
evidence and validation

00:27:53.551 --> 00:27:55.650 align:middle line:84%
in order for something
to become true for us.

00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:58.550 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you, the reason
I resonated with your story--

00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:01.780 align:middle line:84%
and we met a few years ago
through Sheila Gillette,

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:05.270 align:middle line:84%
and Sheila channels
the THEO group.

00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:07.730 align:middle line:84%
We were talking about the work
you were doing at that time.

00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:11.060 align:middle line:90%
And then this kind of more--

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:12.800 align:middle line:84%
well, you've had
a number of years

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:14.750 align:middle line:84%
under your belt since
then in teaching

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:16.070 align:middle line:90%
this particular method.

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:19.130 align:middle line:84%
But in the interim, what
happened in my case--

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:22.800 align:middle line:84%
and it could have even
happened before that--

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:26.450 align:middle line:84%
another of our
interviewees, Steven Ross,

00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:28.690 align:middle line:90%
also knows this, right?

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:33.560 align:middle line:84%
And he alluded to it, but didn't
talk about it in our interview.

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:36.380 align:middle line:84%
But I heard him talk about
this thing, this little healing

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:39.270 align:middle line:84%
thing that he does for
people when they need it.

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And we were on other
subjects, so there

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:43.280 align:middle line:84%
was no need to go
there at that moment,

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:45.250 align:middle line:90%
but I didn't forget about it.

00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:47.910 align:middle line:84%
And it just lived in
the back of my mind.

00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:50.750 align:middle line:84%
So I was at an
event at his house

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:54.830 align:middle line:84%
in the style of people that
are seers and in Sedona.

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:57.164 align:middle line:84%
Regina, your guides
are telling my guides

00:28:57.164 --> 00:28:59.330 align:middle line:84%
I need to tell you it's
time to start healing again,

00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:01.750 align:middle line:84%
because I've had a lot of
experiences with healing

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:03.270 align:middle line:90%
of others and such.

00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:06.350 align:middle line:84%
But I forget about it, and I
don't do it for years maybe.

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:07.830 align:middle line:90%
I just forget about it.

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:09.510 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK.

00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:10.310 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I wonder
if it's that thing.

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:14.090 align:middle line:90%
So that's a Saturday night.

00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:17.820 align:middle line:84%
On a Monday, I had this
feeling of deep urgency.

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:18.620 align:middle line:90%
And I called him.

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:21.020 align:middle line:84%
I said, Steven, when
can I learn the thing?

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:22.280 align:middle line:90%
He said, come on over.

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:25.970 align:middle line:84%
Dumped out a bag of
letters onto a floor.

00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:27.770 align:middle line:84%
Said, read as many or
as few as you like.

00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:29.030 align:middle line:90%
And it was, oh my God.

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:31.820 align:middle line:84%
You know, they did the
MRI, the tumor's gone.

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:32.750 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And these kinds
of letters, right?

00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:35.570 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, OK.

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:36.820 align:middle line:90%
I had read about half a dozen.

00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:38.220 align:middle line:90%
I said, I get it.

00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:39.020 align:middle line:90%
What do I do?

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:41.150 align:middle line:84%
He handed me a piece of paper
with one paragraph on it,

00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:42.980 align:middle line:84%
kind of like what you're
doing for everyone right now.

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:43.780 align:middle line:90%
One paragraph.

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:45.880 align:middle line:90%
And I looked at it.

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:46.710 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:47.510 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:48.310 align:middle line:90%
And I left.

00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:49.200 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.000 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.340 align:middle line:84%
So the next morning,
I get a phone call,

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:54.054 align:middle line:84%
and it was a very
dear friend of mine,

00:29:54.054 --> 00:29:55.220 align:middle line:90%
and she was having a stroke.

00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:57.606 align:middle line:90%
So her voice was slurred.

00:29:57.606 --> 00:30:00.230 align:middle line:84%
From what I could tell, her son
was on the way over to get her.

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:02.900 align:middle line:84%
Her arm and leg was going,
and they were taking her

00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:04.740 align:middle line:90%
to the emergency room.

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:06.680 align:middle line:90%
And I was scared.

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, the
piece of paper.

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:09.320 align:middle line:90%
Just do it.

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:12.170 align:middle line:84%
So I went did the thing,
which is exactly what you're

00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:14.060 align:middle line:90%
talking about.

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:16.310 align:middle line:84%
It is seeing the
perfected state.

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And in my case, I added
another little layer

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:21.710 align:middle line:84%
where I just, in
a flash of light,

00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:25.750 align:middle line:84%
blended that from the perfected
state into the moment, the now.

00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:26.550 align:middle line:90%
[WHOOSH]

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:27.300 align:middle line:90%
Done.

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:28.100 align:middle line:90%
Let go of outcome.

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:29.880 align:middle line:90%
Let go of any attachment.

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:31.290 align:middle line:90%
Don't think about it again.

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:32.100 align:middle line:90%
And I did it.

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:34.050 align:middle line:90%
I just followed directions.

00:30:34.050 --> 00:30:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And so I called
her phone, thinking

00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:38.100 align:middle line:84%
her son would answer about a
half an hour, an hour later,

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:39.240 align:middle line:90%
and she answered.

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.980 align:middle line:90%
She was totally normal.

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And she said, my son saw
I was having a stroke.

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:46.020 align:middle line:84%
All the symptoms went away, and
they can't find traces of it

00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:47.480 align:middle line:90%
in my blood.

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:49.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, anyway, so I did
this a few more times,

00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:51.709 align:middle line:84%
helping people that
were in these dire--

00:30:51.709 --> 00:30:53.250 align:middle line:84%
another one was a
stroke, another one

00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:55.542 align:middle line:84%
was a very traumatic
thing that happened.

00:30:55.542 --> 00:30:57.000 align:middle line:84%
The person was
being air-vaced out,

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.220 align:middle line:84%
and they were in the
helicopter when we did it.

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And each time, it worked
just like you say.

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:04.830 align:middle line:84%
It worked exactly
in that moment.

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:06.270 align:middle line:84%
The symptoms
reversed themselves.

00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:07.740 align:middle line:84%
In the case of
another stroke, they

00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:09.840 align:middle line:84%
couldn't find the
markers in the blood,

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:12.300 align:middle line:84%
but they still had to
recover their speech.

00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:13.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Hmm.

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:13.600 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:14.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:16.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it wasn't
showing in the body,

00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:18.243 align:middle line:84%
but there was still an
effect, because there

00:31:18.243 --> 00:31:21.820 align:middle line:84%
had been a little damage
to the speech center.

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:22.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Right.

00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:23.610 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:24.530 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:31:24.530 --> 00:31:25.422 align:middle line:90%
Fantastic validation.

00:31:25.422 --> 00:31:29.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's why when you
and I were talking, I thought,

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:31.260 align:middle line:84%
I've personally
been involved in it.

00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:32.790 align:middle line:90%
It absolutely works.

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:35.995 align:middle line:84%
It is not complicated,
and it is instantaneous.

00:31:35.995 --> 00:31:36.795 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Correct.

00:31:36.795 --> 00:31:39.690 align:middle line:90%


00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:42.510 align:middle line:90%
I had trepidation, right?

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:48.210 align:middle line:84%
Years-- it took me years
to call you to say, OK.

00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:49.840 align:middle line:90%
Let's do this.

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:52.320 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons I
was able to call you

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:55.440 align:middle line:84%
is because I had
the realization.

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And the realization--
let me start

00:31:57.570 --> 00:32:01.740 align:middle line:84%
with when I first learned this,
I was like, you know what?

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:03.060 align:middle line:90%
I can't teach anybody.

00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:05.670 align:middle line:84%
I could do it, but I
can't teach anybody,

00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:09.900 align:middle line:84%
because it's like giving a
nuclear bomb to somebody.

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:12.135 align:middle line:90%
Imagine the power of this.

00:32:12.135 --> 00:32:14.470 align:middle line:90%
You can change things.

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:17.910 align:middle line:90%
And so I was like, wow.

00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:19.950 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's
sacred information.

00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And it kind of goes back to the
Hermetic teachings, the Cabala.

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:27.630 align:middle line:84%
All of these different teachings
had kind of veiled it over.

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:30.009 align:middle line:84%
I had heard about it,
but it was veiled.

00:32:30.009 --> 00:32:31.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I understand
that, and that's

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:35.060 align:middle line:84%
why I never speak about it,
because of this same thing.

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:36.310 align:middle line:90%
Is it time?

00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:38.460 align:middle line:90%
Is it time for people to--

00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:41.420 align:middle line:84%
everyone to start doing this
on their own behalf and behalf

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:42.220 align:middle line:90%
of others?

00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:45.090 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I wanted
to do this with you--

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:46.830 align:middle line:84%
because I've had
the same concern--

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:49.350 align:middle line:84%
is that I believe
the time has arrived.

00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:51.840 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about the
caveat you were about to say.

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Well, you're right.

00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:56.280 align:middle line:84%
The time is here
and now for this.

00:32:56.280 --> 00:33:03.362 align:middle line:84%
And the big thing was the
realization, like, I get it.

00:33:03.362 --> 00:33:06.690 align:middle line:90%
There is a safety on this gun.

00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:09.060 align:middle line:84%
It's a gun, but
there is a safety.

00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And the safety is that you
have shifted from wanting,

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.400 align:middle line:84%
thwarted wanting,
and indifference

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:20.580 align:middle line:90%
to some derivative of love.

00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:23.000 align:middle line:90%
Unconditional love.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:31.215 align:middle line:84%
And with unconditional love,
you can't do any wrong.

00:33:31.215 --> 00:33:34.290 align:middle line:84%
When I think about it-- you
know, because I tried, right?

00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:36.120 align:middle line:90%
I was like, hey, this is great.

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:37.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to go win the lottery.

00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:38.713 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:33:38.713 --> 00:33:39.513 align:middle line:90%
Daddy needs--

00:33:39.513 --> 00:33:40.360 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:41.710 align:middle line:90%
--Daddy needs some money.

00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:43.560 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:45.150 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:46.410 align:middle line:90%
It takes--

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:48.202 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
there's too much desire--

00:33:48.202 --> 00:33:49.001 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Wanting.

00:33:49.001 --> 00:33:50.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --wanting,
fear behind it.

00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:50.850 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:51.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Exactly.

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:54.690 align:middle line:90%
So all the manipulations, right?

00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:58.740 align:middle line:84%
Every bit of manipulation,
whether it's a psychic meaning,

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:00.840 align:middle line:84%
I want you to behave
in a certain way,

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:06.090 align:middle line:84%
or I'm so afraid because you've
got a tumor, and I just--

00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:08.670 align:middle line:90%
I want it so bad to go away.

00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, I
have no effect on it.

00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:14.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:14.370 --> 00:34:16.199 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: The way
I have an effect

00:34:16.199 --> 00:34:19.469 align:middle line:84%
is being unattached to
the outcome and being,

00:34:19.469 --> 00:34:21.870 align:middle line:84%
for example, in a
state of gratitude.

00:34:21.870 --> 00:34:24.659 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Gratitude, yes.

00:34:24.659 --> 00:34:28.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Which brings me to
one of the other discoveries.

00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And like I said
earlier, these things

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:34.300 align:middle line:84%
continue to get more
and more ridiculous.

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:39.409 align:middle line:84%
And that is that I
understood the ego now.

00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:41.370 align:middle line:90%
I understood dimensions.

00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:45.420 align:middle line:84%
I understood consciousness
or levels of understanding.

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:47.170 align:middle line:90%
And I was late.

00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:50.820 align:middle line:84%
I was late to--
every week, I make

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:55.530 align:middle line:84%
an hour and 45-minute drive
from San Diego to Riverside.

00:34:55.530 --> 00:34:58.680 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm out of
the house at 8:15,

00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:00.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to make it
right at 10 o'clock.

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:06.820 align:middle line:84%
Set the cruise control at 70
so I don't get any tickets.

00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, that's
my weekly routine.

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:15.980 align:middle line:84%
I end up a series of
unfortunate events.

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:19.040 align:middle line:84%
I ended up getting out
of the house at 8:45,

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:21.270 align:middle line:90%
half an hour later.

00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I had
to get gas as well.

00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:26.956 align:middle line:90%
Even later now.

00:35:26.956 --> 00:35:28.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm on the road, and
I'm like, you know what?

00:35:28.830 --> 00:35:30.121 align:middle line:90%
I started-- it just came to me.

00:35:30.121 --> 00:35:31.690 align:middle line:90%
I was like, you know what?

00:35:31.690 --> 00:35:35.480 align:middle line:84%
Time's malleable in the
fourth and fifth dimensions.

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:36.280 align:middle line:90%
And all--

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:38.284 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're
multidimensional.

00:35:38.284 --> 00:35:39.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: We all are.

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.325 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you transfer
that to traffic patterns

00:35:41.325 --> 00:35:42.150 align:middle line:90%
in your car, right?

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:45.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Can I-- or,
which is another one, which

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:47.980 align:middle line:90%
I can get to.

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:52.290 align:middle line:84%
Or can I actually
get there on time?

00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:56.160 align:middle line:90%
And set the speedometer at 70.

00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:00.930 align:middle line:84%
What I did is I decided that
I would just feel gratitude

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:02.530 align:middle line:90%
for no reason.

00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:03.420 align:middle line:90%
And I did.

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:06.090 align:middle line:84%
I felt gratitude for
everything, gratitude

00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:09.300 align:middle line:84%
for everyone in my life,
gratitude for my child,

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:12.360 align:middle line:84%
my wife, for the trees,
for the air, for the fact

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:16.060 align:middle line:84%
that I have hands and gas
in the car, and my breath.

00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:19.050 align:middle line:84%
I just felt gratitude
for no reason.

00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:21.560 align:middle line:90%
Just, I was very grateful.

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well, okay I'm
going to be there at 9:55.

00:36:25.590 --> 00:36:27.360 align:middle line:90%
I'll be there at 9:55.

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And I let go of the
clock, meaning I

00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:32.220 align:middle line:90%
didn't look at the clock again.

00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:35.370 align:middle line:90%
I let go of my anxiety, right?

00:36:35.370 --> 00:36:38.760 align:middle line:90%
So back to the basics.

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:42.280 align:middle line:84%
If I'm late, which I've always
been late before, and I'm like,

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:45.050 align:middle line:84%
I want to be there,
and I'm not--

00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:47.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm afraid of if
I don't get there

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:49.680 align:middle line:90%
on time, the repercussions.

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:54.480 align:middle line:84%
Third dimension or back in
my ego, I left it behind.

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:55.690 align:middle line:90%
No anxiety.

00:36:55.690 --> 00:36:57.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because there's
no ego in gratitude.

00:36:57.970 --> 00:36:58.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Right.

00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:00.250 align:middle line:90%
Just gratitude.

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:03.000 align:middle line:90%
And I set the time.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.310 align:middle line:84%
I think once during the
time, I was like, hey.

00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:07.393 align:middle line:84%
You know, you've got to
be-- and I was like, yeah.

00:37:07.393 --> 00:37:08.680 align:middle line:90%
9:55, I'll be there.

00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:09.480 align:middle line:90%
And I just kept--

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:11.010 align:middle line:90%
I just drove, you know?

00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:13.050 align:middle line:90%
Cruise control.

00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:13.980 align:middle line:90%
9:55.

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:15.210 align:middle line:90%
Ba-binga!

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:16.350 align:middle line:90%
I was like, what?

00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:19.710 align:middle line:84%
I should have been
here later than 10:40.

00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:24.630 align:middle line:84%
You know, so anyway,
it actually worked.

00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:29.190 align:middle line:84%
I ended up holding a class
and teaching others this,

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:32.950 align:middle line:84%
and the stories came back
even better than my stories,

00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:33.750 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:35.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
anyone's capable of this

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:38.530 align:middle line:84%
if you can just do those
three things you talked about.

00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:39.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:39.900 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:41.358 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
know, sometimes I

00:37:41.358 --> 00:37:43.830 align:middle line:84%
think with people, unless
they've been meditating

00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:45.840 align:middle line:84%
for a while or
something like that,

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:48.750 align:middle line:84%
many people have a very hard
time finding what they think

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:50.550 align:middle line:84%
is the state of
unconditional love,

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:53.760 align:middle line:84%
because it's a nebulous
zone, because it's not

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:57.110 align:middle line:84%
a sentimental, familiar
kind of human love.

00:37:57.110 --> 00:38:00.980 align:middle line:84%
And what do you think
about various means?

00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:03.750 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing that
popped in my mind, for example,

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:06.450 align:middle line:84%
is certain music
that helps lift you

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:10.020 align:middle line:84%
into this state of
just pure openness

00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:12.390 align:middle line:84%
and acceptance in the
moment of everything.

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:14.520 align:middle line:84%
Life is beautiful
in that moment.

00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:16.942 align:middle line:84%
To give a feeling
of what that's like,

00:38:16.942 --> 00:38:18.900 align:middle line:84%
so then you can kind of
magnetize yourself back

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:20.460 align:middle line:90%
into it.

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:23.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Whatever helps
you to get to that state.

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:25.152 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the
Tibetans, right?

00:38:25.152 --> 00:38:26.735 align:middle line:84%
You heard the monks,
and they're all--

00:38:26.735 --> 00:38:27.600 align:middle line:90%
[CHANTING]

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:30.270 align:middle line:90%
--and the bowls, and all that.

00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:31.480 align:middle line:90%
All the gongs, all that--

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:32.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:34.170 align:middle line:84%
And some of it's very
entraining toward that.

00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:34.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:36.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: That's its purpose.

00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:38.460 align:middle line:84%
They have figured
out, its purpose

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:41.490 align:middle line:84%
is to help to put
them into the state,

00:38:41.490 --> 00:38:44.970 align:middle line:84%
to shove them up into the
fourth and fifth dimensions.

00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:46.860 align:middle line:84%
So it's a tool to
help you get there.

00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:47.760 align:middle line:90%
So whatever that is--

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:49.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There are
so many CDs alone,

00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:51.240 align:middle line:84%
just on whether it's
Tibetan chanting,

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:53.100 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's on
beautiful, you know,

00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:55.500 align:middle line:84%
music that just takes
you into ethereal realms.

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And you're really talking
about accessing another realm

00:38:59.490 --> 00:39:03.900 align:middle line:84%
that our being is familiar with,
even if our conscious, waking

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:06.120 align:middle line:90%
experience isn't familiar with.

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:06.960 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:07.760 align:middle line:90%
We go there.

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:09.900 align:middle line:90%
We go there when we go to sleep.

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:13.410 align:middle line:84%
Unless a person is so
deeply, deeply damaged

00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:17.100 align:middle line:84%
that they've disconnected
from themselves,

00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:19.390 align:middle line:84%
this realm is
available to everyone.

00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:20.190 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes.

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:21.690 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it is.

00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And to give an example of how
available this is, I live down

00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:30.960 align:middle line:90%
on the beach in San Diego.

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:34.470 align:middle line:84%
We have a large
population of homeless.

00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:38.570 align:middle line:84%
So when I figured
this out, you know,

00:39:38.570 --> 00:39:42.900 align:middle line:84%
I went down the boardwalk,
and anybody I could,

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:44.570 align:middle line:90%
I would heal, right?

00:39:44.570 --> 00:39:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And I'd say-- you know, they'd
ask for a dollar or whatever,

00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:47.700 align:middle line:90%
and I'd give them a dollar.

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:48.210 align:middle line:90%
And I'd say, hey.

00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:49.010 align:middle line:90%
You got some pain?

00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you know,
if you're homeless, right?

00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:52.490 align:middle line:90%
You've got pain.

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:54.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, my foot.

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:56.072 align:middle line:90%
OK, what's it at?

00:39:56.072 --> 00:39:58.110 align:middle line:84%
It's a five or
something like that.

00:39:58.110 --> 00:39:58.980 align:middle line:90%
I was like, OK.

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:00.030 align:middle line:90%
You want it to go away?

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:01.130 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:01.130 --> 00:40:01.930 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

00:40:01.930 --> 00:40:02.780 align:middle line:90%
Did it.

00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:03.630 align:middle line:90%
Worked.

00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:04.290 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:05.150 align:middle line:90%
You got it?

00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:07.084 align:middle line:84%
And they were real
happy that their stuff--

00:40:07.084 --> 00:40:08.250 align:middle line:90%
they're a little blown away.

00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:10.020 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK.

00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:12.700 align:middle line:90%
Now you do it to your buddy.

00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, you
know, they run in packs.

00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:16.510 align:middle line:90%
And it was like, OK.

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And I would walk
them through it.

00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:20.190 align:middle line:90%
All I want you to do is this.

00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:24.470 align:middle line:84%
To see him, your friend
here that's also homeless,

00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:27.920 align:middle line:84%
see him as perfect, as
happy, and blissful,

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:29.240 align:middle line:90%
and don't want anything.

00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:32.560 align:middle line:90%
Be detached from the outcome.

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And boom, they did it,
like, within minutes.

00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:37.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:40.220 align:middle line:84%
Because even though maybe
in some cases, sometimes

00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:42.396 align:middle line:84%
there's alcohol or
drug dependencies,

00:40:42.396 --> 00:40:44.270 align:middle line:84%
you know, and we think
that the consciousness

00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:46.270 align:middle line:84%
would be maybe a little
more difficult to reach.

00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:48.560 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm hearing
you say is that if you

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:51.410 align:middle line:84%
can go into that place of
just visioning that perfection

00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:53.990 align:middle line:84%
and love, no matter
what state you're in,

00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:55.940 align:middle line:90%
you can affect an outcome.

00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:58.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: I can't even
tell you how many--

00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:00.156 align:middle line:90%
how many have done it.

00:41:00.156 --> 00:41:01.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I just love this.

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:03.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: We have a
very empowered population

00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:04.460 align:middle line:90%
of homeless in San Diego.

00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:06.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is wonderful.

00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:07.790 align:middle line:90%
And pain-free, hopefully.

00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:10.040 align:middle line:90%
Or approaching pain-free.

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:11.330 align:middle line:90%
What about kids?

00:41:11.330 --> 00:41:14.660 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems to me that the
best place to start with this

00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:16.400 align:middle line:90%
is with children.

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:19.280 align:middle line:84%
So we make a lifelong
practice, because it

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:21.260 align:middle line:84%
will alter our
reality probably more

00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:25.400 align:middle line:84%
than any other single thing in
terms of peaceful relations,

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:29.030 align:middle line:84%
potentials to create closer
to the speed of thought

00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:30.890 align:middle line:90%
in a good way.

00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:34.070 align:middle line:84%
Our health profile as
we age through life.

00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:36.190 align:middle line:84%
Have you done
anything with kids?

00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:38.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: You know, I haven't.

00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:42.650 align:middle line:84%
I've taught teenagers, and
they're very receptive.

00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:45.590 align:middle line:84%
And you know, they take to
it like a fish to water.

00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:48.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you find an age
or kind of a cutoff line where

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:52.737 align:middle line:84%
they can manage this
kind of clear focus,

00:41:52.737 --> 00:41:54.320 align:middle line:84%
prior to that where
they simply can't?

00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:56.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is there a
cutoff age in general?

00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:58.230 align:middle line:90%
I know every child is different.

00:41:58.230 --> 00:42:02.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah, you know,
I haven't done enough work

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:03.290 align:middle line:90%
through the ages.

00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:07.070 align:middle line:84%
I've only worked with
people maybe 16 and older.

00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:10.340 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's
probably the threshold.

00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:14.730 align:middle line:84%
Very young children, I've
done healings on them,

00:42:14.730 --> 00:42:18.180 align:middle line:84%
and they're incredibly
receptive to it.

00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:21.680 align:middle line:84%
As a child, maybe a
seven-year-old child

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:23.270 align:middle line:90%
had an earache.

00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And very, very fast, very
fast, within minutes, the pain

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:33.940 align:middle line:84%
went away, and could hear
fine, and that sort of thing.

00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:37.070 align:middle line:84%
So I find them to
be very receptive.

00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:39.824 align:middle line:84%
Haven't actually
taught them, but that's

00:42:39.824 --> 00:42:41.990 align:middle line:84%
an interesting thing, and
I think I'd like to do it.

00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:43.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It would be fun
to play maybe with a little

00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:45.390 align:middle line:84%
younger group and see
if they're at all--

00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:47.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's a point at
which you just can't concentrate

00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:48.310 align:middle line:90%
till you're a certain age.

00:42:48.310 --> 00:42:50.393 align:middle line:84%
You're fidgety and your
mind's all over the place.

00:42:50.393 --> 00:42:53.720 align:middle line:84%
But whatever that point may
be, whether it's nine, 10, 11,

00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:54.520 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:57.440 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you have to wait till
people are past puberty.

00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:59.480 align:middle line:84%
But this gets into
the concept of what

00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:02.370 align:middle line:84%
you brought up before, is
this is a very powerful tool.

00:43:02.370 --> 00:43:06.920 align:middle line:84%
You were hesitant to contact
me and talk about it publicly,

00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:09.650 align:middle line:84%
for reasons I already
said I understand.

00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:13.780 align:middle line:90%
And there's this-- it's not--

00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:16.220 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know
if it's a fine line.

00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:19.820 align:middle line:84%
But the power of the mind
to override physical reality

00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:21.890 align:middle line:84%
and recreate
physical reality has

00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:25.310 align:middle line:84%
been well known since the
beginning of humankind.

00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:29.300 align:middle line:84%
Things such as black
magicians, you know,

00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:33.080 align:middle line:84%
the practicing of
black magic does exist,

00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:36.890 align:middle line:90%
and it does have its effect.

00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:39.770 align:middle line:84%
How do you interface
with the notion

00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:43.280 align:middle line:84%
that you can't heal and get this
sublime outcome without going

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:45.530 align:middle line:84%
into that sublime
state yourself?

00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that there are
others who can literally

00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:53.570 align:middle line:84%
inject and impose their will
and clear intention for harm,

00:43:53.570 --> 00:43:56.040 align:middle line:84%
and have done so
throughout history?

00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:58.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: I don't have really
a lot of experience with that.

00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:00.808 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, no, because
it's really the opposite.

00:44:00.808 --> 00:44:03.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: It's kind
of the opposite of it.

00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:07.370 align:middle line:84%
One thing that I've
found is those things--

00:44:07.370 --> 00:44:14.380 align:middle line:84%
that everything is one
big return to sender.

00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:19.640 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, I write the letter,
and I sent it out to Joe Blow,

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:21.020 align:middle line:90%
and it's a lie.

00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:27.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, he never lies back
to me, but Sally Sue

00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:29.270 align:middle line:90%
sends the message back to me.

00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:35.540 align:middle line:84%
So very much in reality
it is a return to sender.

00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And because we're accessing
that realm of oneness,

00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:43.112 align:middle line:84%
everything starts
to return faster.

00:44:43.112 --> 00:44:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we
just have to assume

00:44:44.570 --> 00:44:47.570 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to stay over
in this realm of creating

00:44:47.570 --> 00:44:49.772 align:middle line:90%
positive, lovely outcomes.

00:44:49.772 --> 00:44:51.230 align:middle line:84%
Another realm where
people might be

00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:54.130 align:middle line:84%
playing with those
arts in a darker way.

00:44:54.130 --> 00:44:56.660 align:middle line:84%
The twain don't-- never
the twain shall meet.

00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:58.640 align:middle line:90%
These do not have to intersect.

00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:01.010 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just saying,
I'm validating

00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:04.850 align:middle line:84%
your original concern that
using clear mental power

00:45:04.850 --> 00:45:08.170 align:middle line:84%
can have an outcome,
good or bad.

00:45:08.170 --> 00:45:10.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Well,
in the way that I

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:13.760 align:middle line:84%
am teaching it, and in
my actual experience,

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:16.970 align:middle line:90%
is that the safety is my ego.

00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And because of the
separation, our ego

00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:25.670 align:middle line:90%
makes separation, right?

00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And the evidence of it
is very, very clear.

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:32.740 align:middle line:84%
In everybody's practical
life right here today,

00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:35.680 align:middle line:84%
how many things are
we wanting or upset

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:37.080 align:middle line:90%
about that are not changing?

00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:37.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:39.338 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: You
know, so it's like--

00:45:39.338 --> 00:45:40.990 align:middle line:90%
[GROANING], right?

00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:42.310 align:middle line:90%
So that is the evidence.

00:45:42.310 --> 00:45:43.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, it
is the evidence.

00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:47.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: And what I'm
showing is the evidence of how

00:45:47.890 --> 00:45:52.510 align:middle line:84%
to access it in a way that
will produce a positive--

00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:55.420 align:middle line:84%
has no ability to
produce anything

00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:57.180 align:middle line:90%
but a positive outcome.

00:45:57.180 --> 00:45:58.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:58.090 --> 00:46:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And I think what we can do for
ourselves is simply absolutely

00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:03.100 align:middle line:84%
reject any kind of
negative visions

00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:06.340 align:middle line:84%
that are counter to what you
wish to express or develop

00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:09.310 align:middle line:84%
in your life, or in
assisting someone else.

00:46:09.310 --> 00:46:11.772 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise,
those thoughts--

00:46:11.772 --> 00:46:13.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the power of
thoughts, as we all know--

00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:14.980 align:middle line:90%
I don't have to go into that--

00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:16.840 align:middle line:84%
can create in any
direction you want.

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And as you say, you're
doing it clean and clear.

00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:22.052 align:middle line:84%
The other person doesn't have
a particular mindset when

00:46:22.052 --> 00:46:23.260 align:middle line:90%
they're on the receiving end.

00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:26.860 align:middle line:84%
But just make sure you're not
going into negative mindsets,

00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:28.900 align:middle line:90%
because those will also trump.

00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:31.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Typically,
those negative mindsets

00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:34.570 align:middle line:84%
are going to drop us down
into the third dimension.

00:46:34.570 --> 00:46:36.450 align:middle line:84%
They're going to drop
us down into our ego.

00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:39.360 align:middle line:84%
I won't have a negative
thought without a

00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:41.660 align:middle line:84%
want, a thwarted want,
or an indifference.

00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:42.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:44.410 align:middle line:84%
But when you go to
that next realm,

00:46:44.410 --> 00:46:45.590 align:middle line:90%
that stuff doesn't exist.

00:46:45.590 --> 00:46:46.390 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:46.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:47.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:49.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Any final
thoughts on this, Bill,

00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:50.811 align:middle line:84%
that we haven't
gotten around to yet?

00:46:50.811 --> 00:46:53.380 align:middle line:90%


00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:54.730 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: No.

00:46:54.730 --> 00:46:56.920 align:middle line:90%
That was about it.

00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:59.590 align:middle line:84%
I would say that
there's so much more

00:46:59.590 --> 00:47:01.855 align:middle line:90%
that can be done with this.

00:47:01.855 --> 00:47:04.120 align:middle line:84%
As long somebody has
these basic building

00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:07.940 align:middle line:84%
blocks of understanding, they
can start to utilize it today.

00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And your first experiences
will be shocking.

00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:16.300 align:middle line:84%
And I would say to encourage
you to just keep going,

00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:19.422 align:middle line:84%
and you won't believe it until
you get five, 10, 15 people--

00:47:19.422 --> 00:47:21.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you need to
validate it for yourself.

00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:23.088 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: You need
to validate it.

00:47:23.088 --> 00:47:24.570 align:middle line:90%
Then it'll become true.

00:47:24.570 --> 00:47:27.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so just
as a favor to all of us,

00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:29.830 align:middle line:84%
go through the simple steps
again for everybody one more

00:47:29.830 --> 00:47:32.811 align:middle line:84%
time so when people go
away from this interview,

00:47:32.811 --> 00:47:34.810 align:middle line:84%
it's fresh in their minds
what to do, and can go

00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:35.870 align:middle line:90%
do it right now.

00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:36.230 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes.

00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:37.170 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:47:37.170 --> 00:47:39.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And animals
respond well to it as well.

00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:39.710 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes.

00:47:39.710 --> 00:47:40.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They
have no resistance.

00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:41.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah, they do.

00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:42.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:47:42.550 --> 00:47:44.530 align:middle line:84%
You can do it with their
bowl of water, right?

00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:50.020 align:middle line:84%
So quite simply, we'll use
the water example this time.

00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:53.230 align:middle line:84%
All I do is the
first thing is, I'll

00:47:53.230 --> 00:47:56.985 align:middle line:84%
ask the person, scale of one
to 10, what's it at right now?

00:47:56.985 --> 00:47:58.610 align:middle line:84%
Because you need to
have a measurement.

00:47:58.610 --> 00:48:00.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it can be
emotional or physical,

00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:01.090 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:48:01.090 --> 00:48:01.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Doesn't matter.

00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:02.851 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's bothering you?

00:48:02.851 --> 00:48:04.180 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Whatever.

00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And then all you do,
tip of the tongue

00:48:07.090 --> 00:48:12.130 align:middle line:84%
to the roof of the mouth, and
you see this person or pet

00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:15.100 align:middle line:90%
or whoever in the water.

00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:17.140 align:middle line:90%
It's lit up like the sun.

00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:20.860 align:middle line:84%
And you just see them
in absolute bliss.

00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:24.940 align:middle line:84%
You want nothing from them,
you're unafraid of any outcome,

00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:26.887 align:middle line:90%
you're unafraid of being judged.

00:48:26.887 --> 00:48:28.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're unafraid
of it not working.

00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:30.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Not working.

00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:34.540 align:middle line:84%
All you do is just look at--
you see them in perfect--

00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:38.450 align:middle line:84%
you want absolutely nothing, not
even an acknowledgement is what

00:48:38.450 --> 00:48:39.250 align:middle line:90%
you're--

00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:41.910 align:middle line:84%
or to think that, oh, you're
so great, or whatever.

00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:42.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:43.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Just that.

00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:45.580 align:middle line:90%
You just see them perfect.

00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:47.620 align:middle line:90%
You see them in the water.

00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:53.980 align:middle line:84%
Hold that thought for maybe
30 seconds or so, 45 seconds,

00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:55.540 align:middle line:90%
and then give them the water.

00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And you have them walk
around a little bit,

00:48:58.570 --> 00:49:02.720 align:middle line:84%
and now put it on a
scale of one to 10 again.

00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:05.440 align:middle line:84%
It'll drop down from--
let's say it was an eight.

00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:08.080 align:middle line:84%
It'll drop down to, let's
say, you know, a seven.

00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:10.660 align:middle line:84%
And once that's done, have
them drink a little more,

00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:11.590 align:middle line:90%
walk around.

00:49:11.590 --> 00:49:14.090 align:middle line:90%
And boom.

00:49:14.090 --> 00:49:17.770 align:middle line:84%
It'll start dropping like five,
four, three, zero, you know.

00:49:17.770 --> 00:49:19.630 align:middle line:90%
That sort of thing.

00:49:19.630 --> 00:49:21.500 align:middle line:84%
So that's basically
how you do it.

00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:22.300 align:middle line:90%
It's very simple.

00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:23.466 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is very simple.

00:49:23.466 --> 00:49:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And I can verify it
absolutely works.

00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it's
such a gift that you've

00:49:29.350 --> 00:49:30.580 align:middle line:90%
given to all these people.

00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:32.380 align:middle line:84%
I love the fact
you work with kids.

00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:34.120 align:middle line:84%
I love the fact you
work with homeless.

00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:36.460 align:middle line:84%
I love the fact you
work in corporations.

00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:38.077 align:middle line:90%
It just shows each one of us--

00:49:38.077 --> 00:49:39.660 align:middle line:84%
and you're reminding
us, even if we've

00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:42.670 align:middle line:84%
heard some of the
basic principles of,

00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:46.420 align:middle line:84%
yeah, we can do this-- but
you're reminding everybody

00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:49.300 align:middle line:84%
that it is completely within
their power to go and do this.

00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:51.532 align:middle line:84%
Even bending time
with gratitude.

00:49:51.532 --> 00:49:52.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: There we go.

00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:55.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Practical, real,
all coming from a higher place

00:49:55.690 --> 00:49:58.460 align:middle line:84%
that we need to be accessing
in ourselves anyway.

00:49:58.460 --> 00:49:59.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:49:59.260 --> 00:49:59.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:00.560 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:02.050 align:middle line:10%
So well-- again, I just--

00:50:02.050 --> 00:50:04.510 align:middle line:10%
I love what you do and
your enthusiasm about it,

00:50:04.510 --> 00:50:06.440 align:middle line:10%
and I'm glad you
did reach out to me.

00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:06.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Thank you.

00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:08.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it was good to
see you again after these years.

00:50:08.770 --> 00:50:09.610 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Likewise.

00:50:09.610 --> 00:50:10.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And by the
way, it's interesting.

00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:12.010 align:middle line:90%
You don't have anything to sell.

00:50:12.010 --> 00:50:13.260 align:middle line:10%
You don't even have a website.

00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:14.289 align:middle line:90%
This is a freebie.

00:50:14.289 --> 00:50:15.330 align:middle line:90%
It's a gift to all of us.

00:50:15.330 --> 00:50:16.131 align:middle line:90%
Thanks again.

00:50:16.131 --> 00:50:17.213 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: You're welcome.

00:50:17.213 --> 00:50:18.070 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: All right.

00:50:18.070 --> 00:50:20.281 align:middle line:10%
I hope you found this
useful and uplifting.
