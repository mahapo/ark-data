00:00:03.444 --> 00:00:22.670 align:middle line:90%


00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.170 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MERIDETH:
I think all of us

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.360 align:middle line:10%
have wondered from time
to time about the nature

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.000 align:middle line:10%
of strange phenomena.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.740 align:middle line:10%
Are elves, fairies,
and dragons real?

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.650 align:middle line:84%
How about Bigfoot and
the Loch Ness Monster?

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And what about those
pictographs of helicopters

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.650 align:middle line:90%
on Egyptian temple walls?

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.310 align:middle line:84%
Today we're going to ask those
questions of Sheila Gillette's

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:41.970 align:middle line:90%
channeled group called Theo.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.900 align:middle line:84%
But first let's find out how
Sheila began her channeling.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.842 align:middle line:84%
Sheila, it's wonderful
to have you here again.

00:00:46.842 --> 00:00:47.550 align:middle line:90%
This is our what?

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.610 align:middle line:90%
Maybe fifth-- fourth, fifth?

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEILA GILLETTE:
Fourth or fifth, yeah.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Something like that.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.130 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we did this with Conscious
Media Network a few times.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.922 align:middle line:90%
And now we're back.

00:00:54.922 --> 00:00:57.088 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It's great to
be with you again, Regina.

00:00:57.088 --> 00:00:58.440 align:middle line:90%
It's really fun to see you.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.398 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you, too.

00:00:59.398 --> 00:01:01.967 align:middle line:84%
And for our audience who
is not already familiar

00:01:01.967 --> 00:01:03.800 align:middle line:84%
with your work, let's
just talk a little bit

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.980 align:middle line:84%
about the original
near-death experience

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.932 align:middle line:84%
and how you ended up in this
situation all those years ago.

00:01:09.932 --> 00:01:11.390 align:middle line:84%
How many years ago
did that happen?

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.265 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Oh, gosh.

00:01:12.265 --> 00:01:13.160 align:middle line:90%
It was 1969.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.040 align:middle line:90%
45 years.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: 45 years
you've been doing this.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.060 align:middle line:84%
This is way before anyone
knew what channeling was.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Yeah, I've
been around a long time.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.288 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And few people
watching this know it,

00:01:22.288 --> 00:01:24.280 align:middle line:84%
but you were the mentor
for Esther Hicks.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.740 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: I was.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the Abraham
group coming through.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.228 align:middle line:84%
Because you and the Theo
group where the ones--

00:01:28.228 --> 00:01:30.720 align:middle line:90%
she was a devotee of your work.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.570 align:middle line:84%
And the Theo group told her
she could do a similar thing

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.310 align:middle line:84%
and bring another
group waiting through.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.800 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.591 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
how that all got done.

00:01:37.591 --> 00:01:39.467 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: That
started way back then.

00:01:39.467 --> 00:01:40.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.910 align:middle line:90%
But for you, what happened?

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.010 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: For me, I had a
near-death experience in 1969

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.110 align:middle line:84%
after the birth of
one of my daughters.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.870 align:middle line:90%
And I had pulmonary embolus.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:55.730 align:middle line:84%
I had an experience of a
healing, a miraculous healing

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.670 align:middle line:90%
in the intensive care unit.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.750 align:middle line:84%
My lungs were both
full of fluid.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.230 align:middle line:84%
I had the doctors
telling my family

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.630 align:middle line:84%
that I wasn't going to
make it through the day.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.039 align:middle line:84%
And I was laying there on my
little cubicle bed, going,

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.330 align:middle line:90%
hey, God, give me a job.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.020 align:middle line:90%
I had two little kids at home.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.490 align:middle line:90%
I had a brand-new baby.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And I just-- I
want to stay here.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.970 align:middle line:90%
I want to raise my children.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.010 align:middle line:84%
And that was like a
mantra I kept repeating.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.740 align:middle line:84%
And at one moment, I saw the
movement at the end of my bed.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.620 align:middle line:90%
And I focused on it.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.720 align:middle line:84%
And the room became
extremely bright,

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.940 align:middle line:84%
just as if the sun had
risen in the room itself.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus was standing
at the end of my bed.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.744 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, whoa.

00:02:37.744 --> 00:02:39.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Whoa, what
are you doing here?

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.118 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Whoa.

00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:41.140 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And I was just
mesmerized by his eyes.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.050 align:middle line:90%
And he smiled at me.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.385 align:middle line:84%
And he crossed his arms
in this-- he had a cloak.

00:02:52.385 --> 00:02:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And he crossed his
arms like this.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.400 align:middle line:10%
And then he smiled.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.240 align:middle line:10%
And I heard on my inner
hearing, my inner mind hearing,

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.710 align:middle line:10%
a distinct male voice say,
"Remember, my child, you

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:05.970 align:middle line:10%
are loved."

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.900 align:middle line:84%
That point, I felt
the crown of my head

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.490 align:middle line:84%
open up, and this warm honey--
it felt like warm honey--

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.630 align:middle line:84%
being poured in and
relaxing my whole body.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.210 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't breathe.

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.629 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I had an
elephant sitting on my chest.

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:19.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Because of the fluid?

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.860 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Because of
the fluid in my lungs.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And when this warmth went
down through my body,

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.210 align:middle line:84%
I felt like it went [GASPING]
like I was being breathed.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.570 align:middle line:10%
And he just smiled at me.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.424 align:middle line:10%
And it could have been seconds.

00:03:36.424 --> 00:03:37.465 align:middle line:10%
It could have been hours.

00:03:37.465 --> 00:03:39.380 align:middle line:10%
It was out of time.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.370 align:middle line:84%
But when that happened, I
just completely relaxed.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.680 align:middle line:90%
And I knew I was going to be OK.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And the light
dimmed in the room.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.870 align:middle line:90%
And I started getting better.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And the doctors didn't know
why, because they were preparing

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.900 align:middle line:84%
my family that I wasn't going
to make it through the day.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The lungs
started clearing?

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.066 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: They
started clearing.

00:03:59.066 --> 00:04:01.280 align:middle line:90%
And I started getting better.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And I was in the
hospital for a month.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:10.180 align:middle line:84%
But when I got home, six
months after that event,

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.540 align:middle line:84%
I started having all kinds of
psychic phenomena happening

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.800 align:middle line:84%
internally, externally, messages
being given me in that same way

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.420 align:middle line:84%
that I was spoken to by
Jesus, and information I

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.050 align:middle line:84%
couldn't possibly
have known about.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.510 align:middle line:90%
Could do automatic writing.

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And in the automatic
writing I got prose.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.730 align:middle line:84%
First I would get a paragraph
in Castilian Spanish, which

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.760 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know, and then
a paragraph in English

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.170 align:middle line:90%
and a paragraph in Spanish.

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And I had to find somebody
that could translate it for me.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.795 align:middle line:84%
And what was happening is
that the angels and the spirit

00:04:47.795 --> 00:04:50.710 align:middle line:84%
guides, they were
giving the Spanish

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.060 align:middle line:84%
and then translating it
into the English for me.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.820 align:middle line:84%
So that I knew, that
I could be assured

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.170 align:middle line:90%
that this wasn't coming from me.

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.070 align:middle line:84%
These are things I couldn't
have done on my own.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.800 align:middle line:84%
And they knew I was pretty
analytical and skeptical.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.190 align:middle line:84%
Not skeptical in
a way of blockage,

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.880 align:middle line:90%
but in the just-- is this me?

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:11.740 align:middle line:90%
Am I crazy?

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.990 align:middle line:90%
Or is this really real?

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And then I was given
information about Watergate

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.640 align:middle line:84%
before it happened,
and years later

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.280 align:middle line:84%
had the privilege of
meeting John Erlichman that

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.210 align:middle line:90%
confirmed what I had received.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.540 align:middle line:84%
And then it's just
gone from there.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.260 align:middle line:84%
I worked with
scientists and research

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.570 align:middle line:84%
and was tested for my
psychic ability, which

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.730 align:middle line:84%
was really nice, giving me the
Housekeeping Seal of Approval

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:43.010 align:middle line:84%
that I was psychic and not
a walking crazy person.

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:44.879 align:middle line:84%
Because back in
1969, these things

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:45.920 align:middle line:90%
weren't openly discussed.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.461 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, the
word "channeling"

00:05:47.461 --> 00:05:48.945 align:middle line:84%
wasn't even really
used back then.

00:05:48.945 --> 00:05:49.736 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: No, no.

00:05:49.736 --> 00:05:52.830 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't even
coined as a phrase.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.360 align:middle line:84%
The title that I was
given, a spiritual medium

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.790 align:middle line:84%
is the title I was given,
a trance spiritual medium,

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:03.020 align:middle line:90%
which actually I kind of prefer.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.770 align:middle line:84%
Because the other thing that's
so familiar and so popular,

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:12.460 align:middle line:84%
called channeling, it can be
overused and abused a bit.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it's turned out
to be-- it's utilized-- it cuts

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.980 align:middle line:84%
a broad swath of phenomena
and communication.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.260 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes, it does.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's one
thing-- I agree with you.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't particularly care
for that term myself,

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.940 align:middle line:84%
simply because a person might
be simply getting guidance

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.650 align:middle line:84%
from themselves,
their higher aspect.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.190 align:middle line:84%
They might be getting
guidance from elsewhere

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:35.040 align:middle line:90%
or another being.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And if you're sensitive,
you can hear that

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:38.490 align:middle line:90%
or do automatic writing.

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.910 align:middle line:84%
But that's not the
same as being a medium.

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:43.937 align:middle line:84%
It's a very different
quality to it.

00:06:43.937 --> 00:06:45.270 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: It's very different.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.907 align:middle line:84%
And especially a
direct voice medium.

00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:48.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:53.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Where the direct
voice, they take over my body.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.200 align:middle line:84%
They take over my vocal chords
and speak directly through me.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.670 align:middle line:90%
There's a different voice.

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:00.960 align:middle line:84%
It's my voice, a bit more
masculine, as you know.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And so that can be a little
off-putting for some.

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:05.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I remember
you telling me before,

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.140 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning it was
challenging for you because you

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:14.312 align:middle line:84%
had this booming, almost
digital, I am from Mars,

00:07:14.312 --> 00:07:16.020 align:middle line:84%
digital kind of voice
coming through you.

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.446 align:middle line:84%
And it was quite disconcerting
and shocking when it first

00:07:18.446 --> 00:07:19.070 align:middle line:90%
started, right?

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:20.650 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It was
very loud also.

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:21.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And very loud, yeah.

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.305 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: I would
come out of a session,

00:07:23.305 --> 00:07:27.670 align:middle line:84%
and people would say,
is your throat sore?

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't sound
any different to me.

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:31.780 align:middle line:90%
I felt the energy.

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And it became very comfortable
and very loving energy.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And the information was
phenomenal that I was getting.

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And the information about the
fifth dimension, which is now,

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:44.800 align:middle line:90%
everybody's talking about it.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.500 align:middle line:84%
This was in the '70s that
this was being talked about.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.250 align:middle line:84%
And in my first book, "The
Fifth Dimension, Channels

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:54.450 align:middle line:84%
to a New Reality," a lot of the
things that they spoke about

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:58.230 align:middle line:84%
are happening today, and
the changes in the world,

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:00.260 align:middle line:84%
the changes in
political structures,

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:04.870 align:middle line:84%
the changes in global economy,
and the changes in us.

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:07.990 align:middle line:84%
Because this is the time that
really is the time that's

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:12.250 align:middle line:84%
been spoken about, that all
I can do, you can do it more,

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:15.560 align:middle line:84%
is really what is
now in us becoming

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.120 align:middle line:90%
the masters that we are.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:21.270 align:middle line:84%
We all have the ability
to connect with source,

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:24.830 align:middle line:84%
to connect to the guidance
that is ever present about us.

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And really, the work that
I do is that encouragement

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.690 align:middle line:84%
and giving tools to people to
address that and become that.

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:35.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.445 align:middle line:90%
And a beautiful job you do.

00:08:37.445 --> 00:08:38.820 align:middle line:84%
And you and your
husband, Marcus,

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:41.220 align:middle line:90%
have a radio program each week.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:42.859 align:middle line:84%
And so some of the
people watching this

00:08:42.859 --> 00:08:44.400 align:middle line:84%
have already connected
with your work

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.340 align:middle line:84%
through that, through
the last five years.

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I come
on as a guest host

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.700 align:middle line:84%
and ask whatever questions I'm
interested in, which always

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.840 align:middle line:84%
kind of skew toward
the unordinary.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: That's why
we love you so much.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.410 align:middle line:90%
Because it's so interesting.

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:01.576 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's kind
of what we're doing today.

00:09:01.576 --> 00:09:04.830 align:middle line:84%
And as we go along, and
hopefully have other programs

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:07.730 align:middle line:84%
in the future, we can deal
more at home where people live.

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:10.140 align:middle line:84%
But I thought, hey,
while we're here,

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:12.477 align:middle line:84%
I've got my little list
of phenomena, things

00:09:12.477 --> 00:09:14.060 align:middle line:84%
that people are
curious about and have

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:16.910 align:middle line:84%
been written about as the
great mysteries of all times.

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:18.340 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, why not?

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.860 align:middle line:84%
We've got you and
Theo right here.

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:22.760 align:middle line:84%
Why not get a little
higher perspective

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.320 align:middle line:84%
on what some of
this phenomena is?

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And also, what I didn't
say when I introduced

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.520 align:middle line:84%
you was that I'm also very
interested in the changing

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:34.680 align:middle line:84%
nature of relationships
between odd bedfellows in terms

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.050 align:middle line:84%
of the animal kingdom
and the way animals

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:39.760 align:middle line:84%
are now interacting
with us in a new way,

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.570 align:middle line:84%
and a couple very
specific things.

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:44.715 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of this is about
animals that we love

00:09:44.715 --> 00:09:47.620 align:middle line:84%
and creatures that
we've been curious about

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:48.650 align:middle line:90%
and that sort of thing.

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to
have another program later

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:54.050 align:middle line:84%
that gets down into who
we are, why we incarnate

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:57.011 align:middle line:84%
into the families we are
incarnated into and all that.

00:09:57.011 --> 00:09:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And you don't know any of this
because I didn't involve you,

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:01.392 align:middle line:84%
because it's really
between me and Theo.

00:10:01.392 --> 00:10:02.350 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: I get that.

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:03.200 align:middle line:90%
I get that.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.090 align:middle line:90%
But you know, it's so much fun.

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And as we've talked about,
Marcus and I talk about a lot,

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:13.310 align:middle line:84%
we're only limited by our
curiosity and our intellect.

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:16.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, Regina, I
love so much your questioning.

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:19.860 align:middle line:84%
Because you go into those
areas that most of us

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:21.520 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't think about.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.156 align:middle line:90%
And it's interesting.

00:10:24.156 --> 00:10:25.320 align:middle line:90%
You know, we're interested.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.945 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It pulls
out new information.

00:10:26.945 --> 00:10:29.140 align:middle line:84%
It's fun, and for me, it
satisfies some curiosity.

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:31.040 align:middle line:90%
But also it helps us understand.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.590 align:middle line:84%
For me, asking about
these anomalous creatures

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:36.170 align:middle line:84%
and this kind of
phenomena helps fill

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:39.370 align:middle line:84%
in the backstory of
this planet, who we are,

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:43.510 align:middle line:84%
what has been in the past that
we have no remembrance of.

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:47.150 align:middle line:84%
And so I like it for a larger
purpose than just curiosity,

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:47.700 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:49.430 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure a lot
of our viewers do.

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:52.860 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Well, and
it's an expanded thought.

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:56.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, we've been
so myopic really.

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And now's the time to
expand our thinking

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:02.500 align:middle line:84%
and bring out information
that we wouldn't

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.480 align:middle line:84%
have been ready to
understand before now.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:05.920 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, with that in
mind, Sheila, how do you

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:09.976 align:middle line:84%
feel about going
bye-bye for a while

00:11:09.976 --> 00:11:11.225 align:middle line:90%
and letting Theo come through?

00:11:11.225 --> 00:11:11.520 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: You bet.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.978 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
letting everybody get

00:11:12.978 --> 00:11:15.710 align:middle line:84%
used to the feeling
and the sound of Theo

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:19.060 align:middle line:84%
while we begin this conversation
about the incredible animal

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:21.130 align:middle line:90%
kingdom and creature kingdom.

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:21.990 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Great.

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:23.174 align:middle line:90%
I'll talk to you later.

00:11:23.174 --> 00:11:23.715 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:11:23.715 --> 00:11:24.339 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: OK.

00:11:24.339 --> 00:11:25.667 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:11:25.667 --> 00:11:44.640 align:middle line:90%


00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.030 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: It is the
beginning, is it not?

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:48.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.330 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: We are appreciative
of the opportunity

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:52.250 align:middle line:90%
to be of service unto you.

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:53.002 align:middle line:90%
You may ask.

00:11:53.002 --> 00:11:54.085 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you, Theo.

00:11:54.085 --> 00:11:55.090 align:middle line:90%
It's good to see you.

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:56.770 align:middle line:90%
It's good to be with you again.

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:58.974 align:middle line:90%
I can't see you, actually.

00:11:58.974 --> 00:12:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And I would like to talk
to you about-- I don't know

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:04.220 align:middle line:84%
if you were present
listening to my conversation

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.150 align:middle line:84%
a moment ago with
Sheila, but I'm

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:08.170 align:middle line:84%
interested in talking
to you about some

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:10.920 align:middle line:84%
of the strange and
unanswered questions

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:15.200 align:middle line:84%
on this planet regarding our
creatures and our animals,

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.290 align:middle line:90%
our beloved animals as well.

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't mind, if we
start there and then maybe go

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.040 align:middle line:84%
into a couple larger
themes later, is that OK?

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.090 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: It is of
acceptance you are asking.

00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:29.610 align:middle line:84%
And we are aware
of your thoughts.

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:31.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's
start with a couple

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.870 align:middle line:90%
of the anomalous creatures.

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:35.860 align:middle line:84%
One of them that
has been written

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:38.960 align:middle line:84%
about throughout history
but never fully understood

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:42.660 align:middle line:84%
is one that we know as
Sasquatch or Bigfoot

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:47.880 align:middle line:84%
and what that
species actually is.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.630 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: You could speak of them
as the giants of this Earth.

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And there have been
and would be continued

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.390 align:middle line:84%
in the archaeological
finds, there

00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:03.280 align:middle line:84%
have been these beings of
quite large stature that

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:07.180 align:middle line:84%
have inhabited this
planet, and that

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:15.170 align:middle line:84%
are unfamiliar in the sense of
actuality and living together.

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:19.660 align:middle line:84%
But there is those that
are on this planet that

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:23.030 align:middle line:90%
tend to not be seen.

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:25.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And can you
tell us about that?

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:29.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the one-- the hallmark
of Bigfoot or Sasquatch

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.220 align:middle line:84%
or this type of being
that lives on the planet

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:35.980 align:middle line:84%
is that they are hidden
and keep to themselves

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:37.580 align:middle line:90%
in remote regions.

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:39.870 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us what
regions of the world

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:43.670 align:middle line:84%
they still exist in, and
from the very beginning, what

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:46.640 align:middle line:90%
lineage they came from?

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.090 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Hmm.

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:55.050 align:middle line:84%
To the northern part of
your, hmm, country present

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:59.730 align:middle line:84%
and beyond those borders
that you have set.

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:02.590 align:middle line:84%
For before, there
were no borders

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:09.380 align:middle line:84%
to describe particular states,
countries, hemispheres.

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:13.170 align:middle line:90%
It was all that was, you see.

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:18.150 align:middle line:84%
But now, northerly, so
less populated areas.

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:22.940 align:middle line:84%
For it is in safety
to them, for they

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:30.190 align:middle line:84%
wish not to have fear-based
beings hunting them

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:33.140 align:middle line:90%
as has been in the past.

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:36.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what is the
nature of their consciousness,

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:40.030 align:middle line:84%
in terms of-- do
they operate more

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:43.070 align:middle line:90%
telepathically with each other?

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:47.660 align:middle line:84%
Do they have tight societies
of what's left of them?

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:50.320 align:middle line:84%
Are they continuing
to reproduce and live

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.920 align:middle line:84%
within these remote
regions themselves?

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:56.450 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: Not so much
the reproduction,

00:14:56.450 --> 00:15:00.673 align:middle line:84%
for it would not be in
such a state for the Earth

00:15:00.673 --> 00:15:05.010 align:middle line:84%
as it is ecologically speaking
and for the well-being

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:07.090 align:middle line:90%
of this culture.

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:08.870 align:middle line:90%
So there are few.

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:15.140 align:middle line:84%
Yes, they are connected
telepathically.

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:21.425 align:middle line:84%
They're connected very much
to the higher vibration

00:15:21.425 --> 00:15:26.890 align:middle line:84%
of their souls or
their energy fields.

00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:28.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You hear
every now and then

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.990 align:middle line:84%
what becomes known
as urban legend,

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:37.345 align:middle line:84%
that on occasion in history
that one of these beings

00:15:37.345 --> 00:15:40.910 align:middle line:84%
has come forward to
assist a human who

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:43.250 align:middle line:84%
was in some sort
of danger or need.

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:44.720 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: They have, yes.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they've come
out of their own safety zone

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:48.880 align:middle line:90%
in order to do that.

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:52.410 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: In that sense
of life or death, yes.

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:54.020 align:middle line:90%
That has occurred.

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And they would not stay
for their own safety.

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.700 align:middle line:90%


00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so those
aren't urban legends.

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:05.300 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: They are not.

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:06.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Those are true
situations that occurred.

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:07.688 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: They are.

00:16:07.688 --> 00:16:10.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they, unlike
maybe the development

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.740 align:middle line:84%
we are right now, have
remained throughout history

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:15.610 align:middle line:84%
in close connection
with the soul force

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:18.410 align:middle line:84%
that they incarnate
with or into.

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:21.230 align:middle line:90%
And what is their life span?

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:25.870 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: Some have lived
longer than 100 years.

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:29.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But shall we assume
this phenomena, this type

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:32.860 align:middle line:84%
of being is going to begin dying
out now because the planet is

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:35.890 align:middle line:84%
no longer-- its
frequencies or its ecology

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:37.870 align:middle line:84%
is no longer sustaining
their lifestyle?

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:39.040 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Correct.

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's
the end of that.

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:41.670 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:43.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they're
still in North America?

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:44.299 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: They are.

00:16:44.299 --> 00:16:44.965 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: China?

00:16:44.965 --> 00:16:46.715 align:middle line:84%
Remote areas of other
northern countries?

00:16:46.715 --> 00:16:48.060 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:48.885 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:16:48.885 --> 00:16:49.775 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:16:49.775 --> 00:16:51.030 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Cooler climate.

00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:52.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Cooler climates.

00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:54.030 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:54.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:57.050 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:16:57.050 --> 00:17:00.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, another one is the
whole subject of dragons.

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And I spoke with you
about this not long ago

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:07.369 align:middle line:84%
when we had a chance to have
some fun in another show, one

00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:09.230 align:middle line:90%
of Sheila and Marcus's shows.

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And I enjoyed what you had to
say about this, because I had

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:18.990 align:middle line:84%
been told by my beings that
dragons were upon the Earth.

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:20.260 align:middle line:90%
They're not mythological.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.480 align:middle line:84%
That they were in this
density at one time.

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:27.119 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain the
phenomena around creatures

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:32.180 align:middle line:84%
that were incarnate but that
densities or frequencies change

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:34.490 align:middle line:84%
and are no longer
visible but still exist?

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:37.750 align:middle line:84%
Or what's the situation
with dragons in our world?

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:41.290 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: Dragons have
existed in this world,

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:44.790 align:middle line:90%
on this earthly plane, yes.

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And they had existed
as they've been

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:52.670 align:middle line:90%
depicted in some ways on film.

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:57.810 align:middle line:84%
Not with the great mythology,
but with the actuality

00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:01.130 align:middle line:90%
of their physical structure.

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:05.350 align:middle line:84%
And many archaeological
beings or science

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:12.330 align:middle line:90%
have seen these remains in such.

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And these were upon the planet
in a way as large beings

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:28.780 align:middle line:84%
or large forms that were
conducive of the environment

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:30.840 align:middle line:90%
of the time.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:34.490 align:middle line:84%
The environment now
does not sustain.

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And they're metamorphosed
into other forms

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:39.580 align:middle line:90%
that are much smaller.

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:41.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How would
we recognize them now?

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:46.620 align:middle line:84%
What would those forms be
that where once dragons?

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:51.220 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: There are forms
that are in your oceans.

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:54.420 align:middle line:84%
There are particular
forms that form in water

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:58.780 align:middle line:84%
and then becomes land-based,
such as salamanders,

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:02.280 align:middle line:90%
the very small form, you see.

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:06.060 align:middle line:84%
But very similar,
only miniature,

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:08.860 align:middle line:90%
they would see it as, yes?

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:11.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when you speak of
the environment in which they

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.190 align:middle line:84%
lived, that would
have been a time

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:15.820 align:middle line:84%
also when human beings
and other creatures

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:17.650 align:middle line:84%
were much larger
than we are now,

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:21.270 align:middle line:84%
where the environment or
the density, frequencies,

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:25.550 align:middle line:84%
dimensions could support
that largeness of being?

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:26.940 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:31.440 align:middle line:84%
There were large
human forms as well.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:34.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's a subject
that I find fascinating

00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:36.170 align:middle line:84%
and I've done a
couple interviews on.

00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And from my understanding,
forms as large as 30 feet high

00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:44.840 align:middle line:90%
have been discovered.

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:45.615 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:19:45.615 --> 00:19:47.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you talk
about this period of history

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:49.940 align:middle line:84%
and this kind of
discovery and why

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:52.950 align:middle line:84%
now and what that means on
a deeper soul level, what

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:56.790 align:middle line:84%
it means for us to connect
with this knowledge?

00:19:56.790 --> 00:20:00.620 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: Knowing you're
larger than you are, yes?

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:03.080 align:middle line:84%
There are just
those forms in which

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:07.990 align:middle line:84%
the soul energy that is this
the spark of the human race

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:13.430 align:middle line:84%
in actuality, that is
multi-dimensional, inhabited

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:15.690 align:middle line:84%
those forms as well
because they were

00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:20.160 align:middle line:84%
life-sustaining in the
environment in which they were.

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:24.750 align:middle line:84%
No longer is the environment
conducive to that size.

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:27.200 align:middle line:84%
And it became much
more diminished.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:32.640 align:middle line:84%
What you find now, the forms
are becoming larger once again.

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:33.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:35.390 align:middle line:90%
We devolved in size.

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And now we're starting to
pick up some speed again.

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:40.240 align:middle line:84%
What is it that's changed
that's allowing-- I mean,

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:43.820 align:middle line:84%
we know that more proteins
and those kinds of things

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:45.860 align:middle line:84%
have been made available
globally and all that.

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:47.840 align:middle line:84%
But are there other
factors in terms

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.900 align:middle line:84%
of why we are
beginning to pick up

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:53.330 align:middle line:84%
in size and even perhaps
in age span again?

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:54.770 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: The
vibrational frequency

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:57.470 align:middle line:84%
that is about the
Earth presently.

00:20:57.470 --> 00:21:00.910 align:middle line:84%
There are 12 dimensions about
the Earth, of which you are now

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:03.420 align:middle line:84%
participating with
the fifth, which

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:05.580 align:middle line:84%
is a greater form
of consciousness.

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:07.500 align:middle line:84%
Never before in the
third dimension,

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:12.240 align:middle line:84%
which is your
physical reality, that

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:15.950 align:middle line:84%
could sustain that knowledge
on the vibrational frequency.

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:18.590 align:middle line:84%
There would have been
a short circuiting

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:21.730 align:middle line:90%
because it is very electric.

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:25.740 align:middle line:84%
Now as the body has evolved,
beings have evolved,

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:27.330 align:middle line:90%
their bodies are larger.

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:31.200 align:middle line:84%
They can sustain this
higher electrical frequency

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.820 align:middle line:84%
that aligns you with
the matter of which you

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:37.560 align:middle line:90%
are, the dust of the stars.

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:38.830 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:41.350 align:middle line:84%
And knowing that the
Earth is but one choice,

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:47.060 align:middle line:84%
there are billions of choices
of incarnations for each soul

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:48.160 align:middle line:90%
to choose from.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:54.170 align:middle line:84%
The Earth is the learning of
emotions and the interactions

00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:58.030 align:middle line:84%
that bring forth emotions
and the connectivity one unto

00:21:58.030 --> 00:21:59.190 align:middle line:90%
the other.

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:02.009 align:middle line:90%
For humans are herd animals.

00:22:02.009 --> 00:22:03.175 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Herd animals, yes.

00:22:03.175 --> 00:22:04.230 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:07.720 align:middle line:84%
Wishing to connect
to family, community,

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:13.650 align:middle line:84%
to belong one unto the other and
to support each other's growth,

00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:16.260 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:17.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:20.920 align:middle line:84%
So when you were speaking
of the dragons that

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:23.520 align:middle line:84%
were of very large
stature and the people

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:25.730 align:middle line:84%
that we would call giants
in our discoveries today,

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:28.460 align:middle line:84%
but the large-statured
human beings in that time,

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:31.210 align:middle line:84%
were they existing
at a time when

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:33.870 align:middle line:84%
the Earth was in
higher frequencies?

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:37.570 align:middle line:84%
Or was it early phases of
third-dimensional frequencies?

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:41.040 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: It was early stages of
third-dimensional frequencies.

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:44.370 align:middle line:84%
So they are in the
brain, was being

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:51.830 align:middle line:84%
formed in such a way where there
was this fight or flight, fear.

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:54.810 align:middle line:84%
The neural pathways
of the brain then

00:22:54.810 --> 00:23:00.020 align:middle line:84%
were-- the default
mechanism was for survival.

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:02.900 align:middle line:84%
What is changing now at
the higher frequencies

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:08.140 align:middle line:84%
is the reframing of the brain
into new neural pathways, no

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:11.910 align:middle line:84%
longer defaulting to
that which is fear,

00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:19.509 align:middle line:84%
but to the default of
possibility and positivity.

00:23:19.509 --> 00:23:21.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a
big switch for us.

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:22.480 align:middle line:90%
That's the shift.

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:24.840 align:middle line:84%
That's the shift everyone's
been talking about.

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:25.560 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:28.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So as I want to
wrap up this on dragons,

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:31.180 align:middle line:84%
because they feature
large right now

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:36.750 align:middle line:84%
in our media and
entertainment and in the more

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:40.050 align:middle line:84%
common mythologies
and novels that

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:42.100 align:middle line:84%
are written for young
girls and so forth.

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And young children
are connecting with

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:48.100 align:middle line:84%
and kind of imagining,
dreaming, and connecting more

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:51.290 align:middle line:84%
with that dragon
energy, I'm noticing.

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And we depict it as our
pleasant-- a companion

00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:59.050 align:middle line:84%
who lives for us,
by our side, who's

00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:02.240 align:middle line:84%
ready to take us on a journey
with them and protect us.

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:06.410 align:middle line:84%
In truth, what were
dragons alongside humans?

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:08.680 align:middle line:84%
Assuming we were all
existing at the same time,

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.830 align:middle line:84%
what was the relationship
between dragons

00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:12.230 align:middle line:90%
and the human kingdom?

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:14.430 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: There were some
beneficial relationships

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:18.460 align:middle line:90%
unless there were adversities.

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:21.056 align:middle line:84%
For that was a time
of survival as well.

00:24:21.056 --> 00:24:21.786 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:24:21.786 --> 00:24:23.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what were the
beneficial relationships

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:25.035 align:middle line:90%
between humans and dragons?

00:24:25.035 --> 00:24:27.165 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: It could be much
as you described it.

00:24:27.165 --> 00:24:28.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Protectors.

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:29.130 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Protectors.

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:31.260 align:middle line:90%
Assistors.

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:31.990 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:33.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
these young people

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:36.900 align:middle line:84%
that are connecting more
with the dragon energy,

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:39.370 align:middle line:84%
are they actually
connecting more

00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:41.970 align:middle line:84%
into their own aura in the
past and what they once

00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:42.940 align:middle line:90%
had with the dragons?

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:45.430 align:middle line:84%
Or are they actually
connecting to that other realm?

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:47.700 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: They're connecting
to the multdimensionality

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:48.840 align:middle line:90%
of the realms.

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:51.560 align:middle line:90%
For it is all there, you see.

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:53.640 align:middle line:90%
And they're remembering.

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:59.370 align:middle line:84%
For the veils that have been so
thick in the mind, that did not

00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:04.650 align:middle line:84%
allow for this remembrance
to occur, are thinned.

00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:08.440 align:middle line:84%
And now beings evolving
into this higher state

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:11.250 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness
have the ability

00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:16.720 align:middle line:84%
to accept greater
insights than ever before

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:18.057 align:middle line:90%
and be empowered by them.

00:25:18.057 --> 00:25:18.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And these children seem to
have even fewer veils yet.

00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:21.910 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:23.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thinner veils yet.

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that the
dragons were also noted for

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.450 align:middle line:90%
was the breath of fire.

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And I remember you told me once
before this was quite literal.

00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:34.200 align:middle line:84%
They had a particular
ability within their beings.

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:36.040 align:middle line:90%
Can you talk about that?

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:39.100 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: They do have
that ability, did have.

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:40.327 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:40.327 --> 00:25:42.160 align:middle line:84%
Still do in another
dimensions, as you were.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:45.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How do they create
fire within their being

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:50.650 align:middle line:84%
and have it not impact
their physical bodies?

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:53.930 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: Just as you have
fire within your being,

00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:57.457 align:middle line:84%
which is called
inflammation, isn't it?

00:25:57.457 --> 00:25:58.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:58.040 --> 00:25:58.670 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:01.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, their
inflammation is depicted

00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:03.080 align:middle line:90%
as coming out as flames.

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.390 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: As their breath, yes.

00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:07.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is that
metaphorical or literal?

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:09.070 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: It is metaphorical.

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:14.106 align:middle line:84%
But it is the heat of the
breath that could warm.

00:26:14.106 --> 00:26:14.606 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:26:14.606 --> 00:26:17.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, so they had a
very warm breath, outbreath.

00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:20.180 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes, yes.

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:25.060 align:middle line:84%
But there are those embodied
now, just as you are,

00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:28.730 align:middle line:84%
that have had the capacity
to internally combust

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:29.857 align:middle line:90%
with the heat within them.

00:26:29.857 --> 00:26:30.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:32.460 align:middle line:84%
I was going to ask
you about that.

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:37.390 align:middle line:84%
What exactly is occurring
when a person's fire reaches

00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:40.860 align:middle line:90%
such a level that that occurs?

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:42.850 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: It's a bit of
an imbalance, you see.

00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:46.620 align:middle line:84%
When one is out of balance,
and the inflammation

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:52.050 align:middle line:84%
is to such a heightened degree,
and the electrical balance

00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:55.280 align:middle line:84%
of their body is off
as well, then there

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:58.077 align:middle line:90%
is an occurrence of combustion.

00:26:58.077 --> 00:26:58.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:01.810 align:middle line:84%
That's another one at
those strange anomalies.

00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:02.590 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:06.024 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: We see it not
as strange as you do.

00:27:06.024 --> 00:27:07.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHING]
I'm sure you don't.

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:08.721 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:27:08.721 --> 00:27:09.220 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:12.920 align:middle line:84%
Now let's go into some other
of the creatures that live more

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:17.280 align:middle line:84%
in the realm of myth--
centaurs, for example.

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:21.830 align:middle line:84%
What exactly happened in the
early days of human development

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:23.220 align:middle line:90%
and creatures?

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:25.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what we
understand now is

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:28.290 align:middle line:84%
there were various different
cultures that have been here.

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:30.800 align:middle line:84%
There's been a lot of genetic
kind of experimentation,

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:33.160 align:middle line:84%
manipulation throughout
Earth's history.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.090 align:middle line:84%
How do you describe
creatures that

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:39.610 align:middle line:84%
are half human, half
another source animal?

00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:43.450 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: There had been those
inner changes in what you

00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:50.170 align:middle line:84%
call DNA, in reproduction, that
occurred in experimentation.

00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:51.880 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:59.445 align:middle line:84%
And then there were born of
those two strains of species.

00:27:59.445 --> 00:28:02.400 align:middle line:90%


00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:07.620 align:middle line:84%
It is similar to, if there
were a cat born with two heads,

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:08.830 align:middle line:90%
you see.

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:10.270 align:middle line:90%
An anomaly, yes.

00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:13.220 align:middle line:84%
But it occurs, does it
not, with the transmutation

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:15.360 align:middle line:90%
of certain genes.

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:18.590 align:middle line:90%
So it has occurred, yes.

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:20.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What type of--

00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:23.010 align:middle line:84%
When you're looking at
beings who are half human

00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:30.840 align:middle line:84%
and half a particular animal,
what was the nature of this?

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:34.690 align:middle line:84%
Did, as with humans,
a similar kind of soul

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:37.100 align:middle line:90%
inhabit these beings?

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:40.180 align:middle line:84%
Or was it a different
kind of soul

00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:42.890 align:middle line:84%
that could do such
an inhabitation?

00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:44.200 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: There are souls.

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Each of you are unique
in your own way, you see.

00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:52.020 align:middle line:84%
So we would say different,
in your terminology,

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:54.510 align:middle line:90%
of different type.

00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:59.530 align:middle line:84%
But remember, each of you
are unique in your own soul,

00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:01.920 align:middle line:90%
not one the same.

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:04.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And from
all different parts

00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:08.720 align:middle line:84%
of experience in the universes,
we should assume, right?

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.310 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:11.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:13.210 align:middle line:84%
I often joke that
there is no one that's

00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:17.350 align:middle line:84%
really indigenous on one level
to this life here on Earth.

00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:18.350 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: That is correct.

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:20.510 align:middle line:90%
Because the soul is eternal.

00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:21.520 align:middle line:90%
It is ongoing.

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:23.550 align:middle line:90%
It is energy, you see.

00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:26.190 align:middle line:84%
It is the choices
that the soul makes

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:30.310 align:middle line:84%
where it inhabits
a certain, hmm,

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:34.710 align:middle line:84%
planet, such as the Earth,
for a particular experience

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:37.360 align:middle line:84%
in the form that can
sustain it, which

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:40.320 align:middle line:90%
happens to be the human body.

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:41.344 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:29:41.344 --> 00:29:43.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so it was
a different experience

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:45.150 align:middle line:90%
for a centaur, for example.

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:46.380 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:48.310 align:middle line:90%
And not long lived.

00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:49.610 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:29:49.610 --> 00:29:51.810 align:middle line:10%
There were inherent
genetic challenges

00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:53.590 align:middle line:10%
that didn't allow
for a long lifespan.

00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:55.130 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Correct.

00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:56.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:57.470 align:middle line:90%
What about mermaids?

00:29:57.470 --> 00:30:03.530 align:middle line:84%
That's probably one of the
most wondered about creatures.

00:30:03.530 --> 00:30:05.100 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Mythologically speaking.

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:06.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mythologically, yes.

00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:08.370 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Magically, yes?

00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:09.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:11.940 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: But there
were some that were,

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:14.550 align:middle line:84%
as they were
transforming, as you would

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:21.610 align:middle line:84%
see a salamander would thus be
turned like a fish, with gills.

00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And then it becomes more,
hmm, land-bearing animal.

00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:32.410 align:middle line:10%
Which then the gills drop
away, and the legs form,

00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:35.550 align:middle line:10%
and one walks the Earth.

00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:38.120 align:middle line:10%
So it's similar
to that, you see.

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:40.350 align:middle line:10%
There was just
this metamorphosis

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:44.470 align:middle line:10%
into the human
form from the sea.

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:46.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so,
mythologically, they're

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:49.220 align:middle line:90%
usually female.

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:52.980 align:middle line:90%
They're usually beautiful.

00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:58.150 align:middle line:84%
Was there a particular
kind of-- again, was there

00:30:58.150 --> 00:30:59.890 align:middle line:84%
a particular kind
of soul impetus

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:03.150 align:middle line:84%
to have this
transformation take place?

00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And did they actually look
like a feminine human being?

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:08.389 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:31:08.389 --> 00:31:08.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:11.056 align:middle line:10%
>>THEO: Much like the
centaur looked like the male.

00:31:11.056 --> 00:31:12.555 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes,
looked like the male.

00:31:12.555 --> 00:31:13.150 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:16.940 align:middle line:84%
So they were genetically,
all genetically

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:20.690 align:middle line:90%
aligned to male or female.

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:21.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:23.970 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I've heard
that in the kingdom

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:27.950 align:middle line:84%
of elves and sprites
and undines and fairies.

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:30.780 align:middle line:84%
That seems to be
that certain of them

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:34.630 align:middle line:84%
tend to show themselves
as males solely.

00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And others seem to
show themselves--

00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:39.030 align:middle line:84%
the water elements, for
example, seem to show themselves

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:41.484 align:middle line:84%
almost exclusively
as female also.

00:31:41.484 --> 00:31:42.900 align:middle line:84%
Which is interesting
when you look

00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:44.550 align:middle line:90%
at the subject of mermaids.

00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:45.325 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:31:45.325 --> 00:31:46.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
is the affinity

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:49.770 align:middle line:90%
of the feminine with water?

00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:50.694 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Spirit.

00:31:50.694 --> 00:31:52.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you go into
a little more explanation?

00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:56.180 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: So that
theoretical spirituality

00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:59.280 align:middle line:90%
that is water-based is true.

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:00.120 align:middle line:90%
For it is fluid.

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:03.230 align:middle line:90%
It is flow, the water of life.

00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:07.910 align:middle line:84%
If there were not water on your
planet, there would be no life.

00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:10.320 align:middle line:90%
It is life-sustaining.

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:16.800 align:middle line:84%
The female is the creator
of birth, is it not?

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:19.420 align:middle line:84%
Not that the male
does not participate,

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:23.820 align:middle line:84%
but through the
female and water.

00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:27.850 align:middle line:84%
For in the womb there
is water as well, yes?

00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:28.485 align:middle line:90%
For creation.

00:32:28.485 --> 00:32:31.850 align:middle line:90%


00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:34.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the
beings that are--

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:36.070 align:middle line:90%
let me go back for one moment.

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:37.360 align:middle line:90%
Do mermaids still exist?

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:39.894 align:middle line:90%


00:32:39.894 --> 00:32:41.060 align:middle line:90%
Are they still in our water?

00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:44.180 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: If they exist in
the mind, they exist, yes.

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:46.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do they exist
physically in the oceans

00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:48.680 align:middle line:84%
in our current dimension
of physicality?

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:49.552 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: No.

00:32:49.552 --> 00:32:50.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:52.300 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:54.071 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: But is it not the mind--

00:32:54.071 --> 00:32:55.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes, absolutely.

00:32:56.695 --> 00:32:58.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, of course.

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:03.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm making that very
blunt distinction here.

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:04.460 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:06.830 align:middle line:84%
We know the
distinction, but we wish

00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:11.047 align:middle line:84%
not to diminish what
the mind creates.

00:33:11.047 --> 00:33:11.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:13.980 align:middle line:90%
And that's a very good point.

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:15.600 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:18.810 align:middle line:84%
On a similar level, there
is the Loch Ness Monster.

00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:19.990 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Hmm.

00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:24.690 align:middle line:84%
It really existed when there
were the large creatures

00:33:24.690 --> 00:33:29.730 align:middle line:84%
upon this planet, yes,
with the long necks.

00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:31.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
what people think

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:34.310 align:middle line:84%
they're seeing now
in modern times, what

00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:37.310 align:middle line:90%
is it they're actually seeing?

00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:43.180 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: There are some creatures
in water that are very large.

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:47.980 align:middle line:84%
And some have been found as
little as a few weeks ago

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:52.340 align:middle line:84%
from your oceans that others
would have been surprised

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:55.460 align:middle line:84%
that they even could
exist in large forms.

00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:58.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And how
large are they?

00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:04.250 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: There's, hmm, as large
as a large horse or giraffe.

00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:07.700 align:middle line:90%


00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:11.409 align:middle line:84%
Which when one sees something
in such a way as this,

00:34:11.409 --> 00:34:14.556 align:middle line:84%
the mind enlarges
it even more, yes?

00:34:14.556 --> 00:34:15.139 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:15.139 --> 00:34:18.449 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: With the shock
of the possibility, yes?

00:34:18.449 --> 00:34:19.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:22.239 align:middle line:90%
Those are called fish tales.

00:34:22.239 --> 00:34:25.639 align:middle line:84%
We tend to exaggerate the size
of the fish that we catch here.

00:34:25.639 --> 00:34:26.560 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:29.699 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Makes one feel
better about their catch.

00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:33.630 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: And when one fears
what might happen to them,

00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:37.020 align:middle line:84%
they enlarge that
possibility as well, yes?

00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:38.831 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, indeed.

00:34:38.831 --> 00:34:39.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:45.579 align:middle line:84%
there have been just a
couple of little videos

It's a seal that climbed-- out
in the oceans, climbed on board

like to ask you,

00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:09.340 align:middle line:84%
what is the more kind of
interstellar-- there is thought

00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:12.730 align:middle line:84%
to be an interstellar
connection between dolphins

00:38:12.730 --> 00:38:16.290 align:middle line:84%
and whales and other
off-planet cultures.

00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:19.530 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about sort
of the source and origin

00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:22.410 align:middle line:90%
of them or their consciousness?

00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:24.410 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: There is a
higher conscious state

00:38:24.410 --> 00:38:27.350 align:middle line:90%
of dolphins and whales.

00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And there is a strong
communicative skill

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:33.980 align:middle line:84%
that they have, a
communion with each other,

00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:36.660 align:middle line:90%
a conversation as it were.

00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And they share and
protect each other.

00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:46.060 align:middle line:84%
So you will often see the
whales and dolphins traveling

00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:55.520 align:middle line:84%
together, just as human beings
have had other places to travel

00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:57.890 align:middle line:90%
out of their physical structure.

00:38:57.890 --> 00:39:01.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're saying more
on an astral or psychic level,

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:04.670 align:middle line:84%
they travel maybe to other
planes, other planets?

00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:05.190 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:06.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And communicate
with other beings

00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:07.700 align:middle line:90%
from other planets?

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:07.920 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:08.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
it's often thought

00:39:08.610 --> 00:39:11.310 align:middle line:84%
there's been a connection
between, say, dolphins

00:39:11.310 --> 00:39:14.342 align:middle line:90%
and the planet Sirius.

00:39:14.342 --> 00:39:16.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean not the
planet, the star, yes.

00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:20.690 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: They are connected to
your universal energies, yes.

00:39:20.690 --> 00:39:22.670 align:middle line:90%
But so are you.

00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:27.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so before--
just focusing on them,

00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:30.540 align:middle line:84%
what is their
desire, their growth,

00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:35.804 align:middle line:84%
their task in this
interstellar communication?

00:39:35.804 --> 00:39:37.220 align:middle line:84%
What are they doing
to the planet?

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:42.230 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: Balancing the
Earth, but also the sea.

00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:48.302 align:middle line:84%
And they give information,
do they not, to the sciences.

00:39:48.302 --> 00:39:51.480 align:middle line:84%
So there is a blending
of energy that will come.

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:54.560 align:middle line:84%
For it is the sciences
and the artisans

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:56.990 align:middle line:84%
that bring about the
conversation that

00:39:56.990 --> 00:40:00.700 align:middle line:84%
bring the global
community together.

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:03.740 align:middle line:90%
And they are part of that.

00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:07.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They engender a
lot of love and compassion

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:10.450 align:middle line:84%
among human beings,
dolphins and whales.

00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:12.130 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:15.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And whales are
called the record keepers.

00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:17.150 align:middle line:90%
Are they record keepers?

00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:18.710 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: They are.

00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:21.800 align:middle line:84%
Just all species
are record keepers

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:26.860 align:middle line:84%
to some degree, some
greater and lesser degrees.

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:28.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
oceans, the condition

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:32.640 align:middle line:84%
of the oceans with some of the
acidification that's happened

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:37.300 align:middle line:84%
and some of the radiation
from Fukushima and elsewhere,

00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:45.250 align:middle line:84%
other events-- are the seas
capable of regenerating

00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:52.780 align:middle line:84%
themselves and the health
of the sea, with everything

00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:55.820 align:middle line:84%
that our planet's up
against right now?

00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:57.220 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: It is capable.

00:40:57.220 --> 00:41:01.090 align:middle line:84%
Just as the human body has
the capability of healing,

00:41:01.090 --> 00:41:07.200 align:middle line:84%
the sea does as well, as
there is attention paid to it,

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:09.530 align:middle line:90%
and awarenesses.

00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:12.330 align:middle line:84%
And know there are natural
events on this planet that

00:41:12.330 --> 00:41:16.570 align:middle line:84%
have been a continuum,
have always been,

00:41:16.570 --> 00:41:21.605 align:middle line:84%
which the seas have been a part
and adjust energetically to.

00:41:21.605 --> 00:41:24.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But this
isn't natural now,

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:27.720 align:middle line:84%
the radiation exposure
in particular.

00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:31.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have differing
camps politically,

00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:34.790 align:middle line:84%
some saying don't eat
anything from the sea anymore.

00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:36.130 align:middle line:90%
It's all been tainted.

00:41:36.130 --> 00:41:37.940 align:middle line:84%
It all has high
levels of radiation.

00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:40.280 align:middle line:84%
We should no longer eat
the fish of the seas

00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:43.120 align:middle line:84%
unless it comes from a very
clean Arctic region where

00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:45.754 align:middle line:84%
the flow of the
radiation is not coming.

00:41:45.754 --> 00:41:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And there are other camps
that say, no, you're

00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:48.960 align:middle line:90%
over-exaggerating that.

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.230 align:middle line:90%
Those maps aren't correct.

00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:53.310 align:middle line:84%
What's the truth about the
level of exposure of radiation

00:41:53.310 --> 00:41:56.046 align:middle line:84%
to the Pacific
Ocean in particular?

00:41:56.046 --> 00:41:57.420 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: There has
been radiation,

00:41:57.420 --> 00:42:00.720 align:middle line:84%
as you know, that has
been accounted for,

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:06.280 align:middle line:84%
that is being, hmm, there's
been a bit of cleansing,

00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:08.170 align:middle line:90%
if you would, of it.

00:42:08.170 --> 00:42:09.520 align:middle line:90%
It is there.

00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:13.170 align:middle line:84%
But know there's constant
radiation about your planet

00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:18.160 align:middle line:84%
now that all beings, all
things are having to adjust to.

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:19.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
pretty much where

00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:23.460 align:middle line:84%
I've gone in my thinking
is, well, yes, it

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:27.320 align:middle line:84%
appears that it was an accident
of rather large proportions

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:30.040 align:middle line:84%
that happened in
Japan at Fukushima,

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:32.690 align:middle line:84%
but it does seem as
though the human species,

00:42:32.690 --> 00:42:36.710 align:middle line:84%
for various reasons,
needs to somehow come

00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:39.430 align:middle line:84%
to adapt to higher
levels of radiation.

00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:41.760 align:middle line:90%
Can you explain that?

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:44.950 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: You are adapting daily
to higher forms of radiation

00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:50.130 align:middle line:84%
that permeate your atmosphere,
and electromagnetic fields as

00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:52.040 align:middle line:90%
well.

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And the physical form,
as one cares for it,

00:42:56.750 --> 00:43:01.000 align:middle line:84%
can adapt as you maintain
balances and pay attention.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.940 align:middle line:84%
It is all a matter
of maintenance.

00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:05.490 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:43:05.490 --> 00:43:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And having consciousness about
the maintenance of your planet.

00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:11.350 align:middle line:90%


00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:14.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So in
terms of radiation

00:43:14.530 --> 00:43:18.376 align:middle line:84%
and the planet itself and
the oceans themselves,

00:43:18.376 --> 00:43:19.750 align:middle line:84%
in the world of
science, what are

00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:22.110 align:middle line:84%
some of the most
beneficial things that

00:43:22.110 --> 00:43:28.520 align:middle line:84%
can be done to help begin
cleaning and de-acidifying

00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:30.220 align:middle line:90%
the oceans at this point?

00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:34.050 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: What you will find is
your sciences had the ability

00:43:34.050 --> 00:43:36.400 align:middle line:90%
to create radioactivity.

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:37.630 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:40.994 align:middle line:84%
They also have the
ability to make it,

00:43:40.994 --> 00:43:47.060 align:middle line:84%
hmm, useful from its
debris, to have, hmm,

00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:49.015 align:middle line:90%
the ability to clear it.

00:43:49.015 --> 00:43:50.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
does that look like?

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:52.750 align:middle line:90%
What is that technology?

00:43:52.750 --> 00:43:54.270 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Fusion.

00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:56.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:59.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's another subject
that I've been a bit involved

00:43:59.230 --> 00:44:02.610 align:middle line:84%
with, the subject of fusion,
cold fusion in particular.

00:44:02.610 --> 00:44:05.950 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Cold fusion, yes.

00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:09.474 align:middle line:84%
And that's coming to the
forefront as we speak.

00:44:09.474 --> 00:44:10.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:12.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, there would
be several people

00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:14.790 align:middle line:84%
I know who would be curious
to know your point of view

00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:16.090 align:middle line:90%
on that.

00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And I know it's
difficult looking

00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:19.470 align:middle line:84%
at time frames for things
because there are so

00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:21.880 align:middle line:84%
many shifting variables
at any given moment.

00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:26.150 align:middle line:84%
But do you feel that cold
fusion technology is--

00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:29.235 align:middle line:84%
we're on the brink of it coming
into our physical reality now?

00:44:29.235 --> 00:44:30.860 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: It is in your
physical reality.

00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:33.420 align:middle line:84%
You are on the brink of
allowing it to be utilized.

00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:34.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Allowing it
to be utilized, yes.

00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:35.418 align:middle line:90%
So that's coming.

00:44:35.418 --> 00:44:36.670 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: And it has been there.

00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:38.360 align:middle line:90%
No, it is not coming.

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:38.970 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:42.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I mean
the political structures

00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:44.400 align:middle line:84%
and acceptance of it
are coming to a head

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:46.200 align:middle line:84%
now where it
appears that we will

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:48.610 align:middle line:90%
be able to utilize it soon?

00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:52.295 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: As long as it's
economically viable to many.

00:44:52.295 --> 00:44:53.290 align:middle line:90%
Do you see?

00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:54.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:57.530 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: For it has
been blocked for years.

00:44:57.530 --> 00:44:59.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:04.880 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: For those who
wish it not to be used.

00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:06.610 align:middle line:84%
So as there is
more necessity, it

00:45:06.610 --> 00:45:08.790 align:middle line:90%
will come to the forefront, yes.

00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:11.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is it, from
your perspective,

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.350 align:middle line:84%
possible that Fukushima
in part happened

00:45:13.350 --> 00:45:16.630 align:middle line:84%
to forward that
particular technology

00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:19.840 align:middle line:84%
and other clean technologies,
to say let's take a look at what

00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:22.850 align:middle line:84%
happens now with the old
type of nuclear energy?

00:45:22.850 --> 00:45:23.750 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:27.760 align:middle line:84%
As beings are
affected personally

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:32.450 align:middle line:84%
or in their immediate
family structures

00:45:32.450 --> 00:45:36.480 align:middle line:84%
by these events, which
many are, then there

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:43.379 align:middle line:84%
will be a demand from the
people that this change comes.

00:45:43.379 --> 00:45:44.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And most
people, of course,

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:47.470 align:middle line:84%
have no knowledge it even exists
because the media won't allow

00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:48.940 align:middle line:84%
that information
out to the public.

00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:54.900 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: It's coming
to the point now

00:45:54.900 --> 00:46:00.970 align:middle line:84%
where the media would wish
to speak about it because it

00:46:00.970 --> 00:46:02.650 align:middle line:90%
will be demanded of them.

00:46:02.650 --> 00:46:05.290 align:middle line:90%


00:46:05.290 --> 00:46:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And the greater
numbers would ask.

00:46:09.610 --> 00:46:14.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: On that
subject, there are-- well,

00:46:14.570 --> 00:46:18.010 align:middle line:84%
you can see with the media,
what's gone on with the media

00:46:18.010 --> 00:46:20.560 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, whether it's
the chicken or the egg.

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:24.290 align:middle line:84%
Are you programming what people
are going to be demanding?

00:46:24.290 --> 00:46:26.200 align:middle line:84%
Or are you simply
supplying programming

00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:28.630 align:middle line:84%
for what the average
human being demands?

00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And it appears there's a
fair argument for the fact

00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:33.600 align:middle line:84%
that the people have
been conditioned

00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:37.890 align:middle line:84%
to certain messages and the
absence of other messages.

00:46:37.890 --> 00:46:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And are you seeing that
drawing to a close as well,

00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:43.200 align:middle line:90%
or coming to a head?

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:43.700 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:46.870 align:middle line:84%
And you're already noticing
the dissatisfaction

00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:51.870 align:middle line:90%
from what was to the new.

00:46:51.870 --> 00:46:56.354 align:middle line:84%
There are many changes coming
within that as we speak.

00:46:56.354 --> 00:46:58.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You and I
have talked in years

00:46:58.020 --> 00:46:59.980 align:middle line:84%
past about other
changes as well.

00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And one of them we
spoke about-- now,

00:47:02.110 --> 00:47:04.980 align:middle line:84%
we're kind of going off the
topic of creatures and animals

00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:07.690 align:middle line:90%
into larger themes.

00:47:07.690 --> 00:47:11.430 align:middle line:90%
And that has to do with money.

00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:15.000 align:middle line:84%
The way money and the
structure of money and banking

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.000 align:middle line:84%
on this planet has
happened is probably

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.640 align:middle line:84%
one of the greatest sources
of fear on the planet,

00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:24.050 align:middle line:90%
because it equals survival.

00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And you and I talked a couple
years ago about the notion

00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:30.380 align:middle line:84%
that the money
systems as we know

00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:32.470 align:middle line:84%
it are not going to
continue this way.

00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And if you would, please,
explain to our viewers

00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:38.410 align:middle line:84%
what you see or what you foresee
happening, that would be great.

00:47:38.410 --> 00:47:40.170 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: We've spoken
for many decades

00:47:40.170 --> 00:47:42.630 align:middle line:84%
about this time
of fifth dimension

00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:44.565 align:middle line:84%
that is fully a place
about the planet

00:47:44.565 --> 00:47:50.300 align:middle line:84%
now, which would bring about a
shift in political structures,

00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:53.010 align:middle line:90%
a shift in the global economy.

00:47:53.010 --> 00:47:56.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's already been proven
there is a global economy.

00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:58.510 align:middle line:90%
It is without borders.

00:47:58.510 --> 00:48:00.680 align:middle line:90%
It is about the people.

00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:05.300 align:middle line:84%
So this is what is changing, a
global economic structure that

00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:07.940 align:middle line:84%
is for the benefit
of all beings.

00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:10.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, people
hear "global economy,"

00:48:10.730 --> 00:48:12.190 align:middle line:84%
and the first
thing that comes up

00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:15.480 align:middle line:84%
is the notion, oh no,
a one world order.

00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:18.830 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have these same
people, but even fewer of them,

00:48:18.830 --> 00:48:22.740 align:middle line:84%
controlling the way our
finances move around the planet.

00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:24.656 align:middle line:90%
What are you saying exactly?

00:48:24.656 --> 00:48:26.030 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: That
control they've been

00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:29.360 align:middle line:84%
afraid of has been
happening anyway.

00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:33.840 align:middle line:84%
This is a change
into a new order that

00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:38.880 align:middle line:84%
will be for the betterment
of all, a new structure that

00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:40.880 align:middle line:90%
will be formed.

00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:44.350 align:middle line:84%
For there will always be
an exchange energetically,

00:48:44.350 --> 00:48:45.600 align:middle line:90%
and that will be money.

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:48.400 align:middle line:90%
That is what is of your planet.

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And so the new
change will come in

00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:54.270 align:middle line:84%
this global economic
structure that

00:48:54.270 --> 00:48:58.090 align:middle line:90%
serves the people, not the few.

00:48:58.090 --> 00:48:59.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when
you say that, that

00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:04.609 align:middle line:84%
would require a large
shift in consciousness.

00:49:04.609 --> 00:49:06.150 align:middle line:84%
And the money would
have to certainly

00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:09.534 align:middle line:84%
be managed by hands other than
the hands it's in right now.

00:49:09.534 --> 00:49:10.200 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Correct.

00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:11.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How does that happen?

00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:14.750 align:middle line:84%
Right now humanity is-- how
do you get the money out

00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:17.090 align:middle line:84%
of the hands of those
who are sequestering it

00:49:17.090 --> 00:49:19.440 align:middle line:90%
for their own use and own power?

00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:21.100 align:middle line:90%
How does that shift?

00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:22.090 align:middle line:90%
What's that look like?

00:49:22.090 --> 00:49:24.400 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: You've
already seen that that

00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:32.540 align:middle line:84%
which has been surfacing
dissatisfactorily for all

00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:33.660 align:middle line:90%
to see.

00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:34.370 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:49:34.370 --> 00:49:35.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:49:35.010 --> 00:49:39.110 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: And a bit continuing,
to the dissatisfaction

00:49:39.110 --> 00:49:41.502 align:middle line:90%
to the greater numbers.

00:49:41.502 --> 00:49:42.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All over the world.

00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:43.910 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And so what is occurring
now is out of the demands

00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:52.460 align:middle line:84%
of the people that these
beings not be in charge,

00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:55.940 align:middle line:84%
and accountable
for their misdeeds.

00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:58.530 align:middle line:90%
And this will come to fruition.

00:49:58.530 --> 00:50:01.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In the interim,
it's my understanding

00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:07.190 align:middle line:84%
that there are other beings,
other human beings, who

00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:13.380 align:middle line:84%
have right thinking more in the
process of looking at systems

00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:15.910 align:middle line:84%
of money and movement of
money around the planet,

00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:20.840 align:middle line:84%
that are under the surface,
in a very large, global way,

00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:25.920 align:middle line:84%
beginning to prepare for
bringing something new forward.

00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:26.980 align:middle line:90%
The other still exists.

00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:28.330 align:middle line:90%
It still goes on.

00:50:28.330 --> 00:50:31.690 align:middle line:84%
But that there's going to be
essentially almost a grass

00:50:31.690 --> 00:50:34.897 align:middle line:84%
movements replacement of that
that's starting to bubble up--

00:50:34.897 --> 00:50:35.730 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: That's true.

00:50:35.730 --> 00:50:36.771 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --from beneath.

00:50:36.771 --> 00:50:40.540 align:middle line:84%
And my understanding is
that it's well under way.

00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:43.710 align:middle line:84%
And we're coming maybe
to some flash points.

00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:46.700 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: There is
that to be seen.

00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:50.270 align:middle line:84%
And you're seeing
daily where this

00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:55.570 align:middle line:84%
is occurring, where these
manipulations are surfacing,

00:50:55.570 --> 00:51:00.690 align:middle line:84%
not of the new, but of
the old to be cleared away

00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:04.750 align:middle line:84%
so the new can come
to the surface, yes.

00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:06.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I think
what people are wondering

00:51:06.890 --> 00:51:09.640 align:middle line:84%
is-- does it necessarily
have to be painful?

00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:13.420 align:middle line:84%
Do we have to see a wholesale
collapse of banking systems

00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:16.800 align:middle line:84%
around the world for the
new to be given birth to?

00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:20.020 align:middle line:84%
Because we tend to, as humans,
learn more through pain

00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:22.070 align:middle line:90%
than pleasure certainly.

00:51:22.070 --> 00:51:23.236 align:middle line:90%
Does it have to be that way?

00:51:23.236 --> 00:51:25.600 align:middle line:84%
Or is the consciousness
such that there

00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:29.520 align:middle line:84%
can be the implementation
slowly, quietly of something

00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:34.560 align:middle line:84%
new coming in while the
other just, little by little,

00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:36.960 align:middle line:84%
becomes disrupted
and falls away.

00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:39.950 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: It's becoming disrupted.

00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:41.420 align:middle line:84%
It's already
occurred, has it not?

00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:42.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:51:42.250 --> 00:51:43.259 align:middle line:90%
But it's still there.

00:51:43.259 --> 00:51:44.300 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we're still all--

00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:45.091 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: It's there.

00:51:45.091 --> 00:51:47.490 align:middle line:84%
But it took years
for it to surface.

00:51:47.490 --> 00:51:50.710 align:middle line:84%
Now it takes a bit
of time, not as long,

00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:54.210 align:middle line:84%
for the new to form and
to surface and the other

00:51:54.210 --> 00:51:55.926 align:middle line:90%
to be relinquished.

00:51:55.926 --> 00:51:57.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And because
it is a global economy,

00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:00.440 align:middle line:84%
do you see this
as currencies will

00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:03.370 align:middle line:84%
change to common currencies
around the planet?

00:52:03.370 --> 00:52:05.810 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: It would.

00:52:05.810 --> 00:52:08.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But administered
through higher systems

00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:11.851 align:middle line:84%
that are administered by
higher consciousness beings?

00:52:11.851 --> 00:52:12.350 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:52:12.350 --> 00:52:13.450 align:middle line:90%
In a collective.

00:52:13.450 --> 00:52:17.780 align:middle line:84%
It's not one being
or four or five.

00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:23.170 align:middle line:84%
It would be a larger number
in agreement in that sense,

00:52:23.170 --> 00:52:26.070 align:middle line:90%
in a managerial sense.

00:52:26.070 --> 00:52:28.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, in
a managerial sense.

00:52:28.140 --> 00:52:32.350 align:middle line:84%
And so that would necessitate
also the coming forward

00:52:32.350 --> 00:52:35.654 align:middle line:84%
of new governmental structures
and new political systems.

00:52:35.654 --> 00:52:37.070 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: Yes, we've
spoken of this.

00:52:37.070 --> 00:52:40.290 align:middle line:84%
The political systems
do not work any longer.

00:52:40.290 --> 00:52:41.920 align:middle line:90%
And it-- hmm.

00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:44.230 align:middle line:84%
You are noticing
in the world how

00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:47.310 align:middle line:84%
things are dissolving in
some areas of the world.

00:52:47.310 --> 00:52:50.800 align:middle line:84%
It's not a perfect
system as it comes forth.

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:53.220 align:middle line:84%
It's being stepped
forward courageously

00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:56.520 align:middle line:84%
and asked for the
new to be formed.

00:52:56.520 --> 00:53:03.020 align:middle line:84%
Because it affects their full
life and their family's lives.

00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:07.080 align:middle line:84%
And as you come into this
global community structure,

00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:11.240 align:middle line:84%
a recognition that the
human species are all one,

00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:17.830 align:middle line:84%
same needs, desires,
love, unified.

00:53:17.830 --> 00:53:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And the political structures
will be formed out

00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:28.430 align:middle line:84%
of the desire of that common
unity of human beings globally.

00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:31.000 align:middle line:90%


00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:34.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When we spoke
two or three years ago,

00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:37.350 align:middle line:84%
I remember you said that our
political system in the United

00:53:37.350 --> 00:53:41.310 align:middle line:84%
States was going to go through
a rather significant change.

00:53:41.310 --> 00:53:43.510 align:middle line:84%
The two-party system
that we know now

00:53:43.510 --> 00:53:45.840 align:middle line:84%
was going to go through
a significant change.

00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think you said that
was upcoming relatively soon.

00:53:49.390 --> 00:53:52.487 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember now
if it was 2016, 2012.

00:53:52.487 --> 00:53:54.820 align:middle line:84%
Can you give us some idea of
when you see these changes?

00:53:54.820 --> 00:53:57.860 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: It's happening now.

00:53:57.860 --> 00:54:01.930 align:middle line:84%
All of the disruption and
dissatisfaction and those

00:54:01.930 --> 00:54:04.460 align:middle line:84%
who do not agree and
do not work together,

00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:07.270 align:middle line:84%
it's dissatisfying the
people, the masses.

00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:08.840 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:11.010 align:middle line:84%
So there's a demand
and a recognition

00:54:11.010 --> 00:54:12.020 align:middle line:90%
of the need to change.

00:54:12.020 --> 00:54:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And the apathetic structure
of human beings recognizing

00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:21.010 align:middle line:84%
this is touching their own lives
and they must speak out and be

00:54:21.010 --> 00:54:26.620 align:middle line:84%
active is coming, which changes
the environment completely.

00:54:26.620 --> 00:54:32.160 align:middle line:84%
Because these old forms
of political structures

00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:37.750 align:middle line:84%
do not work and are not
in the highest good.

00:54:37.750 --> 00:54:41.170 align:middle line:84%
And so new is being
formed as we speak

00:54:41.170 --> 00:54:45.660 align:middle line:84%
in the minds of all
of you, seeing ways

00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:51.930 align:middle line:84%
to create a structure where all
beings have a voice and count.

00:54:51.930 --> 00:54:55.390 align:middle line:84%
With technology, you
see, it can be done.

00:54:55.390 --> 00:54:58.190 align:middle line:90%
Before now, it could not.

00:54:58.190 --> 00:55:01.940 align:middle line:84%
But the new form
comes technologically.

00:55:01.940 --> 00:55:03.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you
see a different--

00:55:03.590 --> 00:55:06.820 align:middle line:84%
our shifting our levels
of responsibility

00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:10.630 align:middle line:84%
back to closer to home,
to ourselves, the family,

00:55:10.630 --> 00:55:14.230 align:middle line:84%
our small and local communities,
away from this dependency

00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:17.930 align:middle line:84%
we've all developed
on large structures?

00:55:17.930 --> 00:55:21.840 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: There would
be a bit of both, yes.

00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:27.307 align:middle line:84%
For there is the need-- the
microcosm of the macrocosm.

00:55:27.307 --> 00:55:27.806 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:55:27.806 --> 00:55:28.389 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:55:28.389 --> 00:55:34.160 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: So there would be still
those structures necessary,

00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:36.730 align:middle line:90%
but different.

00:55:36.730 --> 00:55:40.335 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And on that note,
we have a few minutes left.

00:55:40.335 --> 00:55:41.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, there is one
other thing I wanted

00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:44.290 align:middle line:84%
to ask you about that I'm
particularly interested in.

00:55:44.290 --> 00:55:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And that has to do-- we spoke
about the waters of the planet.

00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And I would like to speak
about the trees of the planet

00:55:50.930 --> 00:55:54.620 align:middle line:84%
and about the nature of trees,
such as the redwood trees who

00:55:54.620 --> 00:55:57.490 align:middle line:84%
have up to this time been
able to live thousands

00:55:57.490 --> 00:55:59.130 align:middle line:90%
of years on the planet.

00:55:59.130 --> 00:56:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And with what's
going on ecologically

00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:05.660 align:middle line:84%
and environmentally, with
the shifts in frequencies

00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:08.540 align:middle line:84%
and also oxygen
levels and such, do

00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:11.150 align:middle line:84%
you see the trees
of our planet--

00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:13.860 align:middle line:84%
are they, like we're
adapting to radiation,

00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:17.540 align:middle line:84%
are they adapting to low levels
of oxygen and such as well?

00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And will they continue on
to perform their duties

00:56:20.590 --> 00:56:23.490 align:middle line:84%
and their oxygen exchange
and live their lives

00:56:23.490 --> 00:56:24.460 align:middle line:90%
as they always have?

00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:25.010 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: No.

00:56:25.010 --> 00:56:29.117 align:middle line:84%
The plants, the trees give
oxygen to your planet.

00:56:29.117 --> 00:56:29.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:30.500 align:middle line:90%
Will they continue?

00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:31.770 align:middle line:90%
Will they be able to continue?

00:56:31.770 --> 00:56:33.190 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: They would, yes.

00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:38.050 align:middle line:84%
Just as those plants within your
home give oxygen to your home.

00:56:38.050 --> 00:56:39.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is the
environmental condition

00:56:39.950 --> 00:56:43.480 align:middle line:84%
such they'll be able to continue
doing this in the same way?

00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:45.100 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: They would.

00:56:45.100 --> 00:56:47.850 align:middle line:84%
As long as they are
continually growing.

00:56:47.850 --> 00:56:48.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:56:48.810 --> 00:56:52.586 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: In the sense of
having land space to grow.

00:56:52.586 --> 00:56:53.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
oftentimes it's

00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:58.550 align:middle line:84%
argued that our forests are
in jeopardy, more because

00:56:58.550 --> 00:57:03.370 align:middle line:84%
of ecological or environmental,
atmospheric conditions.

00:57:03.370 --> 00:57:06.035 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
that's concerning.

00:57:06.035 --> 00:57:07.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that would
be concerning.

00:57:07.410 --> 00:57:09.240 align:middle line:84%
That's why I wanted
to know if you felt,

00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:11.340 align:middle line:84%
as long as long as we
quit cutting them down,

00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:14.650 align:middle line:84%
they can continue doing their
part in the oxygen cycle.

00:57:14.650 --> 00:57:15.150 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:57:15.150 --> 00:57:19.270 align:middle line:84%
And they have a
natural way of, hmm,

00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:25.200 align:middle line:84%
having their own life
sustained and regained again,

00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:29.050 align:middle line:84%
a natural way that is
natural to the Earth.

00:57:29.050 --> 00:57:33.730 align:middle line:84%
It's been the manipulation of
man that has created imbalance.

00:57:33.730 --> 00:57:35.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, of course.

00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:38.270 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: So as one's
become more aware

00:57:38.270 --> 00:57:44.620 align:middle line:84%
and listened to the planet
itself, it will heal itself.

00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:47.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So all
these-- I ask this

00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:48.780 align:middle line:84%
because if you go
to a movie theater

00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:51.580 align:middle line:84%
right now, if you look
at new television shows,

00:57:51.580 --> 00:57:53.120 align:middle line:90%
it's all post-apocalyptic.

00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:54.042 align:middle line:90%
There are no trees.

00:57:54.042 --> 00:57:55.000 align:middle line:90%
There isn't much water.

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:56.240 align:middle line:90%
There's not much of anything.

00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:59.660 align:middle line:84%
Why is that being put
forward, in your opinion?

00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:01.760 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: All fear based, yes.

00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
we're speaking about.

00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:06.250 align:middle line:84%
The consciousness
has been fear based,

00:58:06.250 --> 00:58:09.170 align:middle line:90%
fright or flight, survival.

00:58:09.170 --> 00:58:15.630 align:middle line:84%
Now is the time to shift
those patternings of the brain

00:58:15.630 --> 00:58:22.090 align:middle line:84%
to a positive neural patterning
rather than the negative that

00:58:22.090 --> 00:58:28.110 align:middle line:84%
was necessary in
third dimension.

00:58:28.110 --> 00:58:31.500 align:middle line:84%
But there is not
that need to continue

00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:35.220 align:middle line:84%
to have the neural pathways
default to the negative

00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:36.810 align:middle line:90%
or fear.

00:58:36.810 --> 00:58:42.040 align:middle line:84%
And reframing the brain,
creating new neural pathways,

00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:44.840 align:middle line:90%
can be done with your thoughts.

00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:48.080 align:middle line:90%
The brain is always growing.

00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:51.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So our planet will
do just fine as long as we have

00:58:51.260 --> 00:58:54.275 align:middle line:84%
the ability to reprogram
our own brains--

00:58:54.275 --> 00:58:54.900 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Correct

00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:58.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --away from fear
and into the positivity

00:58:58.110 --> 00:59:00.890 align:middle line:84%
of what's possible and what
can very easily continue

00:59:00.890 --> 00:59:03.840 align:middle line:90%
of its own volition.

00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:05.960 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes, correct.

00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:08.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you for that.

00:59:08.210 --> 00:59:11.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm so disturbed when I see all
these apocalyptic scenarios,

00:59:11.410 --> 00:59:14.470 align:middle line:84%
because it's programming a
whole generation of young people

00:59:14.470 --> 00:59:16.480 align:middle line:84%
to think that this
is kind of it.

00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:18.580 align:middle line:84%
You're seeing your last
trees, your last flowers,

00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:20.100 align:middle line:90%
your last dolphins.

00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:21.900 align:middle line:90%
And that's not true.

00:59:21.900 --> 00:59:24.660 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: There's been a
programming of the brain

00:59:24.660 --> 00:59:28.980 align:middle line:84%
that the soul does
not continue as well.

00:59:28.980 --> 00:59:33.440 align:middle line:84%
But there is now, for
each and every being,

00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:36.590 align:middle line:84%
the ability to
connect to the soul,

00:59:36.590 --> 00:59:39.340 align:middle line:84%
to have the awareness
that you are

00:59:39.340 --> 00:59:45.000 align:middle line:84%
more than your physical
body, that is eternal.

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:46.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:59:46.010 --> 00:59:49.650 align:middle line:84%
Any final comments,
Theo, before we go?

00:59:49.650 --> 00:59:51.110 align:middle line:10%
>>THEO: You are all blessed.

00:59:51.110 --> 00:59:55.210 align:middle line:10%
Accept the knowledge
that you are

00:59:55.210 --> 00:59:58.990 align:middle line:10%
the master of your
world, your life.

00:59:58.990 --> 01:00:00.260 align:middle line:90%
You are not at the effect.

01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:07.370 align:middle line:84%
You can be at the causal energy
run of all things in your life.

01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:08.560 align:middle line:90%
Choose it to be so.

01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:11.000 align:middle line:90%


01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Perfect words.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.716 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Theo.

01:00:13.716 --> 01:00:16.070 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: God's love unto you.

01:00:16.070 --> 01:00:16.810 align:middle line:90%
Good day.

01:00:16.810 --> 01:00:17.806 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good day.

01:00:17.806 --> 01:00:30.770 align:middle line:90%


01:00:30.770 --> 01:00:31.790 align:middle line:90%
She's back.

>>GILLETTE: Hi.

01:00:32.590 --> 01:00:33.505 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hi.

01:00:33.505 --> 01:00:35.600 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHING] Thank you
for that, Sheila.

01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:37.760 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: You're welcome.

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:40.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Some very
interesting information.

01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:43.280 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
continue the conversation

01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:45.590 align:middle line:84%
about the soul,
the soul's journey,

01:00:45.590 --> 01:00:47.660 align:middle line:84%
and how we choose the
families we choose.

01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:48.420 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:00:48.420 --> 01:00:50.420 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do that
in a second conversation.

01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:51.520 align:middle line:90%
Sheila, thank you so much.

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:53.936 align:middle line:84%
I look forward to our
next conversation.

01:00:53.936 --> 01:00:55.267 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: I do, too.

01:00:55.267 --> 01:00:57.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Of course, there
are many more anomalies

01:00:57.350 --> 01:00:58.680 align:middle line:90%
of nature and our cosmos.

01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:00.859 align:middle line:84%
This is just a starting
point for exploration.

01:01:00.859 --> 01:01:02.650 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
Sheila back, as we just

01:01:02.650 --> 01:01:05.330 align:middle line:84%
mentioned, to speak about
the dynamics of blood and DNA

01:01:05.330 --> 01:01:07.160 align:middle line:84%
and soul connections
that bind us

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:08.827 align:middle line:84%
all together
throughout lifetimes.

01:01:08.827 --> 01:01:10.660 align:middle line:84%
And particularly, we're
going to take a look

01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:12.950 align:middle line:84%
at what are termed the
black sheep in families.

01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:17.347 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
