00:00:27.709 --> 00:00:29.250 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
In many traditions

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.200 align:middle line:10%
the world, over
intuitive abilities

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.060 align:middle line:10%
are said to be passed from
generation to generation.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.130 align:middle line:84%
Today's guest,
Mariana Cooper, is

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.110 align:middle line:90%
a third-generation intuitive.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.650 align:middle line:84%
This drew her to the work of
Doreen Virtue as her mentor.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.680 align:middle line:84%
As many intuitives,
Mariana also channels.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.070 align:middle line:84%
Today will discuss developing
our own intuition and the signs

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.110 align:middle line:90%
that light the way.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.270 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to our show.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MARIANA COOPER: Thank
you for having me.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:52.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm really excited
to be here today.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I want to find
out first about your family

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.930 align:middle line:84%
if you can chat about that a
little bit, third generation.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.920 align:middle line:84%
It was through your
mother's lineage?

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.920 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Yes, yes, yes.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:02.461 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:04.390 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
grandma and your mother

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.340 align:middle line:84%
and how this used to
show up in their lives

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.982 align:middle line:84%
and even in your life as a
little girl and all of that.

00:01:09.982 --> 00:01:11.940 align:middle line:10%
>>COOPER: It's interesting
because my grandma--

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.330 align:middle line:10%
I'll start with my grandmother
because she kind of

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.010 align:middle line:10%
paved the way for us.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.770 align:middle line:10%
Back in the 1800s-- well,
I guess early 1900s,

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.120 align:middle line:10%
she migrated here
from the Caribbean.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.970 align:middle line:10%
And she was one of
those people that

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.380 align:middle line:10%
had just wanted to cover
all bases because she

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.610 align:middle line:10%
was very hardworking.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.400 align:middle line:84%
She felt that there
was definitely

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.550 align:middle line:84%
something to energy and
also to physicality.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.760 align:middle line:84%
So she always applied
energetic things

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.130 align:middle line:90%
over top of her physical world.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.010 align:middle line:84%
I remember very early on
her taking me to health food

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.390 align:middle line:90%
stores in the 1970s.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.310 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was really something.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.590 align:middle line:90%
She was into organics.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And where was this?

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.120 align:middle line:90%
Where were you raised?

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.090 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: She was in New York.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In New York.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.665 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: In New York, yep.

00:01:52.665 --> 00:01:54.960 align:middle line:84%
And she was very much
about making sure

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.449 align:middle line:84%
that you had the
energy physically

00:01:57.449 --> 00:01:58.990 align:middle line:84%
and you were taking
care of your body

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.700 align:middle line:84%
but also that you
were always thinking

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.860 align:middle line:90%
about your spirituality.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.690 align:middle line:90%
So she covered a lot of things.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:04.850 align:middle line:90%
She wore a Star of David.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.790 align:middle line:84%
She also wore a
Miraculous Medal.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.520 align:middle line:84%
She would watch
Robert Schuller on TV.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.500 align:middle line:84%
I remember her handing me a
packet of the little booklets

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.156 align:middle line:84%
that were all about spirituality
and about handling hard times.

00:02:17.156 --> 00:02:18.530 align:middle line:84%
And she said to
me-- and this was

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.738 align:middle line:84%
when I was in my early
teens-- she said to me someday

00:02:20.738 --> 00:02:21.760 align:middle line:90%
you'll need these.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.460 align:middle line:90%
Someday life will get hard.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And you'll need to
lean on something.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be
more than your mind,

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.780 align:middle line:84%
more than your
physical, mental mind,

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.880 align:middle line:84%
you'll need to step into
something greater than

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:32.930 align:middle line:90%
yourself.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, my mother had a little bit
different experiences with her.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.230 align:middle line:84%
Because when my mom
went off to college,

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.550 align:middle line:84%
my grandmother had packed her
suitcase in a very special way.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.137 align:middle line:84%
She had packed certain things
on one side of the suitcase

00:02:44.137 --> 00:02:45.220 align:middle line:90%
and other things on other.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.361 align:middle line:84%
And she pulled out in
her brand new dorm room

00:02:47.361 --> 00:02:49.110 align:middle line:84%
with all her new
friends, who knew nothing

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.943 align:middle line:84%
about this, a knot of
garlic for protection.

00:02:50.943 --> 00:02:52.229 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:53.520 align:middle line:90%
She says I had all these herbs.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.478 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank God it
wasn't chicken entrails.

00:02:55.478 --> 00:02:56.520 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Yeah, exactly.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.450 align:middle line:84%
We recently had to
redo my mother's house.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And she's still living
in the same house

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.106 align:middle line:84%
that my grandmother
had helped her

00:03:01.106 --> 00:03:04.130 align:middle line:90%
to purchase, our family house.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And they had to rip the
ceiling to redo the basement.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And all these amulets
fell out of the ceiling--

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, my God.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: --that my grandmother
had put to protect the house.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.635 align:middle line:84%
Well, my family's had
the house for 60 years.

00:03:15.635 --> 00:03:17.280 align:middle line:90%
So it's actually it worked.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.360 align:middle line:84%
But essentially, my
grandmother really

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.940 align:middle line:84%
leaned into her intuition
because back in the days

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.960 align:middle line:84%
when she was working-- and
she worked for the subway

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.360 align:middle line:84%
in New York-- and she would
say if she got five cents,

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.750 align:middle line:90%
she'd put it in the bank.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.450 align:middle line:84%
She was in the time
of the Depression.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And they had to come
up with some other way

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.840 align:middle line:84%
to feel hopeful,
to get guidance,

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.420 align:middle line:84%
to follow her instincts
and her intuition

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.400 align:middle line:84%
because she wasn't
getting-- she wasn't

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.580 align:middle line:90%
born into a lot of money.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.275 align:middle line:84%
She was coming in
at a time she had

00:03:46.275 --> 00:03:48.250 align:middle line:84%
to raise two little
children by herself

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.710 align:middle line:84%
and really lean into something
greater than herself.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.600 align:middle line:90%
So then that takes us to my mom.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.829 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And did she apply her
intuition in her daily life?

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:56.870 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Oh, absolutely.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:57.437 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:03:57.437 --> 00:03:58.520 align:middle line:90%
Should always get people--

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.978 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So did
people and friends

00:03:59.978 --> 00:04:01.720 align:middle line:84%
know that if they
needed some clarity,

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.570 align:middle line:90%
they'd go to your grandma?

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.160 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: Well, she
was the wise one.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.993 align:middle line:90%
So was the wise one.

00:04:04.993 --> 00:04:06.100 align:middle line:90%
She was the wisdom keeper.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.860 align:middle line:84%
She was the one who would always
tell you, now, is that what

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.364 align:middle line:90%
you think or is that you feel?

00:04:10.364 --> 00:04:11.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.820 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: So she was--
at a very early age,

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:13.590 align:middle line:90%
I was getting that distinction.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:14.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What nice guidance.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.579 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: Yes, Really,
really powerful guidance.

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.180 align:middle line:84%
And she was very
much into fashion.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.740 align:middle line:84%
And she actually
was a seamstress.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.230 align:middle line:84%
But she followed a very
non-linear path in the way

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.930 align:middle line:90%
that she would operate.

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.620 align:middle line:84%
So if something felt
right, she would

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.570 align:middle line:84%
go in that direction as opposed
to the logical next step

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.290 align:middle line:90%
from the mental mind.

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And so my mother
was similar to that.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.850 align:middle line:84%
But she was around
during the time

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.360 align:middle line:84%
when Shirley MacLaine came
out with Out on a Limb.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.115 align:middle line:84%
And I distinctly remember
her getting into the Seth

00:04:47.115 --> 00:04:48.560 align:middle line:90%
work and the Edward Cayce work.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Because at that
point now we had some

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.380 align:middle line:84%
of the bigger classic
spiritual leaders

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.510 align:middle line:90%
coming to the forefront.

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And they were starting to get
into the mainstream, at least

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:56.490 align:middle line:90%
with publishing.

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And then when Shirley came
out with Out on a Limb,

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.650 align:middle line:84%
my mother was very
involved with that.

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.060 align:middle line:84%
In fact, she went and she
took workshops from Shirley

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.950 align:middle line:84%
and learned quite
a bit from her.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.600 align:middle line:84%
So while other kids were in the
mall and shopping for clothes,

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.350 align:middle line:84%
I was riding horses and going
to trans-channeling sessions

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:13.520 align:middle line:90%
on the weekend with my mom.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.790 align:middle line:84%
I think my first
trans-channeling session

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.000 align:middle line:84%
was in this lady's
basement in Long Island.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.540 align:middle line:84%
I think I was
about 16 years old.

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:20.510 align:middle line:84%
My mother had you
have to see this.

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:21.384 align:middle line:90%
You have to see this.

00:05:21.384 --> 00:05:23.960 align:middle line:84%
So I learned very
early on what a medium,

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.500 align:middle line:90%
what a trans-channeler was.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.370 align:middle line:84%
Some of the psychics she
was going to back then

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.520 align:middle line:84%
are now some of our
world-renowned psychics

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.880 align:middle line:90%
now that many years later.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.160 align:middle line:84%
So she also taught me
a lot about dreams.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.890 align:middle line:84%
Because my mom's
a psychotherapist.

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.220 align:middle line:84%
So it's interesting
because my family has

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.060 align:middle line:90%
a very high level of education.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.350 align:middle line:84%
So we covered all the
traditional bases.

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.690 align:middle line:84%
My mother has a
doctorate in psychology.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.300 align:middle line:84%
She's a psychoanalytic
social worker.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And so she really had the
mental health background.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.622 align:middle line:84%
But she also had the
curiosity that there was more.

00:05:59.622 --> 00:06:00.830 align:middle line:90%
That was from my grandmother.

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And my mother also has
very prophetic dreams.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.390 align:middle line:84%
So her intuitive abilities
came from her prophetic dreams.

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.640 align:middle line:84%
So we would sit down at the
breakfast table, my sister

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.127 align:middle line:84%
and I. My mother would be
standing making breakfast.

00:06:11.127 --> 00:06:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And she says I had
a dream last night.

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:13.560 align:middle line:90%
And we went uh-oh.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.195 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:06:15.195 --> 00:06:17.320 align:middle line:84%
We could get by with nothing
because no matter what

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.110 align:middle line:84%
we could keep from her
during the daylight,

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:20.401 align:middle line:90%
she would get it in her dreams.

00:06:20.401 --> 00:06:21.480 align:middle line:90%
And she would--

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.755 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:06:21.755 --> 00:06:23.296 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: --tell
us, OK, you're going

00:06:23.296 --> 00:06:26.390 align:middle line:84%
to do-- she figured out both
of my sister's pregnancies,

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:28.240 align:middle line:90%
actually all three of them.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:28.759 align:middle line:90%
To this day.

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:30.050 align:middle line:90%
I mean, she's still around now.

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did she bust you
on some things you would have

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:32.360 align:middle line:90%
preferred--

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:32.680 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Oh, big time.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.890 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:35.040 align:middle line:90%
She knew everything.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.050 align:middle line:90%
She knew everything.

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.310 align:middle line:90%
And it was scary.

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.754 align:middle line:84%
And she also was very
good at sizing people up.

00:06:39.754 --> 00:06:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Now of course, she had the
mental health background.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.170 align:middle line:84%
So that added into her
ability to do analytical work.

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:47.240 align:middle line:90%
But she also had a gut feeling.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I
remember very distinctly way

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.580 align:middle line:84%
before-- I rejected this
work for quite some time

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.250 align:middle line:90%
until I was in my late teens.

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.600 align:middle line:84%
But I remember her doing
her private practice session

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.604 align:middle line:90%
with her people at the house.

00:07:00.604 --> 00:07:02.020 align:middle line:84%
And so she'd have
clients come in.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.352 align:middle line:84%
And she would do family
therapy or couples therapy.

00:07:04.352 --> 00:07:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And she would come
out of the room.

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.351 align:middle line:84%
And she'd say, you
know, I don't know

00:07:07.351 --> 00:07:10.230 align:middle line:84%
where all that came from
but I know that I just

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:11.510 align:middle line:90%
channelled that session.

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.940 align:middle line:84%
And I would hear that
as part of-- you know,

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.530 align:middle line:84%
she said something
else came in and helped

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:17.660 align:middle line:90%
these people through me.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.900 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't me analyzing
their specific problem.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now, you were a
young girl still at this time?

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:24.221 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Yes, yes.

00:07:24.221 --> 00:07:27.822 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How did
you feel about that?

00:07:27.822 --> 00:07:29.280 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: I was
riding horses and I

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.344 align:middle line:90%
was going to school and stuff.

00:07:32.344 --> 00:07:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And I was competitive
in the horseback riding,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:35.560 align:middle line:90%
in the equestrian world.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.470 align:middle line:84%
So I was always
try to figure out

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:38.940 align:middle line:90%
how do I fit this into my life?

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:40.532 align:middle line:90%
Like right what is this?

00:07:40.532 --> 00:07:42.240 align:middle line:84%
And I was very nervous
when I was riding.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.240 align:middle line:90%
I was jumping fences.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.960 align:middle line:84%
I was just a nervous-- I had
kind of a nervous personality

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:46.630 align:middle line:90%
type.

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:48.310 align:middle line:84%
So I would kind
of lean into some

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:51.090 align:middle line:84%
of the meditations and
things that my mom was doing.

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:53.540 align:middle line:84%
She would have Shirley
MacLaine's chakra cleansing

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.830 align:middle line:84%
video on and all
those types of things.

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:58.830 align:middle line:84%
So it was just kind
of by association.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:01.610 align:middle line:84%
But honestly, I rejected
it for quite some time

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:03.480 align:middle line:90%
until my life got hard enough.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:06.770 align:middle line:84%
And I think that happens for
people is that I was surrounded

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:08.610 align:middle line:90%
by it, not really knowing.

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:11.720 align:middle line:84%
The first time, though,
that I really remember,

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.170 align:middle line:84%
like that defining
moment where I

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:15.340 align:middle line:84%
went from just being
the innocent bystander

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:19.120 align:middle line:84%
kid whose mom does some pretty
interesting things to actually

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.659 align:middle line:84%
stepping into it is we went
through this wonderful store

00:08:22.659 --> 00:08:23.450 align:middle line:90%
out on Long Island.

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:25.500 align:middle line:84%
It was a New Age store
called Dreams East.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:26.950 align:middle line:90%
And my mother loved it.

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:29.120 align:middle line:84%
They had crystals
and the incense.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.151 align:middle line:90%
And who doesn't?

00:08:30.151 --> 00:08:31.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This was when?

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:31.600 align:middle line:90%
In the '80s?

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.630 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: In the
'80s, yeah, early.

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:35.069 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's
when those shops flourished

00:08:35.069 --> 00:08:35.860 align:middle line:90%
across the country.

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:37.030 align:middle line:90%
There were a lot of good ones.

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:37.210 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Oh, absolutely.

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And this one was just
really off the charts.

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And I remember walking
through the bookstore.

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:45.110 align:middle line:84%
My mom was, of course, at the
counter analyzing the crystals.

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:48.465 align:middle line:84%
And a book fell off the
shelf right in front of me.

00:08:48.465 --> 00:08:49.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which book?

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:50.650 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Just like they said.

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:52.384 align:middle line:84%
Shakti Gawain's
"Living in the Light."

00:08:52.384 --> 00:08:53.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.855 align:middle line:84%
And that's just the message
you needed in that moment.

00:08:55.855 --> 00:08:56.150 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Just the message.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:58.520 align:middle line:84%
And I remember reading
that book cover to cover.

00:08:58.520 --> 00:08:59.980 align:middle line:90%
I started in the car.

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:01.380 align:middle line:90%
It took me about a day.

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:03.110 align:middle line:84%
I read the entire
book cover to cover.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And that night, I dreamt
of dolphins, all night,

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:08.450 align:middle line:90%
just blue waters and dolphins.

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:10.680 align:middle line:84%
And I knew something
had shifted.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.620 align:middle line:90%
And that was, I believe, 1986.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.020 align:middle line:84%
From that point on, that was
the beginning of my journey.

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:19.230 align:middle line:84%
That was when I started to
question and to see things.

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.240 align:middle line:84%
Not just because my
mother said so or just

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.150 align:middle line:84%
because my grandmother
gave me some wisdom.

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:27.060 align:middle line:84%
It was almost like they were
giving a catalog, a reference

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:27.560 align:middle line:90%
catalog.

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.260 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: And then
as my life started

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.850 align:middle line:84%
to take hold as an adult,
I was able to go back

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:36.381 align:middle line:84%
to those references
and say, ah, yeah,

00:09:36.381 --> 00:09:39.070 align:middle line:84%
Oma said that to me or
Mom said that to me.

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:40.400 align:middle line:90%
But that book, that book.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.540 align:middle line:84%
I eventually, on my
show, I eventually

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:46.260 align:middle line:84%
for Shakti's anniversary of
the book, 25th anniversary,

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:47.260 align:middle line:90%
she came on my show.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:48.010 align:middle line:90%
And I interviewed.

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:50.431 align:middle line:84%
So it was like a
wonderful full circle.

00:09:50.431 --> 00:09:51.180 align:middle line:90%
It was phenomenal.

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:52.638 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
well, how lucky you

00:09:52.638 --> 00:09:53.980 align:middle line:90%
were to have such a lineage.

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:55.854 align:middle line:84%
Now in your own life,
were you noticing

00:09:55.854 --> 00:09:58.020 align:middle line:84%
that you were getting
intuitive hits on things, even

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:01.735 align:middle line:84%
if you were rejecting this as
a serious path of any kind?

00:10:01.735 --> 00:10:04.097 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: I was very
sensitive, from the time

00:10:04.097 --> 00:10:04.930 align:middle line:90%
I was a little girl.

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:07.013 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my mom would take
me to the grocery store.

00:10:07.013 --> 00:10:10.635 align:middle line:84%
And if I heard the carts clank
together, I was screaming.

00:10:10.635 --> 00:10:14.040 align:middle line:84%
I was very, very sensitive
when I was riding horses.

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And what I always
knew, well, number one,

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:20.030 align:middle line:84%
is I kind of started to really
communicate with animals.

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:21.040 align:middle line:90%
We always had pets.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.200 align:middle line:84%
And I was with the
horses and everything.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:26.660 align:middle line:84%
And I could sort
of sense what they

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:28.277 align:middle line:84%
were feeling when
they were feeling

00:10:28.277 --> 00:10:29.860 align:middle line:84%
under the weather,
that type of thing.

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:32.820 align:middle line:84%
So that was kind of my-- not
that I started out as an animal

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.780 align:middle line:84%
communicator, but
I did notice that I

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:38.900 align:middle line:84%
would get a hunch about my dog
and the dog would get sick.

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:42.880 align:middle line:84%
Or those types of things, little
synchronistic types of things.

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:47.560 align:middle line:84%
I really first, though,
stepped into really

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:51.780 align:middle line:84%
seeing my psychic
ability sort of burst

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:55.720 align:middle line:84%
to the scene when I went walking
with a friend of mine one day.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And I had just want
to a psychic reading.

00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:59.060 align:middle line:90%
If fact, she had gone with me.

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:03.824 align:middle line:84%
And the gal held a piece
of jewelry of mine.

00:11:03.824 --> 00:11:04.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Psychometry.

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.020 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Psychometry, right.

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:07.510 align:middle line:90%
And she read.

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:09.340 align:middle line:84%
She did a beautiful
job of reading me.

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:12.407 align:middle line:84%
And I said this is
interesting because I

00:11:12.407 --> 00:11:13.490 align:middle line:90%
wonder if I could do that.

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:14.800 align:middle line:84%
I wander if I could
hold someone's jewelry.

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.710 align:middle line:84%
Because the psychic kept
saying, yes, you can do this.

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:17.680 align:middle line:90%
You can do this.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.750 align:middle line:84%
So my friend Margaret and
I went out to the park.

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And I said give
me your earrings.

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:23.480 align:middle line:90%
I held her earring.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:24.897 align:middle line:84%
And I had this
long walking stick.

00:11:24.897 --> 00:11:25.980 align:middle line:90%
And it was kind of curved.

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And it was skitching
across the ground.

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.300 align:middle line:90%
And so we started playing.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:30.300 align:middle line:90%
I thought I was playing.

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:31.900 align:middle line:84%
This happens for people
as they're discovering.

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.160 align:middle line:90%
You think you're playing around.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.970 align:middle line:84%
I said, oh, well, you know
know, there was this guy.

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:36.310 align:middle line:90%
And he was from Cincinnati.

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And I started telling
her this story.

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:38.588 align:middle line:90%
And she starts gasping.

00:11:38.588 --> 00:11:39.500 align:middle line:90%
She goes that's true.

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:40.660 align:middle line:90%
I was like stop it.

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.320 align:middle line:90%
And she says I'm not kidding.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, for the next two hours,
walked around the park,

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:45.966 align:middle line:90%
skitching this stick.

00:11:45.966 --> 00:11:47.090 align:middle line:90%
I thought it was the stick.

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:48.860 align:middle line:90%
I didn't think it was me.

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:51.060 align:middle line:90%
But the stick was just a rhythm.

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:52.470 align:middle line:90%
It was just a rhythm.

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:55.380 align:middle line:84%
I was just how I was
connecting at that time.

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.200 align:middle line:84%
So entrepreneurial
Mari, typical me,

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.050 align:middle line:84%
once she told me I was
right, I went ahead

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:00.720 align:middle line:84%
and had business
cards made, of course.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm a psychic.

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:01.866 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:01.866 --> 00:12:02.366 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:12:02.366 --> 00:12:04.260 align:middle line:90%
I have to go into business now.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.077 align:middle line:84%
And I was still I was in
corporate America by that time.

00:12:07.077 --> 00:12:09.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you're
very driven, competitive,

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:09.860 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:12.900 align:middle line:84%
So you're not going to let
that opportunity slip by.

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.740 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about psychometry
for a minute for people

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:17.550 align:middle line:90%
who aren't familiar with it.

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:19.670 align:middle line:84%
Because for me, that was
one of the first entrees

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:23.220 align:middle line:84%
too was a little class
in the '80s, early '80s,

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.360 align:middle line:84%
on psychic phenomena
and developing it.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.440 align:middle line:84%
And same thing, it
somebody's ring.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:30.130 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about psychometry.

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:34.060 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: Psychometry is
when you take something

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:35.860 align:middle line:84%
that a person wears
on their body.

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:38.835 align:middle line:84%
And what people don't realize
is that-- of course we all

00:12:38.835 --> 00:12:40.960 align:middle line:84%
know, especially on this
show-- know that we're all

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.140 align:middle line:90%
made up of energy.

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:46.270 align:middle line:84%
But even our inanimate objects
also take on, have a vibration.

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And they take on the
vibration and actually can

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.780 align:middle line:84%
record the history of the
person wearing the object.

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:54.190 align:middle line:84%
So when you hold that piece
of metal, particularly

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.555 align:middle line:84%
jewelry, good gold, silver,
that type of thing, a watch.

00:12:56.555 --> 00:12:58.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Things very
personal to the person.

00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:00.570 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: Very
personal to the person.

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:04.680 align:middle line:84%
That psychic can pick up some
of those timelines for you

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:07.030 align:middle line:84%
and the energies
for you as well.

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:09.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
a fun thing to do.

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:09.870 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: It's a
great way to play.

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like you say,
initially you're just playing.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:11.670 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: That's right.

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:13.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And of course,
the enemy of that

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:16.127 align:middle line:84%
is being concerned whether
you're right or wrong.

00:13:16.127 --> 00:13:16.710 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Yes.

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:17.020 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:18.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That just shuts
it down really fast.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Oh, absolutely.

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:22.226 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's why so many
people have, quote, beginners

00:13:22.226 --> 00:13:25.280 align:middle line:84%
luck in these areas because
they're simply open.

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:27.310 align:middle line:84%
And they're not riding
themselves hard.

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:29.069 align:middle line:90%
And information just flows in.

00:13:29.069 --> 00:13:30.360 align:middle line:90%
You think like you, it's silly.

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.130 align:middle line:90%
But it's not.

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:31.540 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: That's right.

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:32.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's a
good way for people

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:35.259 align:middle line:84%
to start playing and
developing their own intuition.

00:13:35.259 --> 00:13:36.300 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Oh, absolutely.

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:36.950 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:39.064 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it got
to the point where

00:13:39.064 --> 00:13:40.730 align:middle line:84%
as you get more
confident, when you hear

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:42.890 align:middle line:90%
someone say, yes, that's me.

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:45.000 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.909 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:13:46.909 --> 00:13:48.700 align:middle line:84%
It opens up the gateways
for you to receive

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:50.300 align:middle line:90%
even more information.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:53.340 align:middle line:84%
So that outside validation is
actually a very good thing.

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:54.954 align:middle line:84%
And that's why in
come in and play,

00:13:54.954 --> 00:13:56.370 align:middle line:84%
you don't have all
these hang ups,

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:57.050 align:middle line:90%
like am I going to be accurate.

00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:58.925 align:middle line:84%
And just charged this
person this much money.

00:13:58.925 --> 00:14:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And are they going to
want their money back?

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:02.369 align:middle line:90%
It really it's a way.

00:14:02.369 --> 00:14:02.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:04.167 align:middle line:90%
So you tried it once.

00:14:04.167 --> 00:14:05.000 align:middle line:90%
You were good at it.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.250 align:middle line:90%
You made up your business card.

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:07.166 align:middle line:90%
So then what happened?

00:14:07.166 --> 00:14:08.870 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Then I tanked.

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:09.580 align:middle line:90%
I sat down--

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:10.905 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:10.905 --> 00:14:12.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now you're
attached to the outcome.

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:14.490 align:middle line:84%
It's not beginner's
luck in effect anymore.

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:14.640 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: That's right.

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:17.210 align:middle line:84%
Someone came to my
house and I said, uh-oh.

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:18.950 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea what I was doing.

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:21.459 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't a play time
in the park anymore.

00:14:21.459 --> 00:14:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, maybe I need
to look into this a little bit

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:24.500 align:middle line:90%
further.

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:26.682 align:middle line:90%


00:14:26.682 --> 00:14:27.390 align:middle line:90%
That's the truth.

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:27.580 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:28.370 align:middle line:90%
I tanked.

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:30.770 align:middle line:90%
And so that lady left the house.

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:32.282 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:32.282 --> 00:14:33.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did she ask
for her money back?

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:34.810 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: Actually, no
she didn't because I

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:35.810 align:middle line:90%
got a few things right.

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:38.320 align:middle line:84%
But I kind of shortened
the reading and everything.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.820 align:middle line:84%
And I just said,
OK, clearly there's

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:42.770 align:middle line:84%
more to this than just
walking around the park.

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And so I went into corporate
America at that point.

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:48.430 align:middle line:90%
I had gotten my MBA.

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:50.080 align:middle line:90%
And I was working.

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.570 align:middle line:84%
And I was hating
every minute of it.

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:54.950 align:middle line:84%
I walked in there and I just
knew, this isn't for me.

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:57.500 align:middle line:84%
I just in two days,
this is not for me.

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.944 align:middle line:84%
But I was developing
my intuitive abilities

00:14:59.944 --> 00:15:01.110 align:middle line:90%
because I wanted to get out.

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:02.094 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to figure out.

00:15:02.094 --> 00:15:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't necessarily
want to be a psychic.

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:07.650 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted to-- I knew that
there was something in me that

00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:11.410 align:middle line:84%
was driving me, that was
drawing me forward to it,

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:13.190 align:middle line:90%
so caused me to want to study.

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:16.134 align:middle line:84%
So I left, eventually
left corporate America.

00:15:16.134 --> 00:15:17.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How long
were you there?

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:18.550 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Eight years.

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:19.050 align:middle line:90%
Eights year.

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:20.470 align:middle line:84%
Major telecommunications
company.

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:21.530 align:middle line:90%
My family was thrilled.

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:22.590 align:middle line:90%
She works for the phone company.

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:23.590 align:middle line:90%
Everybody needs a phone.

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:24.680 align:middle line:90%
You'll have a job forever.

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:25.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hated it.

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.081 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: And I hated it.

00:15:26.081 --> 00:15:27.610 align:middle line:90%
Hated it.

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:30.840 align:middle line:84%
But it gave me a good
solid business background.

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.440 align:middle line:84%
So I tell people
don't necessarily

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.790 align:middle line:84%
quit your day job to come
and do all of this stuff.

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:36.390 align:middle line:84%
But because it did
help eventually.

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:37.890 align:middle line:84%
When you start a
business, you still

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:39.473 align:middle line:84%
do have to know how
to run a business.

00:15:39.473 --> 00:15:40.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:44.400 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: So the real
sort of turning point,

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.580 align:middle line:90%
though, was that I was engaged.

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And my fiance passed
away very suddenly.

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:50.050 align:middle line:90%
And it was devastating.

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:51.840 align:middle line:90%
I was in my 20s.

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And I remember standing
on a hill at the cemetery,

00:15:54.890 --> 00:16:00.460 align:middle line:84%
looking out across all of the
tombstones or grave markers.

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:01.770 align:middle line:90%
Tombstones.

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And I had this moment
where I felt like,

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:10.390 align:middle line:84%
look at all these talent
that's in this graveyard.

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:15.170 align:middle line:84%
Like how rich is this graveyard
with all this talent, all

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:18.790 align:middle line:84%
these unsung songs, all of this
poetry that was never written.

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:20.480 align:middle line:90%
And it really hit me.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.230 align:middle line:90%
Two things hit me.

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:25.670 align:middle line:84%
One was that we go too soon
with our dreams intact.

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:28.920 align:middle line:84%
Too many people go with their
dreams intact, they die.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.837 align:middle line:84%
Because they get caught
up in bills and money.

00:16:30.837 --> 00:16:32.044 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Unfulfilled dreams.

00:16:32.044 --> 00:16:33.070 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: That's right.

00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:35.435 align:middle line:84%
And also that there
had to be a way that I

00:16:35.435 --> 00:16:36.750 align:middle line:90%
could speak with him still.

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:39.650 align:middle line:84%
Because he was very, very
spiritual and very prophetic

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:40.680 align:middle line:90%
himself.

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.210 align:middle line:84%
So I knew that there
were two things going on.

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:45.770 align:middle line:84%
One was that I wanted to help
people to find their passion

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:47.940 align:middle line:84%
and to find their
right livelihood

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:52.440 align:middle line:84%
and to make sure that they
were living a fulfilled life.

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:56.135 align:middle line:84%
And the other was that there
had to be something more

00:16:56.135 --> 00:16:59.360 align:middle line:84%
and a way to communicate,
there had to be something more.

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:02.520 align:middle line:84%
So I start to
really explore that.

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.459 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very
heartfelt exploration.

00:17:04.459 --> 00:17:06.260 align:middle line:90%
And I left corporate.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.359 align:middle line:84%
And I took time to go and
work with Doreen Virtue.

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:10.960 align:middle line:90%
And that's when I got certified.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And I learned the mechanics
of some of the things

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:17.069 align:middle line:84%
I was doing on a natural basis
but I got more confidence

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:19.069 align:middle line:90%
in how to do that.

00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:22.740 align:middle line:84%
And so the other
thing that I did was I

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:24.290 align:middle line:84%
took a class in
mediumship because I

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:26.146 align:middle line:84%
heard about James
Van Praagh and some

00:17:26.146 --> 00:17:27.270 align:middle line:90%
of these other big mediums.

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, I know
I can talk to him.

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:30.400 align:middle line:90%
I know I can talk to him.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.724 align:middle line:84%
For a full year, I went from
medium to medium to medium.

00:17:33.724 --> 00:17:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And they all said
you can do this.

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:36.084 align:middle line:90%
He won't come through.

00:17:36.084 --> 00:17:37.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the biggest
ones in the country.

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:40.430 align:middle line:84%
I had to wait for six
months for some of them.

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:43.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you were
skating on it because you

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.195 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't connect yourself.

00:17:44.195 --> 00:17:44.820 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Yeah.

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:48.054 align:middle line:84%
And so I went to one class that
happened to be on my fiance's

00:17:48.054 --> 00:17:49.470 align:middle line:84%
what would have
been his birthday.

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And I said, if you don't
come through today,

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:51.734 align:middle line:90%
I'm never doing this again.

00:17:51.734 --> 00:17:52.380 align:middle line:90%
Not doing it.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And that day I sat down and I
went to this mediumship class

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.320 align:middle line:84%
thinking that I will
learn about mediumship.

00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And she said you all are doing
to do mediumship yourselves.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.032 align:middle line:90%
And we swapped pictures.

00:18:01.032 --> 00:18:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up doing a
reading for a lady next to me.

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:04.940 align:middle line:90%
And she was crying and sobbing.

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:06.160 align:middle line:90%
The teacher was so excited.

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.490 align:middle line:84%
She asked me to go
around the entire class.

00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:10.250 align:middle line:84%
Ended up reading
everyone in the class.

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I discovered
these mediumship abilities.

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:15.880 align:middle line:84%
So I think that, yes,
that I'm an intuitive

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:20.970 align:middle line:84%
and, yes, I have
generations in my family.

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:23.100 align:middle line:84%
But I think also
what was happening

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:26.390 align:middle line:84%
was that I was being taught
the awakening process of what

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:29.970 align:middle line:84%
was already within
me that we all have.

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:30.760 align:middle line:90%
That we all have.

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And started to, in
very haphazard ways,

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:36.790 align:middle line:90%
learn that there is a process.

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:41.260 align:middle line:84%
There is a step-by-step process
of how to receive guidance.

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:44.580 align:middle line:84%
And I did study all
different types of religions

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:46.425 align:middle line:90%
while once I left corporate.

00:18:46.425 --> 00:18:47.490 align:middle line:90%
I studied Buddhism.

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:48.310 align:middle line:90%
I studied Hinduism.

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:49.870 align:middle line:90%
I studied the Tao.

00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:54.560 align:middle line:84%
I studied all the metaphysical
things and spiritualists.

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I
was raised Catholic.

00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:58.440 align:middle line:90%
So I went through 12 years.

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:01.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What did you find as
maybe a single common thread

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:04.260 align:middle line:84%
that was useful
from all of them?

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.060 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: The one thing
was that everybody

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:08.654 align:middle line:90%
is to teaching how to ask.

00:19:08.654 --> 00:19:10.570 align:middle line:84%
First recognize that
there's something greater

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:11.195 align:middle line:90%
than ourselves.

00:19:11.195 --> 00:19:15.090 align:middle line:84%
I call it the God of your
understanding, that energy

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:18.290 align:middle line:84%
that you can turn to
that goes beyond this.

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:22.440 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, we were taught a
tremendous amount of doctrine

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:24.290 align:middle line:90%
and how to ask for something.

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:25.230 align:middle line:90%
How to ask for favor.

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:26.188 align:middle line:90%
How to ask for healing.

00:19:26.188 --> 00:19:28.020 align:middle line:84%
How to ask for money,
a boyfriend, prayer.

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:28.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In all the religions.

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:28.850 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: A house.

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:29.810 align:middle line:90%
In all religions.

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:33.100 align:middle line:84%
There's always a some sort
of doctrine on how to ask,

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:35.770 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a rosary
bead, or it's prayer beads,

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:38.090 align:middle line:84%
or it's the stations
of the cross, whatever

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:40.630 align:middle line:84%
those different things
are we were asking.

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:45.550 align:middle line:84%
My thought was if there's
so many systems of asking,

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:48.750 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't there be an equally
robust system of getting

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:51.510 align:middle line:84%
answers, of receiving
the answers.

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:56.499 align:middle line:84%
How do we decipher the
answers that we actually get?

00:19:56.499 --> 00:19:58.040 align:middle line:84%
Because that's where
people-- we keep

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:00.600 align:middle line:84%
asking and asking and asking
and asking and asking and then

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:02.952 align:middle line:90%
waiting, like where?

00:20:02.952 --> 00:20:03.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:04.165 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: What?

00:20:04.165 --> 00:20:04.420 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:05.040 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.010 align:middle line:90%
Was that a sign?

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:07.150 align:middle line:90%
Oh, wait, wait.

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:11.320 align:middle line:84%
And unless it's the
lottery on lottery day,

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:13.760 align:middle line:90%
we feel like maybe we missed it.

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And what we're not
realizing is that there

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:18.940 align:middle line:84%
is a language coming at us
24 hours a day 7 days a week.

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:22.710 align:middle line:84%
My grandmother was more
in the waking state.

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:25.380 align:middle line:84%
My mother was receiving
the messages in her dreams.

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:27.640 align:middle line:90%
It's 24/7.

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:29.210 align:middle line:90%
And it's on all the time.

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:33.337 align:middle line:84%
And each religion
has their version

00:20:33.337 --> 00:20:35.420 align:middle line:84%
of the receiving of the
answers but that's usually

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:38.390 align:middle line:90%
shrouded for the higher ups.

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:41.459 align:middle line:84%
That's the power is the
language of answers.

00:20:41.459 --> 00:20:43.000 align:middle line:84%
Because if you don't
have the answers

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.875 align:middle line:84%
and you keep having to ask,
would you keep coming back?

00:20:45.875 --> 00:20:46.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:47.710 align:middle line:90%
Very good point.

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:49.640 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: So that's
the piece like when

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:51.680 align:middle line:90%
I studied the Kabbalah.

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:54.310 align:middle line:84%
The mysteries, those
mysteries, were really

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:59.270 align:middle line:84%
reserved for rabbis
over 40 years old, men.

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And so as I started to piece
all these things together,

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:05.980 align:middle line:84%
it was like but what
about the answer prayer?

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:08.010 align:middle line:90%
Is it just, OK, here's a cup.

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:08.760 align:middle line:90%
I asked for a cup.

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:09.210 align:middle line:90%
Here's a cup.

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:09.710 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:10.370 align:middle line:90%
There it is.

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:10.870 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:11.970 align:middle line:90%
There's steps.

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:15.180 align:middle line:84%
So people get a little
off in their mindset

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:18.040 align:middle line:84%
about answers because they
think, OK, well, I asked.

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:20.080 align:middle line:90%
I did a vision board.

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.140 align:middle line:90%
It's law of attraction.

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:22.060 align:middle line:90%
I did all this.

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:26.750 align:middle line:84%
And now I expect the Rolls Royce
to boom, down out of the sky

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:27.419 align:middle line:90%
like somehow.

00:21:27.419 --> 00:21:29.460 align:middle line:84%
But what they don't realize
is that at the minute

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:31.550 align:middle line:84%
you k-- and this is
for any religion,

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:33.810 align:middle line:84%
because this applies
to everything--

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:37.680 align:middle line:84%
your energetic communication
system kicks into gear to start

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:40.580 align:middle line:84%
you on the path to receiving
what you've asked for.

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
where my career kind of

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:46.230 align:middle line:84%
started to get very
interesting for me

00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:50.820 align:middle line:84%
to see over the years-- it took
me seven years to write what

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:55.000 align:middle line:84%
I've written-- but over the
years to see the commonalities,

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.020 align:middle line:84%
to see that each religion
has it in some way,

00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:01.390 align:middle line:84%
shape, or form it applies, and
that we're all born with it.

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:05.600 align:middle line:84%
These are natural,
energetic capacities

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.320 align:middle line:84%
that we have that are overlaid
over our physical body.

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:10.430 align:middle line:84%
If I learned anything
from my grandmother

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:14.530 align:middle line:84%
it was that we always if
we look beyond the surface,

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:17.080 align:middle line:84%
we need to always consider--
I call them pillars--

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:20.280 align:middle line:84%
but there's four
legs of the table.

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.980 align:middle line:84%
There's the physical,
there's the mental,

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:25.670 align:middle line:84%
there's the emotional, and
there's the energetic aspect

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:27.410 align:middle line:90%
of anything.

00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:28.760 align:middle line:90%
Of anything.

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:31.040 align:middle line:84%
And so you can look at
this cup and you can say,

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:33.470 align:middle line:90%
OK, physically it's a blue cup.

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:35.220 align:middle line:84%
And mentally I like
it because it's clean.

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:37.110 align:middle line:84%
And I don't feel
stress around it.

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:39.320 align:middle line:90%
It's keeping me happy mentally.

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:41.860 align:middle line:90%
Emotionally it's nice and cool.

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.210 align:middle line:90%
I can relate to the water.

00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:47.390 align:middle line:84%
But energetically, there's
a vibration of this as well.

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:48.850 align:middle line:90%
There's a vibration of this cup.

00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:51.640 align:middle line:84%
And it might seem
like a silly cup.

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.860 align:middle line:84%
But you know what, if you
drink some out of a cup

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:57.482 align:middle line:84%
that feels like it has a
higher vibration to you,

00:22:57.482 --> 00:22:59.690 align:middle line:84%
you'll receive the liquid
in it a lot better than you

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:00.719 align:middle line:90%
would otherwise.

00:23:00.719 --> 00:23:01.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:04.530 align:middle line:84%
So now you've
analyzed all of this.

00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:06.940 align:middle line:84%
And you have started
understanding

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:10.630 align:middle line:84%
that we have to start dialing
into these protocols ourselves,

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:12.940 align:middle line:84%
which you ended up
calling the aha factor.

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about the word
aha because everybody thinks,

00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:16.920 align:middle line:90%
oh, Oprah coined the term.

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:17.130 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Oh, yes, yes, yes.

00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:17.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:18.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:21.340 align:middle line:84%
So that's your work of
Professor Deborah Tannen, right.

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:24.260 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about her
and what she contributed

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:26.280 align:middle line:90%
regarding the notion of aha.

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:33.500 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: Well, aha is really
about that sense of energy

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:35.930 align:middle line:90%
and physicality connecting.

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:38.640 align:middle line:84%
I say it's a glimpse
of consciousness.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.380 align:middle line:90%
It's a glimpse of consciousness.

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:47.640 align:middle line:84%
So when we actually
perceive how our bodies--

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:52.840 align:middle line:84%
we feel a sensation and then we
get an insight at the same time

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.400 align:middle line:90%
and we ignite that.

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.040 align:middle line:90%
And that's that aha.

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:59.030 align:middle line:84%
So we're usually led to
that by three pieces.

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:01.300 align:middle line:84%
I called it the anatomy
of the aha moment.

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:03.720 align:middle line:84%
And the first piece is
our energetic senses.

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:06.049 align:middle line:90%
So we have the clair.

00:24:06.049 --> 00:24:07.340 align:middle line:90%
They call them the four clairs.

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:09.381 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people know
these, the clairvoyants,

00:24:09.381 --> 00:24:11.780 align:middle line:84%
which is an energetic
site overlays

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:13.095 align:middle line:90%
over your physical site.

00:24:13.095 --> 00:24:15.640 align:middle line:84%
Clairaudience, which
is energetic hearing.

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:18.360 align:middle line:84%
Clairsentience, which
is energetic feeling.

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:20.086 align:middle line:84%
And claircognizance,
which is a sense

00:24:20.086 --> 00:24:21.460 align:middle line:84%
of knowing, knowing
that you know

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:23.870 align:middle line:84%
but not really
necessarily knowing how.

00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:29.389 align:middle line:84%
Those are the first place
that an aha moment comes to.

00:24:29.389 --> 00:24:30.930 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you get an
insight, whenever

00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:33.980 align:middle line:84%
you get any kind of information,
it comes to those four senses

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:34.670 align:middle line:90%
first.

00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:37.224 align:middle line:84%
That immediately kicks
in to your physiology.

00:24:37.224 --> 00:24:39.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's where it
starts to feel like an aha

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:40.435 align:middle line:90%
because you get the goosebumps.

00:24:40.435 --> 00:24:43.920 align:middle line:84%
Or you might feel a little
sense of heat if it's negative.

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:45.850 align:middle line:84%
You might feel a
little sense of nausea.

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:48.260 align:middle line:84%
You might feel little
dizziness sometimes.

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:49.860 align:middle line:90%
But most people feel them.

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:51.270 align:middle line:90%
They call them the truth bumps.

00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:54.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's your body letting
you know, yes, you have now

00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:58.020 align:middle line:84%
received-- mail's in, you've
received an energetic message.

00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:00.250 align:middle line:90%
Part three is the environment.

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And the environment
comes and supports you.

00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:06.700 align:middle line:84%
So this is where
our energy comes in.

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:10.240 align:middle line:84%
And it says, OK, we received
the energetic sense.

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.090 align:middle line:84%
You may not even
realize you did.

00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:13.780 align:middle line:84%
You get a little
deja vu, you hear

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:17.360 align:middle line:84%
a little lyric, a song
in your clairaudience,

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.244 align:middle line:90%
the lyrics to a song.

00:25:18.244 --> 00:25:19.660 align:middle line:84%
It's trying to
send you a message.

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:20.340 align:middle line:90%
But you might miss that.

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:21.423 align:middle line:90%
So you get the goosebumps.

00:25:21.423 --> 00:25:23.740 align:middle line:84%
You say, wait a second,
I got goosebumps.

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And then what happens is
your environment starts

00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:29.680 align:middle line:84%
to send you what we call signs,
symbols, and synchronicities.

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.530 align:middle line:90%
So those three things happen.

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:32.717 align:middle line:90%
And that's when you know.

00:25:32.717 --> 00:25:35.050 align:middle line:84%
That's when people say, oh,
I think I had an aha moment.

00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:39.220 align:middle line:84%
Because they get the sense, they
get that physiological feeling,

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:41.570 align:middle line:84%
and then they start to
get these signs, symbols,

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:42.320 align:middle line:90%
and synchronicity.

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.690 align:middle line:84%
So you might see
repetitive numbers.

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:47.682 align:middle line:84%
You might overhear
someone talking about what

00:25:47.682 --> 00:25:48.890 align:middle line:90%
you were just thinking about.

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:51.515 align:middle line:84%
You might get that wayward phone
call that person you were just

00:25:51.515 --> 00:25:52.260 align:middle line:90%
thinking of.

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:55.810 align:middle line:84%
Those three things make up the
anatomy of that aha moment.

00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And once you know what those
are and you start to just

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:00.730 align:middle line:90%
to connect the dots.

00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:03.130 align:middle line:90%
It's happening to you anyway.

00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:07.420 align:middle line:84%
That's when you start to put
one aha moment next to the next

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:07.920 align:middle line:90%
to the next.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:09.780 align:middle line:84%
And it actually leads,
the breadcrumbs,

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:11.280 align:middle line:84%
to the thing that
you've been asking

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.290 align:middle line:84%
or in your prayer work and all
of the other different ways

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:13.800 align:middle line:90%
of asking.

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:15.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which often
won't come to manifest

00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:16.480 align:middle line:84%
if you're not
paying any attention

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:17.630 align:middle line:90%
to the trail of breadcrumbs.

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:18.350 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: That's right.

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:19.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
walking right past it.

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:20.000 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: That's right.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're walking right
past our own good all the time.

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:22.740 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Yes.

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:23.030 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:23.380 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:24.588 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's interesting.

00:26:24.588 --> 00:26:27.190 align:middle line:84%
For the last three days,
every day-- maybe four days.

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:30.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, all
week certainly.

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:34.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm always looking at the clock
at 1:11 and 4:11 and 11:11.

00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:37.717 align:middle line:84%
I mean, at 4:44 ,
1:11, and 11:11.

00:26:37.717 --> 00:26:38.300 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Yes.

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:39.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's just has
worked out that that way

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:40.617 align:middle line:90%
the last few days.

00:26:40.617 --> 00:26:42.950 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, you know I
need to slow down a little bit

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:44.070 align:middle line:90%
and analyze some of it.

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:45.910 align:middle line:90%
One's my birth moment.

00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:47.190 align:middle line:90%
So that's that.

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:48.867 align:middle line:90%
But, yeah.

00:26:48.867 --> 00:26:49.700 align:middle line:90%
But I have noticed--

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:50.530 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: 4:44 is the
number of the angels.

00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:52.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's
my-- I was born at 4:44.

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:53.260 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Awesome.

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:56.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the others,
the 11:11 and the 1:11,

00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:58.310 align:middle line:84%
I have my own
interpretation what that is.

00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:02.380 align:middle line:84%
But it's interesting that
like clockwork, literally,

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:03.786 align:middle line:90%
every day, I've been dialing in.

00:27:03.786 --> 00:27:04.410 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Yeah.

00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:06.340 align:middle line:84%
And you know what,
it's a sign to folks

00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:08.864 align:middle line:84%
when they start to see those
repetitive numbers that they

00:27:08.864 --> 00:27:10.780 align:middle line:84%
are being communicated
to and that they should

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:13.419 align:middle line:84%
start paying attention because
there's a lot more for them.

00:27:13.419 --> 00:27:14.460 align:middle line:90%
There's messages waiting.

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:15.105 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:15.105 --> 00:27:15.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:16.480 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:18.420 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
you talk about

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:22.730 align:middle line:84%
is how to get what we
desire and deserve.

00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:28.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, that always ends up kind of
a confusing area of all of this

00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:29.280 align:middle line:90%
in terms of manifestations.

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:29.961 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Yes.

00:27:29.961 --> 00:27:30.460 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:34.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The word deserve
is really heavily loaded.

00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:38.490 align:middle line:84%
So let's decipher what that
means in your parlance.

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:40.050 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Well, worthiness.

00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:41.300 align:middle line:10%
Big, big term.

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:45.850 align:middle line:10%
I mean, everything
goes back to it.

00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:47.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing a lot of
writing right now

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:48.816 align:middle line:90%
in self-love and worthiness.

00:27:48.816 --> 00:27:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And I've been really
contemplating this.

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:53.810 align:middle line:84%
Because no matter my readings
when I'm working with clients

00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:56.210 align:middle line:84%
or teaching or
whatever, any issue,

00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:59.790 align:middle line:84%
it all comes back
down to that point.

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:03.880 align:middle line:84%
So here's the thing, worthiness
is about understanding

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:05.986 align:middle line:84%
that you are of God
and that you are

00:28:05.986 --> 00:28:08.600 align:middle line:84%
of that connection in
that you're born with it.

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:10.600 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
people get worthiness

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:14.110 align:middle line:90%
confused with capabilities.

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:15.305 align:middle line:90%
And especially in the US.

00:28:15.305 --> 00:28:16.195 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:16.195 --> 00:28:19.260 align:middle line:84%
So we are taught, OK,
you're born, you're cute,

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:20.250 align:middle line:90%
you're wonderful.

00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:24.170 align:middle line:84%
Now on the energetic sense,
God, angels, and everybody else,

00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:26.840 align:middle line:84%
on that senses says worthy
because just by showing up.

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:30.680 align:middle line:84%
She's of the essence, of the
source energy, et cetera.

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:34.410 align:middle line:84%
But we forget that because
now we learn how to please.

00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:38.250 align:middle line:84%
We're taught, OK, well, if
I cry I'm going to get fed.

00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And then at some
point when I don't cry

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:44.180 align:middle line:84%
get fed because I'm
pleasing my parents.

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:46.720 align:middle line:84%
I learn how that if I
can do these things,

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:49.380 align:middle line:84%
if I can get my flash cards out
and I do my homework on time

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:51.390 align:middle line:84%
and I'm pleasing
and I'm pleasing.

00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:53.570 align:middle line:84%
So we have a tendency
to at some point

00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:59.240 align:middle line:84%
transpose parental
capabilities and approval

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:02.860 align:middle line:90%
with spiritual worthiness.

00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And they're two
different things.

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And of course in the
church and the religions,

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:09.640 align:middle line:84%
they've all talked about the
Father, the Father, the Father.

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'm the daughter
of the Father.

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:13.630 align:middle line:84%
So we have this sort
of preconceived notion

00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:16.170 align:middle line:84%
that we now have to in
a very parental child,

00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:19.769 align:middle line:84%
parental kind of relationship,
prove ourselves constantly.

00:29:19.769 --> 00:29:21.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
prove our worthiness.

00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:22.601 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Prove our worthiness.

00:29:22.601 --> 00:29:24.150 align:middle line:84%
Prove that we're
worthy of receiving

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:25.399 align:middle line:90%
these things we're asking for.

00:29:25.399 --> 00:29:27.850 align:middle line:84%
We asked daddy for a new bike,
OK, you do your homework,

00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:30.740 align:middle line:84%
you clean your room, you wash
the laundry, you get the bike.

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And so we go to
God and we say I'd

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:35.190 align:middle line:84%
like the relationship
of a lifetime

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:37.920 align:middle line:84%
and then you go around
trying to prove yourself.

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And then when a lot of those
proving things don't work,

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:43.760 align:middle line:84%
we start to feel like maybe
I'm not worthy to receive it.

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:46.290 align:middle line:90%
Here's the separation in that.

00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:47.890 align:middle line:84%
The worthiness part
you're born with.

00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:49.540 align:middle line:84%
You can't, no matter
how much charity

00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:55.204 align:middle line:84%
you do, no matter how much
any good deeds you do,

00:29:55.204 --> 00:29:57.620 align:middle line:84%
you can't get more worthy than
you were when you showed up

00:29:57.620 --> 00:29:58.560 align:middle line:90%
because you're of God.

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:00.350 align:middle line:90%
And that's your nature.

00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:03.686 align:middle line:84%
It's like the rain falls
from the sky, comes

00:30:03.686 --> 00:30:06.060 align:middle line:84%
in the form of a cloud, it
rains, it goes into the ocean,

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:07.559 align:middle line:84%
it evaporates back
up into the rain.

00:30:07.559 --> 00:30:08.950 align:middle line:90%
It's still all water.

00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:10.360 align:middle line:90%
It's just changing form.

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:12.170 align:middle line:90%
So that worthiness is intact.

00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:13.800 align:middle line:84%
Now as far as your
capabilities, I've

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:16.879 align:middle line:84%
had so many people say but,
Mari, I've asked for this.

00:30:16.879 --> 00:30:17.920 align:middle line:90%
I asked for this healing.

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:19.722 align:middle line:90%
And I've done all the stuff.

00:30:19.722 --> 00:30:20.680 align:middle line:90%
I've helped the people.

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:21.690 align:middle line:90%
I've gotten the degrees.

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:23.300 align:middle line:84%
I've done all
these things right.

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:25.910 align:middle line:84%
And I say, OK, that's
your capabilities.

00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:28.380 align:middle line:90%
That's your resume.

00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:30.530 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't dictate
whether you're going

00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:32.500 align:middle line:90%
to receive this thing or not.

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:36.970 align:middle line:84%
So and in fact by you
working so hard to live up

00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:40.780 align:middle line:84%
to these capabilities and
get more and more accolades,

00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:45.010 align:middle line:84%
you're literally saying in a
very covert way I'm not worthy.

00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, the day
that you say you know what,

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:48.384 align:middle line:90%
I deserve this.

00:30:48.384 --> 00:30:49.800 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever
gotten to that point

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:52.640 align:middle line:84%
where you say you know what,
I'm so tired of the struggle.

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:54.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to stop.

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:54.950 align:middle line:90%
I deserve this.

00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:56.260 align:middle line:90%
And I'm done.

00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:58.480 align:middle line:90%
And then boom, it shows up.

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:01.880 align:middle line:84%
Because you tapped back in your
true essence, that true core.

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:04.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's a very
potent message for people

00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:07.190 align:middle line:84%
because, especially
in the Western world,

00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:10.910 align:middle line:84%
we're trying to prove
ourselves all day long to one

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:12.460 align:middle line:90%
person or another.

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:15.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just how we're
wired, especially in the Judeo

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:18.289 align:middle line:84%
Christian world to prove
yourself, your worthiness.

00:31:18.289 --> 00:31:19.330 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Oh, absolutely.

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:19.930 align:middle line:90%
And the Jew.

00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:21.140 align:middle line:90%
And the Hebrew.

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:23.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have-- and
especially being women.

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:26.530 align:middle line:84%
I know we're dealing
with both men and women

00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:28.070 align:middle line:90%
as far as audience is concerned.

00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:30.320 align:middle line:90%
But as women, it's the pleasing.

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And depending on
the generation, I

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:37.510 align:middle line:84%
see definitely women who are
in the '50s, that '50s wives

00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:43.590 align:middle line:84%
thing, it's hard to sort
of separate yourself

00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:46.225 align:middle line:84%
from all of those expectations
and all of those roles.

00:31:46.225 --> 00:31:48.350 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you one the most
powerful days of my life

00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:50.058 align:middle line:84%
was when I left
corporate America and all

00:31:50.058 --> 00:31:54.250 align:middle line:84%
the titles, the budgets,
and the signing abilities,

00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:55.204 align:middle line:90%
and all that left.

00:31:55.204 --> 00:31:56.620 align:middle line:84%
And people say,
well, who are you?

00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:57.328 align:middle line:90%
Who are you with?

00:31:57.328 --> 00:31:58.746 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, I'm Mari.

00:31:58.746 --> 00:31:59.620 align:middle line:90%
And who are you with?

00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:02.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm with Mari.

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:04.850 align:middle line:90%
And it was a open frontier.

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:06.060 align:middle line:90%
It was really powerful.

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:10.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now let's talk
about sort of one term

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:12.340 align:middle line:90%
would be scalable affluence.

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:17.560 align:middle line:84%
So you are tired of being broke,
for example, just sick of it.

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And certainly everyone is worthy
of a dignified life, where

00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:25.300 align:middle line:84%
we can have a life that
we can feel engaged with,

00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:27.640 align:middle line:90%
proud of, on whatever level.

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:32.670 align:middle line:84%
But what happened through the
years in the New Age movement

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:35.190 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of the
prosperity training

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:38.600 align:middle line:84%
is people became-- I don't
want to say greedy, per se,

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.590 align:middle line:84%
that's a judgmental
term-- but thought,

00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:44.912 align:middle line:84%
hey, if I'm worthy of $10,
I'm worthy of $1 million.

00:32:44.912 --> 00:32:46.130 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:48.900 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we're
still in a system--

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:50.380 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not arguing
for limitation,

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:53.080 align:middle line:84%
I just want to say that-- but
yet, we're still in a world

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:56.140 align:middle line:84%
where those things somehow
have to come about,

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:59.880 align:middle line:84%
be manufactured on some
level, energetically drawn in,

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:02.440 align:middle line:84%
and yet, the
individual themselves

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:05.030 align:middle line:84%
may not need the million
dollars, for example.

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:07.670 align:middle line:84%
What they need is to have
something, whether a house

00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:10.580 align:middle line:84%
or enough where they
can feel good and secure

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:11.790 align:middle line:90%
about their lives.

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:17.410 align:middle line:84%
But, again, this whole notion of
what I deserve comes into play.

00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:20.060 align:middle line:84%
I want $1 million, I don't
want a $100 or $100,000,

00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:21.040 align:middle line:90%
I want $1 million.

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, people are
terribly disappointed because,

00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:27.520 align:middle line:84%
well, for one, that skill
set may not have anything

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:30.670 align:middle line:84%
to do with money or even to know
how to draw that kind of money

00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:33.460 align:middle line:84%
in, which is just
another skill set.

00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:36.665 align:middle line:84%
So how do you speak to
people on that level?

00:33:36.665 --> 00:33:39.470 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: Well, I think when
you are intuitively fluent,

00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:42.670 align:middle line:84%
I think there's three
core pieces here.

00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:45.460 align:middle line:84%
One is if you're
fluent intuitively,

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:49.106 align:middle line:84%
you can pretty
much-- and this might

00:33:49.106 --> 00:33:50.730 align:middle line:84%
sound like it's a
little contradictory,

00:33:50.730 --> 00:33:53.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean it to be-- but you
can pretty much have whatever

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:53.680 align:middle line:90%
you desire.

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:54.650 align:middle line:84%
But you have to
understand that it

00:33:54.650 --> 00:33:56.790 align:middle line:84%
may come to you in a way that's
completely different than what

00:33:56.790 --> 00:33:57.630 align:middle line:90%
your mind thinks it should be.

00:33:57.630 --> 00:33:58.505 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:33:58.505 --> 00:34:06.580 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: So if you understand
how to energetically interpret

00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:09.870 align:middle line:84%
the signs and symbols and
synchronicities coming to you,

00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:12.889 align:middle line:84%
like that anatomy we were
talking about earlier,

00:34:12.889 --> 00:34:15.130 align:middle line:84%
then when you start to
ask for these things--

00:34:15.130 --> 00:34:17.080 align:middle line:84%
I think the problem
is when people say,

00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:19.960 align:middle line:84%
OK, I want $1
million, they expect,

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:21.800 align:middle line:84%
OK, it's going to drop
in out of the sky.

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:22.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:24.500 align:middle line:84%
That it's going to be
quite literal in that way.

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:25.166 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Right.

00:34:25.166 --> 00:34:27.949 align:middle line:84%
And what will happen
is you'll be led to,

00:34:27.949 --> 00:34:30.630 align:middle line:84%
of course in finance, God
will not deliver $1 million

00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:31.620 align:middle line:90%
into chaos.

00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:33.739 align:middle line:84%
If you're chaotic
in your finances--

00:34:33.739 --> 00:34:35.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's
what I'm saying.

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:36.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:37.540 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: So, yeah,
your breadcrumbs

00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:39.719 align:middle line:84%
that are being left for
you, start at the beginning,

00:34:39.719 --> 00:34:41.400 align:middle line:90%
start with where you are.

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:43.385 align:middle line:84%
And we get very
caught up, especially

00:34:43.385 --> 00:34:46.010 align:middle line:84%
once we did the vision board and
the Secret and all that stuff,

00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:48.860 align:middle line:84%
that we're very far out, we got
very far into the big vision.

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:49.429 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I'm saying, yeah.

00:34:49.429 --> 00:34:50.699 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: And I really
believe that you

00:34:50.699 --> 00:34:51.865 align:middle line:90%
need to have the big vision.

00:34:51.865 --> 00:34:54.639 align:middle line:84%
It's like having the picture
of the puzzle on the box.

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:56.489 align:middle line:84%
But then it breaks
down into pieces

00:34:56.489 --> 00:34:58.370 align:middle line:84%
and then those pieces
needed to be ordered.

00:34:58.370 --> 00:35:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And the ordered steps to
get to that big vision,

00:35:02.290 --> 00:35:05.330 align:middle line:84%
are you-- the question is,
are you ready to do the steps?

00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And are you willing
to do the steps?

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And just because you can't
get the million dollars today,

00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:13.960 align:middle line:84%
does that now mean that
the law of attraction

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:15.420 align:middle line:84%
or that these
things don't exist?

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:15.920 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:17.336 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
and I can give you

00:35:17.336 --> 00:35:19.850 align:middle line:90%
one example of a woman I know.

00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:20.970 align:middle line:90%
She's a talented woman.

00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:22.060 align:middle line:90%
She's from Austria.

00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:25.610 align:middle line:84%
She's an esthetician
and doing her business.

00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:28.200 align:middle line:84%
But along the way
in her life when

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:30.140 align:middle line:84%
she was spending
time in Italy, she

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:33.710 align:middle line:84%
became friends with
an elderly neighbor,

00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:37.840 align:middle line:84%
a man who his wife was gone,
and she just kind to him.

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:41.770 align:middle line:84%
And so she would bring him some
dinner or some soup or whatnot.

00:35:41.770 --> 00:35:45.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, when his death came,
she was now an American.

00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:48.680 align:middle line:84%
She received a letter that he
had left his estate to her.

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:49.650 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: That's right.

00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:50.858 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This kind of thing.

00:35:50.858 --> 00:35:51.779 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Exactly.

00:35:51.779 --> 00:35:53.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was
not any way in which

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:55.280 align:middle line:84%
she would have ever
guessed she would have

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:58.500 align:middle line:84%
a significant, potentially
significant, amount of money

00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:00.410 align:middle line:90%
coming into her life.

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:04.100 align:middle line:84%
But she had subconsciously
engineered that just

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:05.810 align:middle line:84%
through acts of
grace and kindness.

00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:07.759 align:middle line:90%
That's just one example.

00:36:07.759 --> 00:36:09.550 align:middle line:84%
And I always thought
that was so beautiful.

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:10.466 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: I love that.

00:36:10.466 --> 00:36:11.579 align:middle line:90%
I love that example.

00:36:11.579 --> 00:36:13.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, no, it turns
out he had no other heirs.

00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:14.500 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: That's right.

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:16.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So he left everything
to her, his home, his property,

00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:17.170 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:18.878 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: And she was
there in her heart.

00:36:18.878 --> 00:36:19.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:23.020 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: She wasn't there
trying to mechanically create

00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:25.340 align:middle line:90%
this millions of dollars.

00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:28.010 align:middle line:84%
I think that you can
take that example

00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:30.770 align:middle line:84%
and I think that for
those who haven't

00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:35.130 align:middle line:84%
been a caretaker to someone
who left a big inheritance,

00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:36.870 align:middle line:90%
the universe will configure.

00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:39.960 align:middle line:84%
That's why I say, don't put
a limit on what you desire.

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:43.220 align:middle line:84%
But also don't put a limit
on how you get there.

00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:44.720 align:middle line:84%
Because we have a
tendency to think,

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:47.060 align:middle line:84%
OK, the only way I can
get to that kind of money

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:49.900 align:middle line:84%
is big investments, to
marry into it, for somebody,

00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:52.010 align:middle line:84%
you know, an inheritance,
or to work really hard

00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:53.340 align:middle line:90%
for a whole lot of years.

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:55.440 align:middle line:90%
We put those limitations on us.

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:58.450 align:middle line:84%
When we step into that
combining the energetic

00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:01.610 align:middle line:84%
with the physical, we open up
to all those possibilities.

00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:04.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
and I rely on this,

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:07.310 align:middle line:84%
I have most of my
adult life, I'm

00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:10.540 align:middle line:84%
not nearly as clever as the
higher aspects of myself

00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:12.600 align:middle line:90%
in any guidance.

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:13.970 align:middle line:90%
I just put it out there.

00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:16.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm pretty chilled about how
it comes back most of the time

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:18.490 align:middle line:84%
because it almost
always comes back.

00:37:18.490 --> 00:37:19.448 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: That's right.

00:37:19.448 --> 00:37:21.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But I'm
not attached to how.

00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:23.260 align:middle line:84%
This is another thing
we need to talk about.

00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:26.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm not attached to
timelines necessarily.

00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:29.880 align:middle line:84%
That's one thing I found in
the process of bringing to life

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:34.140 align:middle line:84%
what you wish to have or need to
or want to experience in life,

00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:36.707 align:middle line:84%
you can't really put
a time limit on it.

00:37:36.707 --> 00:37:37.290 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Yes.

00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:38.165 align:middle line:90%
I think you're right.

00:37:38.165 --> 00:37:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And I think that here's
what happens, people

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:44.970 align:middle line:84%
come to me in a panic because
they have a big issue that

00:37:44.970 --> 00:37:46.840 align:middle line:90%
has a time limit on it.

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:47.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:48.700 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't translate.

00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:50.158 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: And it
doesn't translate.

00:37:50.158 --> 00:37:53.170 align:middle line:84%
And so that's where you have
to be willing to operate kind

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:56.757 align:middle line:84%
of almost parallel,
where when somebody

00:37:56.757 --> 00:37:58.340 align:middle line:84%
has that kind of
time limit, oh, Mari,

00:37:58.340 --> 00:37:59.464 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to lose my house.

00:37:59.464 --> 00:38:00.869 align:middle line:90%
Oh my gosh.

00:38:00.869 --> 00:38:02.410 align:middle line:84%
The bills are coming
and I don't know

00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:04.830 align:middle line:84%
and I need this
million dollars now.

00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:09.230 align:middle line:84%
We have to separate that
out and say, OK, if you go,

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:10.740 align:middle line:90%
you can focus in two ways.

00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:13.960 align:middle line:84%
You can focus on what is the
divine solution and divine

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:16.530 align:middle line:84%
resolution of the
situation for today

00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:19.450 align:middle line:84%
and allow it to come in
and manifest for today.

00:38:19.450 --> 00:38:21.370 align:middle line:84%
And then have your
bigger vision,

00:38:21.370 --> 00:38:24.010 align:middle line:84%
which is an ultimately
what is the--

00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:26.650 align:middle line:84%
and you may very well,
a lot of people do it,

00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:30.640 align:middle line:84%
manifest the biggest solution
for today's mundane problem.

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:33.730 align:middle line:84%
But most of the time, it's
hard because we can't even

00:38:33.730 --> 00:38:36.230 align:middle line:84%
see that big vision
because we get swallowed up

00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:37.490 align:middle line:90%
in the mundane for today.

00:38:37.490 --> 00:38:41.000 align:middle line:84%
So my favorite mantra is divine
solution, divine resolution

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.112 align:middle line:90%
in this moment, at this time.

00:38:43.112 --> 00:38:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And really teasing that out
and taking it moment by moment.

00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:49.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it might mean that
the grand divine resolution is

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:51.080 align:middle line:84%
you're supposed
to lose that house

00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:52.480 align:middle line:90%
and move on down the road.

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:54.315 align:middle line:90%
That might be perfectly divine.

00:38:54.315 --> 00:38:55.190 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Absolutely.

00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:56.610 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of times
we get caught up,

00:38:56.610 --> 00:38:58.730 align:middle line:84%
because I think that's
a really good point, is

00:38:58.730 --> 00:39:01.272 align:middle line:84%
that we get caught up in what
our idea of what the ultimate--

00:39:01.272 --> 00:39:02.854 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is a
part of listening.

00:39:02.854 --> 00:39:03.670 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Yes.

00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:04.510 align:middle line:90%
The ultimate is.

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:05.349 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:39:05.349 --> 00:39:05.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:10.390 align:middle line:84%
So also another area is
that, you as you said,

00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:12.290 align:middle line:84%
you've communicated
with outside beings,

00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:15.100 align:middle line:84%
you learned your mediumship
early on, and so forth.

00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And there's always this
question with people,

00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:21.420 align:middle line:90%
what are they connecting to?

00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:23.780 align:middle line:84%
Are they connecting to
their own higher self?

00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:28.270 align:middle line:84%
Is this a vertical axis of
information that's available?

00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:30.040 align:middle line:84%
Because the highest
aspect of ourselves

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:32.730 align:middle line:84%
is certainly capable
of giving-- it's

00:39:32.730 --> 00:39:35.570 align:middle line:84%
able of taking in the
view in all directions,

00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:37.490 align:middle line:90%
beyond time and space.

00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:39.340 align:middle line:90%
We're capable of doing that.

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:43.680 align:middle line:84%
But oftentimes, we may not
be originally connecting

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:45.030 align:middle line:90%
with ourselves.

00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:47.750 align:middle line:84%
Might be there's an
intermediary of some kind that's

00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:49.400 align:middle line:90%
helping us along in that path.

00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:52.400 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
distinction, why it is we

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:54.620 align:middle line:84%
can't just automatically
jump into connection

00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:57.910 align:middle line:84%
with the finest aspect
of self, who guides are

00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:59.020 align:middle line:90%
and why they're needed.

00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:00.910 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: OK.

00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:01.490 align:middle line:90%
Three things.

00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:04.110 align:middle line:84%
There's three-- I'm always
with these threes, right.

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:07.010 align:middle line:84%
But there's three types of
energetic communication.

00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:09.050 align:middle line:90%
So the first type is intuition.

00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:12.520 align:middle line:84%
So your intuition is
built for you personally.

00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:14.355 align:middle line:84%
So if we look at
ourselves, a lot of people

00:40:14.355 --> 00:40:15.980 align:middle line:84%
think we have a spirit
within the body.

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:18.480 align:middle line:84%
But it was actually we're
a big ball of energy

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:21.820 align:middle line:84%
and we take on a little vessel
as a body for this lifetime

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:23.980 align:middle line:84%
and then we have the
bigger version of us

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:27.120 align:middle line:84%
outside of us helping us to
navigate our world while we're

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:28.490 align:middle line:90%
in this particular body.

00:40:28.490 --> 00:40:30.130 align:middle line:84%
The piece of us
that's in the body

00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:33.130 align:middle line:84%
needs a way to communicate to
the greater part of ourselves.

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:34.719 align:middle line:84%
The language that
swings, the pendulum

00:40:34.719 --> 00:40:36.510 align:middle line:84%
that swings back and
forth between the two,

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:38.200 align:middle line:90%
it's the language of intuition.

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:40.310 align:middle line:84%
So that's those signs,
symbols, synchronicities,

00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:41.760 align:middle line:90%
and the aha moments.

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:42.620 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:45.400 align:middle line:84%
From there, we also
have the ability

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:48.090 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with each
other very dynamically

00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:49.124 align:middle line:90%
in an energetic form.

00:40:49.124 --> 00:40:50.415 align:middle line:90%
That would be called telepathy.

00:40:50.415 --> 00:40:53.337 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of people think
that's magicians, carnivals,

00:40:53.337 --> 00:40:53.920 align:middle line:90%
parlor tricks.

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:54.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
happening all the time.

00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:55.770 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: But it's
happening all the time.

00:40:55.770 --> 00:40:58.420 align:middle line:84%
You have kids, you're using
telepathy, especially little

00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:00.080 align:middle line:84%
tiny kids that
aren't speaking yet.

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:01.060 align:middle line:90%
You have animals.

00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:03.170 align:middle line:84%
You have your
plants, your flowers.

00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:06.650 align:middle line:84%
We can have telepathic
communication, basically

00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:09.700 align:middle line:84%
telepathy to keep it
simple, if you think of it

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:15.690 align:middle line:84%
as nonverbal communication with
something else in a body, kids,

00:41:15.690 --> 00:41:17.640 align:middle line:84%
people, kids, animals,
that type of thing.

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:18.348 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Plants.

00:41:18.348 --> 00:41:19.650 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Plants, exactly.

00:41:19.650 --> 00:41:22.410 align:middle line:84%
Then the final
part, the third part

00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:25.220 align:middle line:84%
of that energetic communication
system, is channeling.

00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:28.140 align:middle line:84%
So the channeling is when
we talk to something that's

00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:29.661 align:middle line:90%
not necessarily in a body.

00:41:29.661 --> 00:41:30.160 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:32.480 align:middle line:84%
So that might be your
angels, your guides,

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:34.855 align:middle line:84%
it could be the weather,
people channel the weather.

00:41:34.855 --> 00:41:37.580 align:middle line:90%


00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:41.820 align:middle line:84%
That is where you also go into
that bigger version of you

00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:44.720 align:middle line:84%
and you can download
those creative moments

00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:47.120 align:middle line:84%
when you're in the flow,
you're in the zone,

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:48.580 align:middle line:90%
you're channeling that.

00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:51.360 align:middle line:84%
You can even connect with,
like when I was dancing,

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:55.080 align:middle line:84%
I would connect with famous
dancers from the past

00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:57.310 align:middle line:84%
and channel that energy
through my dancing.

00:41:57.310 --> 00:41:59.670 align:middle line:84%
If I got stuck in a step
and then all of a sudden

00:41:59.670 --> 00:42:01.570 align:middle line:84%
I could get those
counts on that step

00:42:01.570 --> 00:42:04.730 align:middle line:84%
because I was taking
on that energy.

00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:09.100 align:middle line:84%
So those three pieces when
you put that all together,

00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:10.620 align:middle line:84%
that's when we have
that aha factor,

00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:13.700 align:middle line:84%
that energetic communication
system that's robust,

00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:16.440 align:middle line:84%
and it allows us to communicate
with these different aspects.

00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:18.450 align:middle line:84%
So people get a little
confused for sure

00:42:18.450 --> 00:42:20.860 align:middle line:84%
because you're like, OK,
am I talking to an angel?

00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:21.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
originally, that's a,

00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:23.310 align:middle line:90%
yeah, a big field to navigate.

00:42:23.310 --> 00:42:24.600 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:25.380 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:27.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's say
you're sitting with someone

00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:28.961 align:middle line:84%
and they feel like
there's something that's

00:42:28.961 --> 00:42:31.310 align:middle line:84%
not of their conscious
mind coming in,

00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:34.450 align:middle line:84%
how do they begin
deciphering whether it's them

00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:36.560 align:middle line:90%
or whether it's other?

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:38.660 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: Well, that's
where you have are you

00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:42.240 align:middle line:90%
getting those three signs?

00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:45.452 align:middle line:84%
So if we go back to this those
four energetic communication,

00:42:45.452 --> 00:42:47.410 align:middle line:84%
those energies, those
four energetic languages.

00:42:47.410 --> 00:42:49.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's say
you're getting all those things,

00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:51.600 align:middle line:84%
but you don't know if that
information is coming maybe

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:53.900 align:middle line:84%
from a guide or an angel
or you see what I'm saying?

00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:54.900 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Yes, yes, yes.

00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:55.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
people get really

00:42:55.350 --> 00:42:57.847 align:middle line:84%
hung up on these definitions,
where did that come from?

00:42:57.847 --> 00:42:58.430 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Yes.

00:42:58.430 --> 00:42:58.700 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:42:58.700 --> 00:42:58.920 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:42:58.920 --> 00:42:59.110 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:42:59.110 --> 00:42:59.660 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:02.250 align:middle line:84%
So if you're getting
a physical-- most

00:43:02.250 --> 00:43:05.040 align:middle line:84%
of the time what will happen
if it's a guide or an angel,

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:08.070 align:middle line:84%
they're going to send you a sign
that it's a guide or an angel.

00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:10.370 align:middle line:84%
You might get, like you're
seeing the number 444,

00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:12.550 align:middle line:84%
which is definitely the
number of the angels.

00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:13.550 align:middle line:90%
You may see a feather.

00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:15.380 align:middle line:90%
You may see pennies.

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:19.570 align:middle line:84%
They use your environment to
let you know that they're there.

00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:21.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the
other big things that

00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:24.910 align:middle line:84%
helps with deciphering who's
actually speaking to you

00:43:24.910 --> 00:43:27.300 align:middle line:84%
and what they're actually
doing is your clairvoyance.

00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:31.390 align:middle line:84%
You can get a little bit of a
vision if you close your eyes

00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:34.440 align:middle line:84%
and you say, OK, please present
yourself and let me know is

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:36.730 align:middle line:84%
this somebody who's-- because
there's different realms

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:37.230 align:middle line:90%
of guidance.

00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:39.920 align:middle line:84%
We angelic realms, we
have galactic realms,

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:43.740 align:middle line:84%
we have the elemental realms,
and those different beings

00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:44.730 align:middle line:90%
will come to you.

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And they have different
characteristics

00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:47.800 align:middle line:90%
that they'll present.

00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:51.880 align:middle line:84%
So for the most simple version
of it what we're talking about

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:54.190 align:middle line:84%
is most of the
time like an angel,

00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:56.060 align:middle line:84%
you'll feel a
sense of lightness,

00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:58.020 align:middle line:84%
you'll feel a
sense of wholeness,

00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:00.590 align:middle line:90%
you'll feel a sense of peace.

00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:04.070 align:middle line:84%
When you're dealing with more
of a fairy or an elemental,

00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:06.630 align:middle line:84%
they're closer actually
to us in human form.

00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:07.880 align:middle line:90%
They're closer to that energy.

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:09.980 align:middle line:84%
They're more sparkly
and sprightly.

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:12.030 align:middle line:84%
And they're more about
instant manifestation.

00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:13.680 align:middle line:84%
You can't find the right
shoes for that dress

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:14.850 align:middle line:84%
and then all of a sudden
you go to the store

00:44:14.850 --> 00:44:15.641 align:middle line:90%
and there they are.

00:44:15.641 --> 00:44:18.010 align:middle line:84%
That's more of like a
fairy kind of energy.

00:44:18.010 --> 00:44:23.040 align:middle line:84%
Galactic energy is when you're
getting inventions, downloads

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:26.890 align:middle line:84%
of-- like Steve Jobs, tremendous
amount of galactic energy.

00:44:26.890 --> 00:44:29.890 align:middle line:84%
Anything that's going to change
the landscape of the planet

00:44:29.890 --> 00:44:33.030 align:middle line:84%
is usually downloaded,
cures for disease,

00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:35.710 align:middle line:90%
new inventions, new technology.

00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:37.430 align:middle line:84%
If you're dealing
with your computer,

00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:39.410 align:middle line:84%
you call on galactic
energy to help you.

00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:40.868 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, God,
do I need there.

00:44:40.868 --> 00:44:42.250 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:42.250 --> 00:44:43.227 align:middle line:90%
That's one area.

00:44:43.227 --> 00:44:43.810 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Yep.

00:44:43.810 --> 00:44:44.620 align:middle line:90%
For sure.

00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:45.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Does what it wants.

00:44:45.110 --> 00:44:46.450 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: For sure, absolutely.

00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:51.372 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I will say is
don't curse your machinery.

00:44:51.372 --> 00:44:52.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:52.580 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:56.370 align:middle line:84%
I was warned by my ex, who
loves his computers, that I

00:44:56.370 --> 00:44:58.830 align:middle line:84%
had a bad attitude when
things didn't go right.

00:44:58.830 --> 00:45:01.677 align:middle line:84%
And so of course, things
kept going not right.

00:45:01.677 --> 00:45:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And so I've learned to
be more appreciative.

00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:05.030 align:middle line:90%
I love my computer.

00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:06.530 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: Well,
just as a side note,

00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:08.620 align:middle line:84%
you can also call on
archangel Michael.

00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:10.620 align:middle line:84%
He's one of those angels
that actually handles--

00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:11.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He's a great tech?

00:45:11.450 --> 00:45:12.580 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: For tech, yep.

00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:13.080 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:13.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's good to know.

00:45:13.850 --> 00:45:16.058 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: Just a little
sidebar on archangel Michael.

00:45:16.058 --> 00:45:18.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, also as you
were speaking a little bit ago

00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:22.680 align:middle line:84%
about the four different ways
in which we access information,

00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:25.780 align:middle line:84%
I think that for people
if you're a clairaudient

00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:30.090 align:middle line:84%
or you're clairvoyant, sometimes
it's a little easier for people

00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:35.120 align:middle line:84%
to tap into that because
there's some tangible evidence,

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:37.840 align:middle line:84%
as it were, they can hear
or they can see something.

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:41.730 align:middle line:84%
When you come into more of
the sentience part of it,

00:45:41.730 --> 00:45:43.416 align:middle line:84%
it's a little
different because it's

00:45:43.416 --> 00:45:44.790 align:middle line:84%
like, God, I didn't
see anything,

00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:47.080 align:middle line:84%
I didn't hear anything,
but I just know this.

00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:49.210 align:middle line:90%
I just know it's true.

00:45:49.210 --> 00:45:52.520 align:middle line:84%
And that requires,
I think, a person

00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:54.940 align:middle line:84%
to have a lot of
repeat experience

00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:58.200 align:middle line:84%
in order to develop their
confidence that what they know

00:45:58.200 --> 00:45:59.130 align:middle line:90%
they know.

00:45:59.130 --> 00:46:00.200 align:middle line:90%
It's beyond feeling.

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:01.380 align:middle line:90%
And there's feeling as well.

00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:03.675 align:middle line:90%
But they just simply know.

00:46:03.675 --> 00:46:06.300 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: Well, those two things
you're kind of combining them.

00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:08.952 align:middle line:84%
So the claircognizance
is when you--

00:46:08.952 --> 00:46:10.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Claircognizance,
yes, where you know.

00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:11.870 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: You just know.

00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:12.536 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:46:12.536 --> 00:46:14.034 align:middle line:90%
In clairsentience you feel.

00:46:14.034 --> 00:46:14.700 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Right.

00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:18.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of-- now, here's
a good distinction for them

00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:19.420 align:middle line:84%
because some people
get confused,

00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:21.520 align:middle line:90%
is this my mental mind?

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:24.117 align:middle line:84%
Am I making this up or
is this my deep thing?

00:46:24.117 --> 00:46:25.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a
big one for people.

00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:27.074 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: It is
a really big one.

00:46:27.074 --> 00:46:28.670 align:middle line:90%
And it's a very valid point.

00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:31.210 align:middle line:84%
So here's how you tell the
difference, a real quick way.

00:46:31.210 --> 00:46:34.380 align:middle line:84%
Mental mind is always up
and outside of your body.

00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:36.910 align:middle line:84%
It always feels like it's
kind of almost like a cartoon

00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:40.640 align:middle line:84%
caption over your head, bang,
bang, bang, it goes very fast.

00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:42.284 align:middle line:84%
It changes a lot,
like ricochet rabbit.

00:46:42.284 --> 00:46:44.450 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you should do this or
maybe you should that, OK,

00:46:44.450 --> 00:46:45.910 align:middle line:90%
do a pros and cons list.

00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:46.740 align:middle line:90%
That's mental.

00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:47.730 align:middle line:90%
That's mental.

00:46:47.730 --> 00:46:50.120 align:middle line:84%
When you're dealing with
the actual true clairs,

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:52.720 align:middle line:84%
with your actual true
genuine intuitive senses,

00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:55.350 align:middle line:84%
it's very down low in
the body, very deep

00:46:55.350 --> 00:46:57.660 align:middle line:84%
in the body, kind of almost
behind your belly button.

00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:01.090 align:middle line:84%
You'll feel a sense, it's very
soft and also very repetitive

00:47:01.090 --> 00:47:02.535 align:middle line:90%
of the same thing.

00:47:02.535 --> 00:47:04.410 align:middle line:84%
So for me when I was
avoiding writing my book

00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:06.451 align:middle line:84%
and I was saying maybe
I'll do this kind of event

00:47:06.451 --> 00:47:07.930 align:middle line:84%
and that kind of
product and this.

00:47:07.930 --> 00:47:10.203 align:middle line:84%
And I kept saying write
the book, write the book,

00:47:10.203 --> 00:47:11.560 align:middle line:90%
write the book.

00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:14.755 align:middle line:84%
And, oh, I have this idea and
that idea, I meat a new person.

00:47:14.755 --> 00:47:16.140 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah, I could-- no book.

00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:18.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, but that
silence, still message.

00:47:18.250 --> 00:47:23.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for me if I'm
talking with my self,

00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:25.210 align:middle line:90%
it's very specific.

00:47:25.210 --> 00:47:28.360 align:middle line:84%
I find that the
information will follow

00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:31.300 align:middle line:84%
very similar pathways
of experience

00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:32.757 align:middle line:90%
so you know how to recognize it.

00:47:32.757 --> 00:47:33.340 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Yes.

00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:35.006 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it
changes over the years.

00:47:35.006 --> 00:47:37.200 align:middle line:84%
And now it's simply
almost like molasses

00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:40.721 align:middle line:84%
spilling down the side of
my-- this is the right side?

00:47:40.721 --> 00:47:41.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:43.740 align:middle line:84%
The right side of my
brain, inside the brain,

00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:48.205 align:middle line:84%
it's just an oozy smooth fall
of words that's very quiet

00:47:48.205 --> 00:47:49.414 align:middle line:90%
and moves down into the body.

00:47:49.414 --> 00:47:51.205 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: That's a
really good distinction.

00:47:51.205 --> 00:47:53.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so I mean,
for me it's that way.

00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:55.360 align:middle line:84%
For someone else,
it may be different.

00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:57.685 align:middle line:84%
But we have to start
paying attention

00:47:57.685 --> 00:47:59.302 align:middle line:90%
when we get these messages.

00:47:59.302 --> 00:48:01.030 align:middle line:84%
When we're asking
and we're starting

00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:04.670 align:middle line:84%
to receive, pay attention
to these sensations too

00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:06.885 align:middle line:84%
to understand by
repeating it, you

00:48:06.885 --> 00:48:08.520 align:middle line:84%
know kind of what
you're tapping into.

00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:09.700 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Oh, absolutely.

00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:12.407 align:middle line:84%
And we're all born
with all four clairs.

00:48:12.407 --> 00:48:14.490 align:middle line:84%
So we're born with the
capacity to do all of them.

00:48:14.490 --> 00:48:17.080 align:middle line:84%
But we usually have what I
call one screensaver clair,

00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:19.990 align:middle line:84%
one default, one that
we kind of naturally.

00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And one of the best examples
that was taught to me

00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:25.680 align:middle line:84%
is to ask yourself when
you go to a movie, what

00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:26.950 align:middle line:90%
do you remember the most?

00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:28.930 align:middle line:84%
So when you walk
out of the movie,

00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:31.097 align:middle line:84%
do you first comment
on the relationship

00:48:31.097 --> 00:48:32.430 align:middle line:90%
that the characters were having?

00:48:32.430 --> 00:48:36.190 align:middle line:84%
Do you first comment on
the score, the music?

00:48:36.190 --> 00:48:38.630 align:middle line:84%
Are you the one who always
knows the set, the curtains

00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:40.440 align:middle line:90%
and the furniture?

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:43.210 align:middle line:84%
Or you the one who knew the
end of the movie before it got

00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:45.890 align:middle line:90%
started?

00:48:45.890 --> 00:48:47.910 align:middle line:84%
From the beginning,
you knew the end.

00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:51.090 align:middle line:84%
If you're the type it looks
at the set, you're more likely

00:48:51.090 --> 00:48:54.010 align:middle line:84%
then you're defaulting on
clairvoyance, your visual.

00:48:54.010 --> 00:48:57.110 align:middle line:84%
If you remember the score and
that's how you were moved,

00:48:57.110 --> 00:48:59.800 align:middle line:84%
your clairaudience is
your dominant clair.

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:02.710 align:middle line:84%
If you knew the end of
the movie before the end,

00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:05.370 align:middle line:84%
your claircognizance,
kind of that knowing,

00:49:05.370 --> 00:49:06.470 align:middle line:90%
was your dominant clair.

00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And if you were sobbing
and totally involved

00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:10.632 align:middle line:84%
in the relationship
with the characters,

00:49:10.632 --> 00:49:11.840 align:middle line:90%
that's you're clairsentience.

00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:14.266 align:middle line:84%
So when you know what
that dominant clair is--

00:49:14.266 --> 00:49:15.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a
good little exercise

00:49:15.890 --> 00:49:17.800 align:middle line:84%
for people to go away
with and think about.

00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:18.660 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Yeah, for sure.

00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:20.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then you know
what to start looking for.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.430 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: What to
start looking for, yes.

00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:23.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, no, that's
a very good distinction.

00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:25.569 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you're
all of the above.

00:49:25.569 --> 00:49:26.610 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Yeah, oh, yeah.

00:49:26.610 --> 00:49:28.482 align:middle line:84%
You eventually do
have all of the above.

00:49:28.482 --> 00:49:30.190 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to be
professional channel

00:49:30.190 --> 00:49:33.399 align:middle line:84%
or a professional at this,
you do develop all four.

00:49:33.399 --> 00:49:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's how when
you go to psychic

00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:37.490 align:middle line:84%
or a professional intuitive,
that's what they're doing.

00:49:37.490 --> 00:49:38.620 align:middle line:90%
They're using all four.

00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:40.450 align:middle line:84%
They may say, oh,
I'm a clairvoyant.

00:49:40.450 --> 00:49:42.179 align:middle line:84%
But they're tapping,
they're getting--

00:49:42.179 --> 00:49:43.970 align:middle line:84%
when they sit with you
or they're listening

00:49:43.970 --> 00:49:47.072 align:middle line:84%
to you on the phone, they're
getting all four about you

00:49:47.072 --> 00:49:49.530 align:middle line:84%
in some way, shape, or form
than just concentrating on one.

00:49:49.530 --> 00:49:50.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And is that
the case with you?

00:49:50.930 --> 00:49:51.270 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Yes.

00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:52.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's all of the above.

00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:52.310 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Oh, absolutely.

00:49:52.310 --> 00:49:53.306 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:49:53.306 --> 00:49:57.110 align:middle line:84%
I started out not really
having the clairvoyance.

00:49:57.110 --> 00:50:00.331 align:middle line:84%
And then that was
the quietest one.

00:50:00.331 --> 00:50:01.580 align:middle line:90%
I was much more clairsentient.

00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:03.300 align:middle line:84%
I could feel it
and it was almost

00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:05.360 align:middle line:84%
like I was feeling words
in my solar plexus.

00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:07.690 align:middle line:84%
Like you were saying you
had that slow feeling

00:50:07.690 --> 00:50:10.020 align:middle line:84%
of the words coming
down into you,

00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:12.040 align:middle line:90%
that sort of drippy feeling.

00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:13.930 align:middle line:84%
I would feel that more
in my solar plexus.

00:50:13.930 --> 00:50:16.630 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, you develop all
of them if you do it enough.

00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:17.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:18.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:21.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, through the years
I've noticed each of them.

00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:23.350 align:middle line:84%
It just depends
on the situation.

00:50:23.350 --> 00:50:25.390 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it zings,
something goes through

00:50:25.390 --> 00:50:26.920 align:middle line:84%
and you just see
it all in a flash

00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:28.789 align:middle line:84%
and try to remember
what you just saw.

00:50:28.789 --> 00:50:29.580 align:middle line:90%
And then it's gone.

00:50:29.580 --> 00:50:32.690 align:middle line:84%
You can't go back and
regroup and analyze it,

00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:36.350 align:middle line:84%
which I like those hit and runs,
I call them, they just come,

00:50:36.350 --> 00:50:38.150 align:middle line:84%
they're there, you
get it or you don't.

00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.910 align:middle line:90%
And it's gone.

00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:41.609 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same thing when
words come through or sounds

00:50:41.609 --> 00:50:42.150 align:middle line:90%
come through.

00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And I find one thing
a lot of people

00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:50.170 align:middle line:84%
is where we hear a lot of
sounds all the time, kind

00:50:50.170 --> 00:50:51.610 align:middle line:90%
of a chorus of sounds.

00:50:51.610 --> 00:50:55.690 align:middle line:84%
And when the guidance is
trying to get your attention,

00:50:55.690 --> 00:50:59.620 align:middle line:84%
I find in my case, the sounds,
the pitch will go way, way up

00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:03.015 align:middle line:84%
or it'll sink way down long
enough to catch my attention

00:51:03.015 --> 00:51:05.175 align:middle line:84%
and say, hey, dial
into the moment.

00:51:05.175 --> 00:51:07.300 align:middle line:84%
Something's trying to get
your attention right now.

00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:07.850 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: That's
right, absolutely.

00:51:07.850 --> 00:51:10.197 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I mean, something
as simple as a tone even.

00:51:10.197 --> 00:51:10.780 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Yes.

00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:11.210 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:11.710 align:middle line:90%
A tone.

00:51:11.710 --> 00:51:13.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
what about when

00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:18.710 align:middle line:84%
you feel beings touching you,
the chills touching your hair

00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:20.152 align:middle line:84%
and your shoulders
and around you?

00:51:20.152 --> 00:51:21.860 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: Well, that's
when you're really

00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:26.490 align:middle line:84%
talking about divide,
going between two worlds.

00:51:26.490 --> 00:51:29.310 align:middle line:84%
Most people think that there's
an above and there's a below.

00:51:29.310 --> 00:51:31.810 align:middle line:84%
But really those multiple
dimension that we talk about

00:51:31.810 --> 00:51:32.780 align:middle line:90%
are really parallel.

00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:34.520 align:middle line:90%
They're side by side by side.

00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:38.180 align:middle line:84%
So you can, especially with
the elemental energies,

00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:40.560 align:middle line:84%
which are more of the
nature of spirits,

00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:42.880 align:middle line:84%
the gnomes and the fairies
and that type of thing,

00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:45.560 align:middle line:84%
you might feel that
sensation because they're

00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:47.500 align:middle line:90%
very close in vibration to us.

00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:48.370 align:middle line:90%
So yes.

00:51:48.370 --> 00:51:50.067 align:middle line:84%
And the angels can
transform themselves

00:51:50.067 --> 00:51:51.150 align:middle line:90%
into anything for comfort.

00:51:51.150 --> 00:51:52.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I notice they
touch your hair a lot.

00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:52.610 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Yes.

00:51:52.610 --> 00:51:52.870 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:52.940 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:54.880 align:middle line:84%
Yes. you have a lot of
fairy energy for sure.

00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:56.974 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh yeah, there's
a lot of that around.

00:51:56.974 --> 00:51:57.750 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: Sparkly
energy, you know.

00:51:57.750 --> 00:51:59.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
especially that,

00:51:59.530 --> 00:52:01.770 align:middle line:84%
especially if I need it
for something as mundane

00:52:01.770 --> 00:52:04.330 align:middle line:84%
as connections-- it's
happening right now--

00:52:04.330 --> 00:52:07.390 align:middle line:84%
as connecting with an item
because I hate shopping.

00:52:07.390 --> 00:52:08.479 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Oh, do you?

00:52:08.479 --> 00:52:10.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I do not
enjoy the process.

00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:12.145 align:middle line:84%
If I need something, I want
to just connect with it

00:52:12.145 --> 00:52:13.220 align:middle line:90%
and go home.

00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And so inevitably
if I need something,

00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:17.970 align:middle line:84%
there will be that kind
of a quickend energy

00:52:17.970 --> 00:52:20.890 align:middle line:84%
and, boom, in front
of my field of vision,

00:52:20.890 --> 00:52:22.090 align:middle line:90%
I'll see a storefront.

00:52:22.090 --> 00:52:22.630 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: That's right.

00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:24.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They show me
which store to go to.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:24.400 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Perfect, perfect.

00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:25.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So I just go there.

00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:26.404 align:middle line:90%
And it'll be sitting there.

00:52:26.404 --> 00:52:27.730 align:middle line:90%
The last one left on sale.

00:52:27.730 --> 00:52:28.522 align:middle line:90%
That kind of thing.

00:52:28.522 --> 00:52:29.271 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Perfect.

00:52:29.271 --> 00:52:31.030 align:middle line:84%
That happens to me all
the time too, yeah.

00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:32.017 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:52:32.017 --> 00:52:34.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, once you learn to
work with all of these things,

00:52:34.350 --> 00:52:35.690 align:middle line:90%
it makes life a lot easier.

00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:38.120 align:middle line:84%
That's what I find
more than anything.

00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:40.340 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to be a
millionairess overnight.

00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:41.550 align:middle line:90%
That's not the point.

00:52:41.550 --> 00:52:43.690 align:middle line:84%
It's navigating
through life in a way

00:52:43.690 --> 00:52:47.517 align:middle line:84%
that has a certain amount
of grace, efficiency even.

00:52:47.517 --> 00:52:48.100 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Yes.

00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:49.030 align:middle line:90%
Oh, absolutely.

00:52:49.030 --> 00:52:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And you know, what you
said is absolutely right.

00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:53.730 align:middle line:84%
You can actually
send a band of angels

00:52:53.730 --> 00:52:57.580 align:middle line:84%
to support you, like we've
heard the parking space angels,

00:52:57.580 --> 00:52:58.890 align:middle line:90%
please give me a parking space.

00:52:58.890 --> 00:53:00.332 align:middle line:84%
But you can do
that for shopping.

00:53:00.332 --> 00:53:01.040 align:middle line:90%
You can say, OK--

00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:01.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: For anything.

00:53:01.660 --> 00:53:02.618 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: For anything.

00:53:02.618 --> 00:53:04.394 align:middle line:90%
You can send it for anything.

00:53:04.394 --> 00:53:06.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do know Jean
Slatter, "Hiring the Heavens"

00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:07.300 align:middle line:90%
by any chance?

00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:07.877 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: No.

00:53:07.877 --> 00:53:09.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I interviewed
her years ago.

00:53:09.460 --> 00:53:10.860 align:middle line:90%
She became a friend of mine.

00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:14.490 align:middle line:84%
And she uses it for
everything, all the time.

00:53:14.490 --> 00:53:17.649 align:middle line:84%
And it does make
life so much easier.

00:53:17.649 --> 00:53:19.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't know any
other way to put it.

00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:20.140 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Trustworthy.

00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:21.830 align:middle line:90%
It's trustworthy.

00:53:21.830 --> 00:53:24.610 align:middle line:84%
I think that's where people,
they don't trust life,

00:53:24.610 --> 00:53:27.560 align:middle line:84%
because we're so used to
not trusting each other.

00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:30.360 align:middle line:84%
And when we connect, like
what you're talking about,

00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:31.360 align:middle line:90%
you lean into that.

00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:32.901 align:middle line:84%
Now, you've proven
it out to yourself

00:53:32.901 --> 00:53:35.210 align:middle line:84%
enough that you lean into
it and there's a trust.

00:53:35.210 --> 00:53:35.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And I just expect it.

00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:37.450 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: Then as an
expectation, yeah.

00:53:37.450 --> 00:53:39.074 align:middle line:84%
And you expect it
because you trust it.

00:53:39.074 --> 00:53:41.194 align:middle line:84%
And once you get
it, you act on it.

00:53:41.194 --> 00:53:42.860 align:middle line:84%
And see, a lot of
people talk out of it.

00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:44.901 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you have to
go through in your mind

00:53:44.901 --> 00:53:50.190 align:middle line:84%
and say, OK, I need to pick up
a futon, boom, I see that-- hmm,

00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:51.830 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't have
picked that store.

00:53:51.830 --> 00:53:53.250 align:middle line:90%
But I'm seeing the storefront.

00:53:53.250 --> 00:53:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's usually light
like that, it'll be fine.

00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:58.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, if my cognitive
mind kicks in, I'll say,

00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:01.030 align:middle line:84%
well, they have
futons here, here,

00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:02.700 align:middle line:84%
and here, and you
start doing the list,

00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:07.020 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have a long
day, dry day, boring day.

00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:09.790 align:middle line:84%
And so there are times where
I have to actually check

00:54:09.790 --> 00:54:12.755 align:middle line:84%
in and say is this
something that I was shown

00:54:12.755 --> 00:54:15.030 align:middle line:84%
or there is this
something I'm conjuring?

00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And then talk about
that and the difference

00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:19.480 align:middle line:84%
in the feeling of being
shown versus conjuring.

00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:21.040 align:middle line:84%
Because these are
other signposts

00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:22.450 align:middle line:90%
we need to differentiate.

00:54:22.450 --> 00:54:23.650 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Oh, it's so funny.

00:54:23.650 --> 00:54:26.610 align:middle line:90%
I did a test.

00:54:26.610 --> 00:54:28.970 align:middle line:84%
I went to the grocery store
and I gotten this hit,

00:54:28.970 --> 00:54:31.570 align:middle line:84%
just we call them
hits, intuitive hit.

00:54:31.570 --> 00:54:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And I heard get a scratch
and win card, just get it.

00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:36.537 align:middle line:90%
So I said, that's weird.

00:54:36.537 --> 00:54:37.037 align:middle line:90%
Get it now.

00:54:37.037 --> 00:54:37.210 align:middle line:90%
Get it now.

00:54:37.210 --> 00:54:37.949 align:middle line:90%
I just felt it.

00:54:37.949 --> 00:54:39.490 align:middle line:84%
So I bought the
scratch and win card.

00:54:39.490 --> 00:54:42.060 align:middle line:84%
I won on all three,
all three numbers.

00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:43.060 align:middle line:90%
I think it was like $50.

00:54:43.060 --> 00:54:44.510 align:middle line:90%
I said, wow, how cool is that.

00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:45.010 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:54:45.010 --> 00:54:46.670 align:middle line:84%
I don't ever get
scratch and win cards.

00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:47.960 align:middle line:90%
It was just a hunch.

00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:51.070 align:middle line:84%
So I said, well, you know,
if I did that with that, I

00:54:51.070 --> 00:54:53.532 align:middle line:84%
wonder if I took a
$20 bill and bought 10

00:54:53.532 --> 00:54:54.990 align:middle line:84%
scratch and win
cards, would I win?

00:54:54.990 --> 00:54:56.115 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, there you go.

00:54:56.115 --> 00:54:57.180 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: And so I did.

00:54:57.180 --> 00:54:59.570 align:middle line:90%
And I said that's a proof.

00:54:59.570 --> 00:55:01.420 align:middle line:84%
That's a proof that
when you conjure and you

00:55:01.420 --> 00:55:03.910 align:middle line:84%
start to analyze and say, OK,
if you take this, this, this,

00:55:03.910 --> 00:55:05.530 align:middle line:90%
and this, you can create that.

00:55:05.530 --> 00:55:06.200 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:09.760 align:middle line:84%
But I was just walking through,
I had no intention, not even

00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:12.562 align:middle line:84%
thinking about anything, and
I just passing the machine

00:55:12.562 --> 00:55:13.770 align:middle line:90%
and I caught a glimpse of it.

00:55:13.770 --> 00:55:16.600 align:middle line:90%
And I heard buy that.

00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:17.620 align:middle line:90%
And it just hit.

00:55:17.620 --> 00:55:19.580 align:middle line:84%
So that's just a
little tiny example.

00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:22.180 align:middle line:84%
But it's absolutely
true that you feel it.

00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:25.700 align:middle line:84%
Because when you are intuitively
guided to do something,

00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:29.960 align:middle line:84%
what you're going to feel
is a sense of depth to it.

00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:31.730 align:middle line:84%
It might come as a
flash, but there's

00:55:31.730 --> 00:55:33.550 align:middle line:84%
an immediate sense of
knowing, again, you

00:55:33.550 --> 00:55:36.210 align:middle line:84%
might get those goosebumps and
you get that little repetitive

00:55:36.210 --> 00:55:38.180 align:middle line:90%
like do it now, go, go, go.

00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:40.224 align:middle line:84%
When you're conjuring,
it gets very heavy.

00:55:40.224 --> 00:55:41.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does get heavy.

00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:41.890 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: It's very dark.

00:55:41.890 --> 00:55:42.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Slow.

00:55:42.430 --> 00:55:43.520 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Yep, it's slow.

00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:44.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not fun.

00:55:44.790 --> 00:55:45.930 align:middle line:90%
It's not fun anymore.

00:55:45.930 --> 00:55:48.170 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: And then you
start to really undermine

00:55:48.170 --> 00:55:50.810 align:middle line:84%
your own confidence
because you think, well, I

00:55:50.810 --> 00:55:53.710 align:middle line:84%
did all this hard work and I
put all together, nothing's

00:55:53.710 --> 00:55:54.500 align:middle line:90%
working.

00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:56.747 align:middle line:84%
And usually if you're hitting
a lot of closed doors,

00:55:56.747 --> 00:55:58.830 align:middle line:84%
then that's the time when
you need to just say you

00:55:58.830 --> 00:56:01.090 align:middle line:84%
what, I'm just going to simmer
down, I'm going to let this go.

00:56:01.090 --> 00:56:02.048 align:middle line:90%
And then it just flows.

00:56:02.048 --> 00:56:05.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When life is
too much work, just life.

00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And I have friends who've been
into the world of metaphysics

00:56:07.890 --> 00:56:10.210 align:middle line:90%
for many years, decades.

00:56:10.210 --> 00:56:13.009 align:middle line:84%
Some of whom life is just
so darn hard for them.

00:56:13.009 --> 00:56:13.800 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Yes, yes.

00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:15.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And I watch.

00:56:15.370 --> 00:56:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's this process of
constantly mentally evaluating,

00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:21.270 align:middle line:90%
waiting.

00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:24.940 align:middle line:90%
The watch pot never boils.

00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:29.530 align:middle line:84%
Where if we could almost look
at it in an animated context,

00:56:29.530 --> 00:56:33.480 align:middle line:84%
even a Disney-esque
context of the maiden

00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:37.330 align:middle line:84%
or the man out in the woods
and nature speaking to them,

00:56:37.330 --> 00:56:40.350 align:middle line:84%
a little bird flies across,
and lays a little something.

00:56:40.350 --> 00:56:41.240 align:middle line:90%
I don't mean that.

00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:43.570 align:middle line:84%
But I mean a little
suggestion on them.

00:56:43.570 --> 00:56:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And it's light and freeing,
you frolic off and follow it

00:56:46.430 --> 00:56:49.220 align:middle line:84%
down to the woods where you
find the exact thing you

00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:50.540 align:middle line:90%
needed along the stream.

00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:52.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, really
that's the quality

00:56:52.770 --> 00:56:56.650 align:middle line:84%
that life takes on if you get
your own mind out of the way.

00:56:56.650 --> 00:56:57.540 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Yeah.

00:56:57.540 --> 00:56:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have
to be perfect.

00:56:58.990 --> 00:57:01.500 align:middle line:84%
That's one thing I want
to really emphasize

00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:04.390 align:middle line:84%
is that you try this
like 50% of the time,

00:57:04.390 --> 00:57:05.690 align:middle line:90%
you'll start to get results.

00:57:05.690 --> 00:57:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And at 80%, you have
miracles happening.

00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:10.912 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to be perfect.

00:57:10.912 --> 00:57:13.120 align:middle line:84%
I think people get confused
because they think, OK, I

00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:14.245 align:middle line:90%
always have to be positive.

00:57:14.245 --> 00:57:15.560 align:middle line:90%
And I always have to hold on.

00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And I always have
to be like what

00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:19.890 align:middle line:90%
you're saying, in the zone.

00:57:19.890 --> 00:57:21.089 align:middle line:90%
And that's not the case.

00:57:21.089 --> 00:57:21.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:57:21.630 --> 00:57:22.260 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: That's not the case.

00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:24.343 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the other
thing is that loosening up

00:57:24.343 --> 00:57:27.270 align:middle line:84%
from the attachment to
the way the outcome,

00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:29.270 align:middle line:84%
the timing of the
outcome, the way

00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:31.920 align:middle line:84%
it's going to come about,
you just let it go.

00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:33.290 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: It may look different
than what you thought.

00:57:33.290 --> 00:57:34.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It may look
totally different.

00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:35.700 align:middle line:84%

00:57:40.250 --> 00:57:43.030 align:middle line:84%
that you wanted that came
about in such a different way,

00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:45.380 align:middle line:84%
you almost didn't
recognize it yourself.

00:57:45.380 --> 00:57:47.801 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: Oh gosh, I

00:57:47.801 --> 00:57:48.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just pick one.

00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:50.133 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: --I'm a control freak.

00:57:50.133 --> 00:57:51.260 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:52.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm a total control freak.

00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:55.290 align:middle line:90%


00:57:55.290 --> 00:57:59.380 align:middle line:84%
My big plan was to move from
New Jersey to California.

00:57:59.380 --> 00:58:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And I had my heart
set on Malibu.

00:58:02.070 --> 00:58:04.760 align:middle line:84%
Was going to go to Malibu, saw
it on TV, have to go there,

00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:05.690 align:middle line:90%
have to go there.

00:58:05.690 --> 00:58:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And I had little
apartments picked out,

00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:11.700 align:middle line:90%
all kinds of things.

00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:14.033 align:middle line:84%
And when I got there, a friend
of mine called and said--

00:58:14.033 --> 00:58:16.120 align:middle line:84%
And I knew it, it's on
all my vision boards.

00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:17.050 align:middle line:90%
It's on everything.

00:58:17.050 --> 00:58:19.140 align:middle line:84%
Malibu Mar, my
friends had to call me

00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:21.840 align:middle line:90%
Malibu Mari for like a year.

00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And when I got there,
something was off.

00:58:26.310 --> 00:58:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And I remember going-- and
owls are a big sign for me.

00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:31.210 align:middle line:90%
They're like my good luck sign.

00:58:31.210 --> 00:58:32.874 align:middle line:84%
Like they always
are my signpost.

00:58:32.874 --> 00:58:34.540 align:middle line:84%
And then my friend
said come to La Jolla

00:58:34.540 --> 00:58:37.730 align:middle line:84%
just for one day, just come for
an hour to have dinner with me.

00:58:37.730 --> 00:58:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And as I got there, there was
this big owl in front of me.

00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:41.979 align:middle line:90%
I said, no, there's just no way.

00:58:41.979 --> 00:58:42.770 align:middle line:90%
It's not happening.

00:58:42.770 --> 00:58:44.762 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mari La Jolla.

00:58:44.762 --> 00:58:45.970 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: And it worked out--

00:58:45.970 --> 00:58:46.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: La Jolla Mari.

00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:48.310 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: --that I
just happened to be

00:58:48.310 --> 00:58:54.680 align:middle line:84%
talking to someone very randomly
on Facebook and met her.

00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:57.920 align:middle line:84%
She said, why don't you come
and stay here in San Diego

00:58:57.920 --> 00:58:59.190 align:middle line:90%
and find a place to live?

00:58:59.190 --> 00:59:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up
right in La Jolla,

00:59:01.740 --> 00:59:03.200 align:middle line:84%
didn't even know
La Jolla existed.

00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:04.590 align:middle line:90%
I didn't even know what it was.

00:59:04.590 --> 00:59:07.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But still a
beautiful, coastal community,

00:59:07.690 --> 00:59:08.702 align:middle line:90%
just not Malibu.

00:59:08.702 --> 00:59:09.660 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: That's right.

00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:10.280 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:12.369 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you could
have run right past that.

00:59:12.369 --> 00:59:13.410 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Oh, absolutely.

00:59:13.410 --> 00:59:16.289 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you had your mind
set, your mind set on Malibu.

00:59:16.289 --> 00:59:18.830 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: Or it would have been
a very hard time living there

00:59:18.830 --> 00:59:22.150 align:middle line:84%
because when you force
yourself into something,

00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:24.980 align:middle line:84%
things then trip off to
being forced the whole time.

00:59:24.980 --> 00:59:27.310 align:middle line:84%
When you go with something
as you're guided and lead,

00:59:27.310 --> 00:59:28.727 align:middle line:84%
things have a
tendency to unfold.

00:59:28.727 --> 00:59:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're really
looking for with this work.

00:59:31.060 --> 00:59:32.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes, indeed.

00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And then sometimes
it's disappointing.

00:59:34.620 --> 00:59:36.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm planning a
vacation, for example,

00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:38.430 align:middle line:90%
all the plans fell through.

00:59:38.430 --> 00:59:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And I was like a little
teenager, you know, oh, well,

00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:45.095 align:middle line:84%
made a little
sandals, girly things.

00:59:45.095 --> 00:59:47.470 align:middle line:84%
It's like I'm so looking
forward to this little vacation,

00:59:47.470 --> 00:59:50.990 align:middle line:84%
not one thing was
panning out at all.

00:59:50.990 --> 00:59:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And I finally realized I've
tried to divide this and push

00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:56.360 align:middle line:90%
it before, bad things happen.

00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:57.480 align:middle line:90%
So I just let it go.

00:59:57.480 --> 00:59:59.827 align:middle line:84%
And soon enough,
something will come in

00:59:59.827 --> 01:00:01.410 align:middle line:84%
and show me exactly
where I'm supposed

01:00:01.410 --> 01:00:02.150 align:middle line:90%
to be at the right moment.

01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:03.670 align:middle line:84%
But I had to abandon
ship on that.

01:00:03.670 --> 01:00:04.100 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Oh, absolutely.

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it was a one-month
trip to another country

01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:08.320 align:middle line:90%
and just let it go.

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:09.335 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: That's right.

01:00:09.335 --> 01:00:11.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're talking
about houses and trips,

01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:14.060 align:middle line:84%
but it could be something
simple like calling

01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:15.380 align:middle line:90%
the person at the right time.

01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:16.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:17.580 align:middle line:90%
All of the above.

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:18.550 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: All of
those types of things.

01:00:18.550 --> 01:00:19.591 align:middle line:90%
It's the smallest things.

01:00:19.591 --> 01:00:22.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So living lightly,
just kind of breathing in life

01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:26.070 align:middle line:84%
and being open to what we're
seeing and sensing and not

01:00:26.070 --> 01:00:29.540 align:middle line:84%
running past it with this
determination, as you say,

01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:32.100 align:middle line:84%
sometimes this
compulsive behavior even

01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:33.460 align:middle line:90%
can be the real enemy of it.

01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:34.501 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Oh, absolutely.

01:00:34.501 --> 01:00:35.010 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

01:00:35.010 --> 01:00:36.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Any final thoughts?

01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:38.170 align:middle line:10%
>>COOPER: Well,
I just think that

01:00:38.170 --> 01:00:40.910 align:middle line:10%
invest, invest in yourself.

01:00:40.910 --> 01:00:43.520 align:middle line:10%
That if you invest in just
taking a little bit of time

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:46.570 align:middle line:10%
to learn these aspects, it's
a huge world out there for.

01:00:46.570 --> 01:00:47.960 align:middle line:10%
And it makes the
physical world--

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:50.290 align:middle line:10%
the physical world is like
this and the energetic world

01:00:50.290 --> 01:00:51.310 align:middle line:10%
is like this.

01:00:51.310 --> 01:00:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And we focus so much on this
and trying to force this.

01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:56.900 align:middle line:84%
If we just open
ourselves up just a bit

01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:59.440 align:middle line:84%
to those intuitive senses,
you're born with it,

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:00.330 align:middle line:90%
it's all there.

01:01:00.330 --> 01:01:01.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And allow
ourselves to be surprised.

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:02.765 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Just turn it off.

01:01:02.765 --> 01:01:03.380 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:04.130 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

01:01:04.130 --> 01:01:05.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Don't be
afraid of surprises.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.250 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Tons of aha moments.

01:01:06.250 --> 01:01:07.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You bet.

01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:08.580 align:middle line:90%
Mari, thank you so much.

01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:09.180 align:middle line:90%
You're a delight.

01:01:09.180 --> 01:01:09.570 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Thank you so much.

01:01:09.570 --> 01:01:10.410 align:middle line:90%
You are as well.

01:01:10.410 --> 01:01:11.964 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much for having me.

01:01:11.964 --> 01:01:13.380 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Again,
Mariana's book is

01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:15.280 align:middle line:10%
titled "The Aha
Factor," which can

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:16.890 align:middle line:10%
be found at major booksellers.

01:01:16.890 --> 01:01:20.310 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
