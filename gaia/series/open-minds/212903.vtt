>>REGINA MEREDITH:
For millennia, people

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.320 align:middle line:10%
have been fascinated with
the story of the lost

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.680 align:middle line:10%
continent of Atlantis.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.480 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.660 align:middle line:84%
Is there something deep inside
us that needs to remember?

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.110 align:middle line:84%
What will that recovered memory
bring to our understanding

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.010 align:middle line:90%
of ourselves?

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.560 align:middle line:10%
These are the questions
Douglas Kenyon addresses

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.870 align:middle line:10%
in his book, the
"Ghosts of Atlantis."

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:34.800 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.300 align:middle line:84%
>>J. DOUGLAS KENYON:
Thanks, Regina.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wow, you've
contributed so much

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.300 align:middle line:90%
to this field.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.300 align:middle line:84%
You were the publisher of
"Atlantis Rising," for what,

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.110 align:middle line:90%
nearly a quarter of a century?

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.910 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: Yeah.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.743 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because that
was a beloved journal

00:00:46.743 --> 00:00:48.270 align:middle line:90%
to many people watching this.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.060 align:middle line:10%
>>KENYON: Well,
thank you very much.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.493 align:middle line:10%
We hoped it would be that.

00:00:52.493 --> 00:00:54.660 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You make a really
good point in this book,

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.880 align:middle line:10%
and you argued this
point that it's important

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.120 align:middle line:10%
that we do begin putting the
pieces together and remembering.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get
into that in a little bit

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.980 align:middle line:84%
because it has created
a deep trauma that's

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.790 align:middle line:84%
replaced with just a mishmash
of beliefs and thoughts

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.600 align:middle line:84%
and stories that are all
over the place with academia

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.730 align:middle line:84%
saying, oh, no, none
of that ever happened,

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.470 align:middle line:84%
and people that are waking
up from strange dreams

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.440 align:middle line:84%
and everything in between,
including those who

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.060 align:middle line:84%
are in the world of archaeology
who put themselves out

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.860 align:middle line:90%
on a limb.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.050 align:middle line:90%
And we know all of the names.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.740 align:middle line:90%
And we'll get into some of that.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.520 align:middle line:90%
So first of all, is it your--

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.730 align:middle line:84%
do you have a belief
in reincarnation?

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.380 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: Yes, absolutely.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.210 align:middle line:84%
That's the one thing that ties
it all together in my view.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.418 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, OK, thank you.

00:01:39.418 --> 00:01:42.710 align:middle line:84%
Because my thought is that
the reason it's coming up now

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.990 align:middle line:84%
is because so many of us that
were there in Atlantean times

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.790 align:middle line:90%
are back.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.530 align:middle line:84%
And now we want to put it
together what happened,

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.262 align:middle line:90%
why did it happen, right?

00:01:51.262 --> 00:01:52.220 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: You're right.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.920 align:middle line:84%
I think that people can look
at their personal psychology

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.210 align:middle line:84%
and understand now
that as an adult,

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.240 align:middle line:84%
they're influenced by things
that happen that they did,

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.890 align:middle line:84%
they thought when they were a
child, that they have forgotten.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:08.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.240 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: And then so, they--

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.860 align:middle line:84%
through psychotherapy
or other processes,

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.670 align:middle line:84%
they start to remember the
seeds of adult activity.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And I just think that that whole
process, which people recognize

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.820 align:middle line:84%
as a valid process,
and that we need

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.240 align:middle line:84%
to do to be healthy mentally,
spiritually, et cetera.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.170 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, it
has to be opened up

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.740 align:middle line:84%
into a much larger
context so that we're

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.240 align:middle line:84%
looking at not just what
we've done in this life,

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.115 align:middle line:84%
but then we understand our life
is just a chapter to the story--

00:02:49.115 --> 00:02:49.915 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:02:49.915 --> 00:02:52.650 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: --and not
the entire narrative.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.840 align:middle line:84%
And getting that, that's
where people kind of--

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.445 align:middle line:90%
that scares people because--

00:02:59.445 --> 00:03:00.245 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does.

00:03:00.245 --> 00:03:02.040 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: --it takes
them to dimensions

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.150 align:middle line:84%
they're not quite ready to
delve into just yet, they think.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But enough people
are now writing about it.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.100 align:middle line:84%
And now even Disney has
made movies about it.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.760 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: Oh, it's
happening, yes.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.802 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's happening.

00:03:12.802 --> 00:03:14.980 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis is resurfacing
in our awareness.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:15.780 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: Right.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I think
according to Edgar Cayce,

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.370 align:middle line:84%
it's going to even
resurface to an extent

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.290 align:middle line:84%
physically in our world in
the not-too-distant future.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.520 align:middle line:84%
So, perhaps-- I mean, there
are little remnants of it still

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.560 align:middle line:84%
poking out, but I
think he predicted

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.080 align:middle line:84%
there would be a bit of a
rise of that mass again.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.880 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: True.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So meanwhile,
as a metaphor,

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.040 align:middle line:84%
it's rising like that
in our consciousness.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.570 align:middle line:84%
So let's go to the story
of Immanuel Velikovsky

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:44.670 align:middle line:84%
because this has to do with
a deep, hidden mass trauma

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.630 align:middle line:84%
and deep fear of
annihilation that

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.630 align:middle line:84%
lives within the psyche of
almost every human being.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.520 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: Velikovsky was a
practicing psychoanalyst,

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:02.910 align:middle line:84%
as well as he was an associate
of Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:09.500 align:middle line:84%
And he became-- he was like
the original catastrophist

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.500 align:middle line:84%
or the one who basically looked
at the history of the planet

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.019 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the way
we got to where we are

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:23.630 align:middle line:84%
was through sudden, massively
destructive events that

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:24.890 align:middle line:90%
traumatized us.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:31.190 align:middle line:84%
And he was basically taking
what he realized from personal

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.130 align:middle line:84%
or individual experiences
and applying it writ-large

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.345 align:middle line:90%
for the entire--

00:04:35.345 --> 00:04:38.480 align:middle line:90%
for the entire civilization.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And it was in a
direct opposition

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.350 align:middle line:84%
to the standard
orthodoxy of gradualism

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:51.110 align:middle line:84%
or that life on
this planet, if you

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.660 align:middle line:84%
wanted to understand
the way things change,

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.670 align:middle line:84%
you just look at
the way it is now.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.040 align:middle line:84%
And you say, just
extend that back,

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.170 align:middle line:84%
and that accounts
for everything.

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:06.470 align:middle line:84%
The catastrophists of whom
Velikovsky was the leader was--

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.890 align:middle line:84%
had the idea that that
may be true in general.

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:17.060 align:middle line:84%
But there have been sudden
massively catastrophic events

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.070 align:middle line:84%
that really accounted
for in history.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And you can't really understand
what's going on Earth,

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.910 align:middle line:84%
unless you can look
at these sudden events

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.450 align:middle line:84%
and understand how we were
affected by them, how we were

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.970 align:middle line:84%
traumatized by them
and what we had

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:38.130 align:middle line:84%
to do to reconstruct
ourselves in the aftermath.

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:44.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he literally
pointed to Atlantis, didn't he?

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.980 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: I don't think
he talked about Atlantis

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:51.662 align:middle line:84%
specifically because
he was more, in fact--

00:05:51.662 --> 00:05:52.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Was it more--

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:53.670 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: He was more--

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:57.720 align:middle line:84%
he was more in the
orthodox school of history,

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.090 align:middle line:90%
but he talked about--

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.050 align:middle line:84%
well, he talked about events in
the last 2,000 or 3,000 years--

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.460 align:middle line:90%
since the Bronze Age.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And so what you have to
do is make the connection

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:13.500 align:middle line:84%
between the theory that he
was presenting or the idea,

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.560 align:middle line:84%
and you can apply it
on a larger scale.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I believe
is the missing piece.

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't think you'll find
it. a lot of catastrophists

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:28.470 align:middle line:84%
are all looking at more
recent types of events.

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:30.810 align:middle line:90%
But they can see that the--

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.630 align:middle line:90%
they can see that in the works.

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:35.940 align:middle line:84%
They can see how something
like that happened.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.930 align:middle line:84%
But I think, you need to look
at it in really big terms.

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And you see it, the whole
ending of the last Ice Age,

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.040 align:middle line:90%
as the event--

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.290 align:middle line:84%
and everything that
transpired around that,

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:56.460 align:middle line:84%
as being the trauma that left us
basically back in the Stone Age.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and so we'll
go to Atlantis in a moment.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.993 align:middle line:84%
But when you think about
catastrophe, catastrophe

00:07:02.993 --> 00:07:04.660 align:middle line:84%
depending on where
you are in the world,

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.050 align:middle line:84%
it's playing out
around us all the time.

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:06.925 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: Absolutely.

00:07:06.925 --> 00:07:09.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So
humankind is terrified

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:12.780 align:middle line:84%
when we think of the fact that
a meteorite could have impacted

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.500 align:middle line:84%
Earth, and it could have
created such a sudden shift

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.830 align:middle line:84%
in our condition that whole
populations disappeared,

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.890 align:middle line:84%
that earth moved,
that water moved,

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:26.350 align:middle line:84%
and huge percentage of
humanity was wiped out.

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:28.860 align:middle line:84%
But if you just now take
it to a smaller scale,

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.720 align:middle line:90%
try living in Pakistan.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:34.320 align:middle line:84%
My God, it's a catastrophe
there on a regular basis.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.270 align:middle line:90%
But it's just--

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:38.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying, if we
extend it out, we've

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:41.360 align:middle line:84%
all lived through these
catastrophes multiple times--

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.160 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: Right.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.493 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --these Earth changes.

00:07:43.493 --> 00:07:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
important to say,

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:48.490 align:middle line:84%
there's no-- you can't
stuff a soul in a body.

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:50.530 align:middle line:84%
There is no soul
that is incarnated

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:53.080 align:middle line:84%
that's been forced to
incarnate at any time.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.330 align:middle line:84%
It has to be a
collaboration between you

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:56.890 align:middle line:90%
and that little vehicle.

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And you know the times
you're being born into.

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And so we've all
agreed when we--

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.530 align:middle line:84%
those of us who've been
present for catastrophe,

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:10.000 align:middle line:84%
for some reason, to incarnate
at that pivotal time in history.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.485 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: Well, you've
got debts to pay.

00:08:14.485 --> 00:08:16.627 align:middle line:90%
You've got obligations--

00:08:16.627 --> 00:08:17.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Got obligations.

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:21.370 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: --that you
can't move forward

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:25.390 align:middle line:90%
until you balance the scales.

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:27.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the human
enterprise is all about,

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:28.330 align:middle line:90%
in my view.

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:29.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:33.679 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: And we can, again, I
think, many of our experiences

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:38.860 align:middle line:84%
which are on the personal
level, are really

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:42.730 align:middle line:84%
messages from the universe, if
you will, telling us, you see,

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:44.230 align:middle line:90%
this is the way it works.

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:50.704 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're in kindergarten
now, but that's just the--

00:08:50.704 --> 00:08:52.490 align:middle line:84%
that's just the
beginning of things.

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:54.980 align:middle line:84%
That's just the
tip of the iceberg.

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:56.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's go
back to Atlantis now,

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:59.170 align:middle line:84%
since that's the primary
subject of your book.

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:02.380 align:middle line:84%
And my understanding
is that Atlantis

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:05.980 align:middle line:84%
had three separate
catastrophes, so to speak,

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.770 align:middle line:84%
chunked off from the north,
the mid, down to the south.

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:10.990 align:middle line:84%
But the only one that's
really focused on,

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:14.080 align:middle line:84%
and that people are able to get
the geological evidence for,

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.700 align:middle line:90%
is the final destruction.

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And let's just set it up for
people that aren't already aware

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:22.240 align:middle line:84%
of the timeline and the story
and the players involved to have

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:26.200 align:middle line:84%
uncovered the evidence for
this loss of this continent--

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.140 align:middle line:84%
the final loss of the
continent about 12,000--

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:32.140 align:middle line:84%
11,600 years ago to
12,000 years ago.

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:33.730 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: Well,
there's a-- you're

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:41.200 align:middle line:84%
talking about the timeline
of the end of Atlantis.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of
that is speculation.

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:47.800 align:middle line:90%
We can only guess about that.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.992 align:middle line:84%
And there are a
few people who have

00:09:49.992 --> 00:09:52.450 align:middle line:84%
had a lot of very interesting
things to say on the subject.

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:54.220 align:middle line:90%
We've mentioned Edgar Cayce.

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:57.790 align:middle line:84%
Others would be like
James Churchward or--

00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:02.230 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, the point is-- and I
mentioned Churchward and another

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:06.920 align:middle line:84%
of his associate, Augustus
Le Plongeon, and so forth,

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:10.030 align:middle line:84%
and they're basically-- and they
were talking primarily about

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:17.290 align:middle line:84%
what was believed to be the
history of Lemuria, which was--

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:20.620 align:middle line:84%
a civilization that
preceded Atlantis.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.420 align:middle line:90%
And it's hard to--

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:25.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're talking
about such a great span

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:30.340 align:middle line:84%
of time between when
those places were there

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:31.930 align:middle line:90%
and what's here now.

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:35.380 align:middle line:84%
But I think the general
consensus among people

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:37.950 align:middle line:84%
who look at the
unconscious and all of that

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:39.900 align:middle line:90%
was that there was the greater--

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:45.090 align:middle line:84%
there was a much longer period
of time for human evolution

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:51.600 align:middle line:84%
than is generally recognized
by the mainstream.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:56.370 align:middle line:84%
And the idea that according to
mainstream thinking, we were--

00:10:56.370 --> 00:11:01.620 align:middle line:84%
as recently as 5,000 years ago,
we were still basically not

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:03.660 align:middle line:90%
that far out of the Stone Age.

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And when you introduce the
idea, no, there was a--

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:12.420 align:middle line:84%
there was a time prior
to that and way back

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:14.580 align:middle line:84%
where we could do
a lot of things

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.730 align:middle line:90%
that we've forgotten how to do.

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's the important
thing, to be able to see that--

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:23.271 align:middle line:90%
see things in that--

00:11:23.271 --> 00:11:28.770 align:middle line:84%
from that perspective so
that you get the big picture.

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:31.330 align:middle line:84%
Again, that's what we're
arguing for is the big picture,

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:35.160 align:middle line:84%
and I feel that the
orthodox view has

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.215 align:middle line:90%
us looking through a keyhole--

00:11:37.215 --> 00:11:38.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:39.240 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: [CHUCKLES]

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.540 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to see what
all is out there, instead

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:43.500 align:middle line:90%
of getting something.

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But then we have
Graham Hancock, John Anthony--

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:50.460 align:middle line:84%
the late John Anthony
West, wonderfully brave.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:51.780 align:middle line:90%
We have Robert Schoch.

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:52.920 align:middle line:90%
I mean, these people--

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:56.010 align:middle line:84%
Robert Schoch has to deal
with having ten years stripped

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:58.770 align:middle line:84%
by just speaking any of
these things out loud.

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:01.080 align:middle line:90%
Yet, he has said some amazing--

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.510 align:middle line:84%
he's made some amazing
contributions as

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:05.130 align:middle line:84%
to the age of some
of these artifacts,

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:06.690 align:middle line:90%
particularly in Egypt.

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:13.440 align:middle line:84%
And so then, when Gobekli Tepe
started rising to our awareness,

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:16.830 align:middle line:84%
we start understanding there
were very sophisticated cultures

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:17.650 align:middle line:90%
in the past.

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:18.450 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: Right.

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And I think there are a
number of places that are just

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:24.310 align:middle line:90%
starting to be investigated.

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:26.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking about
not only Gobekli Tepe,

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:28.830 align:middle line:84%
but just recently,
there was a lot

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:33.240 align:middle line:84%
of news about Gunung
Padang in Indonesia.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And there's pretty
solid evidence

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:41.827 align:middle line:84%
that there's some kind of a
period-- a pyramid in this one

00:12:41.827 --> 00:12:42.660 align:middle line:90%
area, in particular.

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And they're talking
like 27,000 years.

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:46.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:50.410 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: And so, that
defeats the orthodox paradigm

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:51.210 align:middle line:90%
right there.

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:52.043 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, yes.

00:12:52.043 --> 00:12:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And supposedly, Robert
Schoch casually--

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:58.500 align:middle line:84%
well, John Anthony West told me,
it's at least 35,000 years old,

00:12:58.500 --> 00:12:59.400 align:middle line:90%
the Great Pyramid.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:00.275 align:middle line:90%
That was his opinion.

00:13:00.275 --> 00:13:01.075 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: Right.

00:13:01.075 --> 00:13:03.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Robert Schoch
privately said to someone--

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:03.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:05.417 align:middle line:84%
I hoping I'm not
getting him in trouble,

00:13:05.417 --> 00:13:07.200 align:middle line:84%
that when he first
saw the pyramid,

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.600 align:middle line:84%
he felt it was closer
to 200,000 years old.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.260 align:middle line:84%
In Hermetic studies,
they peg it around 85,000

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:13.950 align:middle line:90%
to 90,000 years old.

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:15.780 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: Right.

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:17.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what's
going on here, right?

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And then Atlantis,
of course, was

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.190 align:middle line:84%
noted to have had its
own pyramidal structures.

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:25.200 align:middle line:84%
That seems to be a
primary structure

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:29.010 align:middle line:84%
around the planet for
some transformative

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:32.940 align:middle line:90%
or spiritual processes.

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:35.520 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: Well, they want to
give credit now for the Great

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:38.920 align:middle line:84%
Pyramids, say, to the
Pharaoh Khufu, which he was--

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:42.420 align:middle line:84%
takes us back about
4,000 or 5,000 years.

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:43.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:48.310 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: And the idea is,
when you look at it closely,

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:53.800 align:middle line:84%
it's absurd because what
civilization could have created

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:58.540 align:middle line:84%
something like that
because it is so complex

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:03.490 align:middle line:84%
and has so many different
aspects that in terms

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:08.230 align:middle line:84%
of its geometry, in terms of
its-- the awareness that it

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:14.490 align:middle line:84%
demonstrates, in terms of the
proportions of the planet,

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:15.290 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:19.180 align:middle line:84%
And so I think it's a
mystery that is not--

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:20.540 align:middle line:90%
there's no explanation.

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:21.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And they're all over the
planet, and they're underground.

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:27.220 align:middle line:84%
The sands of time
are covering a lot

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:30.160 align:middle line:84%
of these amazing pyramidal
structures all over this planet.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.380 align:middle line:84%
They're just getting to
the point, technologically,

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:36.500 align:middle line:84%
to be able to identify them
through earth-penetrating radar.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:39.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is a whole new
area, what they're finding.

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they've got to
be pretty tight-lipped about it

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:44.890 align:middle line:84%
because as soon as the
information comes out,

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:49.000 align:middle line:84%
the machine starts
to immediately try

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.110 align:middle line:90%
to discredit them.

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:53.215 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: Yeah, if you start to
suggest that there was-- again,

00:14:53.215 --> 00:14:55.090 align:middle line:90%
it's the same issue.

00:14:55.090 --> 00:15:00.030 align:middle line:84%
If you're suggesting that there
was a prior civilization that

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:05.160 align:middle line:84%
was destroyed, you immediately
run into opposition,

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.720 align:middle line:90%
tremendous opposition to that.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.345 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to get to
that in a minute about the ways

00:15:09.345 --> 00:15:11.190 align:middle line:84%
in which they do it
and why because this

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:14.550 align:middle line:84%
is beyond my
comprehension that people

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:18.780 align:middle line:84%
can try to quash and control
such essential stories

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:20.910 align:middle line:90%
about our own history.

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:24.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't get how academia can
get away with that and has,

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:26.130 align:middle line:90%
for so long, actually, but--

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:28.720 align:middle line:84%
So, my understanding--
so, if we go back to-- you

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:29.970 align:middle line:90%
were talking about Churchward.

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:31.800 align:middle line:90%
We're talking about Cayce.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.480 align:middle line:90%
We're talking about Lemuria.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:36.990 align:middle line:84%
So our understanding is
Lemuria was in the Pacific.

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:39.480 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis was in the
Atlantic, large continents

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.370 align:middle line:90%
that ultimately sunk.

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:44.760 align:middle line:84%
But my understanding
is that Lemuria was--

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:48.780 align:middle line:84%
the technology was not so
much of a physical nature

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:52.350 align:middle line:84%
as what is said to have
existed in Atlantis,

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:54.910 align:middle line:90%
but more spiritual technology.

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:55.710 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: Mm-hmm.

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:57.252 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Beings
that might have even

00:15:57.252 --> 00:15:59.830 align:middle line:84%
been phased in at a slightly
different density than what

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:00.733 align:middle line:90%
we are now.

00:16:00.733 --> 00:16:02.650 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about that
a little bit, and then

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:03.910 align:middle line:90%
we'll set up Atlantis?

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:05.740 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: Well,
again, that would be--

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:10.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm not-- I can't advocate
for any particular--

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:11.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know--

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:12.220 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: --position on that.

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:13.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you write
on all different things.

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:14.680 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: But we did--

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:18.610 align:middle line:84%
I think Atlantis--
excuse me, Lemuria

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:21.460 align:middle line:84%
is generally
believed among those

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:24.400 align:middle line:84%
who follow these kinds
of things to have been

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.760 align:middle line:90%
much more of a mother culture.

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And that Atlantis was its--
was a descendant of it.

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:36.700 align:middle line:90%
And that those who--

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:39.340 align:middle line:84%
and Atlantis was more
of a kind of what you

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:42.160 align:middle line:90%
might call a left brain world.

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.943 align:middle line:90%
And Lemuria was more of a--

00:16:43.943 --> 00:16:44.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right brain.

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:47.110 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: --more of a
right brain kind of thing.

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And by that, I mean,
more intuitive,

00:16:52.150 --> 00:17:01.960 align:middle line:84%
not so much a linear sequence,
which is what Atlantis was

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:07.867 align:middle line:84%
contributed-- considered to
be much more of a mechanical--

00:17:07.867 --> 00:17:08.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Technologically.

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:09.480 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON:
--technologically advanced.

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:11.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Certainly,
toward the end,

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:13.753 align:middle line:84%
my understanding of
it is the various--

00:17:13.753 --> 00:17:15.420 align:middle line:84%
I've read different
books than you read.

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:17.069 align:middle line:84%
And we read some
that are the same,

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:22.859 align:middle line:84%
is that Lemuria actually
was concurrent at one point

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:24.300 align:middle line:90%
with the beginning of Atlantis.

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:26.799 align:middle line:84%
And Atlantis was concurrent
with Egypt because--

00:17:26.799 --> 00:17:27.599 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: Right.

00:17:27.599 --> 00:17:29.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --the early
Egyptian culture,

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:32.545 align:middle line:84%
according to the Hermetics, goes
back a couple 100,000 years.

00:17:32.545 --> 00:17:33.345 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: Sure.

00:17:33.345 --> 00:17:36.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we're talking
about overlap between these.

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And then it's funny, if we
think about it now, it's--

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:45.180 align:middle line:84%
and it does-- it
has been represented

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:47.730 align:middle line:84%
and even the Bible
and some Vedic texts

00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:50.070 align:middle line:84%
that there's always
been air travel.

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.590 align:middle line:84%
There's always been
a sophisticated form

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:53.410 align:middle line:90%
of air travel.

00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:55.440 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's from
off-planet or on-planet,

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.690 align:middle line:84%
it seems air travel
has always existed.

00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:00.330 align:middle line:84%
So moving populations
around doesn't

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:03.990 align:middle line:84%
have to be a big mystery if we
accept technology has probably

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:05.610 align:middle line:90%
always been on Earth.

00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:08.290 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: Yeah,
it's hard to just--

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:11.500 align:middle line:84%
the technological
story-- there's

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:14.440 align:middle line:84%
a lot of different
variations on that.

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:21.220 align:middle line:10%
And for example, I think that
the idea that the Neanderthals,

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:26.140 align:middle line:10%
for example, were really
a more of an intuitive--

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:27.742 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: More Lemurian.

00:18:27.742 --> 00:18:29.200 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: --type
of thing, and they

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:36.475 align:middle line:84%
go back probably further
than modern humans.

00:18:36.475 --> 00:18:38.020 align:middle line:84%
And that probably,
there may have

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:43.480 align:middle line:84%
been some inheritance there
between from Neanderthals

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:44.590 align:middle line:90%
to modern humans.

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:49.465 align:middle line:84%
And cultures that existed
prior to the Ice Age

00:18:49.465 --> 00:18:53.740 align:middle line:84%
and simultaneously with the
Ice Age, all of these things

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:54.915 align:middle line:90%
are possible.

00:18:54.915 --> 00:18:58.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think that-- and
there's evidence to suggest--

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:01.567 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Neanderthals and the
Denisovans supposedly mated--

00:19:01.567 --> 00:19:02.650 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: Denisovans, yes.

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:05.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --Denisovans
mated, right?

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:09.050 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: There's certainly
a strong evidence for some.

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:11.180 align:middle line:90%
And I was fond of--

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:15.000 align:middle line:84%
talked a lot in the magazine
about Denisova Cave,

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.200 align:middle line:84%
which is this cave in
Siberia, where they found

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:24.485 align:middle line:84%
clear examples of jewelry which
had been obviously drilled

00:19:24.485 --> 00:19:26.170 align:middle line:90%
by some kind of technology--

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:26.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sophisticated.

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:28.055 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: --that was
capable of really--

00:19:28.055 --> 00:19:28.888 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fine work.

00:19:28.888 --> 00:19:31.310 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: --high speed,
very fine drilling.

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:38.578 align:middle line:84%
And there's-- so the full story
is totally obscure right now.

00:19:38.578 --> 00:19:41.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, one thing we
know is a lot more happened than

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:42.680 align:middle line:90%
our academic institutions are--

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:43.190 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: That's for sure.

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:44.357 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --letting us onto.

00:19:44.357 --> 00:19:48.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are
dolmens and caves

00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:51.750 align:middle line:84%
all over the planet
that house people.

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:54.510 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
extraordinarily large.

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:57.830 align:middle line:84%
Some are extraordinarily
exotic, some extraordinarily

00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:00.080 align:middle line:84%
well-dressed that have
actually been unearthed.

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:02.270 align:middle line:84%
You don't read that in
any of the books, right?

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:03.070 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: Right.

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:06.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so we just have
to now say, wait a minute,

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:09.770 align:middle line:84%
I think the big question is,
why is it important to remember

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:12.920 align:middle line:84%
that we've had these very
iterations of us in the past

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.300 align:middle line:90%
that have been very advanced?

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:15.650 align:middle line:90%
And then we get knocked down.

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:19.040 align:middle line:84%
We have to find our way
back again, over and over.

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And I had a personal
experience of that.

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:27.440 align:middle line:84%
And then, why the field of
those who control information

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:31.860 align:middle line:84%
is so afraid of humanity
knowing these things?

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:33.260 align:middle line:90%
So-- yeah.

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:35.270 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: It's a narrative.

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:39.440 align:middle line:84%
People seeking to retain
a particular narrative

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:42.200 align:middle line:84%
in the story that
according to their story,

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:45.020 align:middle line:90%
they end up in charge.

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And so the suggestion
that maybe there

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:54.530 align:middle line:84%
was some other scenario
that occurred where

00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:57.110 align:middle line:84%
maybe somebody
else was in charge,

00:20:57.110 --> 00:21:02.970 align:middle line:84%
or another breed, another group,
another tribe was in charge.

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the, I
think, the core of it.

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And if you take it, it's
another kind of tribal warfare,

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:11.710 align:middle line:84%
is basically what
you're talking about.

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:13.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's time to
get rid of tribal warfare.

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:14.800 align:middle line:90%
It's so primitive.

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.022 align:middle line:90%
Warfare in general is so--

00:21:16.022 --> 00:21:17.230 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: The most primitive.

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:18.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --is so primitive.

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:19.840 align:middle line:84%
So I'll tell you a
little experience

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.510 align:middle line:84%
I had because this goes directly
into what we're talking about,

00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:24.850 align:middle line:84%
and the end part
was interesting.

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:27.040 align:middle line:84%
So the late wonderful
Dolores Cannon

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:29.560 align:middle line:90%
did a regression on me in 20--

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:32.260 align:middle line:90%
2000, actually, 2000 or 2001.

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.140 align:middle line:90%
And I was looking--

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:37.780 align:middle line:84%
I was just a little
blue and wondering what

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:39.640 align:middle line:90%
was impinging upon my heart.

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.280 align:middle line:84%
So I was expecting
something quite simple.

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And boom, I'm somewhere
else entirely.

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And-- kind of try to
get my bearings a bit

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:48.760 align:middle line:84%
and thought, where
in the heck am I?

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out it was in
a place-- it was in Atlantis.

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And it was on the final day
of one of the destructions.

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.630 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was the middle,
not the first destruction.

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:03.850 align:middle line:90%
It was not the last destruction.

00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:07.470 align:middle line:84%
And it was a mix
because at that time,

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:11.930 align:middle line:84%
I was a woman in one of the
temples that worked with--

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:14.940 align:middle line:84%
our lifespans were very
long, by the way, over 700.

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:16.850 align:middle line:84%
Because I remember,
she asked me my age.

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:19.310 align:middle line:90%
I said, I'm 232.

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:20.580 align:middle line:90%
And I was quite young.

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:23.387 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I looked like I
was 35 years old or so.

00:22:23.387 --> 00:22:25.220 align:middle line:84%
But it just came out,
and I was comfortable.

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:26.810 align:middle line:84%
I said, no, the elder
ones are over there.

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:28.310 align:middle line:84%
They only come for
special things.

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:29.360 align:middle line:90%
It's our job right now.

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:30.410 align:middle line:90%
We have the energy.

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:31.940 align:middle line:90%
And we would stand.

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:35.450 align:middle line:84%
We could stand for 20 hours
at a time, focused minds.

00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:40.880 align:middle line:84%
But our job at that time was
working with the disturbed earth

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:46.050 align:middle line:90%
energy that was starting to--

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:48.430 align:middle line:90%
would become unstable.

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:52.780 align:middle line:84%
And everyone psychically knew
this thing is going to blow.

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:55.390 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything we
can do to stop this?

00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:59.480 align:middle line:84%
Because the technology was
so advanced physically,

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:03.610 align:middle line:84%
but also spiritually and
mentally and agriculturally.

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:06.700 align:middle line:84%
It was such a fine, fine
technology of the day

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:08.530 align:middle line:90%
that no one wanted it lost.

00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:11.410 align:middle line:90%
So anyway, we go through this.

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:13.180 align:middle line:90%
It's a very sobering--

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:14.440 align:middle line:90%
somber moment.

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you can move
beyond the actual event

00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:18.040 align:middle line:90%
because it was the end.

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And we were just standing
quietly in a circle.

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:21.340 align:middle line:90%
The game was lost.

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:23.240 align:middle line:90%
So we go beyond it.

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And I told her, as she
said, don't go through it,

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:28.420 align:middle line:90%
it's too traumatizing.

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:31.220 align:middle line:84%
So I went just beyond
it, and it was awful.

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:34.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was like bubbling
waters and fish belly up.

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:39.820 align:middle line:84%
And everything was golden
and brown and burnt.

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:42.595 align:middle line:84%
And we won't go into
the rest of how.

00:23:42.595 --> 00:23:45.200 align:middle line:84%
We were kind of blaming the
guys that were using technology.

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:47.810 align:middle line:84%
It was-- they were just trying
to help with technology.

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:51.510 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting thing
was, in the near atmosphere,

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:55.700 align:middle line:84%
there were these spaceships
from other places

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:57.410 align:middle line:84%
that were trying
to help as well.

00:23:57.410 --> 00:24:00.380 align:middle line:84%
They were also directing
their energy into the Earth.

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:04.590 align:middle line:84%
Everyone was trying to soothe
it, and it didn't work.

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:07.652 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it disturbed it
even more, and it all blew.

00:24:07.652 --> 00:24:09.110 align:middle line:84%
And you could see
there were people

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:12.380 align:middle line:84%
who were taken out by craft
so that the knowledge would

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:14.630 align:middle line:84%
be preserved and
deposited elsewhere.

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:16.880 align:middle line:84%
Others like me went down
with the ship and were

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.410 align:middle line:90%
traumatized deeply.

00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:21.410 align:middle line:84%
But the thing I said to
her was, we are going

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:23.760 align:middle line:90%
to sleep for a very long time.

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:26.390 align:middle line:84%
What we've just
lost is unbearable.

00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And if we remember
this, we will not

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:30.170 align:middle line:84%
choose to incarnate
back to Earth.

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:31.920 align:middle line:90%
We have to start over again.

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And this was-- she didn't
understand initially what I was

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:40.020 align:middle line:84%
saying, and she finally
did, that that was--

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:45.750 align:middle line:84%
there was a need for amnesia
just to keep moving, get earth

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:47.850 align:middle line:90%
to move back forward again.

00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:52.330 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: Yeah, well, amnesia
is a process of self-defense.

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:53.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:55.680 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: It's basically--
and the reason people-- it

00:24:55.680 --> 00:25:01.080 align:middle line:84%
gets to your point about the
people rejecting the storyline

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:02.370 align:middle line:90%
that we're talking about.

00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:04.710 align:middle line:84%
And they're sticking to
their-- they're sticking to--

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:06.210 align:middle line:84%
they've got their
story, and they're

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:11.610 align:middle line:84%
sticking to it because
without it, they

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:14.938 align:middle line:84%
feel they're losing their
sense of self or their--

00:25:14.938 --> 00:25:16.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They feel vulnerable.

00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:19.320 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: Absolutely,
and very vulnerable.

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:21.090 align:middle line:90%
And it's terrifying.

00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:23.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, every culture
has their Great Flood myth.

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:27.690 align:middle line:84%
Virtually, every culture on the
planet has the Great Flood myth.

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:28.500 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: Right.

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.345 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, I
mean, so we know--

00:25:30.345 --> 00:25:31.810 align:middle line:90%
we've accepted that.

00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:32.610 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: Right.

00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:34.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why not look
a little further back

00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:36.660 align:middle line:84%
and accept that this
wasn't a one-off event?

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:40.090 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: Well, we
were talking about why

00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:43.210 align:middle line:84%
the self-protection
of the amnesia

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:49.540 align:middle line:84%
is like, as you deny what might
have happened, you basically

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:52.360 align:middle line:84%
protect yourself so
that you can recover,

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:55.240 align:middle line:84%
that you can regain
your equilibrium.

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:59.840 align:middle line:84%
And that process
becomes a habit.

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:00.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does.

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it had
purpose at the time.

00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:02.410 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: That's right.

00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:04.577 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I understood
when I was looking at it,

00:26:04.577 --> 00:26:07.090 align:middle line:84%
at the destruction, I said,
we've lost everything.

00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:08.013 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: Right.

00:26:08.013 --> 00:26:09.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It made
sense if we were

00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:12.860 align:middle line:84%
going to keep incarnating on
Earth to forget about that.

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:16.015 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: Well, the breaking
out of it is, that's--

00:26:16.015 --> 00:26:17.540 align:middle line:90%
it's coming out of the Ice Age.

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:18.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:20.530 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: It's like the deluge.

00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:25.600 align:middle line:84%
And as the record starts
to come up, remember,

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.980 align:middle line:90%
it's a record of destruction.

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:31.570 align:middle line:84%
And you basically bring
it up by re-enacting it.

00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And dramatic change
requires a dramatic episode.

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:35.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:38.560 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: And the
dramatic episode--

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:40.750 align:middle line:84%
and this, of course,
is what people sense

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:42.355 align:middle line:90%
and what people fear.

00:26:42.355 --> 00:26:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And they realize-- and
the question is, can they

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.705 align:middle line:90%
go through that again?

00:26:46.705 --> 00:26:51.280 align:middle line:84%
And can they go through
it and recover and move on

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:57.940 align:middle line:84%
with their life, or do they have
to go through that again and go

00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:02.050 align:middle line:84%
down again, as you
put it, with the ship?

00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:04.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's an
unanswered question.

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And frankly, this
gets to another point.

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:09.980 align:middle line:84%
I know you-- we haven't
mentioned it yet,

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:12.820 align:middle line:90%
but it's relative to this point.

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:18.310 align:middle line:84%
And that is the "Dweller on
the Threshold," which is the--

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:21.440 align:middle line:84%
you might say-- and we talk
about this in the book.

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And we mentioned this as you
summon the demon, so to speak,

00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:30.850 align:middle line:90%
or all of the fear becomes a--

00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:32.253 align:middle line:90%
it coalesces as a--

00:27:32.253 --> 00:27:33.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Almost
like an egregore.

00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:34.670 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: --personality.

00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:36.203 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As an
egregore of sorts.

00:27:36.203 --> 00:27:37.120 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: Well, it's--

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:37.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, we've created it.

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:38.980 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: Exactly, it becomes.

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:42.400 align:middle line:84%
And basically, this is something
you have to wrestle with.

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And this is something you have
to defeat because basically, you

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:49.630 align:middle line:84%
have to recover the
energy that it's claiming.

00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:53.590 align:middle line:84%
And the energy, that is the
life energy or the life force.

00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:55.690 align:middle line:90%
That's your force, your life.

00:27:55.690 --> 00:28:02.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's all claimed by
this entity or this demon.

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And that, basically,
it's not going

00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:07.210 align:middle line:84%
to let go of that
without a fight.

00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And what we need to do
is recognize that a lot

00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:13.690 align:middle line:84%
of the forces abroad in the
world this day are really

00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:22.880 align:middle line:84%
aspects of this process on
a cosmic scale, or it's--

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:23.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:24.888 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: It's on the scale--

00:28:24.888 --> 00:28:28.940 align:middle line:84%
it's on the scale of the planet
as a whole so that you have

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:34.220 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the politics--
say, international politics,

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:38.660 align:middle line:84%
which is, as people observe,
that it's a repetition--

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:39.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:41.360 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: --of
previous episodes where

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:43.370 align:middle line:90%
the same thing happened before.

00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:47.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's an example
of playing it out

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:52.520 align:middle line:84%
because until you resolve it,
you're compelled to re-enact it.

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:54.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that
gets us to the point

00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:57.260 align:middle line:84%
of trying to hang on to
the things we believe

00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:00.170 align:middle line:84%
will make us safe
and will save us

00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:02.150 align:middle line:90%
and will compromise ourselves.

00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:04.370 align:middle line:84%
And when you're looking at
politics around the world,

00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:07.070 align:middle line:84%
often cultures, will
give way to quote,

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:10.610 align:middle line:84%
"strong men," who are going to
become their patriarchal figure

00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:12.590 align:middle line:84%
and save them from
all the threats that

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:13.970 align:middle line:90%
are happening in the world.

00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:16.520 align:middle line:84%
Instead of
understanding which is--

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:19.055 align:middle line:84%
this is what we're being
invited to do now, I believe--

00:29:19.055 --> 00:29:19.855 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: Right.

00:29:19.855 --> 00:29:24.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --is to understand
we are part of waves of cosmic

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:29.975 align:middle line:84%
and Gaia herself, earthly,
letting go and rebirthing.

00:29:29.975 --> 00:29:32.960 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: Well, you have
to take responsibility

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:35.240 align:middle line:90%
for your own sowings.

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:37.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:40.250 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: Otherwise, you'll
continue to reap the whirlwind,

00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:43.790 align:middle line:90%
if I can paraphrase.

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:47.900 align:middle line:84%
That's the predicament of
civilization as a whole.

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:51.140 align:middle line:84%
Manly Palmer Hall,
one of my favorites,

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:53.150 align:middle line:84%
talked about this
a lot in connection

00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:56.150 align:middle line:84%
with this idea of the "Dweller
on the Threshold," namely,

00:29:56.150 --> 00:30:03.170 align:middle line:84%
that until you get past
this, you're stuck, and--

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:04.912 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're stuck
and haunted by it.

00:30:04.912 --> 00:30:06.620 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: You keep
going round and round.

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:07.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:11.015 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: And you
need catharsis.

00:30:11.015 --> 00:30:14.830 align:middle line:90%
You need the purging that comes.

00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:19.550 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessarily to
re-enact in a physical terms.

00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:21.650 align:middle line:84%
But that will
happen to you if you

00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:23.520 align:middle line:90%
can't figure out a better way.

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:26.705 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
I'm a big believer

00:30:26.705 --> 00:30:29.540 align:middle line:90%
in the principle of drama.

00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:34.100 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm talking about
there is the idea of theater.

00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And that theater itself, which
is leftover from the mystery

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:43.730 align:middle line:84%
schools of ancient
times, basically

00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:50.180 align:middle line:84%
had their rituals by which
the soul could basically

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:54.470 align:middle line:84%
come to grips with its
mistakes and resolve them

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:57.440 align:middle line:90%
and could experience catharsis.

00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:00.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's the
core of tragic drama.

00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:01.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:06.020 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: And that's why when
you can successfully do this,

00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:07.605 align:middle line:84%
you can experience
metamorphosis--

00:31:07.605 --> 00:31:08.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:11.000 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: --or you
can go through.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we
need to do before we

00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:16.095 align:middle line:84%
can move on or move up or
move on to the next level.

00:31:16.095 --> 00:31:16.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:19.340 align:middle line:84%
And we're all feeling
this incredible pressure--

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:23.180 align:middle line:84%
cosmic pressure building up
to force humanity to change.

00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:25.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't think anyone
watching this can deny--

00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:28.310 align:middle line:84%
there's not a pressure
building up for change now.

00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:31.015 align:middle line:84%
And to understand
the graciousness--

00:31:31.015 --> 00:31:33.220 align:middle line:84%
even in our own bodies
on a cellular level,

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:36.370 align:middle line:84%
in order to stay
healthy, our old cells

00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:38.480 align:middle line:84%
have to die so new
cells can be born.

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:39.280 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: Right.

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:40.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Same thing
with the Earth.

00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:45.100 align:middle line:84%
Parts of her have to shake
whatever landmasses off,

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:47.800 align:middle line:84%
blow a little through
volcanoes here and there.

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:50.920 align:middle line:84%
Let her live what
she has to live.

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:51.850 align:middle line:90%
She's our host.

00:31:51.850 --> 00:31:54.370 align:middle line:84%
We've agreed to live in
companionship with her movement.

00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:56.030 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: And it's
not just a matter--

00:31:56.030 --> 00:31:58.990 align:middle line:84%
it's not just a matter
of blowing off steam,

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:01.790 align:middle line:90%
which is one level of it.

00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:02.590 align:middle line:90%
You can see that.

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:03.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
it's transformation.

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:04.505 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: That's necessary.

00:32:04.505 --> 00:32:06.460 align:middle line:84%
You have to develop
a new narrative.

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:07.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:13.930 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: One that is in harmony
with the higher purpose that--

00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:19.960 align:middle line:84%
and the soul can sense
whether or not it's being--

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:23.170 align:middle line:84%
and you see, there's
this war of narratives

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:26.260 align:middle line:84%
where you have all these
different stories that

00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:28.730 align:middle line:84%
are being presented
and people get

00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:32.480 align:middle line:84%
to choose which one
they're interested in

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:34.640 align:middle line:84%
or which one they
find acceptable.

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:36.050 align:middle line:90%
Some, they find pleasing.

00:32:36.050 --> 00:32:38.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people are
pleased by narratives

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:40.297 align:middle line:90%
which they find flattering--

00:32:40.297 --> 00:32:41.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course.

00:32:41.130 --> 00:32:44.260 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: --or which basically
pat them on the back,

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:45.060 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And then that's on one hand,
what people are looking for.

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And then on the
opposite side of it,

00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:51.755 align:middle line:90%
you've got another narrative.

00:32:51.755 --> 00:32:54.470 align:middle line:84%
It says, you're a poor,
miserable, sinner,

00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:56.355 align:middle line:84%
and you're going
down with the ship.

00:32:56.355 --> 00:32:57.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:58.760 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: So neither
one are right.

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And the difference-- and putting
them together is something that

00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:03.750 align:middle line:90%
takes--

00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:04.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Maturity?

00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:06.380 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: Yeah, and
it takes wisdom.

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:07.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wisdom.

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:11.690 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: And it takes a lot
of facing up to one's own

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:18.470 align:middle line:84%
responsibilities and one's
failures without being

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:22.334 align:middle line:84%
self-condemned or
going into a kind of--

00:33:22.334 --> 00:33:24.500 align:middle line:84%
some kind of
self-punishment trip.

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:26.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's where a
lot of people end up.

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:27.260 align:middle line:90%
They end up--

00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:28.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's not
what's being called for.

00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:28.770 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: No, no.

00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:30.562 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's simply,
to look at your life

00:33:30.562 --> 00:33:34.330 align:middle line:84%
honestly and say, where can I
contribute better, and so forth.

00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:37.060 align:middle line:84%
It's just an honest
reckoning of your own self.

00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:39.120 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: It's simple in
terms of-- it's simple

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:42.840 align:middle line:90%
in terms of what is required.

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:48.720 align:middle line:84%
But it requires a deeper
insight, and it requires--

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:50.850 align:middle line:90%
it requires courage.

00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:56.550 align:middle line:84%
And it requires awakening
and a lot of things, which--

00:33:56.550 --> 00:33:59.610 align:middle line:84%
this is why people
resist because they're

00:33:59.610 --> 00:34:00.780 align:middle line:90%
afraid of failure.

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:04.635 align:middle line:84%
They're afraid they'll
maybe attempt it,

00:34:04.635 --> 00:34:06.240 align:middle line:90%
and it won't succeed.

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:10.090 align:middle line:84%
And they'll, as you say,
go down with the ship.

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:12.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the fact
is this, some people

00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:15.510 align:middle line:84%
paint some stories are that
the wickedness of mankind

00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:17.250 align:middle line:84%
caused all these
Earth destructions.

00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:19.080 align:middle line:84%
I personally do
not believe that.

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:22.440 align:middle line:84%
I believe that the Earth is
going through her process.

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:25.239 align:middle line:84%
Our emotional fields are
intertwined with hers.

00:34:25.239 --> 00:34:27.389 align:middle line:84%
And so I think, you
can see disturbances

00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:31.230 align:middle line:84%
within the Earth's field if you
have a very disturbed and dark

00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:33.030 align:middle line:90%
emotional mass field there.

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:37.110 align:middle line:84%
But by and large, she's also
responding to the cosmos

00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:38.679 align:middle line:90%
and the solar system.

00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:41.190 align:middle line:90%
And we're just a part of that.

00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:43.139 align:middle line:84%
We're almost a flea
on the back of it,

00:34:43.139 --> 00:34:46.860 align:middle line:84%
but still, a very important
point in consciousness.

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:47.760 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: Absolutely.

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:53.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a hierarchy of
values that are involved here.

00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And I think that people
have to look at their--

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:00.180 align:middle line:84%
take responsibility
for their actions

00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:05.740 align:middle line:90%
and see things without fear.

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's not an
easy thing to do.

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:14.010 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that is part of this

00:35:14.010 --> 00:35:16.470 align:middle line:90%
is like, the idea of addiction.

00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And I mentioned
addiction as being

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:24.163 align:middle line:84%
this attachment to something
that's destructive.

00:35:24.163 --> 00:35:26.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But temporarily makes
you feel, quote, "better."

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:26.880 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: That's right.

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:27.830 align:middle line:90%
You get a payoff.

00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:32.300 align:middle line:84%
You get a temporary-- and then
discarding that may very well

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:36.740 align:middle line:84%
lead to withdrawal
or detoxification,

00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:38.070 align:middle line:90%
which basically--

00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:38.880 align:middle line:90%
and that's no fun.

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:39.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:42.710 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: And that's what
people are afraid of.

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:44.930 align:middle line:84%
But the process of
approaching that,

00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:49.571 align:middle line:84%
just like healing in general,
is something that has to be--

00:35:49.571 --> 00:35:53.240 align:middle line:84%
it has to be guided
from a higher level.

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:58.310 align:middle line:84%
And it can be from an
individual's own higher self,

00:35:58.310 --> 00:36:03.680 align:middle line:84%
and then it can be guided by
the enlightened elder brothers

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:07.370 align:middle line:90%
and sisters that we rely on.

00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:09.950 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
take responsibility.

00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And that means
very well taking--

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:18.320 align:middle line:84%
dealing with your
mistakes, bad choices.

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:20.540 align:middle line:90%
And you can't escape that.

00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:22.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But I think
compassion is huge,

00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:23.990 align:middle line:84%
to have compassion
for self and others,

00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:26.480 align:middle line:84%
because we're all bumping
through life, more or less

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:29.000 align:middle line:84%
blindfolded, because of
this amnesia that we've

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.400 align:middle line:90%
been operating under.

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:31.200 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: I agree.

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So under a
lot of false principles

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:34.920 align:middle line:90%
that have been foisted upon us.

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And before we go, I
really want to get down

00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:39.210 align:middle line:84%
to the mechanisms that
foist this stuff on us

00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:42.060 align:middle line:84%
and shut the voices down because
you wrote about it in your book.

00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:44.220 align:middle line:84%
One of them is
called astroturfing

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:46.380 align:middle line:90%
by journalist Sharyl Attkisson.

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:49.500 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us one
way in which when

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:52.635 align:middle line:84%
really interesting
discoveries are made

00:36:52.635 --> 00:36:57.060 align:middle line:84%
is they start being shut down
immediately by our global press?

00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:59.820 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: Well, you've
got the economy.

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And you basically have
people trying to make a buck

00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:07.060 align:middle line:90%
or trying to basically--

00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:11.800 align:middle line:84%
and people have
invested in the economy,

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:17.230 align:middle line:84%
all of their vision
of what's going on.

00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And basically-- and they boil
everything down to economic

00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:23.410 align:middle line:90%
issues, getting ahead, getting--

00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:26.063 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's just
a belief system.

00:37:26.063 --> 00:37:27.730 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: But it's
part of the addiction

00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:28.772 align:middle line:90%
that I was talking about.

00:37:28.772 --> 00:37:33.040 align:middle line:84%
It's addiction to material
forms, and that's part of what--

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:36.820 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to get that
across into because you

00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:41.290 align:middle line:84%
find materialism on
the left and the right.

00:37:41.290 --> 00:37:43.210 align:middle line:90%
Both of them are using.

00:37:43.210 --> 00:37:45.550 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a question
of left versus right.

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:52.480 align:middle line:84%
It's easy to fall into that trap
of trying to identify all good

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:55.880 align:middle line:84%
as left and all bad as
right or vice-versa.

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's what a
lot of people do.

00:37:57.710 --> 00:38:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's where you get such
intense emotion that people

00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:04.690 align:middle line:90%
bring to bear on these topics.

00:38:04.690 --> 00:38:06.790 align:middle line:84%
And the reason they
don't make much progress

00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:09.310 align:middle line:84%
is because they want to
be able to point a finger.

00:38:09.310 --> 00:38:13.247 align:middle line:84%
They want to be able
to blame somebody.

00:38:13.247 --> 00:38:15.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, meaning
you never progressed

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:16.640 align:middle line:90%
to the more mature story.

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:19.820 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: Right, and that's what
taking personal responsibility

00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:21.260 align:middle line:90%
is the way you get around.

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:25.250 align:middle line:84%
You don't waste
your time on blame.

00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:27.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
what you're driving at.

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:28.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:31.220 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: And blame,
of course, I mean,

00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:34.400 align:middle line:84%
this idea of responsibility
has many aspects.

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:37.980 align:middle line:84%
And it takes many different
forms and so forth.

00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:42.170 align:middle line:84%
But I think that that's
what we're looking at.

00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:45.335 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned the
astroturfing idea.

00:38:45.335 --> 00:38:47.960 align:middle line:84%
There, again, its
elaborate structures

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:51.180 align:middle line:84%
that are developed to basically
carry out the same agenda we're

00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:51.980 align:middle line:90%
talking about.

00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:53.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it all
happens through the media.

00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:55.730 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: Yeah, media's the
amplifier and the conductor.

00:38:55.730 --> 00:38:57.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Amplifier
through education,

00:38:57.330 --> 00:38:59.420 align:middle line:84%
through financial
systems, all of it,

00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:00.890 align:middle line:90%
but media is the amplifier.

00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:04.408 align:middle line:84%
And even, like, Wikipedia, you
gave some examples in there.

00:39:04.408 --> 00:39:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And some of us know
about Rupert Sheldrake,

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:10.160 align:middle line:84%
but "TED Talks,"
Wikipedia, other sources,

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:13.340 align:middle line:84%
how they have gatekeepers
that will very quickly come

00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:16.790 align:middle line:84%
in and tear down anything
that suggests there's a larger

00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:18.290 align:middle line:90%
picture beyond the mainstream--

00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:20.840 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: Because they know
full well that what we're saying

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:21.380 align:middle line:90%
is true.

00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:22.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:24.990 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: And basically,
they're out to manipulate

00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:25.790 align:middle line:90%
the narrative--

00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:26.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:29.870 align:middle line:10%
>>KENYON: --because
they recognize

00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:34.700 align:middle line:10%
their own position is dependent
upon a certain narrative.

00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And if that narrative
is broken down,

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:39.830 align:middle line:84%
they're going to lose
their clout, and so forth.

00:39:39.830 --> 00:39:41.690 align:middle line:84%
And they've got
their antenna up.

00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:42.587 align:middle line:90%
They're not--

00:39:42.587 --> 00:39:44.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, they have
watchdogs everywhere

00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:45.210 align:middle line:90%
to shut it down.

00:39:45.210 --> 00:39:45.800 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: They're watching it.

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:47.120 align:middle line:90%
Then they're ready to--

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:50.600 align:middle line:90%
they're ready to slam the--

00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:51.500 align:middle line:90%
nipping the bud.

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:52.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:56.997 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: Strangling the cradle,
anything that's a threat--

00:39:56.997 --> 00:39:58.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To the
mainstream narrative.

00:39:58.580 --> 00:39:59.990 align:middle line:84%
>>KENYON: --to the
mainstream narrative, right.

00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:02.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So in the
end, after all of this,

00:40:02.330 --> 00:40:04.760 align:middle line:84%
after all of the
studies you-- studying

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:07.640 align:middle line:84%
you've done and research
throughout your lifetime and all

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:10.790 align:middle line:84%
of the wonders around the
planet that the mainstream--

00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:12.800 align:middle line:84%
people that only pay
attention to mainstream

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:15.200 align:middle line:84%
will never even hear
about in this lifetime,

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:18.960 align:middle line:84%
what would your overarching
message be to everyone?

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:19.920 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: Wake up.

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:22.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, OK, well, that's
a-- that pretty much hits it.

00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:24.030 align:middle line:90%
I agree with you.

00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:25.170 align:middle line:90%
Wake up.

00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:26.378 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: We're sleepwalking.

00:40:26.378 --> 00:40:28.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not-- it's
OK to most people are good.

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:31.050 align:middle line:84%
It's OK to take
personal responsibility.

00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:32.190 align:middle line:90%
We've all screwed up.

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:33.060 align:middle line:90%
We're human.

00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:36.060 align:middle line:84%
But if we understand
that, generally speaking,

00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:36.990 align:middle line:90%
humanity is good.

00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:39.360 align:middle line:84%
It's not so scary
to look at whatever

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:42.070 align:middle line:84%
our faults may be and see
if we can refine ourselves

00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:42.870 align:middle line:90%
a little bit.

00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:44.162 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: There's virtue there.

00:40:44.162 --> 00:40:46.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, a lot
of virtue in humanity.

00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:47.730 align:middle line:90%
And we need to remember that.

00:40:47.730 --> 00:40:48.910 align:middle line:90%
We are good at heart.

00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:51.070 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a
look and remember.

00:40:51.070 --> 00:40:51.870 align:middle line:90%
>>KENYON: I agree.

00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:52.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah?

00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:53.510 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:55.380 align:middle line:10%
"Ghosts of Atlantis"
takes the reader

00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:57.240 align:middle line:10%
through every kind
of historical event

00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:00.300 align:middle line:10%
through geological and
anthropological evidence,

00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:03.180 align:middle line:10%
of course, all being
denied by mainstream media

00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:07.290 align:middle line:10%
and academics, a good compendium
of our unacknowledged history.

00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:08.350 align:middle line:10%
Until next time.

00:41:08.350 --> 00:41:10.830 align:middle line:84%
