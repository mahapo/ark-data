>>STEWART PEARCE: Diana
was immensely gracious

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.239 align:middle line:84%
and very yielding to the
power of significance.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:19.350 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
she was an observer.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.350 align:middle line:84%
She knew that she
had a unique destiny.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.017 align:middle line:84%
She didn't quite know
how to fulfill it.

She was a modern day

00:00:25.642 --> 00:00:26.910 align:middle line:90%
princess out of a fairy tale.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.470 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't a fairy tale.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's the time
that we're in now,

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.780 align:middle line:84%
is deconstructing what we
have put up as fairy tales.

That's really what we're
charged with doing.

Do you believe that her
death was accidental,

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.205 align:middle line:84%
or do you believe
that she was killed?

00:00:43.205 --> 00:00:45.330 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: I think it was
even more crude than that.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.070 align:middle line:90%
Well, we each have our own note.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.170 align:middle line:90%
We each have a signature sound.

is the sound that

in touch with my note.

00:00:59.605 --> 00:01:02.550 align:middle line:84%
There's a sound at the very
core of the vocal compass

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.500 align:middle line:84%
in our bodies, that
if we express it,

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.680 align:middle line:84%

>>REGINA: Certainly one of
the most intriguing women

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.710 align:middle line:10%
of the 20th century
was Princess Diana.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.870 align:middle line:10%
Everybody put their
own story on her,

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.190 align:middle line:10%
and her own story was
complicated enough.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.220 align:middle line:84%
But one thing that
stood clear is

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.080 align:middle line:84%
that the world thought
she was beautiful

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.600 align:middle line:84%
and offered a type of
kindness and generosity

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.920 align:middle line:90%
through her projects.

Stewart Pearce says the
story runs deeper than that.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.540 align:middle line:90%

But first, we start with Diana.

And Diana did have
a complicated life.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.480 align:middle line:90%
And there was something--

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.139 align:middle line:90%
I never met her.

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:09.449 align:middle line:90%
I know people who have met her.

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:10.380 align:middle line:90%
You knew her.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.990 align:middle line:84%
There was something
truly luminous

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.660 align:middle line:84%
just about her
presence alone that

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.400 align:middle line:84%
captivated people and offered
a kind of grace into the world.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.790 align:middle line:84%
In spite of all the troubles
that were going on in her life

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.360 align:middle line:84%
behind the scenes, something
in her transcended that.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.730 align:middle line:84%
But still, there was a part of
her that was a frightened girl.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.330 align:middle line:10%
And you met her and
helped her out of that.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.240 align:middle line:10%
>>PEARCE: Yeah.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.040 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.420 align:middle line:10%
Well, I believe that
that was always there.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.390 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: And if she
were still alive,

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.710 align:middle line:90%
it would always still be there.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.110 align:middle line:84%
But of course, there's a
frightened child within me.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.020 align:middle line:84%
The question is, well, do
we live that all the time

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.560 align:middle line:90%
or is there another choice?

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.970 align:middle line:10%
And so, when I met Diana, she
was at this peak performance

through the Martin Bashir

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.260 align:middle line:10%
right in the annals of history.

was really proud of

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.210 align:middle line:90%
was what she'd revealed.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.740 align:middle line:84%
But she didn't really like
the way that she came across.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.855 align:middle line:84%
(SOFTER TONE) I mean,
looking through this way

00:03:10.855 --> 00:03:11.980 align:middle line:90%
and speaking in this very--

under her eyelashes.

>>PEARCE: --voice, you know?

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.530 align:middle line:84%
She didn't feel that it
was an empowered statement

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.560 align:middle line:84%
of this svelte executive
woman of the world.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.170 align:middle line:84%
But it was still full of her
grace and full of her charm

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.570 align:middle line:90%
and full of her fun.

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.570 align:middle line:84%
So that's really principally
why we started working together,

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:29.370 align:middle line:90%
to empower that.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.960 align:middle line:90%


00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
press around the world

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.780 align:middle line:84%
have all written
about her differently.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.810 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
that seemed clear

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.540 align:middle line:84%
is that she was there
to show the cracks

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.840 align:middle line:84%
in the old patriarchal
and monarchal system.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And that time for revision
had arrived, I think.

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And Diana certainly, in
sharing what she shared,

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.837 align:middle line:84%
pushed that forward probably
faster than anybody else.

00:03:53.837 --> 00:03:54.920 align:middle line:90%
Would you agree with that?

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:55.962 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Oh, absolutely.

00:03:55.962 --> 00:03:59.500 align:middle line:84%
She was an archetypal key in
the movement of these times

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.530 align:middle line:84%
that we live in, these
extraordinary times, which

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.660 align:middle line:84%
we can refer to as
being contemporaneous.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.510 align:middle line:84%
But really the modern
period from the Second War

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.630 align:middle line:84%
has built to this
time of vast change,

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.520 align:middle line:84%
and particularly for
you amazing women,

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.590 align:middle line:84%
as you women step forward and
discover your own empowerment.

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.339 align:middle line:84%
So she was an archetypal key
in the whole of that process.

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:23.230 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, how can we explain
that phenomenon of her death?

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And 3.9 billion people,
which at that time

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.113 align:middle line:84%
was over half the population
of the planet moving into--

>>REGINA: And she did.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.630 align:middle line:84%
She absolutely
fascinated people.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.580 align:middle line:84%
Everybody had a different
idea of who she was,

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.200 align:middle line:84%
what her background
and story was.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.420 align:middle line:84%
But we were transfixed
with her, and everyone

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:44.740 align:middle line:90%
felt the beauty and grace.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.850 align:middle line:90%
I think that is absolute.

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.010 align:middle line:84%
And so it was interesting
to me following the lives--

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.840 align:middle line:84%
I've always, for
whatever reasons,

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.540 align:middle line:84%
followed the lives
of the Royal Family,

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.370 align:middle line:90%
read a fair amount about them.

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.810 align:middle line:84%
And with Diana, something
happened that was interesting.

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.340 align:middle line:84%
Because she was trapped,
herself, in this arrangement.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.990 align:middle line:90%
The arrangement was made.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.090 align:middle line:84%
And then she learned
along the way

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.430 align:middle line:84%
her husband was in
love with someone else.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.460 align:middle line:84%
Very painful for
a young girl who's

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.710 align:middle line:84%
taking on this role
and a new husband

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.300 align:middle line:84%
and bringing a family
into the world.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.100 align:middle line:84%
And so here you have a lot
of confluence of events.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.053 align:middle line:84%
Charles is saying, Mummy, why
are you making me marry someone

00:05:27.053 --> 00:05:27.970 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to marry?

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:28.840 align:middle line:90%
I love Camilla.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.700 align:middle line:90%
And that was the time.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.290 align:middle line:84%
Diana saying, (SOFTER
VOICE) well, it

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.600 align:middle line:84%
seems like the right thing
to do, and he's lovely

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.560 align:middle line:84%
and I love him,
and let's do this.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.650 align:middle line:84%
And so everybody
took their places

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.460 align:middle line:84%
on a stage that was not
authentic for anybody.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And then she, of course,
lived through a lot

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.250 align:middle line:84%
of the horrors of it and
had a very difficult time

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:49.180 align:middle line:90%
emotionally.

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:54.250 align:middle line:84%
So at what point in
her did she shift over

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.800 align:middle line:84%
from realizing she's
not going to have

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.070 align:middle line:84%
the love of her husband,
that's not happening,

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.330 align:middle line:84%
so she can do something
else and then become

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.330 align:middle line:84%
a voice to the world or
a princess of the people,

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:08.590 align:middle line:90%
as she became known?

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.010 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little bit about how
you understood that transition

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.840 align:middle line:84%
and what that
really meant to her.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.790 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Well, the
way of answering it

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.680 align:middle line:84%
is really looking
into the idea of,

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.265 align:middle line:84%
what is it to be an
empowered person today?

00:06:21.265 --> 00:06:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And more specifically,
what is it

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.950 align:middle line:90%
to be an empowered woman today?

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And she was surrounded by
some very extraordinary women

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.590 align:middle line:84%
who were remarkable in
their own capacities.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:31.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mentors.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.240 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Yeah.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.830 align:middle line:90%
Well, influencers, shall we say.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.440 align:middle line:84%
They were mentors,
sure, but influencers.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:41.840 align:middle line:84%
Because Diana was immensely
gracious and very yielding

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.780 align:middle line:84%
to the power of
significance and was

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:48.260 align:middle line:84%
a really great appreciator
of heritage and tradition.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.880 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
she was an observer--

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:51.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.090 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: --of that state.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, she knew that
she had a unique destiny.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.730 align:middle line:84%
She didn't quite know
how to fulfill it.

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:01.760 align:middle line:84%
It was something that
organically tumbled out

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.490 align:middle line:84%
of her, so to speak,
or her responses

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.030 align:middle line:90%
to certain social situations.

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:10.490 align:middle line:84%
For example, the
announcement, I am no longer--

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:13.100 align:middle line:84%
I can no longer really
be in a relationship--

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm paraphrasing-- but,
where there are three people.

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:16.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:16.940 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: I mean, this is--

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:17.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fair enough.

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:19.850 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: --woman of
the world, isn't it?

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And hey, she didn't lose
her head as a result,

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.050 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] which was very much a--

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Nice thing
about modern times.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:26.960 align:middle line:90%
Or end up in the tower.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.710 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: And I think
that's a joke that--

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:30.620 align:middle line:84%
or rather a statement
that Fergie made,

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.300 align:middle line:90%
that the Duchess of York made.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.010 align:middle line:84%
Because she'd also
experienced something

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:36.740 align:middle line:84%
very similar during the
time when she divorced

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:41.960 align:middle line:84%
Andrew, although their situation
was slightly more salacious,

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.710 align:middle line:84%
shall we say, which we're seeing
more and more now with Andrew.

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:49.370 align:middle line:84%
So Diana was extraordinarily
unique in this way,

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:53.780 align:middle line:84%
that she was highly impetuous
but responded instinctively

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:59.390 align:middle line:84%
to the action of the moment
and developed amazing strength

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:01.850 align:middle line:84%
and fiber out of each
moment of empowerment

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:02.810 align:middle line:90%
that she moved through.

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:04.518 align:middle line:84%
That didn't mean to
say that she wouldn't

00:08:04.518 --> 00:08:07.440 align:middle line:84%
go back to KP, Kensington
Palace, and weep for hours.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.273 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah,
I've read all the books.

00:08:09.273 --> 00:08:12.320 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: That was releasing
all of the uptight energy that

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.140 align:middle line:90%
was necessary.

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:16.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she was immensely
vital and honest

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.383 align:middle line:90%
about her feeling state.

00:08:17.383 --> 00:08:19.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She wasn't
a repressed person,

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:22.910 align:middle line:84%
which was really required of
the old members of the monarchy.

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:24.800 align:middle line:84%
And even today, you
still see it today.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.250 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Yeah.

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:26.555 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even with
the young ones today.

00:08:26.555 --> 00:08:26.810 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Yes.

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:29.810 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking, it's interesting
being in these situations,

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:32.510 align:middle line:84%
reviewing the story
that I've told

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:35.150 align:middle line:84%
so much over the years
of printing this book,

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:36.260 align:middle line:90%
publishing this book.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.390 align:middle line:84%
And how I address
it with you, because

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:44.270 align:middle line:84%
of your unique perception of how
you see this particular vessel,

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:48.680 align:middle line:84%
this woman moving forward as
the person that she was and more

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.270 align:middle line:90%
perhaps in her legacy.

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:53.120 align:middle line:84%
She was really rewriting
that whole scenario,

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.310 align:middle line:84%
where, evidently,
something needed

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:58.580 align:middle line:84%
to take place within the
establishment of the British

00:08:58.580 --> 00:08:59.540 align:middle line:90%
Royal Family.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:02.120 align:middle line:84%
It's just that if
you're living inside it,

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.040 align:middle line:90%
why does this need to change?

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.830 align:middle line:84%
Because it's an
extraordinary enclave.

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:08.090 align:middle line:90%
It seems fine.

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:11.250 align:middle line:84%
As far as we are concerned, we
look at behaviors and we say,

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:13.380 align:middle line:84%
well, maybe that wasn't
quite as appropriate.

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:14.180 align:middle line:90%
I don't mean now.

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
25, 30 years ago.

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:16.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.108 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: And she came
along and thought,

00:09:18.108 --> 00:09:19.910 align:middle line:90%
well, I can't live this way.

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:22.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm really going to find
the honesty and the grace

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:24.260 align:middle line:90%
to bring about change.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.635 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because the others
went through their divorces.

00:09:26.635 --> 00:09:29.030 align:middle line:90%
This was not uncommon.

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:30.530 align:middle line:84%
Elizabeth had
other children that

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:31.882 align:middle line:90%
were divorced before Charles.

00:09:31.882 --> 00:09:33.090 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: That was the thing.

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:35.310 align:middle line:84%
This was the huge
revolution that took place.

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:36.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:38.870 align:middle line:84%
Her children, most of
them were divorced.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:39.710 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Yeah.

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:42.560 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And the heir to the
throne, of course, Charles,

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.870 align:middle line:10%
received the majority
of the attention

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:47.610 align:middle line:10%
in that way because
of the third party,

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:49.610 align:middle line:10%
which was known
from the beginning.

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:52.400 align:middle line:84%
Since he was a kid, he'd been
in love with Camilla, right?

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.620 align:middle line:84%
And so the overriding
of the heart,

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:57.530 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what's
happened throughout

00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:59.750 align:middle line:90%
these obliged marriages.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And so Diana simply came out
and talked about it and said,

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:04.367 align:middle line:84%
this is what it feels
like from my end,

00:10:04.367 --> 00:10:05.450 align:middle line:90%
of having to deal with it.

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:07.760 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Extraordinary
courage and honesty.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.050 align:middle line:84%
You know, that level
of transparency,

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:13.410 align:middle line:84%
which I feel that we can see
just by matter of context,

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:15.840 align:middle line:84%
we can see in the
behavior of her youngest.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.040 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Who obviously went
through two-and-a-half years

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.330 align:middle line:90%
of psychotherapy.

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:23.300 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, he was going to
lose the love of his life,

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:24.200 align:middle line:90%
meaning Meghan.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:24.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:26.113 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: And what
happens, of course,

00:10:26.113 --> 00:10:28.430 align:middle line:84%
when we go into that degree
of transparency or honesty

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:31.140 align:middle line:90%
is that we get really honest.

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:31.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:34.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, she was very honest and
she was honest with the press,

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:38.630 align:middle line:84%
and she lived her life
very openly after that.

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:40.815 align:middle line:84%
And we all know, we were
probably all-- if we were

00:10:40.815 --> 00:10:42.440 align:middle line:84%
alive at the time,
we all remember when

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.670 align:middle line:90%
we heard about Diana's death.

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:45.773 align:middle line:84%
And we were probably
glued to our televisions

00:10:45.773 --> 00:10:46.940 align:middle line:90%
for the days following that.

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:47.780 align:middle line:90%
I certainly was.

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:49.405 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Well, it
was huge, wasn't it?

00:10:49.405 --> 00:10:52.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was huge because so
much was brought to the table.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.590 align:middle line:90%
It was more than just her.

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:57.590 align:middle line:90%
And as if that weren't a lot.

00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:00.090 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Well, that's the point
of being an archetypal key,

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:00.890 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:02.930 align:middle line:84%
That this is a
human being that we

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:04.580 align:middle line:84%
may see as an
ordinary human being,

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:07.190 align:middle line:84%
because she had an immediacy
and an authenticity

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:11.300 align:middle line:84%
and an easy play about her the
way that she approached people.

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:14.060 align:middle line:84%
So she could walk into a
room and literally just suss

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:17.230 align:middle line:84%
out the room, really coordinate
herself through the room.

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:20.700 align:middle line:84%
Nothing was ever a
veneer or put on.

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.400 align:middle line:84%
She would just simply
go right into what

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.760 align:middle line:84%
was most necessary, how to
dispatch the exquisiteness

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.340 align:middle line:90%
of her energy.

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:32.250 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I keep coming back
to the theme of immediacy.

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:33.540 align:middle line:90%
That's the gift that she gave.

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:39.080 align:middle line:84%
Because every single person that
is aware of this human being,

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:41.940 align:middle line:84%
when she was either
alive or now dead,

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:44.590 align:middle line:84%
feels they have their
own personal story.

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:46.200 align:middle line:90%
It's really extraordinary.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.960 align:middle line:84%
I've discovered so much as a
result of publishing this book.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:53.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So many people have
put their stories on her.

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:57.150 align:middle line:84%
Because she was a modern day
princess out of a fairy tale.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:58.740 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't a fairy tale.

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's the time
that we're in now,

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:04.020 align:middle line:84%
is deconstructing what we
have put up as fairy tales.

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:05.730 align:middle line:90%
Taking people off of pedestals.

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:07.590 align:middle line:84%
That's really what
we're charged with doing

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:09.000 align:middle line:90%
at this time in history.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.840 align:middle line:84%
Nonetheless, so many
questions following this.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:17.160 align:middle line:84%
But one thing that happened
is in this community watching

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.140 align:middle line:84%
this, the Gaia
community, certainly many

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:21.720 align:middle line:84%
were privy to a lot
of conspiracy theories

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.380 align:middle line:84%
that were going
around at the time.

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And so let's just get
this one off the table.

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:29.190 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe that her
death was accidental,

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:30.570 align:middle line:90%
a result of paparazzi?

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:32.100 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe that
it was arranged?

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:33.510 align:middle line:90%
Just, this is your opinion.

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:35.940 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to speak
for anyone but yourself.

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.730 align:middle line:84%
Or do you believe that she
was killed in some way?

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:40.925 align:middle line:84%
Was this something
more ritualistic?

00:12:40.925 --> 00:12:43.050 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: I think it was
even more crude than that.

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:46.800 align:middle line:90%
I think she was got rid of.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.710 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not really
interested in that,

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:52.390 align:middle line:84%
to be honest, because it's
pretty obvious that that's

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:53.190 align:middle line:90%
what's happened.

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:53.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So she
was gotten rid of.

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: What I'm
interested in is

00:12:55.650 --> 00:13:00.812 align:middle line:84%
the effect that her death
had on billions and billions

00:13:00.812 --> 00:13:01.770 align:middle line:90%
and billions of people.

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:04.210 align:middle line:90%
And that I find extraordinary.

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:05.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:07.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was in the book,
and I posed the question.

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:08.900 align:middle line:84%
So I thought I needed
to ask you out loud.

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:10.090 align:middle line:90%
So we're done with that.

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:13.680 align:middle line:84%
So this is what I want to
get to, is one of the things

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.570 align:middle line:84%
that you-- well,
you've been coaching.

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:17.310 align:middle line:84%
You've been doing
voice coaching.

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:20.040 align:middle line:84%
You've been doing empowerment
coaching for many years

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:24.090 align:middle line:84%
now to a lot of
well-known people.

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:25.980 align:middle line:90%
You started in theater yourself.

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:28.590 align:middle line:84%
So when you were
working with Diana,

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:30.270 align:middle line:84%
let's start talking
about what you

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:32.520 align:middle line:84%
did to help her gain
her voice and what

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:36.180 align:middle line:84%
is the most critical
element for each one of us

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:40.050 align:middle line:84%
in finding our authentic
powerful voice.

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:42.240 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Well, we
each have our own note.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:47.013 align:middle line:84%
We each have a signature sound,
but most of us don't make it.

00:13:47.013 --> 00:13:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And so the big question
is, well, why is that?

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:53.310 align:middle line:84%
So we don't produce it
because we're moved away

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:55.350 align:middle line:84%
from the authenticity
of our beings,

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:58.050 align:middle line:84%
even though many
of our teachers,

00:13:58.050 --> 00:13:59.880 align:middle line:84%
or our guides, or
our mentors, as we

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.500 align:middle line:84%
go through the
educational process,

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:04.650 align:middle line:84%
would say that they're nudging
us towards our authenticity.

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:07.260 align:middle line:84%
What I believe is happening
is they're really nudging us

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:11.310 align:middle line:84%
towards being able to
inhabit the system, which

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:13.825 align:middle line:90%
for me is pure cerebralization.

00:14:13.825 --> 00:14:15.450 align:middle line:84%
(LOUDER TONE) And so
what we tend to do

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:17.430 align:middle line:84%
is live in the upper
part of our bodies.

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:19.282 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, our
voices are like this.

00:14:19.282 --> 00:14:21.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You sound like
every parliamentarian.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.040 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Indeed.

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.605 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, this
is the sound that

00:14:23.605 --> 00:14:25.230 align:middle line:84%
is spreading through
the Western world.

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:25.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.095 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: But it's not in
touch with my note, do you see?

00:14:28.095 --> 00:14:31.510 align:middle line:84%
As soon as I go here into the
fullness of who I am all about.

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And if I can just extrapolate
for a second, what

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:35.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean by our note
is that there's

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:39.480 align:middle line:84%
a sound at the very core of
the vocal compass in our bodies

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:42.780 align:middle line:84%
right at the very core of our
being that if we express it,

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:46.210 align:middle line:84%
it automatically expresses the
whole substance of who we are.

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:47.385 align:middle line:90%
It is the song of our soul.

00:14:47.385 --> 00:14:48.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Our note.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.375 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: And I
call it our note.

00:14:49.375 --> 00:14:51.360 align:middle line:84%
But actually, to
say it's a note--

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.880 align:middle line:84%
because a note means a
frequency or a pitch--

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:57.150 align:middle line:84%
it's actually supported by
a field of resonance, which

00:14:57.150 --> 00:15:01.110 align:middle line:84%
allows it to feel as though
if I speak through here,

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:03.150 align:middle line:84%
through my heart,
which is my note,

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:05.435 align:middle line:84%
the words arise from the
heart, they enter the heart.

00:15:05.435 --> 00:15:07.560 align:middle line:84%
(LOUDER TONE) If words
arise from the tongue alone,

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:09.100 align:middle line:90%
they don't pass beyond the ears.

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:10.350 align:middle line:90%
You can see the significance--

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:10.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That hurts.

00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:11.610 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: --that it has.

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:12.485 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That hurts.

00:15:12.485 --> 00:15:14.580 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] I'm shocked
at how many people's

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:16.190 align:middle line:90%
voices hurt my ears now.

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:17.940 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Well, we've
all been conditioned

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:19.750 align:middle line:90%
by an educational process.

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:22.020 align:middle line:84%
We've all been socialized
in a certain way.

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:24.510 align:middle line:84%
So that we've
literally become, dare

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:27.540 align:middle line:84%
I say, automaton about
the way that we use sound.

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:33.360 align:middle line:84%
Our voices are no longer used
as indexes for our character.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's a quote directly
from Benjamin Disraeli.

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:38.400 align:middle line:84%
If we go back into our
history, our voices

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:41.580 align:middle line:84%
were right at the very core of
the substance of who we were.

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.980 align:middle line:84%
That's the meaning of
the word "persona."

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:46.200 align:middle line:90%
Persona means through sound.

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:49.650 align:middle line:84%
So somebody's absolute
integrity or quality

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:52.080 align:middle line:84%
was literally resonated
through their sound.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:54.850 align:middle line:84%
So the Romans and the
Greeks worked on it.

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:56.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when
they've looked at studies

00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:59.340 align:middle line:84%
of people and their
comfort or discomfort

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:02.340 align:middle line:84%
with others, whether
it's societal,

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:07.560 align:middle line:84%
racial, class, et cetera, the
one thing that binds people

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.510 align:middle line:84%
and that allows
people to trust one

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:13.680 align:middle line:84%
another more than color of
skin, more than social status,

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:14.970 align:middle line:90%
is their speech.

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:18.510 align:middle line:84%
If they hear a voice
that resonates with them,

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:21.278 align:middle line:84%
they can go into a state
of relaxation and trust,

00:16:21.278 --> 00:16:23.070 align:middle line:84%
even if the person is
very, very different.

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:24.760 align:middle line:90%
Above all things, it's voice.

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:25.560 align:middle line:90%
It's speech.

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.602 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Well, sound is
at the core of creation.

00:16:27.602 --> 00:16:28.470 align:middle line:90%
We all know this.

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:31.230 align:middle line:84%
Whether we're a so-called
civilized-- living

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:34.397 align:middle line:84%
in civilized societies, or
as an Indigenous people,

00:16:34.397 --> 00:16:35.730 align:middle line:90%
sound is right at the very core.

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:38.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you have to
have the sound that is--

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:40.440 align:middle line:84%
in the sense of what
I was talking about,

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.880 align:middle line:84%
the sound that is
familiar to you,

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:44.880 align:middle line:84%
regardless of all
other circumstances,

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.960 align:middle line:84%
is the person that
you will most trust.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:50.342 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Familiar to us,
meaning we have to fit in.

00:16:50.342 --> 00:16:51.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:52.800 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: And so the
majority of people--

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.508 align:middle line:84%
this is really what
we're talking about--

00:16:54.508 --> 00:16:56.590 align:middle line:84%
this field of resonance
that's been created,

00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:59.310 align:middle line:84%
which has shifted
really since the--

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:01.560 align:middle line:84%
well, let's say the beginning
of the 20th century,

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:04.980 align:middle line:84%
but has certainly shifted since
the end of the Second Great

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:06.582 align:middle line:90%
War of the World.

00:17:06.582 --> 00:17:08.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's a woman
named Monty Williams.

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:09.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've
ever heard of her.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:12.079 align:middle line:84%
But what she does is--
and you know other people

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:13.490 align:middle line:90%
who do voice analysis.

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And they go through,
and it shows

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:18.530 align:middle line:84%
you a graph of the notes that
are prominent and missing

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:20.010 align:middle line:90%
in your voice.

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:23.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, one thought is we
should have all aspects,

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:25.520 align:middle line:90%
the entire range in our voice.

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:26.869 align:middle line:90%
But is that even true?

00:17:26.869 --> 00:17:28.310 align:middle line:84%
Are there people
where you simply

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:31.220 align:middle line:84%
resonate in these few areas,
and that is your full voice,

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:33.110 align:middle line:84%
or are we all missing
pieces of ourselves?

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:35.443 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Well, if we are
really sounding from our note,

00:17:35.443 --> 00:17:38.000 align:middle line:84%
we're sounding from the
very center of our compass.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.140 align:middle line:90%
We're in harmony.

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:41.900 align:middle line:84%
So if we're in harmony, it
means that we have access

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:44.120 align:middle line:84%
to every single
part of our range,

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:45.770 align:middle line:84%
to every single
part of our being.

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:48.062 align:middle line:84%
(HIGHER PITCHED TONE) But if
we're just living in here,

00:17:48.062 --> 00:17:49.775 align:middle line:84%
then all we do is
resonate this way--

00:17:49.775 --> 00:17:51.275 align:middle line:84%
(NORMAL VOICE)
--rather than going--

00:17:51.275 --> 00:17:52.085 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're hurting my--

00:17:52.085 --> 00:17:53.910 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: --through the
whole of our bodies.

00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:54.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:56.527 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: So this is the voice
of the emotional resonance.

00:17:56.527 --> 00:17:59.990 align:middle line:84%
This is the voice, I believe,
of the persona, which literally

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:03.660 align:middle line:84%
means through sound, that we
use in relation to personality,

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:05.510 align:middle line:84%
which is the word that
we use to describe

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:07.298 align:middle line:84%
the very quality of
somebody's being.

00:18:07.298 --> 00:18:09.590 align:middle line:84%
Actually what we're doing is
talking about their sound.

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:11.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about sound today.

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.190 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to get
into some of what you teach.

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:17.750 align:middle line:84%
So we can find a takeaway
in this-- everybody

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:20.150 align:middle line:90%
can find their takeaway.

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:23.100 align:middle line:84%
Listening to voices
today is very painful.

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:24.410 align:middle line:90%
Even news anchors.

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:28.070 align:middle line:84%
It used to be you had to have
a resonant, smooth, beautiful

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:31.760 align:middle line:84%
voice, male or female, in
order to be a news anchor,

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.630 align:middle line:84%
whether it's in England,
Germany, France,

00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:34.490 align:middle line:90%
the United States.

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:36.200 align:middle line:84%
Now we're hearing a
lot of what you just

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.960 align:middle line:84%
did, those parliamentarian
types of very

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:42.200 align:middle line:90%
nasally, tight, tight voices.

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:45.170 align:middle line:84%
They almost have an edge that
sounds a little mean to them,

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:46.380 align:middle line:90%
they're so tight.

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:49.700 align:middle line:84%
What is going on with
that particular phenomena

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:51.680 align:middle line:90%
in both men and women?

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:53.390 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Well, it's
produced by a state

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:56.840 align:middle line:84%
of supreme physical
tension, number one.

00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:02.690 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, it's a voice that
has, for the individual, a ring

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:03.695 align:middle line:90%
of authority.

00:19:03.695 --> 00:19:05.070 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
only living here.

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:06.290 align:middle line:84%
They don't have
to live down here.

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:07.760 align:middle line:84%
They don't have
to feel something.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.177 align:middle line:84%
(HIGHER PITCHED
TONE) They're just

00:19:09.177 --> 00:19:11.870 align:middle line:84%
living in the pixelation
of opinionation

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:13.453 align:middle line:84%
and arguing about
their own opinions--

00:19:13.453 --> 00:19:15.828 align:middle line:84%
(NORMAL VOICE) --rather than
moving into this area, where

00:19:15.828 --> 00:19:17.220 align:middle line:90%
we start to experience value.

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:18.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So
there's no breathing

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:19.010 align:middle line:90%
that's happening between here.

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:20.150 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Well, I mean, the
first thing that happens

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:22.380 align:middle line:84%
is that you squidge
the back of the tongue.

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:23.180 align:middle line:90%
This is my tongue.

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:23.810 align:middle line:90%
So you squidge it--

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:25.935 align:middle line:84%
(NASALLY VOICE) --right up
against the soft palate.

00:19:25.935 --> 00:19:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And so all you do is
produce nasality down

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:30.890 align:middle line:90%
through the nasal passages.

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:34.250 align:middle line:84%
And so, in turn, I feel a
characterization coming on,

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:35.180 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:36.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]
You're doing it well.

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.050 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: But if I drop
the back of my tongue,

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:40.430 align:middle line:90%
the whole of my throat opens.

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:42.950 align:middle line:84%
And the resonance opens
through the whole of my being.

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:44.780 align:middle line:90%
The channel of the voice opens.

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:46.850 align:middle line:84%
But it comes through
supreme tension.

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:49.880 align:middle line:84%
Most of us are running
around scared all the time.

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that the people
that you're speaking about,

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:54.180 align:middle line:84%
who are, at the
moment, for example,

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:57.650 align:middle line:84%
in this great nation, who
are leading mass media

00:19:57.650 --> 00:20:00.050 align:middle line:84%
communications, that
there's a tremendous amount

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:03.800 align:middle line:84%
of competition within their
own status to stay there

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:07.220 align:middle line:84%
as anchor people, to
bring whatever news they

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:08.280 align:middle line:90%
wish to bring forth.

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:10.020 align:middle line:84%
And then that begins
a huge thesis.

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:10.820 align:middle line:90%
A--

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:11.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, well--

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:12.170 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: --whole substance of--

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:12.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:14.630 align:middle line:84%
First of all, just
for the women alone

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:18.440 align:middle line:84%
to remain a size two to
six in your cocktail dress

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.580 align:middle line:90%
for news time.

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:24.800 align:middle line:84%
The competition between them and
for those positions, of course,

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:25.710 align:middle line:90%
is terrifying.

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:26.510 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Yeah.

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:29.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so you're
saying the fear is causing--

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:31.410 align:middle line:90%
first of all, they're mental.

00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:32.550 align:middle line:90%
They're in fear.

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:36.500 align:middle line:84%
This causes a pressure
at the top of the palate,

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.030 align:middle line:84%
right, with the
tongue moving back.

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:39.650 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: (NASALLY TONE) It's
about controlling, you see?

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:40.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you're not moving.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:41.570 align:middle line:90%
They're not breathing.

00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:42.920 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: (NASALLY TONE)
There's no oscillation.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:44.150 align:middle line:90%
There's no versatility.

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:45.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm just stuck.

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:47.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm controlling, I'm
controlling, because actually,

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.350 align:middle line:84%
deep inside, I'm
really frightened.

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:50.975 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did you
ever speak like that?

00:20:50.975 --> 00:20:51.775 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Never.

00:20:51.775 --> 00:20:52.640 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:53.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Never, he says.

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:54.990 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: But it's to do
with a state of mind--

00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:55.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:56.750 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: --and a state
of being, do you see?

00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:58.730 align:middle line:10%
Because I believe that
what we're talking about

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:01.580 align:middle line:10%
is a sound that we
have deep within us,

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:03.890 align:middle line:10%
that we remember
from our childhood,

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:07.070 align:middle line:10%
that we were influenced by
during our childhood, which

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:10.050 align:middle line:10%
I refer to as being the
metaphoric consciousness.

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:11.930 align:middle line:84%
If we go back and
we listen to JFK,

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:14.780 align:middle line:84%
if we listen to Bobby Kennedy,
if we listen to Martin Luther

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:16.700 align:middle line:84%
King, just to mention
three great speakers,

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:19.460 align:middle line:84%
you hear them speaking
through the essence

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:22.250 align:middle line:84%
of poetry, which is the
metaphoric condition

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:23.180 align:middle line:90%
of our consciousness.

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:26.160 align:middle line:84%
(NASALLY TONE) As opposed
to being purely mechanistic.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:26.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.610 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: I sat on
a plane yesterday

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:31.160 align:middle line:84%
to arrive here, to be
with you, and the plane

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:32.840 align:middle line:90%
was delayed for some time.

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And I watched, I
think, 300 people

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:36.825 align:middle line:90%
spending all of their journey--

00:21:36.825 --> 00:21:39.200 align:middle line:84%
and we were delayed by an
hour-and-a-half on the tarmac--

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.580 align:middle line:84%
simply on their cell phones,
scrolling, scrolling,

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:42.380 align:middle line:90%
scrolling.

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:43.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:46.010 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: I mean, this level of
pixelation is so destructive.

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:49.520 align:middle line:84%
I had a huge
headache as a result

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:52.293 align:middle line:84%
of all of that negative
ionization taking place.

00:21:52.293 --> 00:21:54.710 align:middle line:84%
(NASALLY TONE) So if that's
happening, then you're caught,

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:55.640 align:middle line:90%
aren't you?

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:58.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you have Diana,
who has a pretty young voice.

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:01.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to begin, she had a
pretty little voice, a girl

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:05.540 align:middle line:84%
voice, that developed into a
rounder, more resonant, more

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:06.380 align:middle line:90%
full voice.

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:07.930 align:middle line:84%
You have her
husband, Charles, who

00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:11.170 align:middle line:84%
never had anything but a full
voice, a full resonant voice.

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:14.380 align:middle line:84%
It's like he was groomed
for that from birth, right?

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And so, he was able
to possess that.

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:20.320 align:middle line:84%
She had to learn it because
she wasn't born into it.

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:21.940 align:middle line:90%
And yet, OK, the Queen.

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:24.517 align:middle line:84%
The Queen has quite
a tiny little voice,

00:22:24.517 --> 00:22:25.600 align:middle line:90%
like, a little girl voice.

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.700 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: If you hear
her when she was a child,

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:30.040 align:middle line:84%
everybody said that the
queen thanked everybody

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:32.590 align:middle line:84%
from the bottom of the heart
on the top of her voice.

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:34.265 align:middle line:84%
And now, she tends
to thank everybody

00:22:34.265 --> 00:22:36.640 align:middle line:84%
from the bottom of the heart
and the bottom of her voice.

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:38.760 align:middle line:84%
Maturity does change
us, physiologically.

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:39.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:40.750 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Our bodies
change, of course.

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:41.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:44.380 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: But the point about
Diana was that she used a very

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:45.190 align:middle line:90%
breathy voice--

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:45.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, it
was very breathy.

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:46.467 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: --like this.

00:22:46.467 --> 00:22:48.640 align:middle line:84%
And so, that didn't give
her a sense of gravity,

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:51.640 align:middle line:84%
or a sense of center,
or a sense of wholeness,

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:52.990 align:middle line:90%
or sense of being grounded.

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:55.520 align:middle line:84%
And what I did was to
initially work on the breath

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:58.450 align:middle line:84%
so that she could actually feel
herself sitting in her breath--

00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:00.340 align:middle line:84%
(HIGH-PITCHED TONE) --rather
than riding above the breath.

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:01.540 align:middle line:90%
I mustn't breathe too much.

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:03.220 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, probably,
they will discover

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:04.990 align:middle line:90%
who I am, et cetera, et cetera.

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:06.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
besides doing scales--

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:09.550 align:middle line:90%
mi, mi, mi, you, you, you--

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:12.670 align:middle line:84%
besides that, what are some of
the techniques people listening

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:16.160 align:middle line:84%
to this, who say, jeez,
I could do better.

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.010 align:middle line:84%
I've heard myself in
a recording recently.

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:18.970 align:middle line:90%
I didn't like it.

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:22.040 align:middle line:84%
What are some things we can
do to start taking on our more

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:22.840 align:middle line:90%
authentic voice?

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:25.160 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: That's such a
complex question to answer

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:25.680 align:middle line:90%
because we're all--

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know, you've
written a whole book on it.

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:28.480 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: --different
and myriad.

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:29.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:32.470 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: The key that I'm
really presenting is this idea

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:36.220 align:middle line:84%
of, how can I open up
the whole of the vessel

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:38.380 align:middle line:84%
of my voice, the whole
attunement of my voice?

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing is to
concentrate on the breath

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:44.080 align:middle line:84%
and release this stricture
in the back of the tongue.

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.730 align:middle line:90%
OK, so how do we do this?

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:49.140 align:middle line:90%
[VOCALIZING]

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:49.940 align:middle line:90%
One is tight.

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:50.440 align:middle line:90%
One is free.

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:51.240 align:middle line:90%
All I'm doing is--

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:55.090 align:middle line:90%
[VOCALIZING]

00:23:55.090 --> 00:23:57.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, if I carry on
talking to you like this,

00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:00.260 align:middle line:84%
you're going to feel very
soothed, very easy, very

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:01.060 align:middle line:90%
harmonious.

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:03.100 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be drawn
into the conversation.

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:04.780 align:middle line:84%
This is the voice
that I've actually

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:08.020 align:middle line:84%
encouraged great actors to
use over the last 40 years,

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:09.880 align:middle line:84%
and it's called
the magnetic voice,

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:13.840 align:middle line:84%
which is crucial for
great actors to entrain.

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:16.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking more about
being on stage and on camera

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:18.370 align:middle line:84%
because something
slightly different

00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:20.710 align:middle line:84%
as being used on camera
because the microphone is

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:22.150 align:middle line:90%
right here right.

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:25.990 align:middle line:84%
But on stage, how do I
literally entrain, how do I

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:31.270 align:middle line:84%
embrace 2,000 people who
listen to me in this moment

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:34.510 align:middle line:84%
so that I don't see anybody
moving, that they're literally

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:37.820 align:middle line:84%
spellbound by the magic of
what my characterisation is all

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:38.620 align:middle line:90%
about?

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:40.960 align:middle line:84%
What sound will do
is to create that.

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.970 align:middle line:84%
That's the leading
aspect of my profession.

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:44.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very few people--

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:47.230 align:middle line:84%
when you run into the
average person on the street,

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:51.010 align:middle line:84%
very few people speak with a
resonant or commanding voice

00:24:51.010 --> 00:24:52.660 align:middle line:90%
at all in the world right now.

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:55.170 align:middle line:90%


00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:57.630 align:middle line:84%
In times past, you had
to learn some of that.

00:24:57.630 --> 00:25:01.590 align:middle line:84%
Even to be a salesman, you were
taught some of these traits,

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:04.090 align:middle line:84%
in the '50s, and
'60s, and so forth.

00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:08.140 align:middle line:84%
But now, it's as though
the voice doesn't even

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:09.550 align:middle line:90%
matter anymore.

00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:11.220 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Absolutely.

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:12.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:13.190 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Absolutely.

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:14.990 align:middle line:84%
And so, I'm doing
something about that.

00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:18.480 align:middle line:84%
Because, obviously, the voice
does-- the voice of change,

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:19.700 align:middle line:90%
which is what my project is--

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:22.190 align:middle line:84%
Diana, the voice of
change-- the voice of change

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:25.910 align:middle line:84%
is that we can no longer
go on in this careering

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:30.650 align:middle line:84%
fashion with our output,
with the fascination

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:32.780 align:middle line:84%
of whatever assignment
we're involved in,

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:35.108 align:middle line:84%
that there's something
crucial that needs to shift.

00:25:35.108 --> 00:25:36.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Isn't
there a fear, though,

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:40.070 align:middle line:84%
that we're afraid of actually
positioning ourselves

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:42.880 align:middle line:90%
as standing in our power?

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:45.640 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Yes, of course,
that's what I'm talking about.

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:48.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, there's
just a fear of being seen.

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:52.060 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: What we need
to do is to look into--

00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:54.370 align:middle line:84%
because there are
visionaries in our midst.

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:56.680 align:middle line:84%
There are inspirational
people in our midst,

00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:00.340 align:middle line:84%
particularly in this great
nation, both women and men,

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:01.780 align:middle line:90%
who are informing us.

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:04.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all we have to do is
look at-- in the mind, body,

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:07.660 align:middle line:84%
spirit community, Marianne
Williamson, or indeed,

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:09.310 align:middle line:90%
at Oprah.

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:10.690 align:middle line:90%
That's just to mention two.

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:13.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, forgive me all the
other extraordinary people

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:17.350 align:middle line:84%
that I could flash through
in the diary of my mind,

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:19.030 align:middle line:90%
in the chronicle of my mind.

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:22.850 align:middle line:84%
They're actually indicating
a new way of being.

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of
that, we're beginning

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.970 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that I
need to understand

00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:32.140 align:middle line:84%
how I can become the powerful
person that I wish to be.

00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:33.230 align:middle line:90%
How do I do this?

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:35.200 align:middle line:90%
I don't mean become a celebrity.

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how do I actually
gain my own power.

00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:40.220 align:middle line:84%
That's the core of
the work that I do.

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:42.262 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to
get to that in a moment.

00:26:42.262 --> 00:26:45.050 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about manipulation
of what we've become first.

00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:47.860 align:middle line:84%
So there's a certain
cadence of manipulation,

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:51.410 align:middle line:84%
and this is known by virtually
every reverend pastor

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:52.210 align:middle line:90%
and priest.

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:55.960 align:middle line:84%
There's a cadence,
a coupling of words,

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.970 align:middle line:84%
and the way the words
drop off and have

00:26:57.970 --> 00:27:01.420 align:middle line:84%
a finality at a certain
point that is very hypnotic.

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:03.160 align:middle line:90%
Politicians use it.

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:05.570 align:middle line:90%
Priests use these words as well.

00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:08.170 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes, professors
use the same cadence.

00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:12.868 align:middle line:84%
And it does manipulate a person
into almost a hypnotic trance.

00:27:12.868 --> 00:27:14.410 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk a little
bit about that?

00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:17.080 align:middle line:84%
Because, oftentimes, we fall
under the sway of these people.

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:20.370 align:middle line:90%


00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:22.290 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Well,
it really ties in

00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:24.900 align:middle line:84%
or is a parallel with
what I was saying earlier

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:32.010 align:middle line:84%
on about the fact that we
assume a vocal delivery

00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:34.710 align:middle line:84%
by the influence
of the individuals

00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:37.868 align:middle line:84%
that we see as being powerful
because we don't feel powerful.

00:27:37.868 --> 00:27:39.660 align:middle line:84%
We want to be part of
that, whether they're

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:42.480 align:middle line:84%
leading politician, or a leading
states person, or a leading

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.910 align:middle line:84%
churchman, or a leading
corporate identity,

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:48.087 align:middle line:84%
or a leading teacher, we feel
that we want to be like that.

00:27:48.087 --> 00:27:49.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what is
it they're doing that--

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.747 align:middle line:90%
[VOCALIZING]

00:27:51.747 --> 00:27:53.580 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Oh, you're
talking about something

00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:54.180 align:middle line:90%
slightly different.

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:54.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, the cadence.

00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:56.430 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: You're talking
about a falling inflection.

00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:56.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:56.910 --> 00:27:57.780 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: The
falling inflection.

00:27:57.780 --> 00:27:58.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:59.580 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: OK, the
falling inflection

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:01.140 align:middle line:84%
has come about
because we're being

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:04.938 align:middle line:84%
encouraged to think and speak
in really short sentences.

00:28:04.938 --> 00:28:07.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so give us an
example of what that sounds

00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:08.290 align:middle line:90%
like so people--

00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:10.770 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: OK, so
the short sentence

00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:12.270 align:middle line:90%
doesn't allow us to breathe.

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:15.660 align:middle line:84%
Because we, human beings,
whatever language we speak,

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:18.450 align:middle line:84%
we always have enough breath
for the thought that we speak,

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:21.090 align:middle line:84%
which is fundamental
to the actor, OK?

00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:24.730 align:middle line:84%
So you will take contemporary
text of today, and what we hear

00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:25.530 align:middle line:90%
is--

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:28.356 align:middle line:90%
[VOCALIZING]

00:28:28.356 --> 00:28:30.360 align:middle line:84%
--because the
sentences are so short.

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.010 align:middle line:84%
But if you do that
with Shakespeare,

00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:33.600 align:middle line:90%
I mean, for example--

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:36.300 align:middle line:84%
I say Shakespeare simply
because we go back 400 years,

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:39.720 align:middle line:84%
we suddenly begin to realize
that the writers were

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:41.670 align:middle line:84%
writing in much longer
thoughts than the ones

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:42.840 align:middle line:90%
that we use today.

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:45.090 align:middle line:84%
If we go just to the
end of the 19th century,

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:46.800 align:middle line:84%
we realize that
Dickens' sentences

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:48.510 align:middle line:90%
are sometimes paragraphs-long.

00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:51.580 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, today, we think
in this pixelated form.

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:53.560 align:middle line:90%
So our breath is being affected.

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:55.440 align:middle line:84%
I had a young actor
with me the other day,

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:57.120 align:middle line:90%
who's learning "Henry V."

00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "OK, well, we won't
work on a speech of Henry's,

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:01.830 align:middle line:90%
but let's work on a prologue."

00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "Thus,
with imagined wing,

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.610 align:middle line:90%
our swift scene flies.

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:05.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is what
I'm talking about.

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:07.260 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: --in motion
of no less celerity."

00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:08.240 align:middle line:90%
So I said, how does that feel?

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:09.220 align:middle line:90%
And he said, awful.

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:10.182 align:middle line:90%
So I said, OK.

00:29:10.182 --> 00:29:11.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, look, what I
want you to do is

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:13.900 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that the
thought begins there,

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:14.940 align:middle line:90%
and it ends there.

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:17.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, just breathe and speak
all the way to the end.

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "Thus,
with imagined wing,

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:22.560 align:middle line:84%
our swift scene flies
in motion of no less

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.180 align:middle line:90%
celerity than that of thought."

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:25.780 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my God, that makes sense.

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:26.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:27.997 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: So you
see, it's led him

00:29:27.997 --> 00:29:30.750 align:middle line:84%
to the conviction of his
own authenticity as opposed

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:32.910 align:middle line:90%
to using a rhythm.

00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:37.410 align:middle line:84%
Because in journalists or
in media communications,

00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:39.450 align:middle line:84%
no, you mustn't
use polysyllables.

00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:40.860 align:middle line:90%
You mustn't use superlatives.

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:42.570 align:middle line:84%
You have to write
just four words,

00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:43.860 align:middle line:90%
and that's your sentence.

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:45.340 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's crazy.

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:46.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And I have even found
myself that we're

00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:53.520 align:middle line:84%
so used to speaking in such
brief sentences anymore.

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Everything's been reduced
to something so simple.

00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:58.440 align:middle line:84%
I'll find that if I'm
trying to articulate

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:00.840 align:middle line:84%
a difficult or
complex thought, I'll

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:03.495 align:middle line:84%
start running out of breath
by the end of the sentence.

00:30:03.495 --> 00:30:04.500 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Indeed.

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:06.900 align:middle line:84%
So we're all becoming
immensely stressed

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:09.000 align:middle line:84%
as a result of not
having the breath.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.670 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, our
bodies are becoming

00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:14.190 align:middle line:90%
injured and full of disharmony.

00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:16.060 align:middle line:90%
So no wonder we're in dis-ease.

00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:16.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:20.040 align:middle line:84%
So now, going back to
Diana, working with Diana--

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:21.690 align:middle line:90%
and not just Diana--

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:25.990 align:middle line:84%
you do workshops around
the world for people,

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:27.900 align:middle line:84%
whether they're on
stage or whether they're

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:31.890 align:middle line:84%
in a more of maybe a
corporate capacity or whatnot,

00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:34.320 align:middle line:84%
to be able to bring
themselves to the table.

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:36.990 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about what
that course looks like.

00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:39.457 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's
just people, people

00:30:39.457 --> 00:30:41.790 align:middle line:84%
that have a little money that
want to come across better

00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:43.500 align:middle line:90%
within society.

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:46.900 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: I work through a whole
cross-section of our world.

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:47.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:50.840 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: So it can be
with a states person.

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:53.100 align:middle line:84%
It can be with a
member of royalty.

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:54.400 align:middle line:90%
It can be with a priest.

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.950 align:middle line:84%
It can be-- it can
be with a teacher.

00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:58.230 align:middle line:84%
I just worked with one of
the world's leading quantum

00:30:58.230 --> 00:30:58.860 align:middle line:90%
physicists.

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:00.235 align:middle line:84%
Nobody was going
to his lectures.

00:31:00.235 --> 00:31:01.680 align:middle line:84%
Everything was
online, and nobody

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:02.763 align:middle line:90%
was going to his lectures.

00:31:02.763 --> 00:31:04.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tell us about that.

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:05.120 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:05.968 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:31:05.968 --> 00:31:08.010 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: So somebody
said, you should go and see

00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:08.810 align:middle line:90%
Stewart Pearce.

00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And so, my PA said, by the
way, one of the world's leading

00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:12.130 align:middle line:90%
quantum physicist.

00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:13.020 align:middle line:90%
And I said, why?

00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:14.157 align:middle line:90%
Why is he coming to me?

00:31:14.157 --> 00:31:15.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No one will
understand him anyway.

00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:17.740 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Because--
my PA, who is amazing,

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:19.950 align:middle line:84%
said, because you're
the maestro, Stewart.

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:22.740 align:middle line:84%
You'll be able to work magic
with this gentleman, who

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:28.860 align:middle line:84%
arrived, and he was speaking
in a completely monodimensional

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:30.510 align:middle line:90%
way.

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:33.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everything was
really flat, like this,

00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:36.030 align:middle line:84%
and really, there
wasn't any inflection,

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:38.560 align:middle line:84%
so you weren't compelled
to listen whatsoever.

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:39.720 align:middle line:90%
It was deeply boring.

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:42.000 align:middle line:84%
But also, the whole
of that statement

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.562 align:middle line:90%
arose from his physical body.

00:31:43.562 --> 00:31:46.020 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, OK, well, I'm
going to approach it like this.

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:48.700 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Well, you're one
of the world's leading quantum

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:49.500 align:middle line:90%
physicists.

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:51.610 align:middle line:90%
Where did it all begin?"

00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And he's, "What do you
mean where did it begin?"

00:31:53.610 --> 00:31:55.400 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Well,
what enticed you?

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:56.210 align:middle line:90%
What invoked you?

00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:58.220 align:middle line:90%
What inspired you?"

00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:00.510 align:middle line:90%
And he said, "Well."

00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:01.910 align:middle line:90%
And then, he told me the story.

00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:05.150 align:middle line:84%
And the story was
extraordinary, immaculate.

00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:06.650 align:middle line:90%
He was seven years of age.

00:32:06.650 --> 00:32:09.980 align:middle line:84%
His parents were leading
dons at Cambridge,

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:12.200 align:middle line:84%
and they were appointed
to Princeton here.

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:15.050 align:middle line:84%
So it meant uprooting the
family and coming over here,

00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:18.650 align:middle line:84%
so he lost all of his charms
because he was a single child

00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:20.360 align:middle line:90%
in this two-parent family.

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:22.170 align:middle line:84%
They moved into
this extraordinary,

00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:25.250 align:middle line:84%
it seemed, very Gothic house,
a clapboard house with one

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:29.060 align:middle line:84%
of those extraordinary, as
one sees in New England.

00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:31.430 align:middle line:84%
And his bedroom was
right at the top,

00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:35.210 align:middle line:84%
completely isolated,
socially disenfranchised.

00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:38.450 align:middle line:84%
He pushed his bed up
against the dormer window.

00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And at night, he would
lie and look at the stars.

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And one night, his father
saw a light under the door.

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:48.350 align:middle line:84%
Because we all know the torch
underneath the bed sheets

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:50.630 align:middle line:84%
so that you could read
and look at the stars.

00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And his father
came in, and rather

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:55.220 align:middle line:84%
than punishing his child,
he, the following day,

00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:56.630 align:middle line:90%
brought him a telescope.

00:32:56.630 --> 00:33:00.290 align:middle line:84%
So he became absolutely
invigorated by the stars.

00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:03.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, all the way through this
story, he became animated.

00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:05.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He was
using his voice.

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:07.880 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: He was suddenly
living this passion.

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:09.020 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "Well done.

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:10.520 align:middle line:90%
Look at the revelation."

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:12.208 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Oh, my God,
that was amazing."

00:33:12.208 --> 00:33:14.250 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Well, that's what
you need to be doing."

00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:15.710 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "But I
couldn't do that."

00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:16.510 align:middle line:90%
"Why?

00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:18.470 align:middle line:84%
Why," said I. "Well,
because I have

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:20.180 align:middle line:90%
to sound in a certain way."

00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:22.190 align:middle line:84%
So we're back to
the coder, you see,

00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:24.080 align:middle line:90%
and the coder does not work.

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:26.430 align:middle line:84%
The cerebralization
does not work.

00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:29.120 align:middle line:84%
We're beginning to see this
in all forms of leadership

00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:32.400 align:middle line:84%
because we don't believe in
what they're saying to us.

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:36.050 align:middle line:84%
And so the word authenticity
is like wildfire

00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:37.250 align:middle line:90%
through our world.

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:40.280 align:middle line:84%
It's just that we don't define,
well, what does that mean?

00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And what it really means
is, am I in my note?

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:44.442 align:middle line:90%
Am I really in my harmony?

00:33:44.442 --> 00:33:46.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It also means,
are you in your truth?

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:47.900 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Well, because
when we're in our note,

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:48.800 align:middle line:90%
you can't lie.

00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:49.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:53.090 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: You see, it comes from
that very core of who you are.

00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:54.512 align:middle line:90%
And this is what Diana wanted.

00:33:54.512 --> 00:33:55.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
is what you were

00:33:55.970 --> 00:33:59.060 align:middle line:84%
trying to help her with is just
express what's in your heart.

00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:00.140 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Absolutely.

00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:05.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so that can end up
being a very loaded situation,

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:07.550 align:middle line:84%
speaking from your
heart in situations

00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:09.951 align:middle line:84%
where you necessarily want
your heart known, right?

00:34:09.951 --> 00:34:11.659 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
everybody's running from.

00:34:11.659 --> 00:34:13.670 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Well, to
think of it in this way.

00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:17.270 align:middle line:84%
It's about how we elicit
individuals so that we

00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:18.710 align:middle line:90%
have harmonious relationships.

00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:20.570 align:middle line:90%
And we all want connection.

00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:24.949 align:middle line:84%
You know, Brene Brown-- the
great Brene Brown-- is talking

00:34:24.949 --> 00:34:27.260 align:middle line:84%
about this on major
stages in relation

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:29.659 align:middle line:84%
to vulnerability, and
authenticity, and immediacy,

00:34:29.659 --> 00:34:33.420 align:middle line:84%
and how we are socially
hardwired for connection.

00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:36.530 align:middle line:84%
So we're all dying
for this level.

00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:38.389 align:middle line:84%
I just helped a young
one in the hotel

00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:41.540 align:middle line:84%
where I was staying overnight,
because she brought me

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:42.860 align:middle line:90%
the most beautiful breakfast.

00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And she was looking
really unhappy.

00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:46.260 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "Are you OK?

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:47.060 align:middle line:90%
Good morning.

00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:47.860 align:middle line:90%
Are you OK?"

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:49.280 align:middle line:90%
Over my wonderful omelet.

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:51.139 align:middle line:90%
And she said, "No, I'm not.

00:34:51.139 --> 00:34:54.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm feeling really"-- so we have
this wonderful moment, where

00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:56.960 align:middle line:84%
she said, "Oh, my
God, who are you?

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:57.980 align:middle line:90%
This was amazing."

00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:00.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, we had this
moment of sharing,

00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:02.060 align:middle line:84%
very deep-- it was
transformative for her.

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:03.832 align:middle line:90%
She moved through catharsis.

00:35:03.832 --> 00:35:05.540 align:middle line:84%
Because nobody else
was listening to her.

00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:06.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did she go
from squeaky to heart?

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:08.600 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: She went
from squeaky into--

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:11.235 align:middle line:84%
and then she said,
"Can I do something?"

00:35:11.235 --> 00:35:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "What
are you going to do?"

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:13.800 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:15.560 align:middle line:90%
And she said, "Can I hug you?"

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:17.780 align:middle line:90%
So we moved from up into--

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:22.640 align:middle line:84%
and her heart was pumping
as I held her, you know?

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:24.098 align:middle line:90%
She became real.

00:35:24.098 --> 00:35:26.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this is the
journey of all of us right now

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:27.735 align:middle line:90%
in a time of extreme fear--

00:35:27.735 --> 00:35:28.610 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Absolutely.

00:35:28.610 --> 00:35:30.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and
polarization, like where

00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:36.980 align:middle line:84%
Diana was at the time, is
that we must find the courage

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:42.478 align:middle line:84%
to be able to simply take a
breath and tell our truth,

00:35:42.478 --> 00:35:43.770 align:middle line:90%
speak our truth from our heart.

00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:46.020 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Particularly
post-COVID, which was all about

00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:49.490 align:middle line:84%
don't breathe because you might
become sick or COVID itself.

00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:51.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the horror
of COVID, of course,

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:55.280 align:middle line:84%
affected our respiration in
the most extraordinary way.

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:58.275 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, what you're
saying is to be vulnerable.

00:35:58.275 --> 00:35:59.150 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Absolutely.

00:35:59.150 --> 00:36:00.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's what we all
try to protect ourselves from.

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:03.055 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: And that's what
Diana showed us, you see.

00:36:03.055 --> 00:36:06.650 align:middle line:84%
She showed us how she could
be equitably vulnerable,

00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:09.390 align:middle line:84%
not just with us, with
the common people,

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:13.430 align:middle line:84%
but also in the situation which
is not based on vulnerability.

00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:17.450 align:middle line:84%
It's based on pure mystique,
a mystique that used to work,

00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:18.710 align:middle line:90%
but no longer does.

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:20.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, it does not.

00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:21.470 align:middle line:90%
OK, do you mind if I--

00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:26.000 align:middle line:84%
OK, thank you for all of
the information regarding

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.210 align:middle line:84%
what's needed of
humanity to step forward

00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:30.920 align:middle line:90%
and step into our voices.

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:34.018 align:middle line:84%
Your book has a ton
of exercises and ways

00:36:34.018 --> 00:36:35.060 align:middle line:90%
in which you can do this.

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:36.560 align:middle line:90%
You do workshops on that.

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:40.475 align:middle line:84%
Now, can we ask you a few
personal salacious questions?

00:36:40.475 --> 00:36:41.600 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: [GASPS] Oh, dear.

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:42.400 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:45.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, I know you a bit.

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And so, Prince Philip
was like a father to you

00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:52.070 align:middle line:90%
when your father died.

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:54.612 align:middle line:84%
Let's just, for a moment, talk
about your family connections.

00:36:54.612 --> 00:36:56.360 align:middle line:84%
So some of how
this all came about

00:36:56.360 --> 00:37:00.050 align:middle line:84%
and how you found this part of
yourself rather early in life.

00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:02.502 align:middle line:90%
Your father was--

00:37:02.502 --> 00:37:04.710 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: My father worked
for the Duke of Edinburgh,

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:07.050 align:middle line:84%
and they were very
close for many years,

00:37:07.050 --> 00:37:11.670 align:middle line:84%
for 35 years, because dad was
awarded the RVO, the Royal

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Victorian Order, which
is a special order that's

00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:16.860 align:middle line:84%
given by the monarch
for her servants.

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And dad had met
his Royal Highness

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:23.010 align:middle line:84%
through Earl Mountbatten,
who was Prince Philip's

00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:26.460 align:middle line:84%
uncle and a great character
within the British royal

00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:29.560 align:middle line:90%
family, during the war years.

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And so, there was this
early introduction.

00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And dad moved into
service, post-war,

00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:37.740 align:middle line:84%
and worked for the
young Princess Elizabeth

00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:39.270 align:middle line:90%
and the young Prince Philip.

00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:41.640 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
the late King died,

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:43.080 align:middle line:90%
and she became queen.

00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:44.070 align:middle line:90%
So he continued.

00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:46.027 align:middle line:84%
So I was brought up
in all of that, yes.

00:37:46.027 --> 00:37:47.610 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
brought up in service,

00:37:47.610 --> 00:37:50.850 align:middle line:84%
but also brought up in the
celebration of tradition

00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:53.430 align:middle line:84%
and heritage, which
is a fundamental part

00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:58.800 align:middle line:84%
of my personality that I address
now through the archetypal keys

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:01.692 align:middle line:84%
that certain individuals
can fulfill in our world.

00:38:01.692 --> 00:38:03.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about that.

00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:05.760 align:middle line:84%
So Prince Philip, at one
point, was almost like a father

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:07.260 align:middle line:90%
to you after your father passed.

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:09.240 align:middle line:90%
You knew him well.

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And you say, there
is a part of you

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:13.620 align:middle line:90%
that is very deeply traditional.

00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:16.740 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, we see,
through Princess Diana,

00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:19.245 align:middle line:84%
that much of this tradition
must crumble and die.

00:38:19.245 --> 00:38:22.890 align:middle line:90%


00:38:22.890 --> 00:38:24.117 align:middle line:90%
Over to you.

00:38:24.117 --> 00:38:25.950 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: I don't
necessarily speak about it

00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:28.620 align:middle line:84%
from a sociological or from
a political point of view.

00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:33.030 align:middle line:84%
I express it through that really
interesting and mystical area

00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:35.700 align:middle line:84%
of our consciousness, where
we look into the archetypes,

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:39.030 align:middle line:84%
and we see that they're
keys into our consciousness.

00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:41.370 align:middle line:84%
The Elizabethans
believed, fundamentally,

00:38:41.370 --> 00:38:45.060 align:middle line:84%
in developing an understanding
of the lover, the warrior,

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:47.400 align:middle line:90%
the sovereign, and the magician.

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And that when
we're living those,

00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:51.870 align:middle line:84%
we can begin to really
access fundamental aspects

00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:53.010 align:middle line:90%
of our being.

00:38:53.010 --> 00:38:55.260 align:middle line:84%
So I am an anarchist,
but I'm also

00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:59.690 align:middle line:84%
a great believer in the
values that are handed down.

00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:01.317 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Stewart,
any final thoughts?

00:39:01.317 --> 00:39:02.400 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Oh, my goodness.

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:03.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We're out of time.

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:05.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I could ask you
about so many people

00:39:05.250 --> 00:39:08.700 align:middle line:84%
because so many
people personally

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:10.980 align:middle line:84%
and ask you to do
impersonations of their

00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:13.440 align:middle line:84%
before and after voice, but
we don't have time for that.

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:14.670 align:middle line:90%
Maybe one.

00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:18.570 align:middle line:84%
Can you give us one, one
famous before and after.

00:39:18.570 --> 00:39:21.720 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Oh, God,
I can't even think.

00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:25.050 align:middle line:10%
My final thought is really
returning to the premise

00:39:25.050 --> 00:39:29.010 align:middle line:10%
that's emerged so often
through our conversation, which

00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:32.430 align:middle line:10%
is to do with the
nature of authenticity

00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:39.810 align:middle line:10%
and how, if we don't
conjure this force within us

00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:41.760 align:middle line:10%
through our own
self love and then

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:45.930 align:middle line:10%
love of other, and through
the kindness and the delicacy,

00:39:45.930 --> 00:39:48.090 align:middle line:10%
the reverence or,
indeed, the grace,

00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:50.790 align:middle line:10%
as we've been saying,
of revering other,

00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:56.485 align:middle line:10%
if we don't do this, our world
is going to destroy itself.

00:39:56.485 --> 00:39:57.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

Stewart, thank you so much.

00:39:59.700 --> 00:39:59.880 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Bless you.

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:00.680 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

before Gaia again.

Safe travels, and good luck on
your fundraisers and everything

00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:08.910 align:middle line:90%
else, all your coaching.

00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:10.690 align:middle line:84%
I know the book's
doing really well.

00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:13.440 align:middle line:84%
So again, the title of
the book is "Diana--

The Voice of Change," which you
can find at major booksellers.

00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:18.690 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here
