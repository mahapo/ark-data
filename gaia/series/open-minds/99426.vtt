00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:29.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Welcome to "Open Minds."

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.140 align:middle line:10%
We have a real
treat for you today.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.970 align:middle line:10%
It's a pick up on
last week's show

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.110 align:middle line:10%
with Sheila Gillette
and the THEO Group,

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.280 align:middle line:10%
and her husband, Marcus.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And last week, we were talking
about reincarnation and family

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.035 align:middle line:90%
soul contracts.

00:00:41.035 --> 00:00:43.410 align:middle line:84%
This time, we're going to look
at a more internal process

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.040 align:middle line:90%
called soul integration.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.400 align:middle line:84%
So let's begin our dialogue
by-- I want to ask you

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.951 align:middle line:84%
two, what does THEO mean
by soul integration?

00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:53.450 align:middle line:10%
>>SHEILA GILLETTE:
Well, THEO's been

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.060 align:middle line:10%
teaching about soul integration
for a number of years.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.040 align:middle line:10%
It's kind of their
mainstay, because they

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.250 align:middle line:10%
speak about fragmented
aspects of our soul that

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.970 align:middle line:10%
influence our response to
situations and circumstances

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.890 align:middle line:10%
and challenges in our life.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.090 align:middle line:84%
It's not our intellect--
our high intellect,

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.150 align:middle line:84%
or adult self that
responds to challenge.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.960 align:middle line:90%
It's our emotional body.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.890 align:middle line:84%
Our fragmented aspects are
the emotional reactors--

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.810 align:middle line:84%
the first responders to any
situation and circumstance.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And they're usually
responding out

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.340 align:middle line:84%
of the need of
survival and fear.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.070 align:middle line:84%
So what soul integration
is, is becoming

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.450 align:middle line:84%
aware of how beliefs
that limit us

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.790 align:middle line:84%
in our thinking, our
responding, our experience--

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.970 align:middle line:84%
usually unlovable, not
worthy, not smart enough, not

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.550 align:middle line:84%
pretty, not handsome--
whatever the belief may be that

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.410 align:middle line:84%
holds us from being the
best person that we can be.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.560 align:middle line:84%
So the integrative
process is really

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.710 align:middle line:84%
our higher self, our
whole self, the adult self

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.800 align:middle line:84%
of who we are now, re-framing,
re-parenting, and soothing and

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.990 align:middle line:84%
comforting and bringing
those aspects back home.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.920 align:middle line:90%
Not shutting them out anymore.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And changing the beliefs
that were born or adopted out

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.310 align:middle line:90%
of that challenge.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So is it more
transforming or embracing

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.590 align:middle line:90%
those unhealed aspects?

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEILA GILLETTE: It's both.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.440 align:middle line:90%
It's actually both.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.970 align:middle line:84%
Because what we need
to do is change beliefs

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.910 align:middle line:90%
that don't work for us anymore.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.710 align:middle line:84%
This is a new time of really
recognizing the divine essence

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.080 align:middle line:84%
that we are, the power
that we have within us.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.610 align:middle line:84%
THEO says, that which within
us is greater than anything

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:45.770 align:middle line:90%
outside of ourselves.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.240 align:middle line:90%
That divinity.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.530 align:middle line:90%
The master that we are.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.580 align:middle line:90%
And it's time to own that.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.456 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hear, hear.

00:02:51.456 --> 00:02:52.455 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: Yeah.

00:02:52.455 --> 00:02:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's a multi-dimensional
process, too.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.850 align:middle line:10%
It could be integrating
the fragmented aspects that

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.470 align:middle line:10%
occurred from some experience
that we had in this lifetime,

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.010 align:middle line:10%
typically in the
younger years, or it

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.850 align:middle line:10%
could be from another lifetime.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And so we come in here, as we
discussed in the last show,

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.890 align:middle line:90%
for the learning of emotions.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.180 align:middle line:84%
So this is a path to
emotional mastery.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And as we identify the
core circumstances through

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.930 align:middle line:84%
a meditative process
that THEO's given us,

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.160 align:middle line:84%
we can go into that
experience, observe it,

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.830 align:middle line:84%
not have to own it
or be in it again,

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.290 align:middle line:84%
but just know of it having
happened in our past,

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.450 align:middle line:84%
and to be able, then, to,
when we are faced with

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.470 align:middle line:84%
a circumstance where
that trigger occurs--

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.012 align:middle line:84%
it could be a personal
relationship--

00:03:35.012 --> 00:03:36.303 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And we all know this.

00:03:36.303 --> 00:03:38.470 align:middle line:84%
We all feel when these
little bits are stepped on.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:39.150 align:middle line:90%
We react.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.191 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: We do.

00:03:40.191 --> 00:03:41.872 align:middle line:90%
We go into fear, we go into--

00:03:41.872 --> 00:03:42.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Anger--

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:43.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE:
--conflict, anger--

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --rejection--

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: abandonment,
rejection, not good enough,

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.700 align:middle line:90%
like Sheila said.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.300 align:middle line:84%
We now, once we understand
the core pattern

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.380 align:middle line:84%
in the circumstance it
occurred that fragmented

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.940 align:middle line:84%
that aspect of the soul at that
time for survival's sake, now

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.207 align:middle line:90%
we have an awareness.

00:03:57.207 --> 00:03:57.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.540 align:middle line:84%
And in the last show,
just toward the end,

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:00.580 align:middle line:90%
this subject came up.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.137 align:middle line:84%
So it's the perfect, kind
of, timing, shall we say,

00:04:04.137 --> 00:04:05.470 align:middle line:90%
because we'd already planned it.

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.345 align:middle line:84%
But it just came up with
the very last person

00:04:07.345 --> 00:04:08.390 align:middle line:90%
that asked a question.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And there were just-- there
were a lot of emotions running

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.540 align:middle line:84%
through the last show,
particularly in the men,

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.972 align:middle line:84%
having to do with these rejected
aspects of self as a child.

00:04:16.972 --> 00:04:18.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: And
the feeling of judgment.

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.160 align:middle line:90%
Harsh judgment.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.970 align:middle line:90%
And just not being loved.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.160 align:middle line:90%
We saw a lot of that.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.770 align:middle line:84%
We see it in our
work all the time.

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.170 align:middle line:84%
So now, we get to that point
where we have that awareness,

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.384 align:middle line:84%
but we're not acting, or
reacting, the same way.

00:04:30.384 --> 00:04:31.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: We're
more in an observatory place.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And being able to
then sit back and say,

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:38.535 align:middle line:90%
OK, now what's going on?

00:04:38.535 --> 00:04:40.660 align:middle line:84%
And it can happen in a
moment, or maybe we'll react

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.900 align:middle line:90%
and we'll pull out--

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you have
that little pause point.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.230 align:middle line:84%
Once this realization
happens, you

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.032 align:middle line:84%
can just create stillness
for a moment before reacting.

00:04:47.032 --> 00:04:48.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE:
What's going on?

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:49.114 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:49.114 --> 00:04:49.969 align:middle line:90%
We all need that.

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:51.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: Yeah, we do.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.097 align:middle line:84%
Who inside, right
now, is responding?

00:04:53.097 --> 00:04:54.305 align:middle line:90%
Who is the little one inside?

00:04:54.305 --> 00:04:56.500 align:middle line:90%
And THEO calls them the orphans.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.580 align:middle line:90%
Those fragmented aspects.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.540 align:middle line:84%
So now, we can-- and what we
see all the time in our work

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.830 align:middle line:84%
is that, after people
embrace this process,

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.170 align:middle line:84%
they simply don't react to
life circumstances the way

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:07.092 align:middle line:90%
they used to.

00:05:07.092 --> 00:05:08.300 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that a beautiful thing?

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Beautiful.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: And
they're in alignment.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And that allows us to lift into
the higher aspect of ourself,

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.300 align:middle line:84%
because we're not
constantly trying

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.210 align:middle line:84%
to beat down or fight down
these lower fearful patterns.

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEILA GILLETTE: Yeah.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.450 align:middle line:90%
Because we've changed them.

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.760 align:middle line:90%
And it's subtly done.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.275 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden a challenge
comes, and you recognize,

00:05:28.275 --> 00:05:31.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm not reacting
like I did before.

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.260 align:middle line:90%
I feel more at ease.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.240 align:middle line:90%
I know how to handle this.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.540 align:middle line:84%
So there's this
whole metamorphose

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.020 align:middle line:84%
that occurs when there is
the integrational process.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.530 align:middle line:84%
And the plus side
is we get healthier.

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:50.020 align:middle line:84%
Because when we have resistance
and that kind of stuff

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.122 align:middle line:84%
internally going on,
it creates an imbalance

00:05:53.122 --> 00:05:54.080 align:middle line:90%
in our physical system.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.954 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:05:54.954 --> 00:05:56.100 align:middle line:90%
It's a lower frequency.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEILA GILLETTE: Yeah.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.080 align:middle line:84%
So as we come into
that alignment--

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.720 align:middle line:84%
so it's like
aligning your spine--

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.450 align:middle line:84%
you come into that
soul alignment,

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:07.690 align:middle line:90%
then your energy flows better.

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.510 align:middle line:90%
And you're more present in life.

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:12.834 align:middle line:84%
And you can enjoy life more,
because you're not so reactive.

00:06:12.834 --> 00:06:13.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.380 align:middle line:90%
No, that's beautiful.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think we should
get to it, because we

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.940 align:middle line:90%
have some lovely guests here.

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.600 align:middle line:84%
And this is a little different,
in that THEO chooses.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.500 align:middle line:84%
Rather than raising
our hands, THEO

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.140 align:middle line:84%
will choose who he wishes
to speak to in that moment,

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.750 align:middle line:84%
because he's already in touch
with everybody in the audience

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.580 align:middle line:84%
and already perceiving what
really needs to be addressed

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.280 align:middle line:90%
now, in this next hour.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:36.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEILA GILLETTE:
It's exciting.

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:37.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.025 align:middle line:84%
So are you ready to
say goodbye to us

00:06:39.025 --> 00:06:40.352 align:middle line:90%
and let THEO come through?

00:06:40.352 --> 00:06:41.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEILA GILLETTE: Yes.

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:41.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:42.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEILA GILLETTE:
I'll see you later.

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:43.075 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:06:43.075 --> 00:06:43.420 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:44.545 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: See you.

00:06:44.545 --> 00:07:00.990 align:middle line:90%


00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:02.800 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: It is the
beginning, is it not?

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:03.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: It is.

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:04.640 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, THEO.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.990 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: We are appreciative
of the opportunity

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:09.090 align:middle line:90%
to be of service unto you.

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:10.900 align:middle line:90%
You may ask.

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
THEO, we would like

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:17.090 align:middle line:84%
to open it up for you to choose
who you wish to speak to.

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:18.520 align:middle line:90%
Unless-- well, you know what?

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.860 align:middle line:84%
First, why don't you
give us your perspective

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:21.920 align:middle line:90%
on soul integration?

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.760 align:middle line:84%
We just heard a little bit
from Marcus and Sheila on that,

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.350 align:middle line:84%
and just kind of introduce the
subject a bit to our viewers

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:28.740 align:middle line:90%
before we go to the questions.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.350 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: Soul integration is
coming into the wholeness

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:32.286 align:middle line:90%
of your being.

00:07:32.286 --> 00:07:36.910 align:middle line:84%
The recognition of the
divine essence that you are.

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:38.270 align:middle line:90%
The master that you are.

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:39.860 align:middle line:90%
This 5th dimensionary energy.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.620 align:middle line:90%
It's fully about the planet now.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.750 align:middle line:84%
Never before have
human beings been

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:49.540 align:middle line:84%
available to recognize
their masterhood--

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.310 align:middle line:90%
the 5th dimensionary energy.

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:54.220 align:middle line:84%
It's a place of
refined vibration

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:59.250 align:middle line:84%
that allows each individual to
recognize the divine essence.

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:00.710 align:middle line:90%
The master.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And express that in
their daily lives.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:06.530 align:middle line:84%
The 3rd dimension
being physical reality.

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:09.030 align:middle line:84%
The 4th was the
spiritual awakening.

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And now, as science
speaks about as well,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:18.110 align:middle line:84%
is the 5th dimensional
waves, if you would,

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:21.830 align:middle line:84%
on a higher frequency
level of recognition.

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:25.970 align:middle line:84%
So it is a release of
beliefs, of old paradigms that

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:31.485 align:middle line:84%
no longer work any longer, that
allows for this transmutation,

00:08:31.485 --> 00:08:35.580 align:middle line:84%
if you would, this
homecoming, into the alignment

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.400 align:middle line:90%
of wholeness or holiness.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:43.049 align:middle line:84%
Divinity expressed fully,
unencumbered from the past.

00:08:43.049 --> 00:08:44.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Beautiful.

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:45.047 align:middle line:90%
Well, on that note--

00:08:45.047 --> 00:08:46.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE:
One quick question.

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:49.250 align:middle line:84%
THEO, talk to us, please,
about the multi-dimensionality

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:52.640 align:middle line:84%
of this spiritual process
that you're describing.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.500 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: It is similar,
in that sense,

00:08:54.500 --> 00:09:00.130 align:middle line:84%
of the psychological model
of today of inner child work.

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:04.570 align:middle line:84%
However, it is expanded into
the multi-dimensionality

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:06.000 align:middle line:90%
of the soul.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.590 align:middle line:84%
For there are other
experiences that a soul

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:16.410 align:middle line:84%
has had upon the earthly plane
that has a need of resolution

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:18.950 align:middle line:90%
in the present incarnation.

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:21.360 align:middle line:84%
So there is a
multi-dimensionality

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:27.080 align:middle line:84%
about the process in the
sense of the soul recognizing

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.100 align:middle line:90%
where the pattern first began.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:30.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE:
And does the soul

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.080 align:middle line:84%
incarnate, THEO,
with the awareness

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:35.430 align:middle line:84%
and the intention of integrating
that aspect of the soul?

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:39.670 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: The soul has a blueprint
of its desire for growth.

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:41.880 align:middle line:90%
So of course it knows.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:47.850 align:middle line:84%
It has relevance in the choosing
of a particular incarnation.

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:49.860 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:52.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we're going
to take just a moment, THEO,

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:56.060 align:middle line:84%
as you call upon someone, and
just play quick musical chairs.

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:59.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm vacating my seat for the
person you'll be speaking to.

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:01.827 align:middle line:84%
So we'll take just a
little 30 second break.

00:10:01.827 --> 00:10:02.660 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:05.902 align:middle line:90%


00:10:05.902 --> 00:10:06.610 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: This one.

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:15.268 align:middle line:90%


00:10:15.268 --> 00:10:16.890 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:19.630 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: We are
appreciative to serve you.

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:23.062 align:middle line:90%
There is an asking, yes?

00:10:23.062 --> 00:10:25.310 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:30.980 align:middle line:84%
I am interested in the
line between really pushing

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:35.790 align:middle line:84%
my edge with my
triggers of my orphans,

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:41.080 align:middle line:84%
and choosing a path
that feels better.

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:45.450 align:middle line:84%
So I have a question
about how much is enough,

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:49.120 align:middle line:84%
when I get information--
when my orphans are

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:55.210 align:middle line:84%
ignited and aroused-- to
stay in the same situation?

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:57.520 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: It is not
to relive that which

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:01.380 align:middle line:84%
was this situation-- the
circumstance in which

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:04.060 align:middle line:90%
the belief was adopted, you see?

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:06.160 align:middle line:90%
It is a witnessing.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.670 align:middle line:90%
Not a re-experiencing.

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:14.340 align:middle line:84%
So in the asking of how far to
go into it, only to revelation.

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.980 align:middle line:90%
Into the understanding of, ah,

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:21.510 align:middle line:84%
this is how this
belief was born.

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:22.490 align:middle line:90%
Was accepted.

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:23.610 align:middle line:90%
Was adopted.

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:27.250 align:middle line:84%
For oftentimes, the
beliefs are adopted

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:30.610 align:middle line:84%
by the beliefs of those
whom you are around,

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:35.730 align:middle line:84%
for survival's sake, as you
have already experienced.

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:42.330 align:middle line:84%
So what you experience is a
witnessing, not a reliving.

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:49.170 align:middle line:84%
So that you are not
immersed fully in the past,

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:51.640 align:middle line:90%
but in the awareness of the now.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And the higher self of you
having the availability

00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.130 align:middle line:84%
to access, as if it
is your own birth

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:04.090 align:middle line:84%
child, this little
orphan, or fragment,

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:07.260 align:middle line:84%
so that you can
soothe, comfort, let

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.860 align:middle line:84%
it know that you
are there taking it

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:14.070 align:middle line:84%
with you into a new
life, where they

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:17.124 align:middle line:84%
will have a voice, and
understanding, and your love.

00:12:17.124 --> 00:12:17.790 align:middle line:90%
Unconditionally.

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:20.730 align:middle line:90%


00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:23.280 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: So my love
may be, in those moments,

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.475 align:middle line:84%
to remove them from
that situation.

00:12:26.475 --> 00:12:27.660 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:29.510 align:middle line:90%
So you are the best parent.

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:32.240 align:middle line:84%
The higher self of
you, the future self,

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:37.080 align:middle line:84%
that which you are
now, is the best parent

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.780 align:middle line:90%
for this little one.

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:46.160 align:middle line:84%
Just if it-- as if it
were your birth child.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:51.610 align:middle line:84%
That you would love it,
communicate, support.

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:52.480 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And letting it know,
dependent upon the age,

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:59.570 align:middle line:84%
that you are taking
care of everything.

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:01.980 align:middle line:90%
They need not worry.

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:06.520 align:middle line:84%
They can have
permission to play.

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:11.662 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to be on guard
or in control any longer.

00:13:11.662 --> 00:13:13.370 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: And it
really feels like that

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:16.450 align:middle line:90%
is the phase now-- is the play.

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:17.140 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:19.100 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Am I
accurate with that?

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:20.716 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: You are.

00:13:20.716 --> 00:13:24.550 align:middle line:84%
And at times, go out
to play with them.

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:29.560 align:middle line:84%
For your issues of
control have been great.

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:33.060 align:middle line:84%
You have been hyper
vigilant in your life.

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.950 align:middle line:90%
Necessarily so.

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:39.410 align:middle line:90%
On guard at all times.

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:44.110 align:middle line:84%
So now, at the stage you
are, you are empowered.

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:45.740 align:middle line:90%
You have wisdom.

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:46.820 align:middle line:90%
You are the adult.

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:51.560 align:middle line:84%
You are your future
self, living in this now,

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:57.740 align:middle line:84%
bringing this forward,
released from the past.

00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:00.860 align:middle line:90%
You can take this stage.

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:03.728 align:middle line:84%
You are aware of a very
young orphan, are you not?

00:14:03.728 --> 00:14:07.081 align:middle line:90%


00:14:07.081 --> 00:14:08.518 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: A few.

00:14:08.518 --> 00:14:09.480 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:13.030 align:middle line:84%
And so where you're
taking them from,

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:18.230 align:middle line:84%
ultimately, is your
nuclear family.

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:20.490 align:middle line:84%
In essence, one might
call it a divorce.

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:22.910 align:middle line:90%
A dissolution of relationship.

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:24.420 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:25.410 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:28.130 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Necessarily so.

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:32.720 align:middle line:84%
So as you do this envisioning,
you can hold them.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:38.410 align:middle line:84%
Have them-- envision
the home where you live.

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:39.690 align:middle line:90%
There is a porch.

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:40.450 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:41.190 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:42.990 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: The parents
on the front porch.

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:46.340 align:middle line:90%
You are on the walkway.

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:52.966 align:middle line:84%
There is a walkway extended
beyond the house into infinity.

00:14:52.966 --> 00:14:54.870 align:middle line:90%
To eternal.

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:56.280 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.345 align:middle line:84%
You are standing in
the walkway in front

00:14:58.345 --> 00:15:00.410 align:middle line:90%
of the house with the orphans.

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:04.120 align:middle line:84%
With these little
parts of yourself.

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:05.980 align:middle line:90%
Holding them.

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:09.412 align:middle line:84%
They've already said to
you they will go with you.

00:15:09.412 --> 00:15:11.660 align:middle line:90%
You've engaged in that.

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:19.550 align:middle line:84%
So now you turn and wave
goodbye to that home

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:21.450 align:middle line:84%
and to those beings
on the porch.

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:25.570 align:middle line:90%


00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:30.420 align:middle line:84%
And you take them and
lead them on the path

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:35.440 align:middle line:90%
away from this place.

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.016 align:middle line:84%
And they need not be
afraid any longer.

00:15:38.016 --> 00:15:43.280 align:middle line:90%


00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:46.032 align:middle line:84%
And they're different
ages-- we are aware of that.

00:15:46.032 --> 00:15:47.310 align:middle line:90%
But they want to go.

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:48.927 align:middle line:90%
They're excited.

00:15:48.927 --> 00:15:50.760 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
think they trust me now.

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:51.260 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.510 align:middle line:90%
It took a bit of time.

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:55.288 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Rightfully so.

00:15:55.288 --> 00:15:55.788 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Mm.

00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:59.130 align:middle line:90%


00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:02.080 align:middle line:90%
Now, where are you going?

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.430 align:middle line:84%
That is the question,
more importantly.

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:07.730 align:middle line:84%
You've engaged with these
aspects of self that

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:11.240 align:middle line:84%
now feel quite
comfortable with you,

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:15.482 align:middle line:90%
and you have a new life opening.

00:16:15.482 --> 00:16:17.400 align:middle line:90%
It's time for it.

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:18.070 align:middle line:90%
And a move.

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:21.090 align:middle line:90%


00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:22.110 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: And a move?

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:22.875 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:16:22.875 --> 00:16:24.630 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Can you say more?

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:25.650 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Not immediately.

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:26.580 align:middle line:90%
But there is a move.

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:30.580 align:middle line:84%
And a residential
change that will come

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:32.110 align:middle line:90%
is an indication of this growth.

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:34.960 align:middle line:90%


00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:36.140 align:middle line:90%
And you've felt it.

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:37.040 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.830 align:middle line:90%
And I just moved.

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:39.330 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Ah.

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:40.230 align:middle line:90%
It's been done.

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:41.840 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:42.720 align:middle line:90%
There's another one.

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:43.220 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes?

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:44.360 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.780 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: 2015.

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:47.450 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:48.770 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: This is temporary.

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:49.800 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:50.510 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Very.

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:51.176 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:16:51.176 --> 00:16:56.280 align:middle line:90%


00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:57.970 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: Breathe
through the move.

00:16:57.970 --> 00:16:59.065 align:middle line:90%
Don't unpack everything.

00:16:59.065 --> 00:17:01.637 align:middle line:90%


00:17:01.637 --> 00:17:02.720 align:middle line:90%
But you knew that already.

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:05.359 align:middle line:90%


00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:07.300 align:middle line:84%
Because the change
will be there quickly,

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:12.609 align:middle line:84%
into an environment that's open,
light, and-- you're an artist,

00:17:12.609 --> 00:17:17.620 align:middle line:84%
so the interior
will be your colors.

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:19.964 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: That's
very appropriate.

00:17:19.964 --> 00:17:21.089 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: There is an asking?

00:17:21.089 --> 00:17:21.755 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:17:21.755 --> 00:17:25.990 align:middle line:84%
My mother is very
sick right now.

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:27.502 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:17:27.502 --> 00:17:28.085 align:middle line:90%
Transitioning.

00:17:28.085 --> 00:17:30.740 align:middle line:90%


00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:32.080 align:middle line:90%
But you knew that as well.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.645 align:middle line:90%


00:17:34.645 --> 00:17:39.890 align:middle line:84%
A very profound
time for you both.

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:41.150 align:middle line:90%
Energy is constant.

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:42.935 align:middle line:90%
Form will only change.

00:17:42.935 --> 00:17:47.200 align:middle line:90%


00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:51.010 align:middle line:90%
And you can handle it.

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:53.350 align:middle line:84%
There will be those times
you think you cannot,

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:55.810 align:middle line:84%
but grieving is
important, you see?

00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:57.120 align:middle line:90%
Do not hold it in.

00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:00.749 align:middle line:90%


00:18:00.749 --> 00:18:01.790 align:middle line:90%
There is great love here.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:10.092 align:middle line:90%


00:18:10.092 --> 00:18:12.920 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Is there anything
I need to know about this?

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:13.420 align:middle line:90%
For her?

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:13.850 align:middle line:90%
For me?

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:14.150 align:middle line:90%
For us?

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:15.600 align:middle line:90%
For this-- this life together?

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:19.340 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: She's going
to let you know.

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:22.180 align:middle line:84%
She will describe to
you her experience

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:24.890 align:middle line:90%
of walking in two worlds.

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:28.140 align:middle line:90%
Which will be a blessing.

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:32.625 align:middle line:84%
And you will be comforted by
that, in allowing her release.

00:18:32.625 --> 00:18:35.856 align:middle line:90%


00:18:35.856 --> 00:18:36.980 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Is it imminent?

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:40.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know it's imminent,
but is it soon, soon?

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.350 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell?

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:44.180 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: It's not yet
chosen, the hour or the day.

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:46.210 align:middle line:90%
But it's not long off.

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:49.600 align:middle line:90%
This has been coming for a time.

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And part of you is looking
forward for her release.

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:57.840 align:middle line:90%
You don't want her to suffer.

00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:59.390 align:middle line:90%
And that is what is happening.

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:01.310 align:middle line:90%
She's releasing.

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:04.770 align:middle line:84%
And as it moves
forward, she will not

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:12.796 align:middle line:84%
be suffering when she
walks in both worlds.

00:19:12.796 --> 00:19:14.959 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:19:14.959 --> 00:19:16.250 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: And you'll be with her.

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:16.958 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:19:16.958 --> 00:19:19.450 align:middle line:90%


00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:20.730 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I will.

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:23.640 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: And know that
she will hear you.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:30.240 align:middle line:84%
That is the last thing
before departure, is hearing.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:35.800 align:middle line:84%
So you know before she leaves,
she will hear every word.

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:39.520 align:middle line:84%
So communicate with her, even
when she cannot communicate

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:41.690 align:middle line:90%
clearly back to you.

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:42.675 align:middle line:90%
She hears you.

00:19:42.675 --> 00:19:43.591 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:19:43.591 --> 00:19:49.564 align:middle line:90%


00:19:49.564 --> 00:19:50.980 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: It's a
blessing, actually.

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:53.715 align:middle line:84%
It's a birth into
another dimension.

00:19:53.715 --> 00:19:56.042 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
waiting for her.

00:19:56.042 --> 00:19:57.420 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, there are.

00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:58.700 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: And she speaks of it.

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:01.421 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:20:01.421 --> 00:20:03.170 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: You'll find
some laughter in this.

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:05.091 align:middle line:90%
Not only sadness.

00:20:05.091 --> 00:20:08.730 align:middle line:84%
When she speaks,
it's a blessing.

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:11.520 align:middle line:90%


00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:12.496 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I feel it.

00:20:12.496 --> 00:20:15.424 align:middle line:90%


00:20:15.424 --> 00:20:16.491 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:20:16.491 --> 00:20:18.240 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: You are complete
with your asking?

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:21.330 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I am.

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:22.885 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: God's love unto you.

00:20:22.885 --> 00:20:24.122 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: And unto you.

00:20:24.122 --> 00:20:24.830 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Good day.

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:26.730 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Good day.

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:27.655 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:20:27.655 --> 00:20:28.155 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

00:20:28.155 --> 00:20:32.682 align:middle line:90%


00:20:32.682 --> 00:20:34.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
interesting, too,

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:37.510 align:middle line:84%
because Sheila
just recently went

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:41.810 align:middle line:84%
through the exact same process
with her mother as well.

00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:42.880 align:middle line:90%
The whole journey.

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.732 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:20:44.732 --> 00:20:46.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: THEO,
would you like-- do

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:48.620 align:middle line:84%
you have anything you'd like
to ask at this point, Marcus?

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:48.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: No.

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.353 align:middle line:84%
Who would you like
to pick next, THEO?

00:20:50.353 --> 00:20:50.852 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Mm.

00:20:50.852 --> 00:20:53.460 align:middle line:90%


00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:54.155 align:middle line:90%
This one.

00:20:54.155 --> 00:21:01.400 align:middle line:90%


00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.902 align:middle line:84%
There are some
similarities, are there not?

00:21:03.902 --> 00:21:05.750 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, there are.

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:08.350 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: You may ask.

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:10.220 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I wasn't
really prepared

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:14.730 align:middle line:90%
to have this opportunity.

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:20.310 align:middle line:84%
But I would say that I am
following, and believing,

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:24.930 align:middle line:84%
and living, to my best ability,
the principles that you're

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:30.610 align:middle line:84%
speaking of, and am very
aware of the continuing

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:32.430 align:middle line:90%
path I need to be on.

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:40.000 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I really follow
you, and watch you, and stay

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.395 align:middle line:84%
on top of what you
do, through my friend.

00:21:42.395 --> 00:21:45.210 align:middle line:90%


00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:47.050 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: So you're
opening yourself

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:51.210 align:middle line:84%
to this great time of
transformation of consciousness

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:55.400 align:middle line:84%
that is most appropriate
for your choosing.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:59.540 align:middle line:84%
For you have had these
experience in past lives.

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:04.800 align:middle line:84%
You are that of a
seer, and you have

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:08.450 align:middle line:84%
great wisdom that you
share with others,

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:11.640 align:middle line:90%
and many seek you out for it.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.860 align:middle line:84%
So you are
experiencing that which

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:17.870 align:middle line:84%
you are to share with
them, for a true teacher

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:22.430 align:middle line:84%
teaches from experience,
not book learning.

00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:27.990 align:middle line:84%
And so what is exposed to
you now in your own process

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:30.480 align:middle line:84%
is that which you
share with others.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And that intuitive knowing,
that has blossomed greatly,

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:38.580 align:middle line:90%
you must pay attention to.

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:43.320 align:middle line:84%
What we mean by that, do not
take on the energy of others

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.560 align:middle line:90%
as you work with them.

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:50.740 align:middle line:84%
As you engage with them,
you can absorb their issues.

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:53.120 align:middle line:90%
They are not your own.

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:56.755 align:middle line:84%
Let that pass through you
like wind through a screen.

00:22:56.755 --> 00:22:58.640 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:03.600 align:middle line:84%
And be in water daily so that
the polarities are shifted,

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:07.500 align:middle line:84%
and the energy of the
others is washed away.

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:09.970 align:middle line:84%
For the intensity
of now is great,

00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:16.500 align:middle line:84%
and there is great fear that
has been permeating the airways,

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:19.550 align:middle line:90%
and many are frightened.

00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And you hold the light
to quell the fear.

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:28.480 align:middle line:84%
And that is why you've walked
the walk you've walked.

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:31.070 align:middle line:90%
You've been through that fear.

00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:35.420 align:middle line:84%
You've been through
situations and circumstances

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:38.510 align:middle line:84%
that many would
have cowered from.

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:41.430 align:middle line:90%
And often, ask why me?

00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:45.780 align:middle line:84%
The why you is because you're
the leader, the teacher

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:49.140 align:middle line:84%
of compassion and
understanding, and holding

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:53.731 align:middle line:84%
the space of movement for
those who seek you out.

00:23:53.731 --> 00:23:57.860 align:middle line:84%
You can be empathetic
yet firm with them

00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:01.560 align:middle line:90%
on their path to be strong.

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:02.780 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:03.799 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:24:03.799 --> 00:24:04.965 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: You have a question?

00:24:04.965 --> 00:24:07.880 align:middle line:90%


00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:10.675 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: This was just
beyond my comprehension.

00:24:10.675 --> 00:24:12.780 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:13.540 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Mm.

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:15.840 align:middle line:90%
You will sit with it and know.

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:21.100 align:middle line:84%
For in the 2015 year,
you will be very busy.

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:26.470 align:middle line:84%
So take advantage of the
quiet time for yourself.

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And know, as you work with
others, schedule those workings

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:35.930 align:middle line:90%
to your schedule, not theirs.

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:39.980 align:middle line:84%
So that you can be mindful
of caring for self first.

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.260 align:middle line:90%
That is not selfish.

00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:46.510 align:middle line:84%
But allows the energy
to be firm within you,

00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:47.885 align:middle line:90%
so that you can be of service.

00:24:47.885 --> 00:24:52.110 align:middle line:90%


00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:55.889 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I take
your message with me.

00:24:55.889 --> 00:24:56.930 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: It is a blessing.

00:24:56.930 --> 00:25:00.250 align:middle line:84%
There are many in
need upon this planet,

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:02.770 align:middle line:84%
and the way-showers
must show the way.

00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:07.060 align:middle line:90%


00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:07.840 align:middle line:90%
You are complete?

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:10.610 align:middle line:90%


00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:13.546 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: No, I don't
think I'll ever be complete.

00:25:13.546 --> 00:25:16.425 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: For this moment, yes?

00:25:16.425 --> 00:25:18.100 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:19.640 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:23.540 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: God's love unto you.

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:24.260 align:middle line:90%
Good day.

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:25.174 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Good day.

00:25:25.174 --> 00:25:27.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:30.570 align:middle line:84%
THEO, you were
mentioning something

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:32.890 align:middle line:84%
a moment ago about the
bathing in the waters,

00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:34.670 align:middle line:84%
and releasing the
energy, because she's

00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:37.330 align:middle line:84%
working so directly and
personally with people.

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:39.990 align:middle line:84%
But what about--
what about all of us?

00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:42.410 align:middle line:84%
Because we are more open
now, and we're always

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:45.850 align:middle line:84%
absorbing one another's energy,
can you just, for a moment,

00:25:45.850 --> 00:25:49.260 align:middle line:84%
speak to that, before
choosing the next person?

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:50.310 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:54.000 align:middle line:84%
It is important that each
individual pays attention

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.120 align:middle line:90%
to their physical structure.

00:25:56.120 --> 00:26:00.110 align:middle line:84%
This is a time of grand
change and vibrational shifts

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:03.390 align:middle line:90%
that all are affected by.

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And you are the expert
in your own body.

00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:11.370 align:middle line:84%
So as you pay attention,
notice what you're noticing,

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:14.470 align:middle line:84%
and care for the
body-- nutritionally,

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:19.250 align:middle line:84%
energetically,
emotionally, spiritually.

00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:25.790 align:middle line:84%
All of those things are very
important to optimum health.

00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:27.030 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:32.150 align:middle line:84%
So being in water allows the
body to shift polarities,

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:36.170 align:middle line:84%
as the water washes over
the body, of the energy that

00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:39.650 align:middle line:90%
is absorbed from the day.

00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:46.510 align:middle line:84%
For-- as an empathetic
being, as you are--

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:50.090 align:middle line:84%
you are absorbing the energies
and the emotional impact

00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:51.215 align:middle line:90%
of others.

00:26:51.215 --> 00:26:53.140 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:57.930 align:middle line:84%
So paying attention to that,
noticing that, and refining

00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:01.870 align:middle line:84%
and being within the
self, so that you

00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:04.680 align:middle line:84%
are aware of what is
necessary, and where

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:09.632 align:middle line:84%
there might be an imbalance
that can be corrected.

00:27:09.632 --> 00:27:10.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you for that.

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:12.215 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE:
And THEO, when

00:27:12.215 --> 00:27:15.910 align:middle line:84%
we're working with
people who are activated,

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:18.750 align:middle line:84%
and their orphans are
evident, and they're up

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:23.050 align:middle line:84%
for the experience,
how can we make

00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:26.531 align:middle line:90%
sure we're not taking that on?

00:27:26.531 --> 00:27:30.238 align:middle line:84%
And being aware of what's
ours and what's theirs?

00:27:30.238 --> 00:27:31.446 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Don't be sympathetic.

00:27:31.446 --> 00:27:34.780 align:middle line:90%


00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:36.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:37.310 align:middle line:90%
Easy fix.

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:40.327 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: Sympathy does
not serve anyone.

00:27:40.327 --> 00:27:40.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:42.470 align:middle line:90%
That's different than empathy.

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:43.640 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: It is.

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:47.610 align:middle line:84%
Sympathy is a
continuation of the story

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:49.700 align:middle line:90%
that you get involved in.

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:51.750 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:56.150 align:middle line:84%
Empathy is understanding
where someone is

00:27:56.150 --> 00:28:06.000 align:middle line:84%
and holding the energetic
space-- environment-- for it

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.250 align:middle line:90%
to change.

00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:11.570 align:middle line:90%
Not becoming involved in it.

00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:15.280 align:middle line:84%
So that you can hold
that energy of change

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:17.590 align:middle line:84%
and envisioning that
person as whole,

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:22.590 align:middle line:84%
healthy, functioning
perfectly in their life.

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:25.400 align:middle line:90%
Not in their story.

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.550 align:middle line:90%
Or their experience.

00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:30.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: This is why
so many teachers and healers

00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:34.100 align:middle line:84%
and leaders have had some
pretty-- pretty strong life

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:38.760 align:middle line:84%
experiences themselves, to get
to that point of confession.

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:41.410 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: I have been
where you have been,

00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:45.370 align:middle line:84%
I know what you know,
I feel what you felt,

00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:50.060 align:middle line:84%
and this is what I found is
a good statement of sharing,

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:51.650 align:middle line:90%
is it not?

00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:55.798 align:middle line:84%
Not being embroiled
in the drama.

00:28:55.798 --> 00:28:58.090 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:28:58.090 --> 00:29:00.290 align:middle line:90%
Not starring in their film.

00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:02.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:04.399 align:middle line:90%
A drama, no doubt.

00:29:04.399 --> 00:29:05.690 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Most are, are they not?

00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:07.565 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sometimes horror film.

00:29:07.565 --> 00:29:10.065 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: Usually has
a king or a queen in it, too.

00:29:10.065 --> 00:29:11.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:13.280 align:middle line:90%
Are we complete on that?

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:13.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: I am, yeah.

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:14.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Are you?

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:14.820 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:17.981 align:middle line:84%
THEO, if you would like to go
ahead and select another person

00:29:17.981 --> 00:29:18.730 align:middle line:90%
from the audience?

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:23.068 align:middle line:90%


00:29:23.068 --> 00:29:24.514 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: This one.

00:29:24.514 --> 00:29:29.334 align:middle line:90%


00:29:29.334 --> 00:29:31.160 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Hello, THEO.

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:34.690 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: We are appreciative
to be of service unto you.

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:36.260 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:38.910 align:middle line:90%
I am surprised to be here.

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:40.960 align:middle line:90%
I felt drawn.

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And I offered to be here--
I had the schedule free.

00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:50.500 align:middle line:90%
And I'm new to you.

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:54.710 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that there's
a lot happening for me,

00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:57.530 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not sure
what I'm integrating,

00:29:57.530 --> 00:30:02.890 align:middle line:84%
or where I'm going, but I
know things are different.

00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:04.480 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Very different.

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:05.610 align:middle line:90%
And you heard the call.

00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:07.034 align:middle line:90%
We pushed you a bit.

00:30:07.034 --> 00:30:07.950 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:09.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:12.105 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: And in this,
new to us you are not.

00:30:12.105 --> 00:30:12.730 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:15.730 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: You may be new
to us in this form--

00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:16.830 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:18.590 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: --but we know you.

00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:22.920 align:middle line:90%


00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:26.580 align:middle line:84%
In the most recent years past,
you have let go of everything.

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:28.729 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:30:28.729 --> 00:30:31.020 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: That is why you're
not sure where you're going.

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:34.140 align:middle line:84%
You're not the person
you were before.

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:36.260 align:middle line:90%
At all.

00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:39.410 align:middle line:84%
It is as if you
died to an old life

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:44.640 align:middle line:84%
and have just been born as
an infant into this new one.

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:46.620 align:middle line:90%
Trying to find your way.

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:51.280 align:middle line:84%
Opening your eyes, to
say, oh, this is it.

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:54.320 align:middle line:90%
This is what Earth is.

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:57.930 align:middle line:84%
Almost as dramatic
as that, isn't it?

00:30:57.930 --> 00:31:03.639 align:middle line:84%
For the old way was
so encapsulated.

00:31:03.639 --> 00:31:04.305 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:04.305 --> 00:31:07.191 align:middle line:90%


00:31:07.191 --> 00:31:09.315 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: And now you're
stepping out into the world.

00:31:09.315 --> 00:31:12.090 align:middle line:90%


00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:15.078 align:middle line:90%
To know who you are.

00:31:15.078 --> 00:31:20.400 align:middle line:84%
You've let go the vestiges
of who you thought

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:23.350 align:middle line:90%
everyone else wanted you to be.

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:25.120 align:middle line:90%
You didn't know yourself.

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:27.935 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That's right.

00:31:27.935 --> 00:31:28.850 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Mm.

00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:31.644 align:middle line:84%
It's nice to see
you on this side.

00:31:31.644 --> 00:31:32.560 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:34.760 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: To be the
soul that you are,

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:40.410 align:middle line:84%
and to blossom forth
into that presence.

00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:45.070 align:middle line:84%
The soul presence that you
are is a very powerful being.

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:48.280 align:middle line:90%
You feel that.

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And you've come
through, in the sense

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:56.950 align:middle line:84%
of making a decision, breaking
with the past, in a grand way.

00:31:56.950 --> 00:32:00.070 align:middle line:84%
A pat on the back, a
self pat on the back,

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:01.895 align:middle line:84%
would be excellent
to acknowledge

00:32:01.895 --> 00:32:03.950 align:middle line:90%
how far you've come.

00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:04.660 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:07.210 align:middle line:84%
Other people say how
much I've changed.

00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:11.030 align:middle line:84%
It's hard for me to
feel that at this point.

00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:12.490 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:16.140 align:middle line:84%
Because you still have a
little bit of the other.

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:17.760 align:middle line:90%
But it's oh my, what's happened?

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:18.910 align:middle line:90%
You even look different.

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:22.164 align:middle line:84%
You're a different
person totally.

00:32:22.164 --> 00:32:23.330 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That is correct.

00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:24.170 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: It's good.

00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:25.440 align:middle line:90%
It's new birth.

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:27.910 align:middle line:90%
You should look different.

00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:28.710 align:middle line:90%
Lighter.

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:31.400 align:middle line:90%
The lightness of being.

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:34.920 align:middle line:84%
Now the movement forward is to
be the artisan that you are.

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:35.545 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm.

00:32:35.545 --> 00:32:38.090 align:middle line:90%


00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's new, and
it's frightening,

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:44.480 align:middle line:90%
but it's also freeing.

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:46.120 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: It's not new; it's old.

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:48.240 align:middle line:90%
You're just recalling it.

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:49.510 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Just recalling it.

00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:50.510 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: And remembering.

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:52.980 align:middle line:90%


00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:55.590 align:middle line:90%
And allowing it to flow.

00:32:55.590 --> 00:33:00.740 align:middle line:84%
For you adopted the
belief that you couldn't

00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:04.726 align:middle line:90%
be that in the other time.

00:33:04.726 --> 00:33:05.460 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:06.470 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:06.970 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:08.220 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: It's another lifetime.

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:10.470 align:middle line:90%


00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:16.340 align:middle line:84%
And what it was doing,
it was suffocating you.

00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:22.130 align:middle line:84%
So there was a quantum leap
out of that suffocation.

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:23.990 align:middle line:90%
Now you can breathe.

00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:28.840 align:middle line:84%
And the unfoldment of
your artistic expression

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.240 align:middle line:90%
will be very rapid.

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:31.690 align:middle line:90%
The memory is there.

00:33:31.690 --> 00:33:34.900 align:middle line:90%
Soul memory.

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:35.660 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy it.

00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:38.476 align:middle line:90%
It gives you great joy.

00:33:38.476 --> 00:33:44.870 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Is there a direction
for this artistic expression?

00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:47.944 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: Writing, painting,
sculpting-- all of it.

00:33:47.944 --> 00:33:48.860 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: All of it.

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:49.290 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:51.248 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: And you're
compelled to do that anyway,

00:33:51.248 --> 00:33:55.130 align:middle line:84%
so we're not saying
anything new.

00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:56.270 align:middle line:90%
Begin with painting.

00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:58.370 align:middle line:90%
Small.

00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:03.430 align:middle line:84%
Soon there will be large-- very
large-- with lots of color.

00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:06.265 align:middle line:84%
Because color vibration is
very important for the healing

00:34:06.265 --> 00:34:08.830 align:middle line:90%
of the planet.

00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:15.790 align:middle line:84%
It brings lightness of being
to others, as it does to you.

00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:17.239 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:34:17.239 --> 00:34:19.810 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything else
remaining that I need

00:34:19.810 --> 00:34:22.770 align:middle line:90%
to let go of, to fully embody--

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:23.270 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: No.

00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:25.055 align:middle line:90%
You've done a fine job of that.

00:34:25.055 --> 00:34:26.396 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, good.

00:34:26.396 --> 00:34:27.979 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: Even with
the stamping around,

00:34:27.979 --> 00:34:30.850 align:middle line:90%
and getting rid of the anger.

00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:34.590 align:middle line:90%
That was very good.

00:34:34.590 --> 00:34:35.760 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:36.969 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:34:36.969 --> 00:34:40.250 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: It allowed it to imagine
a way that it's released,

00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:42.560 align:middle line:90%
and forgiveness could come.

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And most of all, the
forgiveness of self

00:34:45.890 --> 00:34:50.820 align:middle line:84%
that occurred, for
holding yourself back.

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:52.330 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't the
right time anyway,

00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:58.025 align:middle line:84%
so understand this-- this could
not have happened before now.

00:34:58.025 --> 00:35:00.510 align:middle line:84%
You have not missed
any opportunity,

00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:03.654 align:middle line:90%
because this is the time for it.

00:35:03.654 --> 00:35:04.570 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:06.920 align:middle line:90%
That's good to know.

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:09.670 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: We heard your thought.

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:12.940 align:middle line:90%
Why didn't I do this before?

00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:16.420 align:middle line:90%
What took so long?

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:18.290 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Those are exactly--

00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:19.160 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: We know.

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:21.250 align:middle line:90%
We've heard.

00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:24.070 align:middle line:90%
It takes as long as it takes.

00:35:24.070 --> 00:35:27.422 align:middle line:84%
In the right timing of the
soul, emergence occurs.

00:35:27.422 --> 00:35:30.080 align:middle line:90%


00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:32.420 align:middle line:90%
And that is your blessing now.

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:37.360 align:middle line:84%
The true emergence of your being
into that divine essence we

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:40.440 align:middle line:90%
speak about.

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:42.290 align:middle line:90%
It is showing on your face.

00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:44.865 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:35:44.865 --> 00:35:45.759 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Mm-hm.

00:35:45.759 --> 00:35:46.900 align:middle line:90%
You may ask.

00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:51.070 align:middle line:90%


00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:55.090 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm blank
now, as far as a question.

00:35:55.090 --> 00:36:01.850 align:middle line:84%
Are there any remnants of--
I've often felt abandoned,

00:36:01.850 --> 00:36:03.085 align:middle line:90%
or rejected--

00:36:03.085 --> 00:36:04.460 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: You're
dealing with that.

00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:05.168 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:05.168 --> 00:36:06.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm dealing with it.

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:09.820 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: Those abandonment issues
are the integrational process

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:12.910 align:middle line:84%
that we speak about, of which
you have become familiar.

00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And you're very at
ease at speaking

00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:16.900 align:middle line:84%
to these little
orphans, and letting

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:19.480 align:middle line:90%
them know you love them.

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And that is all
that it will take.

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:25.190 align:middle line:84%
It will be very easy for
you to accomplish that.

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:27.970 align:middle line:90%
There's no blockage there.

00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:29.910 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That's wonderful.

00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:36.470 align:middle line:84%
Any physical thing left to
take care of or nurture?

00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:37.480 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Not anymore.

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:38.800 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: All right.

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:40.610 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: What you
have done is set

00:36:40.610 --> 00:36:44.504 align:middle line:84%
a trajectory of your life
of complete wellness.

00:36:44.504 --> 00:36:45.420 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: All right.

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:48.080 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: That's what
integration and new birth that

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:49.840 align:middle line:90%
occurred for you has happened.

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:52.680 align:middle line:90%


00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:58.152 align:middle line:84%
For you were on a pathway
of destruction, as you know.

00:36:58.152 --> 00:36:59.580 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Destruction.

00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:01.660 align:middle line:84%
I was on a pathway
of destruction?

00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:03.280 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Physically.

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:06.110 align:middle line:90%
Because of how you were living.

00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:09.180 align:middle line:90%
In constriction.

00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:09.965 align:middle line:90%
No longer that.

00:37:09.965 --> 00:37:12.610 align:middle line:90%


00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:15.260 align:middle line:84%
That's what you
came here to hear.

00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:16.936 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:37:16.936 --> 00:37:17.436 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Mm.

00:37:17.436 --> 00:37:19.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A lifetime
of wellness.

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:21.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: I have
a couple of quick questions

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:21.960 align:middle line:90%
on this, THEO.

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:22.793 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: You may ask.

00:37:22.793 --> 00:37:25.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE:
One is, there's

00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:30.380 align:middle line:84%
so much fear when confronted
with the knowing I

00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:31.670 align:middle line:90%
need to reinvent myself.

00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:33.670 align:middle line:84%
And in this soul
integration process,

00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:38.480 align:middle line:84%
there's also so much
strength in the owning--

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:41.860 align:middle line:84%
how wise, how mature, how
kind, how compassionate

00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:42.930 align:middle line:90%
we become as adults.

00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you
to just, kind of,

00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:45.890 align:middle line:84%
speak a little bit to that
piece of the soul integration

00:37:45.890 --> 00:37:46.510 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:49.520 align:middle line:84%
That we really
parent these orphans

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:52.010 align:middle line:84%
from a place of strength
and a place of wisdom.

00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:55.360 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: A strength, wisdom,
and future acceptance.

00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:56.660 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:56.660 --> 00:38:00.850 align:middle line:84%
And then there was a
realization of that empowerment

00:38:00.850 --> 00:38:02.330 align:middle line:90%
that occurs.

00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:06.500 align:middle line:84%
No longer a feeling of
disempowerment that has been.

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:09.910 align:middle line:90%


00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:14.920 align:middle line:84%
And it is a process of
unfoldment that occurs,

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:18.356 align:middle line:84%
and one then says,
ah-- I am different.

00:38:18.356 --> 00:38:21.430 align:middle line:90%


00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:24.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And THEO, you have
said before, and said, I think,

00:38:24.450 --> 00:38:28.410 align:middle line:84%
earlier in this show, or
maybe it was the last program,

00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:31.340 align:middle line:84%
that we've now entered a
period where we're going

00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:32.700 align:middle line:90%
to be living longer lifespans.

00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And I say that because people
in whatever age group feel

00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:39.690 align:middle line:84%
like, oh, my God,
life has been so long.

00:38:39.690 --> 00:38:42.560 align:middle line:84%
Why did it take me
so long to get this?

00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:45.090 align:middle line:84%
You might only be a short
way through the journey

00:38:45.090 --> 00:38:45.790 align:middle line:90%
at this point.

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's good, I think,
maybe, to remember

00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:50.580 align:middle line:90%
that it's never too late.

00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:54.090 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: It is never too late,
for now is the time for it,

00:38:54.090 --> 00:38:54.590 align:middle line:90%
you see.

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:57.550 align:middle line:84%
It could not have
happened before.

00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:59.460 align:middle line:84%
One would have not
been ready for it.

00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:03.790 align:middle line:84%
One would have not been ready
on many levels of expression,

00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:06.000 align:middle line:84%
but neither would have
the world have been ready.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.980 align:middle line:90%


00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:12.420 align:middle line:84%
For the frequency has
to be a certain level

00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:20.050 align:middle line:84%
of energetic alignment for
this new birth to occur,

00:39:20.050 --> 00:39:22.370 align:middle line:90%
which is occurring now.

00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And those who are embodied,
who have chosen to be incarnate

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:31.705 align:middle line:84%
now, are experiencing
this birthing process,

00:39:31.705 --> 00:39:33.970 align:middle line:90%
at whatever age they are.

00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:39.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, if an infant is born,
they are already ready for it.

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:43.250 align:middle line:84%
But there are those
way-showers that come before,

00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:48.010 align:middle line:84%
in the transitional
period or stage,

00:39:48.010 --> 00:39:54.250 align:middle line:84%
to have the understanding
to be good stewards of those

00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:56.801 align:middle line:90%
who are coming now.

00:39:56.801 --> 00:39:57.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:59.070 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:59.070 --> 00:39:59.987 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:39:59.987 --> 00:40:01.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I look forward
to seeing your art.

00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:02.840 align:middle line:90%
Your future art.

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:04.560 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:06.610 align:middle line:90%
I am, too.

00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:08.314 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: It's an unfoldment, yes?

00:40:08.314 --> 00:40:08.980 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:12.660 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: It will be rapid.

00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:14.230 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:15.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:17.950 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for coming forward.

00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:19.200 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: There is an asking?

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:21.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: Would
you like to pick, THEO?

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:27.860 align:middle line:90%


00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:31.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: She looks shocked.

00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:33.800 align:middle line:84%
Someone just said, hey, there's
this thing happening over

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:35.766 align:middle line:90%
there, and you dropped in.

00:40:35.766 --> 00:40:37.890 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I really don't
have a lot of questions.

00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:41.850 align:middle line:90%


00:40:41.850 --> 00:40:44.700 align:middle line:84%
I guess I'll just ask,
what do you think I could

00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:49.219 align:middle line:90%
be working on, to integrate--

00:40:49.219 --> 00:40:50.760 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: You're
working on everything.

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:53.080 align:middle line:84%
You're experiencing
many things now.

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:57.140 align:middle line:90%


00:40:57.140 --> 00:40:58.960 align:middle line:90%
Allow a time for digesting.

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:01.880 align:middle line:90%


00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:08.620 align:middle line:84%
You have gotten much information
in the recent months.

00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:12.090 align:middle line:90%
You are on a quest, as you know.

00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:15.880 align:middle line:84%
Compelled for this greater
expansion of awareness

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:19.590 align:middle line:84%
and understanding
of human experience

00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:26.880 align:middle line:84%
and the integration of the soul,
which is occurring as we speak.

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:31.420 align:middle line:84%
So it is important
that you take time

00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:38.980 align:middle line:84%
to digest and to
allow the absorption.

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:42.890 align:middle line:84%
Just as you eat a meal,
there is necessary time

00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:48.680 align:middle line:84%
for digestive process and the
cells to absorb the nutrients.

00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:50.530 align:middle line:90%
This is no different.

00:41:50.530 --> 00:41:55.250 align:middle line:84%
Your cells, your soul, is
absorbing all the nutrients

00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:59.160 align:middle line:84%
you have given it in this
most recent time of learning.

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:01.790 align:middle line:90%
It is a continuum.

00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:04.800 align:middle line:90%
But allow for that as well.

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:10.085 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Is my soul an
old soul, or a new soul,

00:42:10.085 --> 00:42:14.400 align:middle line:84%
or-- because I've been told
I'm a pretty emotional person.

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:15.671 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Good.

00:42:15.671 --> 00:42:17.170 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I don't
know about that.

00:42:17.170 --> 00:42:18.770 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: Many people
are told they're

00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:22.215 align:middle line:84%
emotional persons from people
who are afraid of them.

00:42:22.215 --> 00:42:22.840 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:24.340 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:26.640 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: You're not
afraid to emote.

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:29.835 align:middle line:84%
To experience fully what your
soul came here to experience,

00:42:29.835 --> 00:42:31.940 align:middle line:90%
is the learning of emotion.

00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:34.370 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:37.160 align:middle line:84%
It is those who want
to resist emotion

00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:40.990 align:middle line:90%
that judge emotional people.

00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:43.720 align:middle line:84%
So when they say you
are an emotional person,

00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:45.450 align:middle line:90%
say thank you.

00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:46.450 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:42:46.450 --> 00:42:47.950 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:50.920 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: For you've
taken it as judgment.

00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:52.190 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: In some instances.

00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:54.515 align:middle line:84%
I guess it's the
way it's worded.

00:42:54.515 --> 00:42:55.265 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Of course.

00:42:55.265 --> 00:42:58.080 align:middle line:84%
It's not what is said,
it is how it's said, yes?

00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:00.660 align:middle line:90%


00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:04.430 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: And I've been told
by you before to hold my own

00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:10.950 align:middle line:84%
space, because I have older
children that kind of infringe

00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:13.110 align:middle line:90%
on my being, and--

00:43:13.110 --> 00:43:17.560 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: They infringe on
you all over the place, yes.

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:18.810 align:middle line:90%
Financially.

00:43:18.810 --> 00:43:20.990 align:middle line:90%
Emotionally.

00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:25.506 align:middle line:90%
They are a bit self-absorbed.

00:43:25.506 --> 00:43:28.465 align:middle line:90%


00:43:28.465 --> 00:43:28.964 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:43:28.964 --> 00:43:30.780 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:36.740 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: So the power of the word
"no" is very important to you.

00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:39.834 align:middle line:90%
I love you, but no.

00:43:39.834 --> 00:43:41.007 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:43:41.007 --> 00:43:42.340 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Keep holding my own.

00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:43.360 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:44.818 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: Put your
money in the bank.

00:43:44.818 --> 00:43:49.300 align:middle line:90%


00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:55.050 align:middle line:84%
For you will care for you, and
they must care for themselves.

00:43:55.050 --> 00:43:57.780 align:middle line:90%
It's a gift you give them.

00:43:57.780 --> 00:44:04.160 align:middle line:84%
For when you enable
them to use your funds,

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:09.940 align:middle line:84%
you're not empowering them
to manifest in their lives.

00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:13.906 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, that's
a disservice to them.

00:44:13.906 --> 00:44:14.894 align:middle line:90%
Not a gift.

00:44:14.894 --> 00:44:18.144 align:middle line:90%


00:44:18.144 --> 00:44:20.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: I'd like
to ask a question, THEO.

00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:21.809 align:middle line:10%
I'd like you to
speak to the paradox

00:44:21.809 --> 00:44:26.780 align:middle line:10%
that I hear you describing
with her being a very

00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:28.590 align:middle line:10%
emotional person, and
congratulating her

00:44:28.590 --> 00:44:31.460 align:middle line:10%
on being such, and
yet, on the other hand,

00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:33.490 align:middle line:10%
we're talking about
mastering our emotions.

00:44:33.490 --> 00:44:36.450 align:middle line:84%
If you can talk to the
connectivity between the two,

00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:38.090 align:middle line:90%
please.

00:44:38.090 --> 00:44:41.060 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: Recognizing
one's emotions, yes.

00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:43.410 align:middle line:84%
The master of emotion
is first the recognition

00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:47.480 align:middle line:84%
that you have them, and
where they're coming from.

00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:48.900 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And management is what
you're talking about.

00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:54.756 align:middle line:90%
Not being overwhelmed by them.

00:44:54.756 --> 00:44:56.010 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:44:56.010 --> 00:44:57.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, when I was
younger, of course,

00:44:57.710 --> 00:45:02.706 align:middle line:84%
I would be more overwhelmed,
but at this age, I pretty much--

00:45:02.706 --> 00:45:05.080 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: And you're recognizing
where they're coming from.

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:08.260 align:middle line:84%
That's the soul
integrative process, yes?

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:10.622 align:middle line:84%
It's not saying stop
being emotional.

00:45:10.622 --> 00:45:16.950 align:middle line:84%
It's saying, recognizing
that they are there,

00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:21.570 align:middle line:84%
that you have them, and as
you are a master of them,

00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:27.360 align:middle line:84%
you are not overcharged
and reactive.

00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:30.390 align:middle line:84%
You're recognizing how
the emotions get you

00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:34.170 align:middle line:84%
in touch with those
inner aspects of self

00:45:34.170 --> 00:45:40.230 align:middle line:84%
that you can soothe, and then
react differently in situations

00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:43.190 align:middle line:90%
and circumstances of challenge.

00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:45.240 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: And
sometimes I still have--

00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:47.900 align:middle line:84%
of course, my old
patterns will slip in.

00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:48.400 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:49.900 align:middle line:90%
You're human.

00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:52.360 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I
would like to know,

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:54.770 align:middle line:84%
am I still working
on the same patterns

00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:56.420 align:middle line:90%
from previous lifetimes?

00:45:56.420 --> 00:46:00.230 align:middle line:84%
Or is there a pattern that
I should be working on?

00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:02.670 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Oh, they show up.

00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:04.333 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
go looking for them.

00:46:04.333 --> 00:46:07.580 align:middle line:90%


00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:10.740 align:middle line:84%
They've shown up-- those
things that the soul wishes

00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:13.930 align:middle line:90%
to learn and to integrate with.

00:46:13.930 --> 00:46:14.861 align:middle line:90%
Trust that.

00:46:14.861 --> 00:46:15.486 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:46:15.486 --> 00:46:19.300 align:middle line:90%


00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:24.140 align:middle line:84%
Anything else that you
think I should know?

00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:27.360 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: There's been
much given for thought.

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:31.556 align:middle line:84%
It's not our way to overwhelm
to enlighten the path.

00:46:31.556 --> 00:46:33.940 align:middle line:90%
We are complete for this moment.

00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:34.880 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:37.140 align:middle line:90%


00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:39.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: Who will
you be picking next, THEO?

00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:44.282 align:middle line:90%


00:46:44.282 --> 00:46:44.990 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: This one.

00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:49.890 align:middle line:90%


00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:51.552 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:51.552 --> 00:46:52.820 align:middle line:90%
So good to be with you again.

00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:55.820 align:middle line:84%
I have been experiencing
you for a while now,

00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:57.880 align:middle line:90%
and it has been such a pleasure.

00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:00.140 align:middle line:84%
I have been working on soul
integration for a while,

00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:05.120 align:middle line:84%
and I think I have
a knowing of it now.

00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:07.430 align:middle line:84%
What it is to integrate
those little aspects of--

00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:10.060 align:middle line:90%
or big aspects of our self.

00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:11.030 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.796 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:11.796 --> 00:47:14.180 align:middle line:84%
So THEO, what
fascinates me when I

00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:17.660 align:middle line:84%
work with you during the classes
that Sheila and Marcus have

00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:21.390 align:middle line:84%
offered, is that we start
always with an intention.

00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:25.530 align:middle line:84%
So could you elaborate on
how important intention

00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:31.050 align:middle line:84%
is when we are working
to soothe those orphans,

00:47:31.050 --> 00:47:35.391 align:middle line:84%
or to actually allow
them to come out?

00:47:35.391 --> 00:47:35.890 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Ah.

00:47:35.890 --> 00:47:36.473 align:middle line:90%
The intention.

00:47:36.473 --> 00:47:40.300 align:middle line:84%
It is a decision, is
what we speak about.

00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:42.880 align:middle line:84%
Once the decision
is made that one

00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:46.410 align:middle line:84%
wishes to come into
the wholeness of being,

00:47:46.410 --> 00:47:50.610 align:middle line:84%
that intention allows for
them to surface in a way

00:47:50.610 --> 00:47:54.660 align:middle line:84%
that one can pay attention,
no longer unconscious to one's

00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:59.970 align:middle line:84%
reaction to life, but more
empowered by the recognition

00:47:59.970 --> 00:48:02.800 align:middle line:90%
of who is reacting.

00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:04.220 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:08.320 align:middle line:84%
So the intention that you have
made is to be in that wholeness

00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:14.987 align:middle line:84%
and to walk in that completeness
in the calmness of your soul.

00:48:14.987 --> 00:48:16.240 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:18.180 align:middle line:90%
Good intent.

00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:23.590 align:middle line:84%
For what is intended and decided
upon, the energy surrounding it

00:48:23.590 --> 00:48:26.530 align:middle line:90%
makes it so.

00:48:26.530 --> 00:48:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And its unfoldment is
very rapid, as you know.

00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:33.860 align:middle line:90%
Life changes.

00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:35.760 align:middle line:90%
For some, dramatically.

00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:40.010 align:middle line:84%
Most often dramatically,
because one is not acting out

00:48:40.010 --> 00:48:43.530 align:middle line:90%
in the manners of the past.

00:48:43.530 --> 00:48:45.840 align:middle line:84%
So that is what is
occurring to you

00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:50.660 align:middle line:84%
and has expanded you
into the now that is

00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:53.242 align:middle line:90%
very fruitful in your teaching.

00:48:53.242 --> 00:48:54.200 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:57.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my life
completely changed

00:48:57.010 --> 00:49:00.260 align:middle line:84%
through soul integration,
just because I

00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:05.140 align:middle line:84%
have peeled so many layers,
and the person that I found--

00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:10.490 align:middle line:84%
or, actually, the soul
that I found that is me--

00:49:10.490 --> 00:49:12.610 align:middle line:84%
is so light compared
to what I have been

00:49:12.610 --> 00:49:14.620 align:middle line:90%
holding for the longest time.

00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:19.362 align:middle line:84%
So I feel like, right
now, I know who I am.

00:49:19.362 --> 00:49:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'm still
discovering who I am,

00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:24.490 align:middle line:84%
and I hope I will always be
in that process of discovery.

00:49:24.490 --> 00:49:26.700 align:middle line:84%
But it's been such
a great adventure,

00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:30.450 align:middle line:84%
even though with intention
came attention, and then came

00:49:30.450 --> 00:49:33.800 align:middle line:84%
resistance, and then-- I
learned all these words--

00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:37.280 align:middle line:84%
intention, attention,
resistance, allowing, and then

00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:39.090 align:middle line:90%
expansion.

00:49:39.090 --> 00:49:40.200 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And coming from where you came
from in your structure of life

00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:50.550 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning, in this
lifetime, to where you are now,

00:49:50.550 --> 00:49:52.780 align:middle line:90%
it's much lighter.

00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:53.280 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:54.571 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm a child of war.

00:49:54.571 --> 00:49:58.890 align:middle line:84%
I came from a lot of
what we would call here

00:49:58.890 --> 00:50:03.340 align:middle line:84%
trauma, so was raised in
war, and a lot of things

00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:05.160 align:middle line:90%
have happened.

00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And I actually can't
find this girl anymore.

00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:09.030 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:11.570 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of good
memories of her,

00:50:11.570 --> 00:50:13.450 align:middle line:90%
but I can't find that vibration.

00:50:13.450 --> 00:50:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And this is what fascinates
me with soul integration,

00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:19.840 align:middle line:84%
is that the vibration
changes so much that I can't

00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:21.410 align:middle line:90%
find that vibration anymore.

00:50:21.410 --> 00:50:24.030 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: You can't find
the fear vibration,

00:50:24.030 --> 00:50:26.550 align:middle line:90%
for it no longer exists.

00:50:26.550 --> 00:50:31.890 align:middle line:84%
For that child of fear,
who came from war,

00:50:31.890 --> 00:50:35.930 align:middle line:84%
who came from a
particular structure,

00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:45.590 align:middle line:84%
and family, a structure
of community and tribe

00:50:45.590 --> 00:50:49.780 align:middle line:84%
that had particular beliefs
of how one should be,

00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:54.110 align:middle line:84%
particularly female, that
you have transformed that

00:50:54.110 --> 00:50:56.680 align:middle line:84%
into the power
person that you are

00:50:56.680 --> 00:51:01.930 align:middle line:84%
to transform generations
in the past and generations

00:51:01.930 --> 00:51:02.900 align:middle line:90%
for the future.

00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:06.780 align:middle line:90%


00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:08.856 align:middle line:84%
It's quite a powerful
time for you.

00:51:08.856 --> 00:51:11.070 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah,
it's a lot of fun.

00:51:11.070 --> 00:51:11.887 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:51:11.887 --> 00:51:13.720 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Now I can
see it's a lot of fun.

00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:18.700 align:middle line:84%
I have to say that when there is
a lot of-- when a lot of things

00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:22.660 align:middle line:84%
are coming to the surface,
it feels like it's never

00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:25.430 align:middle line:84%
going to end because
there's so much grief, also,

00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:31.140 align:middle line:84%
when we recognize those
fragmented aspects.

00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:34.466 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: What it is, is
the release of the old.

00:51:34.466 --> 00:51:37.180 align:middle line:84%
The grief is letting go
of the patterns that have

00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:40.260 align:middle line:90%
served you so long, you see?

00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:43.550 align:middle line:90%
Necessary losses.

00:51:43.550 --> 00:51:46.320 align:middle line:84%
So whenever there's
a loss in life,

00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:50.210 align:middle line:84%
there-- continual growth
in losses of the old

00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:54.030 align:middle line:90%
that pass-- that one grieves.

00:51:54.030 --> 00:51:56.930 align:middle line:90%
It's a natural process.

00:51:56.930 --> 00:52:00.280 align:middle line:84%
But as one moves through
that into the joy

00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:06.700 align:middle line:84%
of living in the now,
there is that reward

00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:12.220 align:middle line:84%
of the effervescence that you
feel and the forward looking

00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:18.320 align:middle line:84%
of new life and experience,
unencumbered from that past.

00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And being the
way-shower, culturally,

00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:28.340 align:middle line:84%
to a new way of being for
your family of origin.

00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:30.450 align:middle line:90%
And their family.

00:52:30.450 --> 00:52:32.970 align:middle line:90%
And their family before that.

00:52:32.970 --> 00:52:36.820 align:middle line:84%
This has been
generationally passed along

00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:40.065 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of years.

00:52:40.065 --> 00:52:42.490 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: So it ends with me.

00:52:42.490 --> 00:52:43.470 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:52:43.470 --> 00:52:44.300 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:44.800 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And THEO, I have
experienced, also,

00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:51.890 align:middle line:84%
during that time of integration,
the physicality changing

00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:54.220 align:middle line:90%
in such a drastic way.

00:52:54.220 --> 00:52:55.880 align:middle line:90%
Not always comfortable.

00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:58.640 align:middle line:84%
So should we trust that,
when moments like that

00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:01.450 align:middle line:90%
happen, we expand physically?

00:53:01.450 --> 00:53:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And I have experienced a lot
of physical expansions-- weight

00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:10.660 align:middle line:84%
gain, vibration,
pulsation-- a lot of things.

00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:14.492 align:middle line:84%
Is that-- we always go to
fear, just because-- I,

00:53:14.492 --> 00:53:15.950 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning,
would go to fear,

00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:21.490 align:middle line:84%
just because it's hard to
know what is happening.

00:53:21.490 --> 00:53:22.930 align:middle line:90%
Is that part of the resistance?

00:53:22.930 --> 00:53:27.140 align:middle line:84%
Or is it just normal to actually
have these physical changes

00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:29.907 align:middle line:84%
as we move our vibrations
in a certain direction?

00:53:29.907 --> 00:53:30.740 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: It's normal.

00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:35.030 align:middle line:84%
The body holds liquid
around its cells

00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:39.010 align:middle line:84%
so it doesn't short circuit
in the nervous system

00:53:39.010 --> 00:53:40.990 align:middle line:84%
as there is this
vibrational shift

00:53:40.990 --> 00:53:44.340 align:middle line:90%
and change that is occurring.

00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:45.860 align:middle line:90%
Note this.

00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:47.660 align:middle line:90%
An infant is born.

00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:48.620 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:53.090 align:middle line:90%
And it's small.

00:53:53.090 --> 00:53:54.050 align:middle line:90%
Very small.

00:53:54.050 --> 00:53:55.240 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: For now.

00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:56.140 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Yes.

00:53:56.140 --> 00:53:58.950 align:middle line:90%
And then it begins to eat.

00:53:58.950 --> 00:54:03.090 align:middle line:84%
And then it becomes quite
pudgy, you might say.

00:54:03.090 --> 00:54:05.260 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:08.070 align:middle line:90%
Very cute pudgy.

00:54:08.070 --> 00:54:12.030 align:middle line:90%
And then it has a growth spurt.

00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:13.260 align:middle line:90%
And it elongates.

00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:15.200 align:middle line:90%
Gets taller.

00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:17.780 align:middle line:90%
And thinner.

00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And stays that way for
a little bit of time.

00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And soon, again, the weight,
the expansion, comes.

00:54:25.930 --> 00:54:28.680 align:middle line:90%
For there's growth coming.

00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:30.590 align:middle line:90%
And then there's more growth.

00:54:30.590 --> 00:54:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And the body elongates,
and the muscles

00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:36.950 align:middle line:84%
get stronger and bigger, and the
bones get longer and stronger

00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:40.430 align:middle line:90%
and bigger, and there's growth.

00:54:40.430 --> 00:54:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And then this body, to its
healthful state, is thin again.

00:54:47.050 --> 00:54:50.510 align:middle line:84%
So there are many
stages of that growth.

00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:52.010 align:middle line:90%
It's true as an adult.

00:54:52.010 --> 00:54:53.281 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Growing pains.

00:54:53.281 --> 00:54:54.530 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: There's growing pains.

00:54:54.530 --> 00:54:58.640 align:middle line:84%
It is growth that is occurring,
that then the body defines

00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:02.070 align:middle line:84%
itself to its most
healthful weight

00:55:02.070 --> 00:55:06.105 align:middle line:84%
as the energetics are
metamorphosed into the cells,

00:55:06.105 --> 00:55:10.180 align:middle line:84%
and the cells have cleansed
the old out of them.

00:55:10.180 --> 00:55:14.680 align:middle line:84%
So it's a continual processes
of rebirth, regeneration,

00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:15.460 align:middle line:90%
and rejuvenation.

00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:16.740 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: For sure.

00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:19.550 align:middle line:90%
For sure.

00:55:19.550 --> 00:55:27.840 align:middle line:84%
My last question, THEO,
is, in my lifetime,

00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:32.640 align:middle line:84%
is it going to be possible for
us to be actually communicating

00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:37.800 align:middle line:84%
with-- like, having other
planets as a part of our life?

00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:40.110 align:middle line:90%
Just because I feel that so--

00:55:40.110 --> 00:55:42.050 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: You already are.

00:55:42.050 --> 00:55:42.910 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing new.

00:55:42.910 --> 00:55:44.760 align:middle line:90%
It's always been.

00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:46.820 align:middle line:84%
What's happening
is, the awareness

00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:51.412 align:middle line:84%
is becoming more acute, so
that then you can see it.

00:55:51.412 --> 00:55:52.120 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:54.091 align:middle line:90%
This is a bit of a-- OK.

00:55:54.091 --> 00:55:54.590 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:55:54.590 --> 00:55:56.820 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: And the acceptance.

00:55:56.820 --> 00:55:58.990 align:middle line:90%
It's always been here.

00:55:58.990 --> 00:56:01.726 align:middle line:84%
The density of the energy
didn't allow its knowing.

00:56:01.726 --> 00:56:06.100 align:middle line:90%


00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:07.570 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:56:07.570 --> 00:56:08.930 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: God's love unto you.

00:56:08.930 --> 00:56:09.550 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: And unto you.

00:56:09.550 --> 00:56:10.260 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, THEO.

00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:10.732 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Good day.

00:56:10.732 --> 00:56:11.676 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Good day to you.

00:56:11.676 --> 00:56:12.176 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:56:12.176 --> 00:56:14.510 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:56:14.510 --> 00:56:17.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, THEO,
thank you so much.

00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:21.780 align:middle line:90%
We are out of linear time.

00:56:21.780 --> 00:56:25.680 align:middle line:84%
So we all wish to thank
you for your helping

00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:28.430 align:middle line:84%
us here today understand some of
these really profound concepts.

00:56:28.430 --> 00:56:31.490 align:middle line:84%
So with that, we will
ask that you release

00:56:31.490 --> 00:56:34.140 align:middle line:90%
yourself to Sheila again.

00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:36.950 align:middle line:84%
>>THEO: We appreciate the
opportunity to be of service.

00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:37.930 align:middle line:90%
It is continuous.

00:56:37.930 --> 00:56:41.827 align:middle line:84%
You may call upon this energy
at all times to assist you.

00:56:41.827 --> 00:56:42.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you, THEO.

00:56:42.910 --> 00:56:44.715 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: God's love unto you.

00:56:44.715 --> 00:56:46.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE:
And you, THEO.

00:56:46.090 --> 00:56:46.832 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:56:46.832 --> 00:56:47.540 align:middle line:90%
>>THEO: Good day.

00:56:47.540 --> 00:56:48.526 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good day.

00:56:48.526 --> 00:57:01.860 align:middle line:90%


00:57:01.860 --> 00:57:02.820 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:05.450 align:middle line:84%
A lot of wonderful
information, once again.

00:57:05.450 --> 00:57:11.140 align:middle line:84%
Very deeply-- I think every
person's question, again,

00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:12.860 align:middle line:90%
relates to all of us.

00:57:12.860 --> 00:57:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And one thing we
didn't talk about,

00:57:14.970 --> 00:57:16.930 align:middle line:84%
because we're about
out of time now,

00:57:16.930 --> 00:57:22.340 align:middle line:84%
is that these kinds of
embracing of aspects of self

00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:25.050 align:middle line:84%
are creating a new-- and
I've interviewed other people

00:57:25.050 --> 00:57:27.010 align:middle line:84%
on this subject-- a
new kind of neural

00:57:27.010 --> 00:57:30.664 align:middle line:84%
networking happening
in the brain itself.

00:57:30.664 --> 00:57:32.455 align:middle line:84%
And that's an important
thing to recognize.

00:57:32.455 --> 00:57:32.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCUS GILLETTE: Yeah.

00:57:32.820 --> 00:57:35.070 align:middle line:84%
THEO's been talking a
lot about that lately.

00:57:35.070 --> 00:57:37.760 align:middle line:10%
There's actually neural
path-- new neural pathways

00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:41.299 align:middle line:10%
moving from fright or flight
into a knowing that something

00:57:41.299 --> 00:57:42.340 align:middle line:10%
great is going to happen.

00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:44.055 align:middle line:10%
It's a very different
way of proceeding.

00:57:44.055 --> 00:57:44.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:57:44.930 --> 00:57:46.070 align:middle line:90%
Well, we are out of time.

00:57:46.070 --> 00:57:47.930 align:middle line:84%
And on that note,
thank you so much--

00:57:47.930 --> 00:57:48.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEILA GILLETTE:
You're welcome.

00:57:48.660 --> 00:57:49.993 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --for both being here.

00:57:49.993 --> 00:57:51.450 align:middle line:84%
And to all of you
in the audience,

00:57:51.450 --> 00:57:55.340 align:middle line:84%
for being vulnerable enough
to allow THEO to see you.

00:57:55.340 --> 00:57:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And so on that, again, thank
you for joining us here

00:57:58.590 --> 00:57:59.330 align:middle line:90%
on Gaiam TV.

00:57:59.330 --> 00:58:01.870 align:middle line:90%
