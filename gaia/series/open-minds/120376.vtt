>>REGINA MEREDITH:
In most of our lives

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.116 align:middle line:10%
there's a moment
when our eyes open

00:00:31.116 --> 00:00:32.490 align:middle line:10%
and we know that
we're surrounded

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.320 align:middle line:10%
by a constant source of love,
healing, and information.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.520 align:middle line:84%
This is when life changes
and grace sets in.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.140 align:middle line:84%
Robbie Holz was by all accounts
living a seemingly graceless

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.960 align:middle line:84%
life when she was
flattened by Hepatitis C.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.420 align:middle line:84%
That's when the miracles
began, and that's what

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.820 align:middle line:90%
set her on her teaching path.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.730 align:middle line:90%
And I loved your book.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.560 align:middle line:84%
It's very personable, and
such a rich, warm story

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.860 align:middle line:84%
about your husband who
has since passed away

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.720 align:middle line:84%
and your own journey from--
wow, you were quite a go getter.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'd say
manic, but I don't

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.550 align:middle line:90%
know that that's the case.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:08.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBBIE HOLZ:
There's a lot of words

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.880 align:middle line:90%
you could use to describe that.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why don't
we do this first

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.020 align:middle line:84%
as a foundation for
why we're doing this

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.550 align:middle line:84%
and why we're talking
about your book.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.770 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
story of your husband

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.890 align:middle line:84%
Gary and how he
encountered the Aborigines

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.840 align:middle line:84%
and how he was invited
in, what they taught him,

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.950 align:middle line:84%
and just take time to introduce
us first to his story which

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.370 align:middle line:90%
then brings your story.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:31.170 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: OK.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.935 align:middle line:10%
And Gary's story is
pretty fascinating.

00:01:32.935 --> 00:01:33.810 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.320 align:middle line:10%
>>HOLZ: He was a
physicist, very much

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.260 align:middle line:10%
a scientist-- pretty much
black and white world.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.700 align:middle line:10%
And he had multiple sclerosis
and became a quadriplegic.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.360 align:middle line:84%
He had no feeling
from the neck down,

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.476 align:middle line:84%
and he was a quadriplegic
for about seven years.

00:01:49.476 --> 00:01:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And then the doctors told him
that he had about two years

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.190 align:middle line:84%
left to live, he actually
had about six months.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.620 align:middle line:84%
So he was pretty desperate
to find answers to survive.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.390 align:middle line:84%
He had a couple children
that he wanted to live for,

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.410 align:middle line:84%
and he went into a
jazz bar that night

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.850 align:middle line:84%
after hearing the news
to soothe his soul.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.570 align:middle line:84%
And he met a naturopathic
woman, a naturopathic doctor

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.290 align:middle line:84%
from Australia, and she told
him about the remote Australian

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.780 align:middle line:84%
Aborigines and how they had
tremendous healing abilities.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.470 align:middle line:84%
And so unlike this scientific
person that he was,

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.420 align:middle line:84%
he was just so
desperate to stay alive

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.700 align:middle line:84%
that he called the
number that she

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.174 align:middle line:84%
had of one of the tribesmen and
Ray answered, and he said well,

00:02:28.174 --> 00:02:29.090 align:middle line:90%
what took you so long?

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.090 align:middle line:84%
We've been waiting
for four months.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.680 align:middle line:84%
And Gary had just learned
about them the night before,

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.100 align:middle line:84%
but the Aboriginals
are so tuned in.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.060 align:middle line:84%
They're so tapped into
this one consciousness

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.560 align:middle line:84%
and they had already
brought a woman

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.920 align:middle line:84%
over who was part
English, part Aboriginal.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:43.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Who, Rose?

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:44.347 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: Yes.

00:02:44.347 --> 00:02:44.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:45.650 align:middle line:90%
Ray and Rose.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.100 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: Ray and Rose.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And she knew English so she
could communicate to him

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.160 align:middle line:84%
and they spent the last
four months coming up

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.462 align:middle line:90%
with metaphors.

00:02:57.462 --> 00:02:59.340 align:middle line:84%
They were told by
the big guy, which

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.899 align:middle line:84%
is a genderless term
for God, Goddess, Divine

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:04.440 align:middle line:84%
Source, whatever
you want to call it,

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.471 align:middle line:84%
but they were told
by the big guy

00:03:06.471 --> 00:03:07.970 align:middle line:84%
that they were to
give their healing

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.514 align:middle line:90%
secrets to this man, Gary.

00:03:09.514 --> 00:03:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And he would take it
out into the world.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.846 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
unheard of, really.

00:03:12.846 --> 00:03:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: Totally unheard
of, and actually they

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.250 align:middle line:90%
were quite resistant initially.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.750 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want
to give this-- this

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.850 align:middle line:84%
is ancient wisdom, very powerful
wisdom that had been passed on

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.230 align:middle line:90%
for at least 60,000 years.

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.362 align:middle line:84%
But when they understood that
it was because he could take it

00:03:29.362 --> 00:03:31.320 align:middle line:84%
out into the world and
it would help the world,

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.640 align:middle line:84%
we didn't really understand
how healing worked.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And so this is what they
were happy to do then.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.960 align:middle line:90%
So Gary came there.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.400 align:middle line:84%
He actually was in a
wheelchair, flown like cargo,

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.070 align:middle line:84%
was unlifted from the plane,
and then driven into the Outback

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.460 align:middle line:84%
and spent 10 days with
this particular tribe.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:50.600 align:middle line:90%
Now the tribe was remote.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.990 align:middle line:84%
They had not seen a
white person before.

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:54.590 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it
was so fascinating

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.190 align:middle line:84%
that the little
boys, I think there

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.195 align:middle line:84%
was a little boy that loved
the wheels on his wheelchair.

00:03:59.195 --> 00:04:02.520 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter what culture,
boys are fascinated by wheels.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.150 align:middle line:84%
So he went into that
remote desert Outback

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.620 align:middle line:84%
and came back 10 days
later totally transformed.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.849 align:middle line:84%
He had feeling now, which he
hadn't had in seven years.

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:15.390 align:middle line:84%
So he had the feeling again for
the first time in seven years

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.820 align:middle line:90%
throughout his entire body.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.560 align:middle line:84%
He was really transformed
more emotionally

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.530 align:middle line:90%
and spiritually than anything.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.200 align:middle line:84%
And he clumsily walked
down that airplane aisle

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.520 align:middle line:84%
on his return flight home and
spent the rest of his days

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.310 align:middle line:90%
promoting their healing.

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.440 align:middle line:84%
He had been a
scientist and inventor

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.720 align:middle line:84%
before he went into the
Outback, and he came back

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.960 align:middle line:84%
and got a doctorate
in immunology knowing

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.700 align:middle line:84%
that that would help promote
their healing practices

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.280 align:middle line:90%
and spent the rest of his days.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's
amazing in 10 days

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.320 align:middle line:84%
he went from not feeling
anything from the neck

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.850 align:middle line:84%
down to walking-- some
semblance of walking.

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: And survived another
at least 12 years beyond what

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.480 align:middle line:90%
the doctors told him he would.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.104 align:middle line:84%
So it's a pretty
remarkable transformation.

00:05:02.104 --> 00:05:03.770 align:middle line:84%
I think more than
anything he understood

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.760 align:middle line:84%
why that multiple sclerosis
had happened to him,

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.950 align:middle line:84%
how he had numbed himself
emotionally as a child.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.094 align:middle line:84%
All through his life he
was a very brilliant man

00:05:13.094 --> 00:05:15.010 align:middle line:84%
and he learned how to
numb himself emotionally

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:16.980 align:middle line:84%
until he literally numbed
himself physically,

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.850 align:middle line:84%
so he understood how
that had happened

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:24.230 align:middle line:84%
and how you really needed
to forgive his father

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.680 align:middle line:84%
to be able to start healing
that multiple sclerosis.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.320 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: Well, so after he got
back some other things happened

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.820 align:middle line:90%
with him.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.630 align:middle line:84%
He became a real
conduit for healing.

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.350 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, obviously they were
waiting for him because there

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.480 align:middle line:84%
was something within him that
we had this capability that

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.800 align:middle line:84%
was ready to start blossoming,
but let's talk about what

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.389 align:middle line:90%
happened after he got back.

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:47.930 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: Sure.

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.090 align:middle line:84%
So the Aborigines told him that
he had a lot of healing energy

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.050 align:middle line:84%
traversing through him,
which was new to him,

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.660 align:middle line:84%
and that he also had a solar
angel, a guardian angel,

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.640 align:middle line:84%
solar angel named Julie that
was with him all the time.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.824 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's probably one
of the biggest revelations is

00:06:03.824 --> 00:06:05.740 align:middle line:84%
recognizing there's a
lot of gray that exists,

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.323 align:middle line:84%
but you can't prove
it scientifically.

00:06:07.323 --> 00:06:09.440 align:middle line:84%
That was one of the
big shifts in him.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.670 align:middle line:84%
So he came back from
the Outback and he

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.550 align:middle line:84%
started developing the same
gifts that the Aborigines have.

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.380 align:middle line:84%
He started becoming
telepathic to everything.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:18.960 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know that
the first year we

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.220 align:middle line:84%
were married, which is such an
interesting thing to be married

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:22.840 align:middle line:84%
to a man who's telepathic
to your thoughts

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:23.230 align:middle line:90%
for the first year.

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:24.521 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, right, Naughty.

00:06:24.521 --> 00:06:27.230 align:middle line:90%


00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:31.410 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: And he started people's
skin became transparent to him.

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:32.660 align:middle line:90%
He could see through the skin.

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.890 align:middle line:90%
He could see chakras spinning.

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:38.170 align:middle line:84%
He could see auras,
tumors growing,

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:41.110 align:middle line:84%
and he became this very,
very gifted healer,

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.390 align:middle line:84%
but he was a humble conduit
is what he would tell you.

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.800 align:middle line:84%
He was a humble conduit working
with this solar angel named

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.790 align:middle line:84%
Julie where he could watch
her laser tumors off.

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And she needed to
use him as a conduit

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:56.680 align:middle line:84%
because he was really
good at focusing.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Using his
mind, eyes, senses.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:59.989 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: You bet.

00:06:59.989 --> 00:07:01.530 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so he could
stay really focused

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.810 align:middle line:84%
so she could work through
him, through his eyes

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:08.210 align:middle line:84%
and the energy coming through
him was pretty strong.

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:12.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when you first
came in contact with him

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.075 align:middle line:84%
you were more just
you'd heard of him.

00:07:15.075 --> 00:07:16.200 align:middle line:90%
You were more aware of him.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this was before there
was any personal relationship.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think we need to
probably at this point

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:26.702 align:middle line:84%
take a look at who
you were prior to that

00:07:26.702 --> 00:07:29.160 align:middle line:84%
and what you were doing and
what had happened to your body.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's a
story, that's a trip.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:32.577 align:middle line:90%
That you're alive is shocking.

00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:33.660 align:middle line:90%
I would have been so dead.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: I know, and I
just became a grandmother

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.187 align:middle line:90%
a couple days ago.

00:07:38.187 --> 00:07:39.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Congratulations.

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: Thank you, but I
honestly never thought I

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.590 align:middle line:90%
would--

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:43.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You didn't
even think you were

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:44.700 align:middle line:90%
going to see your child raised.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:45.200 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: No.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.170 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even think I'd
make it to 40 and here I am.

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:49.820 align:middle line:90%
What a gift.

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:52.610 align:middle line:84%
When I delivered
my son 30 years ago

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:54.480 align:middle line:84%
they gave me a
blood transfusion.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.180 align:middle line:84%
It was a rough delivery, and
I got a blood transfusion that

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.140 align:middle line:84%
was tainted with Hepatitis
C. But back then they

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:02.320 align:middle line:84%
didn't know-- they
called it non-A non-B.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:03.940 align:middle line:90%
They didn't even know--

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:04.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: C existed.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: C existed,
and so I ended up

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:11.550 align:middle line:84%
with this actually
often fatal disease

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:13.270 align:middle line:84%
and that almost killed
me, and then they

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:15.050 align:middle line:84%
put me on an experimental
treatment that

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:16.330 align:middle line:90%
almost killed me.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:20.360 align:middle line:84%
And at this point I had
survived some really slim odds,

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.097 align:middle line:84%
but I was really pretty
much a wreck at this point.

00:08:23.097 --> 00:08:25.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's talk about
your lifestyle prior to that.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.110 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: Sure.

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:27.490 align:middle line:84%
There is a reason I
got you to thank point.

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:29.156 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When I said
graceless I simply

00:08:29.156 --> 00:08:32.110 align:middle line:84%
meant that you weren't
living by grace.

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:35.400 align:middle line:84%
You were living by will
and sheer adrenaline,

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.440 align:middle line:84%
running yourself
into the ground.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.720 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: You know, exactly.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:43.590 align:middle line:84%
I was very career-oriented,
raising a young boy

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:44.440 align:middle line:90%
with my husband.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:50.060 align:middle line:84%
We were building a home that
was like 4,000 square foot home

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:52.590 align:middle line:90%
in the midst of all of this.

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:54.580 align:middle line:90%
Working 60 to 80 hours a week.

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: After you
got Hepatitis C.

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:59.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean after you contracted
it but hadn't started even

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:00.860 align:middle line:90%
showing the symptoms yet.

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:03.370 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: Right, but that kind
of extreme living, which

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:06.192 align:middle line:84%
is not uncommon
here in the States--

00:09:06.192 --> 00:09:07.650 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's
probably why you

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:09.440 align:middle line:84%
keep doing it is because
you're surrounded by people

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.290 align:middle line:90%
who are doing the same thing.

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:10.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
it's like oh, God.

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:12.656 align:middle line:84%
They'll think I'm
lazy if I don't do it.

00:09:12.656 --> 00:09:13.793 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: I'm a slacker.

00:09:13.793 --> 00:09:14.543 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:09:14.543 --> 00:09:16.000 align:middle line:90%


00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.180 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: But it was that
pushing the body, never

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.654 align:middle line:90%
listening to what it needs.

00:09:19.654 --> 00:09:21.070 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you
how often I would

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:23.480 align:middle line:84%
work all through the night
and show up at work again

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:27.290 align:middle line:84%
the next day and
feed myself candy

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:31.450 align:middle line:84%
to get through the night as
a reward system, you know.

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And just not really finding
that spiritual connection, just

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:39.660 align:middle line:84%
really in the fast lane and
couldn't go fast enough.

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:43.160 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden this almost dying

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.320 align:middle line:90%
twice changed everything for me.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:48.370 align:middle line:84%
Here I was at 30 facing
questions that a lot of people

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:49.720 align:middle line:90%
don't have to face.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And I kept surviving,
and I didn't

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:52.800 align:middle line:90%
know why I was surviving.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I started
asking, why am I still here?

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And more than
anything, at this point

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.100 align:middle line:84%
after the second time
when I had crashed

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.452 align:middle line:84%
on this experimental treatment
that they put me on--

00:10:02.452 --> 00:10:03.660 align:middle line:90%
and now there was no answers.

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:05.180 align:middle line:84%
Western medicine
had nothing for me.

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:06.596 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was this
the interferon?

00:10:06.596 --> 00:10:08.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: It was a cocktail
mix of interferon,

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:11.870 align:middle line:84%
and I had been on it longer
than anybody on the planet.

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:15.264 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, tell us
what the normal protocol is

00:10:15.264 --> 00:10:16.930 align:middle line:84%
and then tell us what
happened with you.

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:17.700 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: OK.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.070 align:middle line:84%
Well the normal for
this particular cocktail

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:22.600 align:middle line:84%
mix that has interferon
in it, most people

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:26.590 align:middle line:84%
are able to tolerate it about
three months and sometimes six

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:27.570 align:middle line:90%
months.

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think I was on
it for over five years,

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:32.920 align:middle line:90%
and then my system just crashed.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.860 align:middle line:90%
It started attacking itself.

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:37.980 align:middle line:84%
It couldn't tell what was good
stuff and what was bad stuff.

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:40.720 align:middle line:84%
The immune system
was just inflamed.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:45.020 align:middle line:84%
So I was now without any
help from Western medicine.

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.469 align:middle line:84%
They had nothing else in
their magic bag for me,

00:10:47.469 --> 00:10:49.510 align:middle line:84%
and I couldn't finish a
sentence because I didn't

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:50.730 align:middle line:90%
know what I was talking about.

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:52.021 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, your mind went.

00:10:52.021 --> 00:10:53.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: My mind
went, my memory went.

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:54.818 align:middle line:90%
Everything was shutting down.

00:10:54.818 --> 00:10:57.040 align:middle line:84%
I was in bed at
least nine months.

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:59.610 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't walk to the mailbox.

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:04.530 align:middle line:84%
I was really actually
suicidal I was in so much pain

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:05.540 align:middle line:90%
and so miserable.

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:07.810 align:middle line:84%
But it was that
little boy of mine

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:10.620 align:middle line:84%
that motivated me
to find the answers.

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:13.280 align:middle line:84%
I knew he was too
young to remember me

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.830 align:middle line:90%
and I needed to survive.

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:17.490 align:middle line:84%
So I started looking
and discovered

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:20.800 align:middle line:84%
that there's all kinds of
answers out there and actually

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.610 align:middle line:84%
ended up eventually healing
myself of what the doctor said

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:24.940 align:middle line:90%
was incurable.

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:27.590 align:middle line:84%
At that time they said
Hepatitis C is incurable,

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:31.810 align:middle line:84%
and because I'm an overachiever
I also developed fibromyalgia.

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:33.230 align:middle line:90%
And I've healed that as well.

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:35.600 align:middle line:84%
So I healed all of
that, and it put me

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.920 align:middle line:84%
on this path of being passionate
about waking people up

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.640 align:middle line:84%
to the fact that your
body wants to heal.

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:43.290 align:middle line:90%
It's a powerful healer.

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:45.166 align:middle line:84%
You have to figure
out what's stopping

00:11:45.166 --> 00:11:46.290 align:middle line:90%
the healing from happening.

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:47.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, there
were some little angels

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:50.080 align:middle line:84%
of mercy along the way
that helped you get there

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:53.490 align:middle line:84%
and let's talk
about Deirdre first.

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:55.130 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: Yes,
because I was coming

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:59.130 align:middle line:84%
from a very conservative,
Midwestern, Catholic upbringing

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:02.570 align:middle line:84%
and having been listened in--
I worked in the court system

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:05.840 align:middle line:84%
for 25 years, and so I'd
heard all kinds of stories.

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:10.880 align:middle line:84%
Very conservative minded, but
when no one had any answers

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:14.330 align:middle line:84%
for me there was
one woman, you could

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:15.559 align:middle line:90%
call her medical intuitive.

00:12:15.559 --> 00:12:17.350 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that I
even knew what she was.

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:19.808 align:middle line:84%
I just knew that she had been
able to help a friend of mine

00:12:19.808 --> 00:12:21.070 align:middle line:90%
who had fibromyalgia.

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And she caught my attention
when she knew immediately

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:27.480 align:middle line:84%
how many medications
I was on, which

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.149 align:middle line:84%
was like 14, how
many doctors I had,

00:12:30.149 --> 00:12:31.440 align:middle line:90%
which was like 10 or something.

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.565 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're just
in this tiny little body.

00:12:33.565 --> 00:12:35.670 align:middle line:84%
How you didn't die just
of counter implications--

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:37.698 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: I'm a tough
little thing, apparently.

00:12:37.698 --> 00:12:38.448 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, boy.

00:12:38.448 --> 00:12:39.364 align:middle line:90%
Apparently.

00:12:39.364 --> 00:12:40.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: But more
importantly, what

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:42.154 align:middle line:84%
really caught my
attention is she

00:12:42.154 --> 00:12:46.160 align:middle line:84%
started communicating with
my deceased grandfather.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.320 align:middle line:90%
That shook me up.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:51.070 align:middle line:84%
Like the Aborigines had
shaken Gary out of his world,

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:52.500 align:middle line:90%
that shook me up.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:56.540 align:middle line:84%
And she sent me to a woman who
was a naturopathic doctor who

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:58.200 align:middle line:90%
she thought could help me.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.310 align:middle line:90%
And I started getting better.

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:04.030 align:middle line:84%
I just started
taking natural herbs

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:06.207 align:middle line:84%
and I think she was
doing energy work on me.

00:13:06.207 --> 00:13:07.790 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know
what she was doing.

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:09.665 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Had you reached
the end of the road

00:13:09.665 --> 00:13:12.967 align:middle line:84%
for all of even the experimental
protocols allopathic medicine?

00:13:12.967 --> 00:13:13.550 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: Right.

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:14.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
were kind of cooked.

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.221 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: I was cooked, because
everything that they were using

00:13:17.221 --> 00:13:20.039 align:middle line:84%
for Hepatitis C back then
had some form of interferon

00:13:20.039 --> 00:13:22.080 align:middle line:84%
and my body couldn't
tolerate interferon anymore.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.020 align:middle line:90%
So they said we're sorry.

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:26.090 align:middle line:90%
So I was really a wreck.

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:28.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you were in bed
20 hours a day at this point.

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:30.230 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: Oh yeah, for years.

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:31.120 align:middle line:90%
For years.

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.630 align:middle line:90%
I was really a mess.

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:42.030 align:middle line:84%
So I just slowly, slowly
brought myself back to health.

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:44.200 align:middle line:84%
You know, I had to start
learning to love this body

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.180 align:middle line:84%
and listen to it and
give it what it needed.

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And having the help of someone
who was using energy work,

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:53.320 align:middle line:84%
using color therapy on
me, I didn't even know.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:56.020 align:middle line:84%
I just knew that I
was feeling better.

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:58.910 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there was a lot going
on both sides of the veil.

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:02.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, because
you had a destiny.

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:06.460 align:middle line:84%
So you weren't able to do your
job anymore, that was over,

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:09.080 align:middle line:84%
but one thing you
always loved was pets.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:09.580 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: Yes.

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:12.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you really wanted
to work in a veterinary clinic

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.610 align:middle line:90%
with animals.

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:17.400 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: Well, I knew that I
learned how to heal myself

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.150 align:middle line:84%
and so my passion has
always been animals,

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:21.870 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, well, maybe
I can help heal animals,

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:24.550 align:middle line:84%
and so I wanted to go see
what's Western medicine doing.

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:29.930 align:middle line:84%
So I got a job working
with a beautiful vet,

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:31.930 align:middle line:84%
and then that's when Gary
sort of came on board.

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:32.811 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:32.811 --> 00:14:33.310 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:36.110 align:middle line:84%
So now we're at that
point in your life, which

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:38.094 align:middle line:84%
was the pivotal event
in your life really.

00:14:38.094 --> 00:14:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: Yeah, but I
didn't even know it.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
aside from being sick.

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:41.220 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:44.194 align:middle line:90%
So Gary wheels in, OK.

00:14:44.194 --> 00:14:44.860 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: He does.

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:48.490 align:middle line:84%
It was a 4th of July party,
and I had heard about this man.

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:50.160 align:middle line:84%
I'd heard he had
amazing healing gifts,

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.701 align:middle line:84%
but I really wasn't
interested in him

00:14:51.701 --> 00:14:54.750 align:middle line:84%
because we were at this
party, a big picnic,

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:56.300 align:middle line:84%
and there were a
lot of people there

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.840 align:middle line:84%
who were in the healing
realm with animals, animal

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:02.220 align:middle line:84%
communicators, and they were
the ones that I was really

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:03.390 align:middle line:90%
zeroing in on.

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And I just wanted
to soak it all up,

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:07.342 align:middle line:84%
and Gary arrives and
he had a bit of--

00:15:07.342 --> 00:15:09.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Plus there was
another guy there you liked.

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:12.090 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: There was.

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I have a memory
from some details anyway.

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:15.210 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: There was.

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:16.876 align:middle line:84%
There was another guy
at the picnic that

00:15:16.876 --> 00:15:20.100 align:middle line:84%
was just wow, he is
a interesting guy,

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:22.667 align:middle line:84%
he's a good looking
guy, and yeah.

00:15:22.667 --> 00:15:23.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And here's Gary.

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:24.749 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: And here's Gary.

00:15:24.749 --> 00:15:25.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:29.130 align:middle line:84%
Who arrives in a wheelchair,
surrounded by people

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:31.310 align:middle line:90%
that I just had no interest in.

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:34.160 align:middle line:84%
I was happy in my little
corner talking to the animal

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.960 align:middle line:84%
communicators, but
somehow during the evening

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:39.890 align:middle line:84%
we ended up sitting
next to each other.

00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:43.170 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, the first time
he saw me and was introduced

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:48.810 align:middle line:84%
to me he saw all the past
lives flash across my face,

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:50.160 align:middle line:90%
which freaked him out.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.717 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know this
for a long time.

00:15:51.717 --> 00:15:53.550 align:middle line:84%
He told me that, but
nothing happened to me.

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:55.770 align:middle line:90%
I got nothing.

00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:58.180 align:middle line:84%
But then he knew
that I was someone

00:15:58.180 --> 00:15:59.770 align:middle line:84%
that he needed to
be involved with

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:02.040 align:middle line:90%
and that we had a connection.

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:05.560 align:middle line:84%
So he was determined that I
would come and work for him.

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.250 align:middle line:84%
He was going to
open up a clinic,

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:10.030 align:middle line:90%
and I had no interest in it.

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:13.810 align:middle line:84%
But he knew my Achilles
heel was if he taught me

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:16.830 align:middle line:84%
how to heal animals I would
be there in a heartbeat.

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:19.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So OK.

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:21.960 align:middle line:84%
Out of that there were
stories, because he could

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:23.660 align:middle line:90%
do this with animals or people.

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:26.014 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: Right, he started
out on animals really.

00:16:26.014 --> 00:16:27.805 align:middle line:84%
His roommate, and then
he worked on horses.

00:16:27.805 --> 00:16:32.030 align:middle line:90%


00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:32.957 align:middle line:90%
So we started talking.

00:16:32.957 --> 00:16:34.540 align:middle line:84%
I was going to start
to work with him,

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:38.510 align:middle line:84%
and then I come from a big,
Catholic family and one

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:41.460 align:middle line:84%
of my sisters back in the
Midwest was going blind really

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:42.360 align:middle line:90%
quickly.

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:45.325 align:middle line:84%
She had been in an accident
and she lost all her vision

00:16:45.325 --> 00:16:47.700 align:middle line:84%
in one eye and had just a
little bit of peripheral vision

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:50.362 align:middle line:84%
in the other eye and she
was losing that quickly.

00:16:50.362 --> 00:16:52.320 align:middle line:84%
And again, Western medicine
had nothing for it.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.760 align:middle line:90%
It was uveitis.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:57.670 align:middle line:84%
And when he learned about her
he said, well, send her out.

00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:58.870 align:middle line:90%
I think I can help her.

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:02.959 align:middle line:84%
So she flew out trusting me
and he healed her in four days.

00:17:02.959 --> 00:17:05.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, big sick leap of
faith for all of you, really.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:06.197 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: Huge.

00:17:06.197 --> 00:17:07.030 align:middle line:90%
I still remember it.

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:09.119 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to think
about it and not weep,

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:13.010 align:middle line:84%
because I can remember her in
the morning saying, I can see.

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:14.420 align:middle line:90%
I can see.

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And then I knew that he
had done that for me,

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:20.130 align:middle line:84%
and it was like somebody
had just flipped the switch.

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:23.089 align:middle line:84%
I just fell in love
with him instantly.

00:17:23.089 --> 00:17:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And we worked together and
spent our time together.

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:26.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What a gift.

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:26.599 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: Yeah.

00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:27.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:28.700 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
the story of Gunner.

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:30.760 align:middle line:90%
That's a sweet story.

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: Oh my gosh, Gunner.

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:36.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, the first animal
I brought to him

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:39.250 align:middle line:84%
really the fastest way to
my heart is with an animal.

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:41.270 align:middle line:84%
So I was working in this
veterinarian's office,

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:43.710 align:middle line:84%
and there was a
young couple that

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:45.580 align:middle line:84%
brought a little
dog, cute little dog,

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:48.060 align:middle line:84%
kind of looked like
a little Lhasa Apso,

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:51.560 align:middle line:84%
and they had gone on
vacation and they came back

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:55.180 align:middle line:84%
and the dog sitter gave the
dog back-- didn't say a word,

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:58.960 align:middle line:84%
and then they realized that the
dog's spine had been broken.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.610 align:middle line:90%
It was an accident.

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:03.660 align:middle line:84%
It was a developmentally
challenged teenager

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:05.940 align:middle line:84%
who had kicked the dog
out of frustration,

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:09.040 align:middle line:84%
and so they had brought the
dog immediately to the clinic,

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.280 align:middle line:84%
and she took
x-rays, the vet did.

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:11.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She was
dragging her legs.

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:13.514 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: She was
dragging her back legs.

00:18:13.514 --> 00:18:15.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, clearly wasn't working.

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And the veterinarian
took x-rays and realized

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:25.970 align:middle line:84%
it was a broken spine, and very
compassionate veterinarian.

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:27.710 align:middle line:90%
I just loved her so much.

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:30.417 align:middle line:84%
And she said, the best thing
is to put this dog down.

00:18:30.417 --> 00:18:31.500 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing we can do.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.490 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing anybody can do.

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:36.600 align:middle line:84%
And there was just
something in me

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.630 align:middle line:84%
that I just kind of--
when she left the room

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:43.880 align:middle line:84%
and I saw this young man tears
start to come down his cheek,

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.870 align:middle line:84%
something in me said,
maybe Gary can help.

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And so I called him, and I had
never asked him for anything

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:51.520 align:middle line:90%
before, and he rushed over.

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:54.190 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say that
this veterinarian was

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:56.670 align:middle line:84%
compassionate enough
and ego-less enough

00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:58.900 align:middle line:84%
to let this alternative
healer come into her clinic.

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's an
interesting story in itself

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:02.099 align:middle line:90%
that she could do that.

00:19:02.099 --> 00:19:04.639 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: Yeah, and she did it
out of the goodness of her heart

00:19:04.639 --> 00:19:05.910 align:middle line:90%
and to help this little dog.

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And so he came in and he
wheeled in in his wheelchair

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:13.930 align:middle line:84%
and he put his hand on
where the broken spine was.

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And the energy was
flowing out of his hand

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:17.610 align:middle line:90%
into this little dog.

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:19.390 align:middle line:84%
And it was very
interesting, whenever

00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:22.090 align:middle line:84%
he worked with animals they
just always calmed down.

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:24.825 align:middle line:84%
They could just--
they loved that.

00:19:24.825 --> 00:19:26.950 align:middle line:84%
In fact, people would call
it the peaches and cream

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:27.700 align:middle line:90%
treatment.

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:30.340 align:middle line:90%
He just felt so good afterwards.

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:33.300 align:middle line:84%
And so he said, I
think I can help you.

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:35.910 align:middle line:84%
Bring this dog to my
clinic a couple more times.

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And they did, and I think
about the fourth time

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:42.520 align:middle line:84%
little Gunner just stood
up and started walking

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:45.000 align:middle line:90%
on the floors and no problem.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And then they would bring
him back every now and just

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:50.070 align:middle line:90%
for us to see him running.

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:51.594 align:middle line:90%
I think it was a male.

00:19:51.594 --> 00:19:52.510 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to remember.

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:55.820 align:middle line:84%
It's been a few
years, but that's

00:19:55.820 --> 00:20:00.230 align:middle line:84%
when I realized there's really
some amazing things happening.

00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:03.420 align:middle line:84%
And I got the opportunity
to work with him

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:06.410 align:middle line:84%
for a number of years
and witness miraculous

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:07.700 align:middle line:90%
things like that all the time.

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:09.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about what

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:13.490 align:middle line:84%
it was that he was
taught about healing that

00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:16.870 align:middle line:84%
allowed him to be able to
be utilized in this way,

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:19.721 align:middle line:84%
but others as well
can have this ability.

00:20:19.721 --> 00:20:20.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: Yes.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about what

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.770 align:middle line:90%
the Aboriginals taught him.

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:24.630 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: OK.

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:29.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, what I learned
is that he would focus

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:31.230 align:middle line:90%
on that person being well.

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:32.510 align:middle line:90%
He had that vision.

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:35.320 align:middle line:84%
He went to the end result
of them being well, already

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:36.140 align:middle line:90%
healed.

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:39.910 align:middle line:84%
He didn't dwell on
where they are now.

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:41.850 align:middle line:84%
He just went right
to that end-vision

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:43.920 align:middle line:90%
and held that vision for them.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And he just always felt like
he was very humbly the conduit.

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:52.470 align:middle line:84%
He would allow this healing
to flow through him,

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:54.970 align:middle line:84%
and he started out initially
needing to be with the person

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:56.610 align:middle line:84%
where he had to put
his hand on him.

00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And as he opened up to his
gifts and expanded on them,

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:01.570 align:middle line:84%
he got to the point
where he could be remote.

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:03.195 align:middle line:84%
He didn't need to be
in the same place,

00:21:03.195 --> 00:21:06.370 align:middle line:84%
and all he needed was the
city and the first name,

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:09.372 align:middle line:84%
and that was enough for his
solar angel to connect to them.

00:21:09.372 --> 00:21:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And it was interesting how it
just kept growing from there,

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:15.590 align:middle line:90%
and we had files.

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:16.650 align:middle line:90%
Somehow people found us.

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:18.170 align:middle line:90%
We never advertised what we did.

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:21.900 align:middle line:90%


00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:25.640 align:middle line:84%
So we had just these plastic egg
crates, I think you call them,

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:28.330 align:middle line:84%
and they were filled with files,
and we had them on the counter

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:31.760 align:middle line:84%
and it got to the point where
he could just sort of heal them

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:34.520 align:middle line:84%
without even having to go
through each one individually.

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:35.370 align:middle line:90%
It was amazing.

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:37.060 align:middle line:84%
When you have this
high intention

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:39.582 align:middle line:84%
and help from the
other side of the veil.

00:21:39.582 --> 00:21:42.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about what
that actually meant though.

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:45.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when they were telling
him what the magic formula is

00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:46.980 align:middle line:90%
for healing.

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:50.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: Well, you know that's
why the first book, "Secrets

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:53.750 align:middle line:84%
of Aboriginal Healing" gives
the five steps of the Aborigines

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:55.700 align:middle line:84%
wanted us to have,
so that everybody

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:59.720 align:middle line:84%
could have had this information
because their minds are really

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.067 align:middle line:90%
the biggest factor.

00:22:01.067 --> 00:22:02.900 align:middle line:84%
If you don't think
you're going to get well,

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:04.000 align:middle line:90%
chances are you won't.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.490 align:middle line:84%
But what's important
is you needed

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:08.530 align:middle line:84%
to have that alignment of
the body, mind, and spirit.

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:12.670 align:middle line:84%
If your spirit, your soul, is
done in this particular body,

00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:14.760 align:middle line:84%
then it doesn't matter
the other elements.

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.500 align:middle line:84%
You have to have
all three aligned,

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:18.000 align:middle line:84%
but where most
people are missing

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.290 align:middle line:84%
the boat is the
emotional component.

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:23.110 align:middle line:84%
They're not getting
to the emotional core.

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:26.409 align:middle line:84%
There's always an emotional
root, even with my blood

00:22:26.409 --> 00:22:28.950 align:middle line:84%
transfusion, which may have been
quote unquote "an accident,"

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:31.400 align:middle line:84%
or a car accident, there's
always an emotional core

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.510 align:middle line:90%
and a soul connection there.

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:35.189 align:middle line:84%
So the Aborigines
taught us that if you

00:22:35.189 --> 00:22:36.730 align:middle line:84%
don't get to that
emotional root it's

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:38.313 align:middle line:84%
like picking the top
of the dandelion.

00:22:38.313 --> 00:22:39.980 align:middle line:84%
It's going to come
right back again.

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:42.530 align:middle line:90%
So we would talk to people.

00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:46.370 align:middle line:84%
We worked as a team, Gary and I,
where he would send the healing

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:48.730 align:middle line:84%
and I would
communicate with them

00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:51.470 align:middle line:84%
and help them understand
what their emotional core was

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:53.530 align:middle line:84%
and how to uproot
that and actually

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:57.180 align:middle line:84%
get that powerful mind on
board, which is an incredibly

00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:58.530 align:middle line:90%
powerful instrument.

00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:01.170 align:middle line:84%
But not sabotaging, but
actually creating the health,

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:03.320 align:middle line:90%
seeing themselves well.

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:05.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there
was one formula

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:09.432 align:middle line:84%
that was mind plus big guy
equals pretty much anything.

00:23:09.432 --> 00:23:10.140 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: Anything.

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:11.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Any potential.

00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:12.030 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: Absolutely.

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:14.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that
real clarity of focus

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:16.700 align:middle line:84%
is critical in the
healing process.

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:17.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: Yes.

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:17.980 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
become aware of what--

00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:22.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're very conscious of
what we're eating, what we're

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:25.320 align:middle line:84%
drinking, getting
exercise, herbs,

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:26.740 align:middle line:84%
these are all
really good things,

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:29.070 align:middle line:84%
but we need to be
paying attention

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:32.350 align:middle line:84%
to what emotions am I marinating
in on a regular basis.

00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:34.390 align:middle line:84%
Because there are
some emotions that

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:36.420 align:middle line:84%
are going to create
health and wellness

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:39.690 align:middle line:84%
and some emotions that are
going to be creating a stagnant,

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:42.370 align:middle line:84%
which is a perfect breeding
ground for disease.

00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:46.229 align:middle line:84%
So you need to understand that
guilt, and I'm a Catholic gal--

00:23:46.229 --> 00:23:47.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You know guilt.

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:51.880 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: I know guilt. It's
on default mode, I think.

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:54.690 align:middle line:84%
But guilt is one of the most
toxic emotions for the body

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:56.990 align:middle line:84%
to handle, and if
you're creating it

00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:59.410 align:middle line:84%
and you're not releasing
it on a regular basis,

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:01.935 align:middle line:84%
you are creating a perfect
breeding ground for disease.

00:24:01.935 --> 00:24:04.810 align:middle line:90%


00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:06.336 align:middle line:90%
It's really very simple.

00:24:06.336 --> 00:24:07.960 align:middle line:84%
Either it's fear-based
emotions created

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:10.060 align:middle line:84%
by the mind, which
are very unhealthy,

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:12.820 align:middle line:84%
or it's love-based, which
is more heart centered, soul

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:13.620 align:middle line:90%
centered.

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And if you're in these
emotions of compassion,

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:21.450 align:middle line:84%
gratitude is such a beautiful
emotion to heal somebody.

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:22.310 align:middle line:90%
Joy.

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:25.370 align:middle line:84%
You want to heal faster, hang
out in a lot of gratitude,

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:27.360 align:middle line:84%
lot of joy, and
like Gary learned,

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.320 align:middle line:84%
have to totally forgive
everyone involved,

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:32.512 align:middle line:84%
especially yourself or you
can't totally heal from it.

00:24:32.512 --> 00:24:34.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I have interviewed
a couple of other people

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:38.490 align:middle line:84%
that have used a similar
process on one level where again

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:41.760 align:middle line:84%
that clarity of
mind, and again it

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:47.050 align:middle line:84%
was creating that picture of
perfect health or of perfection

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:52.170 align:middle line:84%
and almost collapsing this
reality into that one, so time

00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:53.960 align:middle line:84%
collapses, everything
collapses, that's

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:57.730 align:middle line:84%
why in this kind of healing,
time is completely non-linear.

00:24:57.730 --> 00:24:58.760 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: Exactly.

00:24:58.760 --> 00:24:59.590 align:middle line:90%
That's well put.

00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:01.320 align:middle line:90%
Yes, exactly.

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And I tell people,
go to the end result.

00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:05.780 align:middle line:84%
Don't let your mind get
hung up on the obstacles.

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:08.932 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like how are
we going to do this?

00:25:08.932 --> 00:25:09.640 align:middle line:90%
And I've seen it.

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:13.930 align:middle line:84%
I have seen witnessed
myself seemingly miracles

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:17.950 align:middle line:84%
happen with that simple
technique of collapsing

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:21.520 align:middle line:84%
the current situation
into this ideal reality

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.050 align:middle line:90%
by simply holding it.

00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And the other part of
it is to let it go.

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:28.410 align:middle line:84%
You can't hold
onto it and kind of

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:30.432 align:middle line:84%
try to micro-manage
it in your mind.

00:25:30.432 --> 00:25:31.890 align:middle line:84%
Gee, I hope it
worked and all that.

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:32.770 align:middle line:90%
You have to let it go.

00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:33.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: You have to let it go.

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.846 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's talk
about that component of it,

00:25:35.846 --> 00:25:38.070 align:middle line:84%
because that's where you
let the grace come in

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:41.060 align:middle line:84%
and then the person's
soul intention

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:43.580 align:middle line:84%
has something to do with
this, and talk about that.

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:44.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: Exactly.

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And I really want our audience
to know that most people are

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:50.480 align:middle line:90%
not supposed to be sick.

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:53.080 align:middle line:84%
Sometime it is part of
your soul's destiny.

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:55.780 align:middle line:84%
I needed to go through that
to put me where I am today.

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:57.680 align:middle line:84%
Often children
are born that way.

00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:00.770 align:middle line:84%
Babies come in with these
things, but most of us

00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:02.160 align:middle line:90%
are not supposed to be sick.

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.770 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies are just crumbling
under the emotional weight

00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:06.460 align:middle line:90%
that we're putting them under.

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:09.480 align:middle line:84%
So that's important is that
you have the ability to heal,

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.690 align:middle line:84%
more than likely you
are supposed to heal.

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:12.890 align:middle line:90%
Know that.

00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:13.730 align:middle line:90%
Get your power back.

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:16.520 align:middle line:84%
That's the fourth step of the
aboriginal healing secrets

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:17.532 align:middle line:90%
is take your power back.

00:26:17.532 --> 00:26:19.490 align:middle line:84%
If I had believed what
the doctors had told me,

00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:22.887 align:middle line:84%
that this is incurable, you'll
have it the rest of your life,

00:26:22.887 --> 00:26:24.970 align:middle line:84%
I probably wouldn't have
made it another 10 years.

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:26.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And nor would Gary
have made it an extra 12

00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:27.700 align:middle line:90%
years had he believed that.

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:28.200 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: No.

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:28.720 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:31.420 align:middle line:84%
And I have since
healed that Hepatitis.

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:34.050 align:middle line:84%
The doctors have tested me every
year for at least eight years

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:35.030 align:middle line:90%
and I have not had it.

00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:35.696 align:middle line:90%
I don't have it.

00:26:35.696 --> 00:26:36.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm cured.

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:37.990 align:middle line:90%
So these things are doable.

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:40.250 align:middle line:84%
It's only what they
know at the moment,

00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:43.000 align:middle line:84%
so that's really important
to keep that in mind.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.708 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's
talk about a couple

00:26:44.708 --> 00:26:47.160 align:middle line:84%
of examples where the soul
has its own agenda going on

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.090 align:middle line:84%
and there's a dance
that's happening

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:51.430 align:middle line:84%
between what appears to
be the physical reality

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:53.460 align:middle line:90%
and the unseen.

00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:55.070 align:middle line:84%
And I think one story
you had in there

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:58.810 align:middle line:90%
was the story of little Kevin.

00:26:58.810 --> 00:26:59.530 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: Yes.

00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:00.320 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:05.220 align:middle line:10%
Little Kevin was born
premature, and his eyes

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:07.590 align:middle line:10%
had never really joined.

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:11.880 align:middle line:84%
So they kind of rolled randomly
in his little eye sockets,

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:14.990 align:middle line:84%
which was kind of disturbing
to look at initially,

00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:18.522 align:middle line:84%
and Gary was able to
heal and get those eyes.

00:27:18.522 --> 00:27:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And he knew before he
was going to do it.

00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:23.130 align:middle line:90%
He told me, pay attention today.

00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:24.230 align:middle line:90%
Really watch this.

00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:27.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He knew the
day that the big click in

00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:28.410 align:middle line:90%
was going to happen.

00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:30.220 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: And he also
knew it with my sister.

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:31.310 align:middle line:90%
He told me the night before.

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:33.059 align:middle line:84%
Don't tell her, but
tomorrow morning she's

00:27:33.059 --> 00:27:34.280 align:middle line:90%
going to wake up different.

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:35.770 align:middle line:90%
And he knew that with Kevin too.

00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And so sure enough,
they all of a sudden

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:39.540 align:middle line:90%
they locked into place.

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:42.040 align:middle line:84%
And now, the next thing
was to get that vision

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:43.310 align:middle line:90%
to start coming through.

00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:45.477 align:middle line:84%
And Gary kept trying and
he couldn't get the vision.

00:27:45.477 --> 00:27:47.851 align:middle line:84%
He's like, I don't know why
this little boy isn't seeing.

00:27:47.851 --> 00:27:49.170 align:middle line:90%
He should be seeing by now.

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And what we realized when we
asked Kevin one time, Kevin,

00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:58.390 align:middle line:84%
what would happen
if you could see?

00:27:58.390 --> 00:28:00.050 align:middle line:84%
What would happen
if you could see?

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:01.050 align:middle line:90%
And he thought about it.

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:01.915 align:middle line:90%
He was just a little bitty guy.

00:28:01.915 --> 00:28:03.630 align:middle line:84%
I think he was like
four-years-old, three

00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:04.630 align:middle line:90%
or four-years-old.

00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:08.010 align:middle line:84%
He said, I'd have
to play by myself.

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:11.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because his grandpa
was his constant companion.

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:14.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: Somebody was always
with him because he was blind.

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:18.930 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't see, and he
didn't want to be by himself.

00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:21.407 align:middle line:84%
So there was that
resistance to healing.

00:28:21.407 --> 00:28:23.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we have
to pay attention to,

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:26.561 align:middle line:84%
is there resistance to healing
subconsciously or consciously

00:28:26.561 --> 00:28:27.060 align:middle line:90%
going.

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:29.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Whatever happened
with Kevin, anyway?

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:32.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: You know, I was in
touch with the grandfather

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:37.040 align:middle line:84%
for a while, and we just
check-base, see how he's doing.

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And so he said, well, every
now and then I ask him,

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:41.750 align:middle line:84%
Kevin you going to turn
your eyes on today?

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:44.150 align:middle line:90%
And Kevin just wasn't ready.

00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:46.270 align:middle line:84%
But we knew that his
vision was improved,

00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:47.924 align:middle line:90%
because he could see things.

00:28:47.924 --> 00:28:50.340 align:middle line:84%
He could pick up little things
he couldn't pick up before,

00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:52.487 align:middle line:84%
and his caregivers also
felt the same thing.

00:28:52.487 --> 00:28:54.320 align:middle line:84%
He's seeing more than
he's letting you know,

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:56.980 align:middle line:84%
but he wasn't ready
to just go totally.

00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:58.800 align:middle line:90%
Wasn't ready to go totally.

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:00.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
happens sometimes

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:04.220 align:middle line:84%
where Gary had an awful lot
of requests for healing,

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:08.800 align:middle line:84%
and there is that portion
that has the ultimate

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:12.370 align:middle line:84%
say in whether a person is going
to continue the healing process

00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:13.727 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:29:13.727 --> 00:29:14.310 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: Right.

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:16.310 align:middle line:84%
It has a lot to do with
their soul's journey.

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:18.500 align:middle line:84%
We need to go through
these experiences

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:22.676 align:middle line:84%
sometimes because it helps
wake us up, shakes us up.

00:29:22.676 --> 00:29:24.050 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like
how bad does it

00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:26.490 align:middle line:84%
have to get before you're
paying attention like me.

00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:31.180 align:middle line:84%
But I think that what people
will recognize with when you've

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:35.630 align:middle line:84%
moved through this you realize
that these illnesses are

00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:37.690 align:middle line:90%
messengers.

00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:39.340 align:middle line:84%
It's not that you
fight the cancer.

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:41.060 align:middle line:90%
The cancer is a messenger.

00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:44.070 align:middle line:84%
It's trying to get your
attention on things that you

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:48.830 align:middle line:84%
need to change in your life,
belief systems, exercise,

00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:51.650 align:middle line:84%
eating whatever, but it's
just simply a messenger.

00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:56.110 align:middle line:84%
And once you get that, you
realize that these challenges

00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:57.854 align:middle line:90%
are your best blessings.

00:29:57.854 --> 00:30:00.020 align:middle line:84%
But it takes a while for
people to get to that point

00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:04.200 align:middle line:84%
where you realize that as a
soul here growing and evolving,

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:07.260 align:middle line:84%
which is really the name of the
game, that's why we're here.

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:11.787 align:middle line:84%
They're beautiful opportunities
for tremendous growth,

00:30:11.787 --> 00:30:12.620 align:middle line:90%
especially the soul.

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:15.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you've had
a number of opportunities

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.290 align:middle line:90%
and along the way.

00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:20.130 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you and Gary--
there was that moment

00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:22.490 align:middle line:84%
that the light switch
just kind of flipped on.

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:24.516 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I love this
guy, and of course, he

00:30:24.516 --> 00:30:25.390 align:middle line:90%
had always loved you.

00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:27.765 align:middle line:84%
He knew from the moment you
met he wanted to be with you.

00:30:27.765 --> 00:30:31.490 align:middle line:84%
You ended up marrying,
but then in your own life

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:34.380 align:middle line:84%
a completely different
reality set in.

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:35.957 align:middle line:90%
You can think, I love this man.

00:30:35.957 --> 00:30:38.040 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter to me
that he's in a wheelchair,

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:42.170 align:middle line:84%
but as it started
becoming more apparent,

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:44.740 align:middle line:84%
this was a huge
lifestyle shift for you.

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And maybe talk about
that-- some of the things

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:51.500 align:middle line:84%
we don't think about, and
also what being incapacitated

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:55.810 align:middle line:84%
to that extent brought to Gary
by way of learning and wisdom,

00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:57.890 align:middle line:90%
and also what it brought to you.

00:30:57.890 --> 00:31:00.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: Well, Gary will
tell you that wheelchair

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:03.960 align:middle line:84%
was the best thing that
ever happened to him.

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:07.390 align:middle line:84%
He will tell you that
it slowed him down,

00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:09.280 align:middle line:84%
and like the
Aborigines, he started

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:12.770 align:middle line:84%
spending a tremendous amount
of time in dream time.

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:15.050 align:middle line:84%
Before, he was a globe
trotting physicist

00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:19.150 align:middle line:84%
working all over the world
for different governments

00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:23.070 align:middle line:84%
and companies and just an
over achiever in every way,

00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:24.490 align:middle line:90%
as I was too.

00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:27.050 align:middle line:84%
And it forced him to
slow down and to really

00:31:27.050 --> 00:31:30.590 align:middle line:84%
connect like the Aborigines
do, to unplug from the mind

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:32.880 align:middle line:84%
and to plug into this
greater consciousness

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.780 align:middle line:90%
and spend hours a day.

00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:37.699 align:middle line:84%
He got to the point where he
was no longer numb to emotions.

00:31:37.699 --> 00:31:39.490 align:middle line:84%
He really came back a
totally different man

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:41.630 align:middle line:90%
from that Outback experience.

00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:43.960 align:middle line:84%
I would find him in
the kitchen with tears

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:48.760 align:middle line:84%
rolling down his face from just
the beauty and awe of life.

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:50.360 align:middle line:90%
That's a rich life.

00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:53.550 align:middle line:84%
That's what they had helped
him understand and develop,

00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:58.390 align:middle line:84%
but marrying a man-- he went
into the Outback in '94.

00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:02.580 align:middle line:84%
I met him in 2001, and by
this time he was in his chair,

00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:03.990 align:middle line:90%
but he had a lot more freedom.

00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:05.860 align:middle line:84%
He still had feeling
throughout his body,

00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:08.490 align:middle line:84%
but he lived in
this beautiful home.

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:09.490 align:middle line:90%
He took care of himself.

00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:11.460 align:middle line:84%
He came to work dressed
in suits every day,

00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:14.430 align:middle line:84%
and he would stand up at
the sink and do exercises.

00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:18.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he was self-sufficient,
but he still had that chair.

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:22.536 align:middle line:84%
And I was, oh my
gosh, my friends

00:32:22.536 --> 00:32:24.160 align:middle line:84%
accuse me of being
a chipmunk on crack.

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:27.510 align:middle line:90%
I have so much energy now.

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:31.129 align:middle line:84%
And I'm used to just
moving, moving, moving.

00:32:31.129 --> 00:32:32.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Buzzing through life.

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:34.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: Buzzing
through life, right.

00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden when I
fell in love with this man who

00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:40.610 align:middle line:84%
happened to be in a wheelchair,
the wheelchair didn't matter.

00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:42.470 align:middle line:90%
I knew what I was up against.

00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:45.020 align:middle line:84%
I had been a court
reporter for many years,

00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:46.880 align:middle line:84%
and I had taken an
all day deposition

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:49.610 align:middle line:90%
of a man who had become numb.

00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:52.420 align:middle line:84%
He'd become a
quadriplegic as well.

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And we heard in great detail,
we actually went to his home--

00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:58.280 align:middle line:84%
all the attorneys
and I-- and heard

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:01.920 align:middle line:84%
intimate details
of this man's life,

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:03.930 align:middle line:90%
and it rocked all of our worlds.

00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:07.950 align:middle line:84%
We came back very compassionate
and feeling very grateful

00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:11.490 align:middle line:84%
for our lives, because
that life slows down.

00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:14.120 align:middle line:90%
Everything is an effort.

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:17.610 align:middle line:84%
With Gary just to go to the
restaurant, it's a big deal.

00:33:17.610 --> 00:33:18.840 align:middle line:90%
It takes time.

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:21.340 align:middle line:84%
You can't always
necessarily get to a table.

00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:24.610 align:middle line:84%
Just getting him
dressed, it's an hour

00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:26.216 align:middle line:84%
just to get to that
little restaurant.

00:33:26.216 --> 00:33:29.050 align:middle line:90%


00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:32.470 align:middle line:84%
He had years to get adjusted
to this, whereas I just

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:34.980 align:middle line:84%
felt like I'd been
slammed into a wall.

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:38.920 align:middle line:90%
But I needed to slow down.

00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:42.110 align:middle line:84%
That was also something I
had been getting messages

00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:44.860 align:middle line:84%
from my guides
across the other side

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:46.990 align:middle line:90%
of the veil is to slow down.

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:48.170 align:middle line:90%
Slow the mind down.

00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:49.640 align:middle line:90%
Slow your body down.

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:53.990 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say that I'm
getting so much better at that.

00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:55.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
and because you're

00:33:55.920 --> 00:34:00.600 align:middle line:84%
a loving and giving woman,
of course once you arrived

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:02.900 align:middle line:84%
on the scene you
started helping him

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:05.055 align:middle line:90%
compensate in a lot of ways.

00:34:05.055 --> 00:34:06.930 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
that part of the journey

00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:10.116 align:middle line:84%
when we're trying to assist
someone on their journey.

00:34:10.116 --> 00:34:10.699 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: Right.

00:34:10.699 --> 00:34:13.570 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of the dark side
of care-giving, I call it.

00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:17.790 align:middle line:84%
You know, he would reach for
a Kleenex across the table,

00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:20.850 align:middle line:84%
whereas before he would
have to reach for it.

00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:22.960 align:middle line:84%
That was actually a
little bit of therapy.

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And you can't, when
you're a Cancer like me,

00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:28.659 align:middle line:84%
and especially coming
from my family,

00:34:28.659 --> 00:34:30.639 align:middle line:90%
very loving, very care-giving,

00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:34.380 align:middle line:84%
It's so natural for me to push
that Kleenex box toward him,

00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:36.110 align:middle line:84%
and keep alleviating
those things.

00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:38.850 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that the
easier I made life for him,

00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:41.120 align:middle line:90%
the weaker he got physically.

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:44.190 align:middle line:84%
And we started incorporating
a little bit of equipment

00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:45.940 align:middle line:84%
into the house that
made it easier for me.

00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:47.170 align:middle line:90%
He was 6' 2".

00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:48.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm 5' 1".

00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:53.368 align:middle line:84%
And it gets a little
dicey sometimes.

00:34:53.368 --> 00:34:54.909 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Trying to
hold that weight.

00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:57.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: Yeah, and
transferring him, especially

00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:58.604 align:middle line:90%
in the bathrooms.

00:34:58.604 --> 00:35:00.770 align:middle line:84%
It's always a little
nerve-wracking in the bathroom.

00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:02.580 align:middle line:84%
Every transfer, whether
it's into the car

00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:05.830 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's into-- so we
started using a few devices,

00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:08.450 align:middle line:84%
but every time you did
that it weakened his body

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:11.350 align:middle line:84%
a little bit because he wasn't
having to do those things.

00:35:11.350 --> 00:35:13.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now
he was also keeping

00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:18.160 align:middle line:84%
himself fit, his upper
body and such, by swimming.

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:18.850 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: Right.

00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:20.206 align:middle line:90%
He was swimming.

00:35:20.206 --> 00:35:21.580 align:middle line:84%
He used to be a
marathon swimmer.

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:23.292 align:middle line:90%
He used to swim ocean marathons.

00:35:23.292 --> 00:35:24.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Nice,
strong, upper body.

00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:26.208 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: Beautiful,
beautiful frame.

00:35:26.208 --> 00:35:27.600 align:middle line:90%
That man was gorgeous.

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:29.530 align:middle line:90%
He really had a beautiful frame.

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:30.420 align:middle line:90%
Perfect posture.

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so as you
continued assisting him

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:35.050 align:middle line:84%
his body started
becoming weaker,

00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:38.380 align:middle line:84%
and I was very touched
by this one day

00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:41.970 align:middle line:84%
when you went to the
pool for swimming

00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:46.539 align:middle line:84%
and it turned out they couldn't
allow him in the pool anymore.

00:35:46.539 --> 00:35:48.330 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: He didn't have
the strength anymore

00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:50.250 align:middle line:84%
to get in and out
of the pool, to get

00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:52.800 align:middle line:84%
in and out of that
chair that assisted him,

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:55.970 align:middle line:84%
and you know I have to say
that the pool staff were

00:35:55.970 --> 00:35:56.720 align:middle line:90%
so beautiful.

00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:59.210 align:middle line:84%
They really are went
above and beyond

00:35:59.210 --> 00:36:01.680 align:middle line:84%
to help him get
that pool therapy,

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:03.230 align:middle line:84%
but they finally
just said, you know,

00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:05.460 align:middle line:84%
we can't do this
like this anymore.

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:07.720 align:middle line:90%
It's not safe for him.

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And so I knew and
Gary did too that when

00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:13.170 align:middle line:84%
he couldn't exercise anymore
and do that pool therapy

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:15.970 align:middle line:90%
we would start to go down.

00:36:15.970 --> 00:36:17.140 align:middle line:90%
And he did.

00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:17.810 align:middle line:90%
He did.

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:20.090 align:middle line:84%
But he told me a
year before he was

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:23.680 align:middle line:84%
going to pass that he
was being asked to leave.

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:27.200 align:middle line:84%
He told me that he-- and
he was upset about it,

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:28.454 align:middle line:90%
and I was upset about it.

00:36:28.454 --> 00:36:30.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He had gotten
this through a transmission.

00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:33.119 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: Right, because he would
sit and talk to his guardian

00:36:33.119 --> 00:36:36.030 align:middle line:90%
angel Julie hours a day.

00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:39.022 align:middle line:84%
They worked together,
so she told him

00:36:39.022 --> 00:36:40.480 align:middle line:84%
that he would be
leaving in a year.

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.430 align:middle line:84%
He should get his
affairs in order,

00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:45.420 align:middle line:84%
that he was needed more on
the other side of the veil.

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:48.132 align:middle line:84%
And it took us, I don't
know, maybe six months

00:36:48.132 --> 00:36:49.590 align:middle line:84%
to finally come to
terms with that.

00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:51.266 align:middle line:90%
And he did leave a year later.

00:36:51.266 --> 00:36:53.980 align:middle line:90%


00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you were blaming
yourself for enabling him.

00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:57.014 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: I know.

00:36:57.014 --> 00:36:58.934 align:middle line:84%
There is that Catholic
guilt that just--

00:36:58.934 --> 00:37:01.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But in reality, this
was going to happen anyway.

00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:02.641 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: It was going to happen.

00:37:02.641 --> 00:37:04.270 align:middle line:90%
It was part of his journey.

00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:06.876 align:middle line:84%
I think his journey had
been finished in his body.

00:37:06.876 --> 00:37:08.250 align:middle line:84%
He had done what
he needed to do.

00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:10.590 align:middle line:84%
He had passed on
the teachings to me,

00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:12.150 align:middle line:90%
and I was taking them out.

00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:14.650 align:middle line:84%
It got to the point where he
was having so many people come

00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:17.480 align:middle line:84%
to him, and you don't come
to an alternative healer

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:19.297 align:middle line:90%
unless you're stage four cancer.

00:37:19.297 --> 00:37:20.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's your last resort.

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:22.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: Right, and there's
nothing else out there.

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:23.728 align:middle line:84%
And so we were realizing
we were spending

00:37:23.728 --> 00:37:26.570 align:middle line:84%
so much time on helping people
who were really, really sick.

00:37:26.570 --> 00:37:28.850 align:middle line:84%
One day we decided let's
start helping people

00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:31.950 align:middle line:84%
at the other end of that,
teaching them how to stay well,

00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:34.260 align:middle line:84%
and teaching them how
to heal themselves.

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:36.020 align:middle line:90%
So we started doing that.

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:36.999 align:middle line:90%
Big, big difference.

00:37:36.999 --> 00:37:38.540 align:middle line:84%
You Know, when you
can start reaching

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:41.400 align:middle line:84%
large numbers of people and
helping them learn how to heal

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:43.340 align:middle line:90%
themselves, empowering them.

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And so I think what he
felt, it's OK, I can leave.

00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:49.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm taking care of myself.

00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:50.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm loving myself.

00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:51.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm slowing down.

00:37:51.850 --> 00:37:53.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm listening.

00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:56.400 align:middle line:84%
I really think he hung on
until he knew I was OK.

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:57.230 align:middle line:90%
I was fine.

00:37:57.230 --> 00:37:58.900 align:middle line:84%
One thing that I
didn't expect is

00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:01.370 align:middle line:84%
after he passed I didn't
expect that he would continue

00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:02.900 align:middle line:90%
to show up every morning.

00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:06.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh yes, well let's
get to the passing part first,

00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:10.300 align:middle line:84%
and then we're going to go
into what happened after that.

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:12.370 align:middle line:84%
First of all, there was
another thing going on.

00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:15.740 align:middle line:84%
He had this amazing ability
to telepathically communicate

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:18.680 align:middle line:84%
with animals and birds,
including your Cockatiel.

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:20.790 align:middle line:90%
I love that part of the story.

00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:23.917 align:middle line:84%
Remember you were cleaning
up endless amounts of poo

00:38:23.917 --> 00:38:26.880 align:middle line:84%
from your Cockatiels
and he goes and starts

00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:29.486 align:middle line:84%
mentally communicating
with them telepathically.

00:38:29.486 --> 00:38:30.360 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what happens.

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:32.010 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: He did.

00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:34.640 align:middle line:84%
I put it out there to the
universe, let's rescue

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:35.140 align:middle line:90%
something.

00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:37.580 align:middle line:84%
And I was volunteering
at a shelter,

00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:40.070 align:middle line:84%
and I thought it'd be a dog
or a cat that would come home,

00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:42.710 align:middle line:84%
and a little Cockatiel
shows up at our front door.

00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:46.450 align:middle line:84%
And so I can't cage anything,
so we had a big cage

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:51.680 align:middle line:84%
and we got it a mate and it
had fresh branches every day.

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:53.930 align:middle line:90%
But it was a mess to clean up.

00:38:53.930 --> 00:38:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And so Gary was
a very quiet man.

00:38:56.970 --> 00:38:58.000 align:middle line:90%
Very quiet man.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.990 align:middle line:84%
He was very shy, but whatever he
said was very succinct wisdom.

00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:05.550 align:middle line:84%
You just got a lot out of those
five words or seven words.

00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:08.370 align:middle line:84%
So he would just watch me every
morning spend about 15 minutes

00:39:08.370 --> 00:39:10.784 align:middle line:84%
at least cleaning up
from these two birds,

00:39:10.784 --> 00:39:12.200 align:middle line:84%
and then all of a
sudden I noticed

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:17.580 align:middle line:84%
that all the poo is just going
on one spot on a piece of paper

00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:18.570 align:middle line:90%
underneath.

00:39:18.570 --> 00:39:20.750 align:middle line:84%
There was a little
branch that extended out,

00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:22.590 align:middle line:84%
and they were going to
the end of the branch

00:39:22.590 --> 00:39:26.572 align:middle line:84%
and pooping from the end of
the branch to a piece of paper.

00:39:26.572 --> 00:39:28.280 align:middle line:84%
So all I had to do
was pick up the paper.

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And just stuff like
that would happen

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:33.160 align:middle line:84%
that if you didn't say anything
he wouldn't say anything.

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:36.955 align:middle line:84%
So I realized, I'm like, did
you talk to them about that?

00:39:36.955 --> 00:39:38.350 align:middle line:90%
He says, yeah.

00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:40.269 align:middle line:90%
He just communicated to them--

00:39:43.976 --> 00:39:44.940 align:middle line:90%

00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:45.850 align:middle line:90%

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:46.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Little things.

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And what about hummingbirds,
because that hummingbirds

00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:50.494 align:middle line:84%
started playing a big
role in your life.

00:39:50.494 --> 00:39:51.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: It did,
and it still does.

00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:53.160 align:middle line:90%
It still does.

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:54.020 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:39:54.020 --> 00:40:00.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, when he was getting ready
to transition to the other side

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:03.330 align:middle line:84%
we were working with hospice,
beautiful group of people,

00:40:03.330 --> 00:40:06.242 align:middle line:84%
and we were fortunate enough
to be able to have him

00:40:06.242 --> 00:40:07.200 align:middle line:90%
at home when he passed.

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:09.590 align:middle line:84%
But it's not an
easy thing to do.

00:40:09.590 --> 00:40:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And one day he got to the point
where he couldn't join us,

00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:12.960 align:middle line:90%
he was in bed.

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:14.680 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't join us
for meals anymore,

00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:16.960 align:middle line:84%
and that particular
morning I noticed

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:20.220 align:middle line:84%
there was a little hummingbird
outside my kitchen window that

00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:22.790 align:middle line:90%
was watching me eat.

00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And I hadn't noticed
him before, and I just

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:27.800 align:middle line:84%
got that sense, you know, I
wouldn't be surprised if that's

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:29.000 align:middle line:90%
connected to Gary somehow.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.804 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
like the Aborigines

00:40:30.804 --> 00:40:32.470 align:middle line:84%
he could look through
the eyes of others

00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:34.790 align:middle line:84%
right and choose whose
eyes he wanted to use.

00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:37.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: Exactly, and so he
was watching through the eyes

00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:38.630 align:middle line:90%
of the hummingbird.

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And so it was a number of
days where Gary was just

00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:45.130 align:middle line:84%
losing more and
more consciousness,

00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:47.200 align:middle line:84%
and we were getting
close to the end.

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:49.650 align:middle line:84%
And that little hummingbird
stayed there on that branch

00:40:49.650 --> 00:40:51.860 align:middle line:84%
outside my kitchen
window every time

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:54.310 align:middle line:84%
I was eating that little
hummingbird would appear.

00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:59.224 align:middle line:84%
And when Gary passed,
it was so interesting.

00:40:59.224 --> 00:41:00.390 align:middle line:90%
I had left the room briefly.

00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:02.450 align:middle line:84%
Somebody had come to
the door, and as I

00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:04.832 align:middle line:84%
left to go greet them
at the door he passed.

00:41:04.832 --> 00:41:06.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's pretty
common, isn't it?

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:06.850 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: Yes.

00:41:06.850 --> 00:41:09.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When people leave,
when they're finally alone,

00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:10.466 align:middle line:84%
so there's no one
pulling on them.

00:41:10.466 --> 00:41:11.620 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: Exactly.

00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:13.940 align:middle line:84%
They don't have that energy
also holding them back,

00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:18.130 align:middle line:84%
and we noticed that that little
hummingbird had also died

00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:19.942 align:middle line:84%
and it was now
lying on the deck.

00:41:19.942 --> 00:41:21.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Isn't that amazing?

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:23.066 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: And it died at
the same time Gary did,

00:41:23.066 --> 00:41:26.850 align:middle line:84%
so Gary continued to use
the hummingbirds as a way

00:41:26.850 --> 00:41:28.280 align:middle line:90%
to get my attention.

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:29.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: After he passed.

00:41:29.450 --> 00:41:30.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: After he passed.

00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:31.829 align:middle line:84%
And the hummingbird
wasn't the only animal

00:41:31.829 --> 00:41:34.345 align:middle line:84%
in the house that responded
to the moment he was passing.

00:41:34.345 --> 00:41:35.932 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: No.

00:41:35.932 --> 00:41:37.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I would
like you to share

00:41:37.390 --> 00:41:40.580 align:middle line:84%
what happened with the
animals, because we sometimes

00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:43.600 align:middle line:84%
think of them as some kind of
passive ornaments in the house,

00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:45.450 align:middle line:90%
when there are highly tuned in.

00:41:45.450 --> 00:41:46.450 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: Highly tuned in.

00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:48.700 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know he was
going to be passing that day,

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:51.060 align:middle line:90%
but the animals weren't eating.

00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:52.680 align:middle line:90%
They wouldn't eat.

00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:56.180 align:middle line:84%
My dog, Checkers, just
went and laid in his bed.

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:56.980 align:middle line:90%
So he knew.

00:41:56.980 --> 00:41:57.700 align:middle line:90%
He knew.

00:41:57.700 --> 00:42:00.960 align:middle line:84%
And what was fascinating
is that-- and so sad,

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:02.899 align:middle line:84%
it's a challenge
to sit here and not

00:42:02.899 --> 00:42:04.440 align:middle line:84%
tear up when these
things happen when

00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:07.680 align:middle line:84%
I talk about them because they
truly happened-- those two

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:10.930 align:middle line:90%
Cockatiels that we had rescued.

00:42:10.930 --> 00:42:12.770 align:middle line:84%
They used to have
babies all the time.

00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:14.954 align:middle line:84%
They would sit by
Gary and oh my gosh,

00:42:14.954 --> 00:42:17.120 align:middle line:84%
we've had more clutches
than anybody probably should

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:17.742 align:middle line:90%
in a lifetime.

00:42:17.742 --> 00:42:19.200 align:middle line:84%
They would have
babies after babies

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:22.751 align:middle line:90%
and we couldn't keep them all.

00:42:22.751 --> 00:42:24.290 align:middle line:84%
We would bring
them to a woman who

00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:27.920 align:middle line:84%
would humanize them,
at least feed them, so

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:30.870 align:middle line:84%
that they were very tame and
then find good homes for them.

00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:33.990 align:middle line:84%
And so when those
babies were leaving,

00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:35.879 align:middle line:84%
Gary was communicating
to those birds.

00:42:35.879 --> 00:42:37.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When they
were being adopted out.

00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:38.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: When they
were being adopted out

00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:41.130 align:middle line:84%
he would let them know, tomorrow
you're going to be leaving.

00:42:41.130 --> 00:42:42.554 align:middle line:90%
He would talk to the babies.

00:42:42.554 --> 00:42:43.720 align:middle line:90%
He would talk to the mother.

00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:46.315 align:middle line:84%
He would talk to the father, and
he said the mother was always

00:42:46.315 --> 00:42:47.830 align:middle line:90%
just inconsolable.

00:42:47.830 --> 00:42:51.700 align:middle line:84%
The father would sing a song
that he sang only to the babies

00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:53.390 align:middle line:90%
the night before they left.

00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:55.000 align:middle line:90%
It was the most beautiful song.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That was so beautiful.

00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:57.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: And it was
sort of telling them

00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:59.626 align:middle line:84%
what's going to happen
and where they're going

00:42:59.626 --> 00:43:00.860 align:middle line:90%
and they'll be OK.

00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:03.770 align:middle line:84%
And he's only sang
that song that father,

00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:07.390 align:middle line:84%
that Cockatiel, when they were
leaving, the night before.

00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And when Gary passed,
it was so interesting.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.900 align:middle line:84%
All the eggs we had ever had
been healthy, every one of them

00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:17.940 align:middle line:84%
had always hatched and been a
beautiful little baby chick.

00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:20.870 align:middle line:84%
When Gary was getting
ready to pass,

00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:23.550 align:middle line:84%
she had an egg
that never hatched.

00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:26.810 align:middle line:84%
When he was dying,
and that father

00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:32.040 align:middle line:90%
sang the song when he passed.

00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:33.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It was just beautiful.

00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:37.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the interconnectedness
and the love,

00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:40.050 align:middle line:84%
because Gary loved
these animals too.

00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:42.049 align:middle line:84%
It was the love that
bound them and allowed

00:43:42.049 --> 00:43:42.965 align:middle line:90%
for the communication.

00:43:42.965 --> 00:43:44.740 align:middle line:90%


00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:48.990 align:middle line:84%
I just thought that was the
most touching, beautiful thing.

00:43:48.990 --> 00:43:52.900 align:middle line:84%
And so it's as though
he left his body,

00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:56.300 align:middle line:84%
Gary left his body that
day, but it wasn't long

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:59.780 align:middle line:84%
before he came back and you were
fully aware of was presence.

00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:01.800 align:middle line:84%
And like you said, he
was a punctual man.

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:02.985 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: Very punctual man.

00:44:02.985 --> 00:44:04.651 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he was
coming to visit you

00:44:04.651 --> 00:44:06.267 align:middle line:90%
at 8 o'clock every morning.

00:44:06.267 --> 00:44:06.850 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: Right.

00:44:06.850 --> 00:44:10.110 align:middle line:84%
He was a physicists at
heart, and so he was always

00:44:10.110 --> 00:44:10.710 align:middle line:90%
very punctual.

00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:14.078 align:middle line:90%
And I am not.

00:44:14.078 --> 00:44:17.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm always 10 minutes
late, five minutes late,

00:44:17.550 --> 00:44:19.980 align:middle line:84%
and he would show up
after he had passed.

00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:22.780 align:middle line:84%
I did not know he would
continue to show up.

00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:26.250 align:middle line:84%
He would show up at
8:00 every morning.

00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:28.101 align:middle line:90%
Not 7:59 and not 8:01.

00:44:28.101 --> 00:44:29.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us how
you knew, because it

00:44:29.850 --> 00:44:31.558 align:middle line:84%
was another thing
going on when you would

00:44:31.558 --> 00:44:33.300 align:middle line:90%
go into your own internal work.

00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:35.970 align:middle line:84%
You and your sister,
early on when

00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:38.200 align:middle line:84%
he was working on the
two of you to help you

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:40.970 align:middle line:84%
with your health, what
you would both see

00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:43.929 align:middle line:84%
was this eye would show up
in your field of vision.

00:44:43.929 --> 00:44:45.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: Right it
was like an eyeball.

00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:47.630 align:middle line:84%
I first noticed it when
I was taking a shower,

00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:50.780 align:middle line:84%
and I could see it when
I closed my eyes when

00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:52.872 align:middle line:90%
I was shampooing my hair.

00:44:52.872 --> 00:44:54.080 align:middle line:90%
And I could see this eyeball.

00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:57.480 align:middle line:84%
It was very distinct,
and then I just somehow

00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:00.000 align:middle line:84%
knew he's working on
me from the other room.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.960 align:middle line:84%
He's just sending
this healing to me.

00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:04.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you'd call him
on it, and he's say yes, I was.

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:05.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: I'd bust him
for it all the time.

00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:06.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you got you
validation over and over,

00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:08.210 align:middle line:90%
and so did your sister.

00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:10.461 align:middle line:84%
So when this eye showed up,
you knew Gary was present.

00:45:10.461 --> 00:45:12.043 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: I knew Gary
was present, and I

00:45:12.043 --> 00:45:13.920 align:middle line:84%
knew that my sister
could also see that,

00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:16.660 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't know she was seeing
the exact same thing I was.

00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And after he passed I said
draw for me what you're seeing.

00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:22.330 align:middle line:90%
And it's the exact same thing.

00:45:22.330 --> 00:45:23.746 align:middle line:90%
It was the exact same shape.

00:45:23.746 --> 00:45:25.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now is that
part of how you knew

00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:27.610 align:middle line:90%
Gary was there in the morning?

00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:30.400 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: That's how I knew
is I could see that eyeball.

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:33.280 align:middle line:84%
With my eyes closed I could see
that eyeball shape, and I knew.

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And also I could see-- I've
gotten better at seeing energy,

00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:38.980 align:middle line:84%
and I can see it coming
in and every morning I

00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:40.966 align:middle line:90%
can see it downloading into me.

00:45:40.966 --> 00:45:42.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So at
eight on the dot,

00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:46.460 align:middle line:84%
and in the beginning times,
what was he coming through for?

00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:47.440 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: To comfort me.

00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:48.750 align:middle line:90%
To just truly comfort me.

00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:49.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:49.749 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:49.749 --> 00:45:51.710 align:middle line:84%
And he had so many ways
of communicating to me,

00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:53.320 align:middle line:84%
and I would get
better at picking up.

00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:55.300 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden a song
would pop in my head

00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:56.630 align:middle line:90%
that would be our song.

00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:58.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'd hear the
lyrics and I would

00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:03.480 align:middle line:84%
hear in my sort of no words, but
just this knowing, just dance.

00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:04.775 align:middle line:90%
Just dance.

00:46:04.775 --> 00:46:06.400 align:middle line:84%
Close your eyes and
just dance with me.

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:07.608 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Dance to the music.

00:46:07.608 --> 00:46:08.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: Yeah.

00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:10.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because he could dance
once he was out of his body.

00:46:10.670 --> 00:46:12.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: He was a beautiful
dancer earlier it his life,

00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:15.050 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't know
he loved dancing.

00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:18.260 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know that he used to
do ballroom dancing before I

00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:18.849 align:middle line:90%
met him.

00:46:18.849 --> 00:46:20.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it was
interesting, some

00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:24.270 align:middle line:84%
of the people who are a little
bit more psychic or tuned in

00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:26.870 align:middle line:84%
would call me and leave
me these messages.

00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:29.839 align:middle line:84%
Gary showed up and
he's dancing, and he

00:46:29.839 --> 00:46:31.130 align:middle line:90%
wants you to know he's dancing.

00:46:31.130 --> 00:46:33.890 align:middle line:84%
Or people who were a little bit
psychic that didn't know him

00:46:33.890 --> 00:46:36.150 align:middle line:84%
would just say, this
guy won't leave me alone

00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:38.337 align:middle line:84%
until I give you the
message that he's dancing.

00:46:38.337 --> 00:46:40.420 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if that means
anything to you or not,

00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:44.550 align:middle line:84%
but he just wants you know
he's so enjoying the freedom.

00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:46.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's a
beautiful love story.

00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:49.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in the book it is
a beautiful love story.

00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:52.571 align:middle line:84%
But then there came
a time where you now

00:46:52.571 --> 00:46:54.750 align:middle line:84%
were starting to
lecture to large groups,

00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:59.150 align:middle line:84%
it frightened you initially,
especially once Gary was gone.

00:46:59.150 --> 00:47:01.250 align:middle line:84%
You had to get up and
then start carrying

00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:07.977 align:middle line:84%
the messages from the
original peoples forward.

00:47:07.977 --> 00:47:08.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: Right.

00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:10.995 align:middle line:84%
And I had to do it within a
couple weeks after he passed.

00:47:10.995 --> 00:47:12.620 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know if I
could pull that off.

00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And again, I just am learning
to ask for what I need.

00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And so I asked for the strength,
because that was a hard thing

00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:21.870 align:middle line:90%
to do is to talk about this man.

00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:23.900 align:middle line:84%
He was so involved
in the teachings--

00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:25.540 align:middle line:90%
and within a couple of weeks.

00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:28.954 align:middle line:84%
But I've gotten so much
better at asking, telling them

00:47:28.954 --> 00:47:30.870 align:middle line:84%
what I need and allowing
every step of the way

00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:31.980 align:middle line:84%
for that assistance
to come through.

00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:33.855 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
part of the message too.

00:47:33.855 --> 00:47:34.570 align:middle line:90%
We all have this.

00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:35.980 align:middle line:90%
It's available to us all of us.

00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:37.170 align:middle line:90%
All we have to do is ask.

00:47:37.170 --> 00:47:38.314 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: Yes.

00:47:38.314 --> 00:47:40.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, that's a big
part of the teachings even.

00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:41.396 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: Exactly.

00:47:41.396 --> 00:47:44.010 align:middle line:84%
Your mind isn't designed to
know how to do these things.

00:47:44.010 --> 00:47:46.970 align:middle line:84%
It's designed to
balance a checkbook,

00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:49.320 align:middle line:84%
but it's not designed
to know what job-- that

00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:52.400 align:middle line:84%
comes from the soul, that comes
from a higher consciousness.

00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And so I've learned to hand
these things over and allow

00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:57.192 align:middle line:90%
them to guide me.

00:47:57.192 --> 00:47:58.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there
came a time when

00:47:58.650 --> 00:48:03.020 align:middle line:84%
it was your turn to meet with
the Aborigines, with the women.

00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:03.842 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: Yes.

00:48:03.842 --> 00:48:05.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about what happened,

00:48:05.550 --> 00:48:07.330 align:middle line:84%
how that invitation
came, and what

00:48:07.330 --> 00:48:10.160 align:middle line:84%
happened during your experience
because there were a few screw

00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:10.660 align:middle line:90%
ups.

00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:14.145 align:middle line:84%
When they say no talking,
no crossing the line,

00:48:14.145 --> 00:48:16.296 align:middle line:84%
no looking the
elders in the eye,

00:48:16.296 --> 00:48:17.670 align:middle line:84%
there are some
serious protocols.

00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:20.164 align:middle line:90%
This is serious business.

00:48:20.164 --> 00:48:22.330 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: And I've learned
I'm really good at breaking

00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:24.314 align:middle line:90%
protocols and not realizing it.

00:48:24.314 --> 00:48:25.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, joie
de vivre, you know,

00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:27.080 align:middle line:90%
American, and all that.

00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:29.000 align:middle line:84%
But that's not how
these women live,

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.370 align:middle line:84%
and here you're thrown in
the desert with saucer sized

00:48:32.370 --> 00:48:34.010 align:middle line:90%
tarantulas and the rest.

00:48:34.010 --> 00:48:35.450 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: Exactly.

00:48:35.450 --> 00:48:37.116 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So talk
about your experience,

00:48:37.116 --> 00:48:38.880 align:middle line:84%
and what your
breakthrough was, and some

00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:45.490 align:middle line:84%
of the others in this very
dusty, harsh environment

00:48:45.490 --> 00:48:47.640 align:middle line:84%
with these women who
are so focused you

00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:50.140 align:middle line:84%
don't dare look them in the
eye without an invitation.

00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:50.730 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: Right.

00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:53.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, the aboriginal
women had decided

00:48:53.730 --> 00:48:57.470 align:middle line:84%
that they wanted to give their
healing, their ceremonies out,

00:48:57.470 --> 00:49:00.100 align:middle line:84%
that they wanted to invite other
people to start experiencing

00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:00.930 align:middle line:90%
these things.

00:49:00.930 --> 00:49:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And so there was an
invitation sent to I

00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:05.150 align:middle line:84%
think about 20 women
from around the world,

00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:07.980 align:middle line:84%
and I went with a friend of
mine from the United States.

00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:09.830 align:middle line:84%
This is a year after
Gary had passed.

00:49:09.830 --> 00:49:12.590 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that a little suspect
that I would get invited?

00:49:12.590 --> 00:49:14.990 align:middle line:84%
I think Gary was heavily
involved in that,

00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:17.150 align:middle line:90%
so the men didn't want this.

00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:19.140 align:middle line:84%
They really didn't, but
the women prevailed.

00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And so it was going to be
women doing these ceremonies

00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:23.950 align:middle line:84%
and the men would be
outside, because they

00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:25.960 align:middle line:90%
are very powerful ceremonies.

00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And the women would be inside
performing the ceremonies

00:49:29.170 --> 00:49:30.980 align:middle line:84%
with the white
women, and the men

00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:36.800 align:middle line:84%
would be on another area
keeping us grounded.

00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And when we got
there I just remember

00:49:39.110 --> 00:49:41.200 align:middle line:84%
thinking, I don't know
what I'm doing here,

00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:43.140 align:middle line:90%
because it just felt so foreign.

00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:46.180 align:middle line:84%
It just felt like I had landed
on Mars, because it's red dirt.

00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:47.310 align:middle line:90%
It's very harsh.

00:49:47.310 --> 00:49:50.200 align:middle line:84%
If you touch anything it'll
splinter off into your hand

00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:54.430 align:middle line:84%
because it's been baking
in this 120 degree heat.

00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:56.160 align:middle line:90%
It's freezing at night.

00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:58.990 align:middle line:84%
It's hot during the day
with all these insects

00:49:58.990 --> 00:50:03.690 align:middle line:84%
and there's wild camels,
there's wild pigs,

00:50:03.690 --> 00:50:07.880 align:middle line:84%
there are literally spiders
as big as a dinner plate,

00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:13.130 align:middle line:84%
and their body is as big as
your hand, dangerous snakes--

00:50:13.130 --> 00:50:15.219 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And all
you white women are--

00:50:15.219 --> 00:50:16.510 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: Thinking what did I do.

00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:19.106 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Trying to put a
little bit of sunblock on.

00:50:19.106 --> 00:50:19.856 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: Chapstick.

00:50:19.856 --> 00:50:22.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But interestingly too
you needed a lot of sunblock,

00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:25.890 align:middle line:84%
because when it was
time for ceremony

00:50:25.890 --> 00:50:29.560 align:middle line:84%
you could only
wear a black skirt.

00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:31.860 align:middle line:84%
Both the aboriginal
women and the white women

00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:33.557 align:middle line:90%
could only wear a black skirt.

00:50:33.557 --> 00:50:34.140 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: Right.

00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:35.181 align:middle line:90%
They would call ceremony.

00:50:35.181 --> 00:50:36.067 align:middle line:90%


00:50:36.067 --> 00:50:36.900 align:middle line:90%
It's so interesting.

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:37.755 align:middle line:90%
They're so tuned in.

00:50:37.755 --> 00:50:39.380 align:middle line:84%
It's not like they're
going to tell you

00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:41.360 align:middle line:84%
we're doing this at
five on Saturday,

00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:44.510 align:middle line:84%
they wait until everything
tells them it's correct.

00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And so I knew that they
were sending transmissions

00:50:48.090 --> 00:50:50.757 align:middle line:84%
or raising our vibrations
up to be able to perform

00:50:50.757 --> 00:50:51.590 align:middle line:90%
in these ceremonies.

00:50:51.590 --> 00:50:53.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you were
away from anything

00:50:53.410 --> 00:50:57.530 align:middle line:84%
the modern world would have
to distract you and dirty,

00:50:57.530 --> 00:50:58.500 align:middle line:90%
sometimes hungry.

00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:01.180 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: Oh, I couldn't
believe that they were still

00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:02.490 align:middle line:90%
out there when we got back.

00:51:02.490 --> 00:51:04.970 align:middle line:84%
We were doing this by
Uluru, Ayer's Rock,

00:51:04.970 --> 00:51:06.860 align:middle line:90%
which is a huge vortex.

00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:08.710 align:middle line:90%
Very, very strong energy.

00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And it was a little
frightening, but I

00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:14.382 align:middle line:84%
do remember seeing
a dingo at one point

00:51:14.382 --> 00:51:15.340 align:middle line:90%
when I first got there.

00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:19.690 align:middle line:84%
Because we met them at
night with blazing bonfires,

00:51:19.690 --> 00:51:21.930 align:middle line:84%
and I just remember
feeling comforted

00:51:21.930 --> 00:51:24.250 align:middle line:84%
seeing at a dingo
like oh, of course

00:51:24.250 --> 00:51:26.310 align:middle line:90%
they have dogs as companions.

00:51:26.310 --> 00:51:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And then I saw a young
child, and it was like,

00:51:28.350 --> 00:51:29.558 align:middle line:90%
of course they have children.

00:51:29.558 --> 00:51:30.190 align:middle line:90%
Their mothers.

00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:31.010 align:middle line:90%
You know, they're women.

00:51:31.010 --> 00:51:32.551 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And one
of the little girls

00:51:32.551 --> 00:51:34.830 align:middle line:84%
was actually the one
who was in training

00:51:34.830 --> 00:51:37.210 align:middle line:90%
to take over the position.

00:51:37.210 --> 00:51:38.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: Yes.

00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:40.905 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So tell us what
you learned during that.

00:51:40.905 --> 00:51:42.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because
it was so random.

00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:43.738 align:middle line:84%
It seemed like you
were just trying

00:51:43.738 --> 00:51:45.570 align:middle line:84%
to get by during
the day in the hot,

00:51:45.570 --> 00:51:48.360 align:middle line:84%
and then all of a
sudden it's like now.

00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:49.510 align:middle line:90%
You have to come now.

00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:50.890 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: Right, you rushed there.

00:51:50.890 --> 00:51:51.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Rushed
to the ceremony.

00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:52.320 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: Right.

00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:53.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what
actually-- because there

00:51:53.530 --> 00:51:55.030 align:middle line:90%
wasn't a lot of language.

00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:55.290 align:middle line:90%
There wasn't words spoken.

00:51:55.290 --> 00:51:57.370 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: No, but I knew
they were telepathic.

00:51:57.370 --> 00:51:58.640 align:middle line:90%
I knew they were telepathic.

00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:02.360 align:middle line:84%
I was a little more guarded
probably than the others.

00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:03.880 align:middle line:90%
There was a lot going on.

00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:05.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
was the take-away

00:52:05.410 --> 00:52:08.010 align:middle line:90%
for the group of white women?

00:52:08.010 --> 00:52:09.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: You know
what, I think what

00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:14.370 align:middle line:84%
I noticed is that
the white women,

00:52:14.370 --> 00:52:16.660 align:middle line:84%
we tended to be really
harsh on ourselves.

00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:19.000 align:middle line:84%
I saw women who were
running corporations

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:20.960 align:middle line:84%
and they had young
children, women

00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:22.990 align:middle line:84%
who were running
charitable foundations

00:52:22.990 --> 00:52:25.500 align:middle line:84%
and running marathons, and
they were beating themselves up

00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:27.710 align:middle line:84%
because they were
exhausted, feeling

00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:29.002 align:middle line:90%
like they weren't doing enough.

00:52:29.002 --> 00:52:29.585 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yep.

00:52:29.585 --> 00:52:30.350 align:middle line:90%
That's the thing.

00:52:30.350 --> 00:52:33.137 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: And I think
that what I love about,

00:52:33.137 --> 00:52:34.970 align:middle line:84%
there's so much wisdom
from the Aboriginals.

00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:36.090 align:middle line:90%
There's no criticism.

00:52:36.090 --> 00:52:39.310 align:middle line:84%
There's no judgment,
no comparison,

00:52:39.310 --> 00:52:43.420 align:middle line:90%
you love all of you.

00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:45.950 align:middle line:84%
But what I had experienced
during these powerful

00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:48.102 align:middle line:84%
ceremonies-- and
we're not allowed

00:52:48.102 --> 00:52:49.560 align:middle line:84%
to talk about the
ceremonies, but I

00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:51.600 align:middle line:84%
can talk about my
reaction to them--

00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:54.770 align:middle line:84%
was that I could feel
what they already know,

00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:56.770 align:middle line:90%
and that is that we're all one.

00:52:56.770 --> 00:52:57.950 align:middle line:90%
I could feel it.

00:52:57.950 --> 00:53:01.380 align:middle line:84%
I could feel and actually
sort of see everything blend

00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:02.550 align:middle line:90%
into each other.

00:53:02.550 --> 00:53:06.180 align:middle line:84%
There was no distinction
between the rock

00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:08.830 align:middle line:90%
and the dragonfly or us.

00:53:08.830 --> 00:53:13.790 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing that was
really a huge insight was we

00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:15.640 align:middle line:84%
know so much of
this intellectually,

00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:19.760 align:middle line:84%
but to actually feel it,
feel it, integrate it,

00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:24.700 align:middle line:84%
I really could integrate and
feel the love of Mother Earth.

00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:27.300 align:middle line:84%
I could feel the
love she has for us

00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:31.060 align:middle line:84%
and how she supports us and just
loves us so unconditionally.

00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:33.330 align:middle line:84%
And the Aborigines
all ready knew that.

00:53:33.330 --> 00:53:34.530 align:middle line:90%
They all ready feel that.

00:53:34.530 --> 00:53:36.360 align:middle line:84%
So I got to feel that
during the ceremony.

00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:37.830 align:middle line:90%
That was a big gift.

00:53:37.830 --> 00:53:41.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So after you came
back and now years have passed,

00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:44.266 align:middle line:84%
and what became of your life
and what are you doing now?

00:53:44.266 --> 00:53:45.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've just
published your book

00:53:45.890 --> 00:53:47.917 align:middle line:90%
which took you awhile to write.

00:53:47.917 --> 00:53:48.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: Right.

00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:49.940 align:middle line:84%
I've got two of
them out. "Secrets

00:53:49.940 --> 00:53:53.810 align:middle line:84%
of Aboriginal Healing,"
which is about Gary's

00:53:53.810 --> 00:53:55.620 align:middle line:84%
journey and the
healing practices,

00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:57.890 align:middle line:84%
and now "Aboriginal
Secrets of Awakening,"

00:53:57.890 --> 00:53:59.150 align:middle line:90%
which is my journey.

00:53:59.150 --> 00:54:03.660 align:middle line:84%
My passion is empowering
people and helping them wake up

00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:05.470 align:middle line:90%
from this imprisoned mind.

00:54:05.470 --> 00:54:07.160 align:middle line:84%
Our belief systems
have really got

00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:09.160 align:middle line:84%
us believing a
lot of things that

00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:12.540 align:middle line:84%
are creating a lot of pain,
imprisoning us, taking

00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:13.740 align:middle line:90%
our power away.

00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:15.880 align:middle line:84%
So my passion is
helping them recognize

00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:20.650 align:middle line:84%
how to heal themselves
and taking your power back

00:54:20.650 --> 00:54:24.190 align:middle line:84%
and recognizing when
that mind has hold of you

00:54:24.190 --> 00:54:28.480 align:middle line:84%
and how to step back and just
observe it and let it go.

00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:29.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Don't
let it dictate you.

00:54:29.950 --> 00:54:33.000 align:middle line:84%
And tell us about the
continued presence

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:37.790 align:middle line:84%
of hummingbirds inextricably
inner-twined with Gary.

00:54:37.790 --> 00:54:40.039 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: They are so connected.

00:54:40.039 --> 00:54:41.830 align:middle line:84%
My sister was trying
to decide whether this

00:54:41.830 --> 00:54:43.560 align:middle line:84%
was a new-- she
had to leave now,

00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:46.380 align:middle line:84%
she lived with us for a
little while to help us.

00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And so when she was trying
to find her new apartment

00:54:48.790 --> 00:54:50.540 align:middle line:84%
she wasn't sure, and
a hummingbird just

00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:53.290 align:middle line:84%
buzzed her right in the face
and we hadn't seen any all year.

00:54:53.290 --> 00:54:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, if you
don't understand that.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.250 align:middle line:90%
We both knew it was a sign.

00:54:57.250 --> 00:54:57.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's Gary.

00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:58.250 align:middle line:10%
>>HOLZ: Yeah.

00:54:58.250 --> 00:54:59.826 align:middle line:10%
This is your apartment.

00:54:59.826 --> 00:55:00.950 align:middle line:10%
This is your new apartment.

00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:02.665 align:middle line:84%
So things like that
happen all the time.

00:55:02.665 --> 00:55:04.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're still
in regular communication

00:55:04.790 --> 00:55:05.540 align:middle line:90%
with Gary?

00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:06.570 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: Every day.

00:55:06.570 --> 00:55:08.360 align:middle line:10%
He's a part of my
healing team now.

00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:10.211 align:middle line:10%
He is assisting more
from the other side

00:55:10.211 --> 00:55:11.710 align:middle line:10%
than he could in
the physical realm.

00:55:11.710 --> 00:55:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is he still working
with people-- with you

00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:18.067 align:middle line:84%
individually and
collectively in healing?

00:55:18.067 --> 00:55:19.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLZ: Yes, I have a
beautiful healing team

00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:21.167 align:middle line:90%
and he's part of the team.

00:55:21.167 --> 00:55:21.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:23.140 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful.

00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:26.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you for
sharing your story.

00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:28.120 align:middle line:90%
I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.

00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:32.890 align:middle line:84%
It was a wonderful journey
of love, of healing messages,

00:55:32.890 --> 00:55:35.236 align:middle line:84%
but I think more than
anything, I like the love part.

00:55:35.236 --> 00:55:37.610 align:middle line:90%


00:55:37.610 --> 00:55:38.360 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: Thank you.

00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:39.637 align:middle line:90%
It's been a real pleasure.

00:55:39.637 --> 00:55:41.720 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: To read more
about this heartwarming and

00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:43.340 align:middle line:10%
instructive story,
you can pick up

00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:45.860 align:middle line:10%
a copy of "Aboriginal
Secrets of Awakening"

00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:48.200 align:middle line:10%
and "Secrets of
Aboriginal Healing."

00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:52.400 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.

00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:59.534 align:middle line:90%
