that's what's happening.

They've been comfortable.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.900 align:middle line:90%
They didn't learn grit.

Well, tough.

I don't believe that the
soul's dharma can turn on

>>REGINA: Some of you may have
noticed an increase in what's

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.660 align:middle line:10%
called gaslighting or
narcissistic behavior

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.050 align:middle line:10%
from the ground level to top
officials around the world.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.210 align:middle line:84%
Tiffany Barsotti and
I had a conversation

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.010 align:middle line:84%
about that last time
she was with me.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.690 align:middle line:84%
But now we're going
to look at what

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.320 align:middle line:84%
it takes to break free of these
relationships and tendencies

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.840 align:middle line:84%
and make a higher
commitment to ourselves.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.840 align:middle line:84%
Because ourselves are getting
lost under all of this.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, what is
creating this kind of--

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.420 align:middle line:84%
well, it's almost like a
lack of ethics has occurred.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.030 align:middle line:84%
Personal will, personal morality
that has descended into,

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.490 align:middle line:84%
I want this and
you do what I say.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And this behavior that we
were talking about last time.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's been horribly
disempowering for both

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.500 align:middle line:84%
the people that are acting it
out and the people around them.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.330 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to go into
some even deeper syndromes.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.110 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, I want
to say congratulations.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.450 align:middle line:84%
You just received
your doctorate.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.610 align:middle line:84%
You've been working
on this for so long.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.470 align:middle line:84%
So tell us just a
little bit about how

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.450 align:middle line:84%
that journey wrapped
up for you and what

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.540 align:middle line:90%
you can now do with it.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: Oh,
it's so interesting.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.050 align:middle line:84%
It's 17 years in total
from when it began.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And I got to study with Norm
Shealy and Carolyn Mace.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: And I did
my master's thesis

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.810 align:middle line:84%
on the reticular activating
system, the vagus nerve

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.190 align:middle line:90%
and the alta major chakra.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's wonderful, but
there's no hard science

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.430 align:middle line:90%
to prove my theory with that.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.897 align:middle line:10%
>>BARSOTTI: That there
really is a nexus

00:02:19.897 --> 00:02:21.620 align:middle line:10%
to presence and transcendence.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.000 align:middle line:10%
And embodied ascension,
how we can do that.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.440 align:middle line:10%
So that is work that
continues for me.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.770 align:middle line:90%
But it's not hard research.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:29.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.528 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: So in order
to finish my doctorate,

00:02:31.528 --> 00:02:34.320 align:middle line:84%
I had to choose something else
that is also really important,

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.300 align:middle line:90%
which is our space.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.890 align:middle line:10%
And so essentially, I studied
a sacred object and the effect

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.260 align:middle line:10%
that it has on the
human biofield.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.570 align:middle line:84%
And I used the
biowell to measure--

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:48.595 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wonderful.

00:02:48.595 --> 00:02:49.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: --this
effect, and it

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.740 align:middle line:90%
was statistically significant.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And everybody had very
different experiences, but--

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What was this thing?

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: It was in India.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.960 align:middle line:90%
It's a sri yantra.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And people put their
hands and recite a mantra.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.860 align:middle line:90%
And it's in Ashram in Peetham.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a stone that--
it's called the Durga stone.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.870 align:middle line:84%
And so you recite a
mantra while you're there.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.360 align:middle line:84%
And you put your
hand, close your eyes.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.660 align:middle line:84%
And while you're reciting
the mantra, what comes

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:24.470 align:middle line:90%
is what comes.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And people had all kinds
of different experiences.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.130 align:middle line:84%
Some really just very distant
taking them out there.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.170 align:middle line:90%
And some people got really--

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.380 align:middle line:84%
they felt the ground
underneath them and anyway.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.880 align:middle line:84%
So it was all over the place
as far as personal experiences.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the effect
of sacred geometry,

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.810 align:middle line:84%
sacred space, sacred objects
on the human biofield.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:43.610 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yep.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that can be proved
because Konstantin Korotkov

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.900 align:middle line:84%
invented the biowell
and there were

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.347 align:middle line:90%
others who did similar things.

00:03:49.347 --> 00:03:50.180 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Exactly.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So he said you
could get your proof.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.530 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yeah.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, congratulations.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.140 align:middle line:84%
It's been a long and
amazing journey for you.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.940 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.232 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now here we are
talking about narcissists.

00:03:58.232 --> 00:03:59.150 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.610 align:middle line:84%
And what we have
to assume here is

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.970 align:middle line:84%
we're starting with the premise
that most all of society

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.580 align:middle line:84%
is under some kind
of groupthink spell.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we'd all
like to think, oh, I'm not.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.940 align:middle line:90%
I don't succumb to that.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.760 align:middle line:84%
But it's shocking how well
engineered it has been.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.090 align:middle line:90%
So take it away, Tiffany.

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: There's actually
something called the revelation

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.090 align:middle line:84%
of the method, which
uses a doctrine of what's

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.860 align:middle line:90%
hidden in plain sight.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.720 align:middle line:84%
And this is a way that the
powers that really are seeking

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.780 align:middle line:84%
to have power and
control over humanity

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.820 align:middle line:84%
are using our free will
essentially against us.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.150 align:middle line:84%
So what's the truth
about hermetic laws

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.880 align:middle line:84%
and the revelation of the method
is you have to get buy-in.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.290 align:middle line:84%
So one of a really good way
to get buy-in from a person

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.110 align:middle line:90%
is to induce fear.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.230 align:middle line:84%
And when you induce a fear
and then you give somebody

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.010 align:middle line:84%
a solution within that
fear, even though it may not

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.430 align:middle line:84%
be the solution that you would
do from a sovereign self,

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.810 align:middle line:84%
it is essentially you choosing,
by your own free will,

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.590 align:middle line:84%
to go in whatever direction
you might be choosing.

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.000 align:middle line:84%
One could be into the hands
of the totalitarian control,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.450 align:middle line:84%
and one could be, no, I'm going
to take the freedom route.

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:26.690 align:middle line:84%
So this has to do with what
it is that we consent to.

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, two things.

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.560 align:middle line:84%
First of all,
totalitarian control

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.420 align:middle line:84%
sounds like a very
harsh word, like we're

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:36.380 align:middle line:84%
looking at Italy World
War II or whatnot.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:41.150 align:middle line:84%
But it actually has very,
very fine nuanced tentacles

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.810 align:middle line:84%
and has reached into societies
right now today, including

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:50.000 align:middle line:84%
the United States, and
deep into us individually.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.430 align:middle line:84%
In fact, David Icke,
years ago, called

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.770 align:middle line:90%
it the totalitarian tiptoe.

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:55.880 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes, exactly.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.463 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're marching toward
it a little bit all the time.

00:05:58.463 --> 00:06:00.950 align:middle line:84%
And because it's just
tiptoeing, you don't even

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.120 align:middle line:90%
see what's happening to you.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.140 align:middle line:90%
And he was right.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.910 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: It's the frogs
being boiled in water.

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:05.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.200 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: You're just
gently turning up the heat.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.960 align:middle line:84%
You don't even notice that
that's what's happening.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:09.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to have you
talk about that in a moment,

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.660 align:middle line:84%
about how it's reaching into
our lives and the effects of it

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.350 align:middle line:84%
on our psyche en masse
and even individually.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.770 align:middle line:84%
But I just want to say, you
brought up the word hermetic

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:21.570 align:middle line:90%
earlier.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And I've studied
hermetics for years

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.210 align:middle line:90%
and many, many people have.

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting because
these are simply explaining

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.430 align:middle line:90%
natural law and how it works.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.820 align:middle line:84%
And here you have someone
like Manly P. Hall, which

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:39.330 align:middle line:84%
produces absolutely
beautiful work that you

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.390 align:middle line:84%
can use with deep
conscience and will

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:45.550 align:middle line:84%
to have fabulous outcomes
with hermetic principles.

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:47.460 align:middle line:84%
Then you have
others that, well--

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.350 align:middle line:84%
maybe arguably Alastair
Crowley, for example,

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:54.000 align:middle line:84%
who might be using it for more
controlling purposes, right?

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.090 align:middle line:84%
Same principles--
it's how they're used.

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:59.280 align:middle line:84%
What you're saying
is we're being

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.600 align:middle line:84%
manipulated by the negative use
of what are just natural laws.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.680 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yeah.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.380 align:middle line:84%
The reality is that we
live in a polar universe.

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And there's the
positive and negative.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And even taking
5G, for instance.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.290 align:middle line:84%
On one end of the spectrum,
if from a millimeter wave,

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:18.940 align:middle line:90%
it does horrific damage.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.720 align:middle line:84%
On the other spectrum
of a millimeter wave,

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:22.960 align:middle line:90%
it can be healing.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.580 align:middle line:90%
So same principle.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.860 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there's differences
in the administration

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.960 align:middle line:84%
and there's differences
in how you turn up

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.640 align:middle line:84%
the heat, so to speak,
on what these things are.

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.720 align:middle line:84%
But principally, they work
on the same principles.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:41.550 align:middle line:84%
How something will go into a
cell in order to make a change.

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:42.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's a good
example of something

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:47.490 align:middle line:84%
that we have to
give our consent to

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:51.000 align:middle line:84%
or should have to
give our consent to

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.920 align:middle line:84%
and are not being
given that opportunity.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:53.753 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Correct.

00:07:53.753 --> 00:07:57.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk about
how the totalitarian tiptoe

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:58.750 align:middle line:90%
has tiptoed into our lives.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:07:59.550 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yeah.

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:03.180 align:middle line:84%
So recently I was sitting with
a book that just came out.

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's Mattias Desmet's
book called "The Psychology

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.650 align:middle line:90%
of Totalitarianism."

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's fascinating because
what he's talking about

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.500 align:middle line:84%
is essentially four main
things to watch out for.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And he studied deeply
in these areas.

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:17.910 align:middle line:90%
He's a professor in Belgium.

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And he's been studying
this totalitarian

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.350 align:middle line:90%
tiptoe for his whole career.

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And what he says is that
with generalized loneliness

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:30.660 align:middle line:90%
or isolation--

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.059 align:middle line:90%
that's the first step.

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:34.450 align:middle line:90%
So when we're isolated.

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:35.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:37.950 align:middle line:84%
We just had a big
spate of that globally.

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:41.100 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: Then that gives
way to a lack of meaning.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:45.090 align:middle line:84%
Because if we're not having
connection with each other,

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:47.790 align:middle line:84%
then where are we
deriving meaning?

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And if you're cut
off from your work

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:52.650 align:middle line:84%
or cut off from people
that you love and know

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:54.780 align:middle line:84%
or they're making
different choices than you,

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:55.782 align:middle line:90%
that sets up loneliness.

00:08:55.782 --> 00:08:57.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
maybe that's why we

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.640 align:middle line:84%
started seeing a big
surge of people wearing

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.500 align:middle line:84%
their pajamas to the grocery
store in the middle of the day.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.300 align:middle line:90%
Who cares?

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:04.100 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:05.350 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: I didn't see that.

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:06.240 align:middle line:90%
That's awesome.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.120 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, it probably is that.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.770 align:middle line:84%
Because really, it's
a lack of meaning.

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:11.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: I'm not going
to derive meaning from this.

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And how many people are in jobs
where they're not necessarily

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:19.350 align:middle line:90%
following their soul's passion?

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.660 align:middle line:84%
They're doing jobs
that are just,

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.820 align:middle line:84%
I have to do this for
money, or whatever.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.200 align:middle line:90%
But it's a disconnect in there.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And that further helps
to reduce meaning.

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And then that
ultimately gives way

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:38.040 align:middle line:84%
to this fear and this
free range anxiety

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.530 align:middle line:90%
and fear and discontent.

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And then when you have
that free-floating anxiety

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:47.970 align:middle line:84%
in that way, it's really easy to
start controlling more people.

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And then you have divisiveness
that some people are, well,

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to find my
new group over here out

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:58.900 align:middle line:84%
of my frustration or malcontent
or even sometimes aggression.

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:01.472 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the people that
are, I believe in masks, I

00:10:01.472 --> 00:10:02.430 align:middle line:90%
don't believe in masks.

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:04.200 align:middle line:84%
The people who believe
in the vaccine versus

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.408 align:middle line:90%
don't believe in the vaccine.

00:10:05.408 --> 00:10:07.830 align:middle line:90%
There's these divides happening.

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:12.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost like
the people that want--

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:15.820 align:middle line:84%
that are controlling these
puppet strings, if you will,

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:18.880 align:middle line:84%
that are wanting power
and control over humans,

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.330 align:middle line:84%
they want that
divisiveness to happen.

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:23.130 align:middle line:84%
Because then we're
not in oneness.

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:25.710 align:middle line:84%
We're not in our
deeper connection

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:27.210 align:middle line:90%
and meaning as spiritual beings.

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, which is
where we get a lot of power.

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:33.210 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
something for a moment.

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:38.610 align:middle line:84%
So up until now throughout
history, most of humanity

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:41.430 align:middle line:84%
did jobs that weren't
their dream job, that

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:44.310 align:middle line:90%
weren't their soul's desire.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:49.320 align:middle line:84%
But they were a way to
basically be part of something

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.620 align:middle line:90%
and bring some money home.

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:52.410 align:middle line:90%
That's what humanity has done.

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:56.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, we can certainly see the
corruption in that as a system

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.010 align:middle line:84%
compared to what would
be ideal in a world

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:03.000 align:middle line:84%
where we all express our genius
and trade for what we need.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.800 align:middle line:84%
But this transition
period from moving

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:11.790 align:middle line:84%
away from any sense of
pride, even in a simple job--

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:14.610 align:middle line:84%
which, I mean, I've had
a lot of simple jobs.

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:18.010 align:middle line:84%
Waiting for things to happen
elsewhere, you do a simple job.

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:18.810 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yeah.

00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:21.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But-- and
I don't know how

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:24.760 align:middle line:84%
to say this because it
might be generational.

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:26.580 align:middle line:84%
I thought, well, I've
got a simple job,

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:28.128 align:middle line:90%
but I'm going to be the best.

00:11:28.128 --> 00:11:29.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do the
best I can at it.

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:33.060 align:middle line:84%
If I'm working behind a counter,
I'll make the best whatever.

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:35.730 align:middle line:84%
If I'm selling stuff, I'll
be the best salesperson.

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:37.200 align:middle line:90%
I'll just do my best.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And there was even a sense
of pride in the simplest

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:43.830 align:middle line:84%
little tasks while I
lived my desire, dream,

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:45.220 align:middle line:90%
dharma outside of it.

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.430 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
the breakdown of that

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:49.770 align:middle line:90%
and what this phase is.

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And is it necessary
that people become

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.642 align:middle line:84%
so discontented that they just
don't care about it anymore?

00:11:55.642 --> 00:11:56.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: It's interesting.

00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:00.485 align:middle line:84%
A couple points come to mind
as we're conversing about this.

00:12:00.485 --> 00:12:01.860 align:middle line:84%
Martin Luther
King, first of all,

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:04.500 align:middle line:84%
comes to mind where he's like,
no matter what you're doing,

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:05.778 align:middle line:90%
do the best.

00:12:05.778 --> 00:12:06.945 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's how I feel.

00:12:06.945 --> 00:12:07.745 align:middle line:90%
Do your best.

00:12:07.745 --> 00:12:10.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: Do your best with
whatever it is, absolutely.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.930 align:middle line:84%
What I think is that we're
on a tipping point here

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:15.270 align:middle line:84%
and coming out of clan
mentality of that,

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:18.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do whatever
it was needed by the tribe.

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:19.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:22.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: And now it's
really about individuating.

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:25.200 align:middle line:84%
Carl Jung spoke deeply
to this, about coming

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.000 align:middle line:90%
into this time in humanity.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.610 align:middle line:84%
And also the work
of Carl Calleman

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:31.765 align:middle line:84%
comes to mind, about the
phases of consciousness--

00:12:31.765 --> 00:12:32.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.205 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: --of
the different people

00:12:34.205 --> 00:12:36.330 align:middle line:84%
who were born in these
times generationally, what's

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:37.440 align:middle line:90%
important to them?

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:37.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:39.210 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: And that's shifting.

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:42.840 align:middle line:84%
But throughline in the
way that I'm seeing it

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:46.260 align:middle line:84%
is that individuation
is still key.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And how do we individuate while
keeping wholeness in mind?

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And the Tibetan Master
Djwal Khul-- and I

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:59.580 align:middle line:84%
studied deeply in Alice
Bailey's work and those texts

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.530 align:middle line:90%
of esoteric healing, et cetera.

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And really when you look at
the total of those 24 volumes

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:07.530 align:middle line:90%
that I studied--

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:09.197 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a
couple more than that.

00:13:09.197 --> 00:13:13.200 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, how do
we do group consciousness?

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And my experience of this so
far when working with people

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:20.460 align:middle line:84%
and certainly doing deep dives
by myself is that we have

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:23.350 align:middle line:90%
to have the I-ness involved--

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:24.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:25.567 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: --before
we can really

00:13:25.567 --> 00:13:27.700 align:middle line:90%
do group consciousness well.

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And so it's an and/both kind of
scenario that I see happening.

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:37.110 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we want to develop the I.
Yes, we want to individuate.

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And yes, we want to do the thing
that is for the greater good.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.040 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:41.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:41.670 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yeah.

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:43.045 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But
going to that point

00:13:43.045 --> 00:13:44.380 align:middle line:90%
that I was making a moment ago.

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:47.500 align:middle line:84%
So it's necessary to let
the whole thing fall down.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:48.300 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.175 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
really what's happening.

00:13:50.175 --> 00:13:54.780 align:middle line:84%
So if someone's in my position
not getting to-- but when

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:57.660 align:middle line:84%
I was younger, their money
wasn't coming through

00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:59.970 align:middle line:84%
to fund their
documentary or whatever

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:02.100 align:middle line:84%
and they're stuck
working in a shop.

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:04.660 align:middle line:84%
Right now you'd say, screw
it, I'm not going to show up.

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:05.460 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:06.940 align:middle line:90%
And so then what happens?

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:08.670 align:middle line:90%
So then what happens to society?

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:10.830 align:middle line:84%
Because this is what's
happening now en masse.

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And I do not deny
this may be necessary.

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:18.150 align:middle line:84%
Even if I, on a personal ethics
level, can't understand it,

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:21.630 align:middle line:84%
that it en masse may be
necessary for the whole thing

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:23.200 align:middle line:90%
to fall down.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.000 align:middle line:90%
And it's happening.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.230 align:middle line:84%
People aren't showing
up across the board.

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:27.030 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yeah.

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:30.930 align:middle line:84%
So what I wonder what will
happen with that as we're

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:34.247 align:middle line:84%
seeing this personality
shift where these people

00:14:34.247 --> 00:14:35.830 align:middle line:84%
are just not showing
up for these jobs

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:35.970 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:37.762 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Don't want
to do it anymore, yep.

00:14:37.762 --> 00:14:41.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: Is they've
been comfortable.

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:44.530 align:middle line:84%
Everything has been
for their comfort zone.

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:46.090 align:middle line:90%
They didn't learn grit.

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:47.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:51.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: And so this,
I'm going to make it easy

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.430 align:middle line:90%
on my kid, or I'm going to--

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:56.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't want them to go through
Hard Knocks or whatever.

00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:58.450 align:middle line:90%
Well, tough.

00:14:58.450 --> 00:14:59.830 align:middle line:90%
This is Earth.

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:01.060 align:middle line:90%
This is what we're doing.

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:03.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, but we've
protected one or two

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:07.960 align:middle line:84%
generations of children from
any kind of pressure or stress

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:08.860 align:middle line:90%
or danger.

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:11.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: And now we're
living in the midst of this.

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:14.530 align:middle line:84%
So what I believe-- and this is
my prediction in this moment--

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:18.610 align:middle line:84%
is that when those people
that are just not showing

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:21.250 align:middle line:84%
up and doing the thing and
being part of something

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:24.280 align:middle line:84%
anymore and just want their way
or want to control things out

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:27.280 align:middle line:84%
of their own way
of being or ideals,

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:30.670 align:middle line:84%
when they get
uncomfortable enough, then

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:32.140 align:middle line:90%
maybe they will change.

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:36.640 align:middle line:84%
Or something will shift for
having more of an inclusivity.

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That makes sense.

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:39.183 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:39.183 --> 00:15:41.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: I think that
there is something in that.

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:42.310 align:middle line:90%
And I really wonder--

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:44.640 align:middle line:84%
I'd have to go back and
look at Barbara Hand

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:46.265 align:middle line:90%
Clow and Carl Calleman's work--

00:15:46.265 --> 00:15:46.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:48.400 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: --and see
what they predicted

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.812 align:middle line:84%
for these next phase
of consciousness

00:15:50.812 --> 00:15:52.270 align:middle line:84%
that we're going
to be coming into.

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:53.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:54.580 align:middle line:90%
OK, so let's go to you.

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:55.540 align:middle line:90%
So we had COVID.

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:58.480 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's siloing themselves.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:01.450 align:middle line:84%
So we're all doing
self-enforced realities.

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:02.418 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people--

00:16:02.418 --> 00:16:03.460 align:middle line:90%
yeah, that can feel good.

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:06.100 align:middle line:84%
You can connect with new
people and new groups

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:07.060 align:middle line:90%
online and so forth.

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:08.320 align:middle line:90%
And that happened.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:10.520 align:middle line:84%
And we had all kinds
of results out of that.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:13.247 align:middle line:84%
And so here we have
people now, as you

00:16:13.247 --> 00:16:14.830 align:middle line:84%
say, where a certain
amount of meaning

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:17.080 align:middle line:84%
has been lost because we're
not collecting, gathering.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.070 align:middle line:84%
We're not working
together anymore.

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:21.610 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at these
patterns we were talking about

00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:27.520 align:middle line:84%
in the last show, how this
stranglehold of narcissism,

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:30.070 align:middle line:84%
for example, in
controlling behavior

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:33.070 align:middle line:90%
settled in amongst all this.

00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:37.660 align:middle line:84%
What gave birth to that in
such an out of proportion way

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:40.612 align:middle line:90%
to what used to be?

00:16:40.612 --> 00:16:42.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: I don't
know that I can

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:43.820 align:middle line:90%
answer what gave birth to it.

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:47.230 align:middle line:84%
But what I will
say is what I feel

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:50.260 align:middle line:84%
coming up in a very
real way is making

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.030 align:middle line:90%
the unconscious conscious.

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:56.230 align:middle line:84%
So when we start seeing
patterns of things,

00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:58.390 align:middle line:90%
it becomes really obvious.

00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:01.490 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you cannot
not see this anymore.

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:03.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are people
that still-- yes, they

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:05.200 align:middle line:84%
have a cognitive
dissonance and they

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.550 align:middle line:90%
don't want to actually see it.

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:10.100 align:middle line:84%
So they bury their head
and create a new reality

00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:10.900 align:middle line:90%
about themselves.

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.900 align:middle line:84%
But specifically on the
narcissists and the gaslighting

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:17.290 align:middle line:84%
and this kind of thing,
what I'm noticing is this--

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:19.060 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden,
there's an urgency.

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:22.359 align:middle line:84%
Somebody-- they
are-- many people--

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:24.460 align:middle line:84%
me, too-- this is
happening for me

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:27.640 align:middle line:84%
where I'm getting
super clear on, oh, no,

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:29.202 align:middle line:90%
that is not acceptable behavior.

00:17:29.202 --> 00:17:30.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.490 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: I'm not
doing this anymore.

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:33.823 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm seeing that
with a lot of people actually.

00:17:33.823 --> 00:17:35.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: I do not consent.

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:36.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I don't consent.

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:37.180 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:37.980 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:41.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's really what
the gist of this conversation

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.150 align:middle line:90%
is about, is about consent.

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:45.590 align:middle line:90%
Developing proper consent.

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:47.410 align:middle line:90%
So this moves on to another--

00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:48.265 align:middle line:90%
I love this.

00:17:48.265 --> 00:17:52.000 align:middle line:84%
This phrase that has
been used by Dr. Mario

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.330 align:middle line:84%
Martinez on centenarians
called, inclusive narcissism.

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:57.350 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:59.080 align:middle line:84%
First, talk about his
work a little bit.

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.230 align:middle line:90%
And what does that mean?

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:01.700 align:middle line:90%
Where can narcissism serve us?

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:02.500 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yeah.

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:03.970 align:middle line:90%
We really enjoy him.

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:05.170 align:middle line:90%
He's got a few books out.

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:07.810 align:middle line:84%
And I would like to
say that we can call--

00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:10.450 align:middle line:84%
Paul and I-- Paul Mills
and I, call him a friend.

00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:12.263 align:middle line:84%
He was also just
recently a guest teacher

00:18:12.263 --> 00:18:13.930 align:middle line:84%
on our personal
self-integration course.

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:16.900 align:middle line:84%
So we got to go a little
bit deeper into his work.

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:19.780 align:middle line:84%
So he's done a lot of work
in centenarians and studying

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:20.650 align:middle line:90%
blue zones.

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:24.400 align:middle line:84%
And he's also coming out
of psychoneuroimmunology.

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And he's got his own
methods about biosymbolism

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.200 align:middle line:90%
and biocognition.

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.480 align:middle line:90%
And just really beautiful work.

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:35.290 align:middle line:84%
Specifically, what he speaks to
about an inclusive narcissism

00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:38.350 align:middle line:84%
is-- there's a beautiful
story about him being in Cuba

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:41.230 align:middle line:84%
and studying some of these
people who are above 100.

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And what's so different
about these people?

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:46.720 align:middle line:84%
Why are they celebrating
life in the way

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.190 align:middle line:84%
that they are and really
thriving no matter their age,

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.990 align:middle line:90%
et cetera?

00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:52.330 align:middle line:84%
So what he found is is
that-- this one story where

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:55.090 align:middle line:84%
he's sitting with a gentleman
and it's very-- there's

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:55.930 align:middle line:90%
a lot of ritual.

00:18:55.930 --> 00:19:00.160 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of, yeah,
ritual about what they do.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.510 align:middle line:84%
They celebrate having their
cognac or they celebrate

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:03.310 align:middle line:90%
having--

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:05.020 align:middle line:90%
they're not overdoing anything.

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:06.670 align:middle line:84%
They're doing things
in moderation.

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:10.698 align:middle line:84%
So they're having an
event where they gather.

00:19:10.698 --> 00:19:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's like a dancing
event or something.

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And this gentleman
that he's interviewing,

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:20.240 align:middle line:84%
he's saying, as they all
arrive, oh, isn't this amazing?

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:24.100 align:middle line:90%
Everyone is so beautiful.

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And have you noticed
how much they love me?

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:31.420 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:36.340 align:middle line:84%
So this connection of, they
all love me, and, have you

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:37.880 align:middle line:84%
noticed how beautiful
they all are.

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:38.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:40.600 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: It's
like, yes, I can

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:43.330 align:middle line:84%
identify with being
a person that there's

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:45.610 align:middle line:84%
an attraction and
a magnetism for.

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And they're all uniquely
amazing and bring so much more

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:51.320 align:middle line:90%
to my life.

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So essentially
super high self-esteem.

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:54.730 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:55.938 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's one of them.

00:19:55.938 --> 00:19:57.580 align:middle line:84%
Which is an interesting
conversation

00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:00.400 align:middle line:84%
I got into with
Father Sean O'Laoire.

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.560 align:middle line:90%
And we talked about self-esteem.

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:04.660 align:middle line:84%
We talked about
his days in Africa.

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:07.450 align:middle line:84%
He said, there is no
word for low self-esteem.

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:08.660 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't exist.

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:12.730 align:middle line:84%
People don't have this
neurotic sense of disconnection

00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:15.312 align:middle line:84%
from self and
anxiety about self.

00:20:15.312 --> 00:20:17.020 align:middle line:84%
Through all the years
he lived in Africa,

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:19.870 align:middle line:84%
he never even
encountered it one time.

00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And that that seems to
be traditionally Western.

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:26.500 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:30.580 align:middle line:84%
Along these lines, are you
aware that Abraham Maslow, when

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:32.410 align:middle line:84%
in the hierarchy of
needs where he speaks

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:34.990 align:middle line:84%
about the pyramid
of that, are you

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:38.950 align:middle line:84%
aware that he lived amongst the
Blackfoot First Nations people?

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:40.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:43.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: So this is not
talked about in his work.

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:43.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's
talk about it, yeah.

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:45.397 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: It's
really important,

00:20:45.397 --> 00:20:48.032 align:middle line:84%
because he speaks about
self-actualization, and later

00:20:48.032 --> 00:20:50.490 align:middle line:84%
in his life-- but he never got
to write about it because he

00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:52.823 align:middle line:84%
had a heart condition and
couldn't finish his writings--

00:20:52.823 --> 00:20:54.540 align:middle line:90%
about self-transcendence.

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:56.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's also some of
what we're speaking on here.

00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:57.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:20:57.530 --> 00:21:00.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: So what he found is
that when he was living amongst

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:03.810 align:middle line:84%
the Blackfoot-- and they
didn't get the recognition

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:06.420 align:middle line:90%
unfortunately in Maslow's work--

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:09.510 align:middle line:84%
but what he found
is that he learned

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:12.390 align:middle line:84%
in their tribal
organization, everyone

00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:15.360 align:middle line:84%
was born
self-actualized already.

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And then what they
were moving into

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:19.170 align:middle line:90%
was the self-transcendence.

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:24.030 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, even amongst a tribe,
that you might be the shaman,

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:26.500 align:middle line:84%
but you also are going to do
a whole lot of other jobs.

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:27.750 align:middle line:90%
You're going to be the farmer.

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:30.390 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be in
all these other roles

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:33.160 align:middle line:84%
in order to help
support the clan.

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:33.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:39.852 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: And so it's
just this organization of--

00:21:39.852 --> 00:21:41.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA:
Self-actualized at birth.

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:41.790 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:43.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Very
different mentality

00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:46.500 align:middle line:84%
than, oh, you poor helpless
little thing at birth.

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:47.760 align:middle line:90%
A helpless little thing.

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:50.490 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, let's drug you and
shoot you up with stuff.

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:54.490 align:middle line:84%
So what we were talking
about before this,

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:56.340 align:middle line:90%
there's the centenarians.

00:21:56.340 --> 00:22:00.090 align:middle line:84%
This inclusive narcissism
about feeling special, feeling

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:02.580 align:middle line:84%
like you have worth
and value even,

00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:06.575 align:middle line:84%
and choosing to
participate or indulge

00:22:06.575 --> 00:22:08.700 align:middle line:84%
in your favorite little
thing so you have something

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:11.130 align:middle line:90%
to get excited about each day.

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:13.740 align:middle line:84%
All of these things
tend to keep the people

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:15.960 align:middle line:90%
in the blue zones more alive.

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:19.630 align:middle line:84%
And now you come-- let's just
go to any urban area of America,

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:20.430 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And one of the biggest trends
is among young people--

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:26.640 align:middle line:84%
quite young people-- they
don't want to be here anymore.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:28.507 align:middle line:90%
It's total opposite.

00:22:28.507 --> 00:22:29.340 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Oh, man.

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:31.230 align:middle line:90%
This is a big area.

00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:37.290 align:middle line:10%
And I've also known several
healers who have left.

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:38.340 align:middle line:90%
It's young people.

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'm actually finding
this across many age groups.

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's this lack
of commitment,

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:48.520 align:middle line:84%
that they are not
committing to life.

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:49.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:51.250 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: And
this is dangerous.

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:52.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:53.300 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: This is dangerous.

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:56.170 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to
say, first of all,

00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:58.120 align:middle line:84%
I had to go through my
own plights of this.

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:01.410 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to be here.

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Paul has a great story,
which, if there's time,

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:07.390 align:middle line:84%
we'll go into it, of
not wanting to be here.

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:10.230 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
there's a common theme

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:12.850 align:middle line:84%
of there's so many of us
on the planet right now,

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:14.460 align:middle line:84%
and I feel like
it's a numbers game.

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:15.360 align:middle line:90%
Well, why?

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:18.060 align:middle line:84%
There's all these sensitives,
all these high sensitivity

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:21.480 align:middle line:84%
persons, or the people
who are empaths,

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:25.590 align:middle line:84%
or it's just really very
exquisitely sensitive.

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:27.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, that also means that
we're good perceivers.

00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:32.550 align:middle line:84%
But it also means that
we're taking a lot on.

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:36.840 align:middle line:84%
And what I notice is a common
theme of many of the healers

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:39.010 align:middle line:90%
that check themselves out.

00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:42.750 align:middle line:84%
They were doing their work
in service, so to speak.

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:45.060 align:middle line:84%
But they were not
committed to being here.

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:48.840 align:middle line:84%
Still in their internal
life and internal dialogues

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:51.370 align:middle line:84%
where, why am I
here on this planet?

00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:53.440 align:middle line:90%
I really don't want to be here.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:56.100 align:middle line:90%
And that is such a disconnect.

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:59.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's so important
to also finding meaning.

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:03.420 align:middle line:84%
It's so important for how it
is that we-- because I don't

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:08.310 align:middle line:84%
believe that the soul's
dharma can turn on

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:09.998 align:middle line:90%
until we make a commitment.

00:24:09.998 --> 00:24:11.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, absolutely.

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:13.140 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we'll read one of
both of our favorite quotes

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:14.080 align:middle line:90%
ever in a minute.

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:14.913 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Awesome.

00:24:14.913 --> 00:24:16.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I couldn't
agree more with that.

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:20.970 align:middle line:84%
And also here you have people in
the healing professions, right?

00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And so it sounds like there's
another issue of there's so

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:27.820 align:middle line:90%
much need right now for that.

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:30.270 align:middle line:84%
So much going out but
feeling like there

00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:31.620 align:middle line:90%
wasn't much coming back.

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:34.620 align:middle line:84%
Much to fill their own
cup again because there's

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:36.660 align:middle line:90%
such great need right now.

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:40.500 align:middle line:84%
What can we do with that, with
the intuitives, the empaths,

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:42.210 align:middle line:90%
sensitives, and healers.

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:45.660 align:middle line:84%
What can each one of
us do to help someone

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:48.193 align:middle line:84%
in that capacity
struggling right now?

00:24:48.193 --> 00:24:49.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: That's
such a good question.

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:51.310 align:middle line:90%
And even for the young people--

00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:52.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:53.250 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: --is
to find meaning.

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:53.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:55.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: But I really--

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:57.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But they have
meaning, they're just drained.

00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:58.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:24:58.440 --> 00:24:59.970 align:middle line:84%
But part of the reason
that they're drained

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:01.980 align:middle line:84%
is because they're taking
the weight on in the world.

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:02.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:03.510 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: It's the Atlas--

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:04.952 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:25:04.952 --> 00:25:05.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: --position.

00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:09.340 align:middle line:90%


00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:12.400 align:middle line:84%
I had to go through this
personally where literally,

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:16.360 align:middle line:84%
my astral judge self-- this
is speaking in personal

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.280 align:middle line:90%
self-integration language--

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:19.600 align:middle line:90%
it was Atlas.

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:22.805 align:middle line:84%
When I met this part of
myself, it was Atlas carrying

00:25:22.805 --> 00:25:25.180 align:middle line:84%
the weight of the world--
happened to be on my alta major

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:26.650 align:middle line:90%
chakra, funny enough--

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:27.940 align:middle line:90%
blocking.

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:31.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is where I think
that we don't get access

00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:32.650 align:middle line:90%
to our intuition.

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:36.250 align:middle line:90%
We're just encumbered.

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:37.970 align:middle line:90%
We're taking on too much.

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:43.270 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd like to say to that
is, first, make the commitment.

00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:44.980 align:middle line:90%
I am willing to be here.

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:49.090 align:middle line:84%
I am willing to turn
on my life's journey.

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:52.130 align:middle line:84%
I am actually
willing to do this.

00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:53.920 align:middle line:90%
And then help me.

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.840 align:middle line:90%
Help me with the discernment.

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:58.220 align:middle line:84%
And there's three really
important questions

00:25:58.220 --> 00:25:59.020 align:middle line:90%
that I find.

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:01.960 align:middle line:90%
Is this mine, yes or no?

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And then be able to
increase that discernment.

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:08.020 align:middle line:84%
Is this-- and then
if it's yes or no,

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:10.060 align:middle line:84%
we pay attention to
what the answers are.

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:13.450 align:middle line:90%
If it's no, then whose is it?

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:14.530 align:middle line:90%
Male or female.

00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:17.710 align:middle line:84%
These are the key questions to
start to discern, where is this

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:18.580 align:middle line:90%
coming from?

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:23.830 align:middle line:84%
And then what we'll find is
over time, that this is a--

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:25.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm always taking on
everybody else's things.

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:28.270 align:middle line:84%
This is where the
anxiety is coming from.

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:30.100 align:middle line:84%
And it makes us feel
so disconnected,

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:31.630 align:middle line:90%
even from our own emotions.

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And also where we have
been hijacked, if you will,

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:38.660 align:middle line:84%
in what it is that
we're feeling.

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:39.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:41.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: So
that's also what's

00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:43.180 align:middle line:84%
going on with a lot of
these young people who

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:46.568 align:middle line:84%
are choosing to commit suicide
and not making the bigger

00:26:46.568 --> 00:26:48.610 align:middle line:84%
commitments and things
like that, because they're

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:51.410 align:middle line:84%
exquisitely sensitive
and don't have the tools.

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:52.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:53.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: And I
was born that way.

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:58.120 align:middle line:84%
I was born open and didn't have
necessarily the tools either.

00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's just the
School of Hard Knocks.

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:02.380 align:middle line:90%
And so we figured that out.

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:05.870 align:middle line:84%
But it does make it easier
if we just say, OK, I'm here.

00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:07.210 align:middle line:90%
I want to figure it out.

00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:08.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm committed
to being here.

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:09.790 align:middle line:84%
OK, you mentioned
Paul a little bit ago

00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:11.373 align:middle line:84%
and you said there
was a little story.

00:27:11.373 --> 00:27:15.110 align:middle line:84%
Because he's also very
sensitive, empathic.

00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:15.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yeah.

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:18.040 align:middle line:90%
So he has this great story.

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And I was sharing with him that
I'm finding this in clients

00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:24.047 align:middle line:84%
right now and how important this
commitment thing is to make.

00:27:24.047 --> 00:27:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And he was like,
wow, I hadn't thought

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:27.050 align:middle line:90%
about this memory in years.

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:30.280 align:middle line:84%
But when he was a young
boy, he would go to sleep.

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:33.020 align:middle line:90%
And he didn't want to be human.

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:34.300 align:middle line:90%
He wanted to be angelic.

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And so when he would go to
sleep, he would astral travel

00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:39.580 align:middle line:84%
and it would be to the
edges of the planet.

00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:42.820 align:middle line:84%
And he would always run
into this invisible thing.

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:43.630 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:45.088 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
such a cool dream.

00:27:45.088 --> 00:27:46.171 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: I know, right?

00:27:46.171 --> 00:27:47.380 align:middle line:90%
But it was repetitive, right?

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:48.220 align:middle line:90%
So that actually--

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:49.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
very important, yes.

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:52.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: So this thing
that kept running into.

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:54.520 align:middle line:90%
And he just gave up.

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:55.960 align:middle line:90%
Well, many years later--

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:57.290 align:middle line:90%
many years later--

00:27:57.290 --> 00:28:00.040 align:middle line:84%
I think he was in his 30s where
he was reading a Rudolf Steiner

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:04.300 align:middle line:84%
book about the importance
of being in a human body.

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:08.110 align:middle line:84%
And really that this is-- the
theosophists actually say,

00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:10.130 align:middle line:90%
that's the god's ends path.

00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:10.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:13.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: It is to
take a human body.

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:17.050 align:middle line:84%
So he had a revelation when
he was reading that book.

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And that started
to make a shift.

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And then in conversation with
people, that he was like, wow,

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:24.520 align:middle line:90%
this happened.

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:27.110 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going to make
the commitment to be here.

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:29.060 align:middle line:84%
I actually want
to be fully human.

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:32.530 align:middle line:84%
I want to do my best
as a human to be here.

00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:35.060 align:middle line:90%
And that was just--

00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:35.860 align:middle line:90%
he lit up.

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:36.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:37.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, the commitment.

00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:42.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's funny because
having known him a little bit,

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:43.660 align:middle line:90%
he is very angelic.

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:46.660 align:middle line:84%
It makes me almost think that
he's from some other place

00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:48.520 align:middle line:84%
and he was just trying
to get back there.

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:49.722 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:28:49.722 --> 00:28:50.680 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: You got it.

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:51.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:52.000 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: You'll
have to get him

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.817 align:middle line:84%
to tell you has that
side of the story,

00:28:53.817 --> 00:28:55.150 align:middle line:90%
because it's really interesting.

00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:56.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I bet it is.

00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And so he decided to
take the brave leap.

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:01.475 align:middle line:84%
And so it's
interesting because all

00:29:01.475 --> 00:29:03.850 align:middle line:84%
of these people who said I
don't want to be here anymore,

00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:05.200 align:middle line:90%
it's too painful.

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.180 align:middle line:84%
As you talked about,
Randall Carlson,

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:10.090 align:middle line:84%
rewriting through these waves
of consciousness-- ascending,

00:29:10.090 --> 00:29:11.170 align:middle line:90%
descending waves.

00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:15.190 align:middle line:84%
The descending waves are never
fun or as fun and comfortable

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:16.450 align:middle line:90%
as the ascending waves.

00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:20.530 align:middle line:84%
But they're part of the
process of evolution.

00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:21.400 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Right.

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:24.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And here you
have beings from everything

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:28.510 align:middle line:84%
I've heard, from
virtually every medium,

00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:30.940 align:middle line:90%
mystics throughout the ages.

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:33.800 align:middle line:84%
There are beings lined
up to get a body.

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:35.320 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yeah.

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:36.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:36.510 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yeah.

00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:37.958 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's like, all right--

00:29:37.958 --> 00:29:39.250 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: We won the lottery.

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:40.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We won the lottery.

00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:42.990 align:middle line:90%
Lined up to get bodies.

00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:45.480 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:50.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: As I tune
into that right now,

00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:53.670 align:middle line:84%
we still need more
of this numbers game.

00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:55.610 align:middle line:90%
But we go through this amnesia.

00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:58.300 align:middle line:90%
So we don't know.

00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:00.010 align:middle line:90%
Are people going to succumb?

00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:02.020 align:middle line:90%
Barbara Hand Clow has this--

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:04.420 align:middle line:84%
she says in this time of
what we're in astrologically,

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:05.800 align:middle line:90%
it's the Neptune in Pisces.

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:06.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:06.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:10.120 align:middle line:84%
And we're either going
to go in the trance,

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:12.430 align:middle line:84%
or we're going to go for
our cosmic inheritance.

00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:12.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:14.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: And so,
which are we choosing?

00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:19.330 align:middle line:84%
So for the people that are
going in the way of the trance,

00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:21.130 align:middle line:90%
we need new recruits.

00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:21.940 align:middle line:90%
We need--

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:22.857 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:30:22.857 --> 00:30:24.400 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: We need
more people to be

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:29.020 align:middle line:84%
able to get into this
spiritual inheritance of really

00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:31.190 align:middle line:84%
who we are, is
this divine nature.

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:31.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:33.130 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:36.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so this
is the quote, all right,

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:38.590 align:middle line:84%
that I mentioned
a little bit ago.

00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And this is about
recommitment, right?

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:42.790 align:middle line:90%
And this is by Goethe, right.

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:44.950 align:middle line:84%
And there's a longer
portion at the front.

00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:48.970 align:middle line:84%
It says that "The moment one
definitely commits oneself,

00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:51.880 align:middle line:90%
then providence moves too."

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And this I have found
absolutely true in life.

00:30:55.630 --> 00:31:00.100 align:middle line:84%
And I watch people who are
having trouble just even making

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:01.225 align:middle line:90%
decisions right now.

00:31:01.225 --> 00:31:04.390 align:middle line:90%


00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:06.490 align:middle line:84%
Because it is a
numbers game sometimes.

00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:10.390 align:middle line:84%
It's a preponderance
of draw or energy game.

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:12.010 align:middle line:84%
Where you have a
decision to make.

00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:13.570 align:middle line:90%
There may not be a clear path.

00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:14.370 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Right.

00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:15.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:19.510 align:middle line:84%
But you can feel the weight
of one decision over another.

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:22.210 align:middle line:84%
And the important thing
is not that you're right.

00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:24.340 align:middle line:84%
This is all an
experiment, really.

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:27.040 align:middle line:84%
It's that you commit to
putting your foot, one

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:28.280 align:middle line:90%
foot or the other down.

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:29.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:32.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is critical,
because then, the truth

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:33.610 align:middle line:90%
can rush in.

00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:34.652 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: That's right.

00:31:34.652 --> 00:31:37.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you
made a bad decision,

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:40.110 align:middle line:84%
oh my god, I can't
believe I did-- oh jeez,

00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:42.230 align:middle line:84%
I got to see if I can
undo this and get back

00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:43.310 align:middle line:90%
in their good graces.

00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:44.283 align:middle line:90%
You know now.

00:31:44.283 --> 00:31:46.700 align:middle line:84%
Right, you didn't know that
before you put your foot down.

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:49.220 align:middle line:84%
Or, oh thank god, I
feel such freedom.

00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:53.310 align:middle line:84%
But it's like people
are just paralyzed.

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:54.110 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:55.850 align:middle line:84%
So something really
important about this,

00:31:55.850 --> 00:31:58.370 align:middle line:84%
because you bring up
something so important about,

00:31:58.370 --> 00:31:59.480 align:middle line:90%
I put my foot down.

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And Goethe is a
confirmation of what

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:04.130 align:middle line:84%
we were saying earlier
about make the commitment,

00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:05.690 align:middle line:90%
then the providence follows.

00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:07.560 align:middle line:90%
Everything else follows that.

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:12.260 align:middle line:84%
So this going in
the direction of--

00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:15.470 align:middle line:84%
something really important--
when we follow our intuition

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:17.618 align:middle line:84%
or we're really in that
delicate balancing-- oh,

00:32:17.618 --> 00:32:19.910 align:middle line:84%
I could go left, I could go
right, I could go straight,

00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:21.710 align:middle line:90%
or all these choices--

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:22.880 align:middle line:90%
just make a choice.

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:23.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Make a choice.

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:24.720 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Just make a choice.

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:26.178 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I always say.

00:32:26.178 --> 00:32:27.210 align:middle line:90%
Just make a choice.

00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:29.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: But if it didn't
work out according to--

00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:31.640 align:middle line:84%
we're not the ones
necessarily in control here,

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:33.260 align:middle line:84%
as far as the divine
providence piece.

00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:33.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is correct.

00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:35.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: So if
it didn't work out,

00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:38.250 align:middle line:84%
there's usually a
karmic reason for that.

00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:40.100 align:middle line:84%
But what I find is
that then people

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.050 align:middle line:84%
start disconnecting
from their intuition

00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:43.810 align:middle line:90%
because it didn't work out.

00:32:43.810 --> 00:32:45.890 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, no.

00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:47.030 align:middle line:90%
Don't go that way.

00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:49.580 align:middle line:84%
Go in the fact that,
OK, the next question

00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:50.550 align:middle line:90%
is, what did I learn?

00:32:50.550 --> 00:32:51.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:52.520 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: What did I learn?

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:53.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:55.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: Because, oh, shoot,
I got into that relationship.

00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:57.920 align:middle line:90%
Oh, man, I did it again.

00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:59.203 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:32:59.203 --> 00:33:01.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was talking to
Sheila Jillette the other day

00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:02.360 align:middle line:90%
in the theo group.

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And what they kept
saying is, you

00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:08.720 align:middle line:84%
have no idea how much
help is around you.

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:11.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's dripping
all over you.

00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:13.960 align:middle line:84%
There is so much help on
the other side if you ask.

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:14.760 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Ask.

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:16.100 align:middle line:90%
Ask is key.

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:19.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because everyone's
aware about the amnesia

00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:20.930 align:middle line:90%
of the human species.

00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:23.750 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's aware that we're here
with the boots on the ground

00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:25.940 align:middle line:90%
in this density of polarity.

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:28.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is not an
easy reality to be in,

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:31.100 align:middle line:84%
but it's absolutely
stunningly beautiful, too.

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And so all of these beings
who are in other densities

00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:38.670 align:middle line:84%
are not just cheering us on,
but it's like, what do you need?

00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:39.470 align:middle line:90%
What do you need?

00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:40.730 align:middle line:90%
I'll help you with that one.

00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:44.908 align:middle line:84%
And even they
can't do their jobs

00:33:44.908 --> 00:33:47.450 align:middle line:84%
and help us if we can't put our
foot down one way or another.

00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:48.800 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: It's so true.

00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:51.590 align:middle line:84%
This vacillation
point that we get to--

00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:55.370 align:middle line:84%
it creates incapacitance
to be able to move forward.

00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:56.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does.

00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:58.680 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: So just
making that first step.

00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:00.320 align:middle line:90%
And if it's a wrong one, fine.

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:02.420 align:middle line:84%
But see, this goes back
to this other piece

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:03.800 align:middle line:90%
about being comfortable.

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:04.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:05.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: Because we're
so afraid to make a mistake.

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:06.200 align:middle line:90%
Or--

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:07.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's all fear.

00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:07.370 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:09.328 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Every single
bit of it is fear-based.

00:34:09.328 --> 00:34:11.000 align:middle line:84%
It's just fear
running our lives.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.290 align:middle line:90%
Fear of the unknown.

00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:16.070 align:middle line:84%
Not knowing if it's going to be
better or worse if we do this.

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:17.750 align:middle line:84%
I think if there's
one thing both of us

00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:22.460 align:middle line:84%
can stress in this talk, is
that, just put your foot down,

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:23.460 align:middle line:90%
like you just said.

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:26.455 align:middle line:84%
Just make a decision and then
see what the reaction is.

00:34:26.455 --> 00:34:27.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: Consent
to something.

00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:29.227 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Consent to something.

00:34:29.227 --> 00:34:31.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: Consent to
your own intuition, please.

00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:32.630 align:middle line:90%
Your own sovereignty.

00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:34.627 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Ideal is going
to be your intuition.

00:34:34.627 --> 00:34:36.710 align:middle line:84%
Not someone basically
saying, oh, could you please

00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:37.752 align:middle line:90%
do this for me, you know?

00:34:37.752 --> 00:34:38.552 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:34:38.552 --> 00:34:40.130 align:middle line:90%
But with your own sovereignty.

00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:42.889 align:middle line:84%
And then start
learning the lessons.

00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:45.860 align:middle line:84%
It's so important to
understand this life is

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:47.189 align:middle line:90%
an experiment and an adventure.

00:34:47.189 --> 00:34:47.989 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:34:47.989 --> 00:34:50.787 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're not here just
to always do the right thing.

00:34:50.787 --> 00:34:52.370 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
the right thing is.

00:34:52.370 --> 00:34:54.500 align:middle line:84%
Half the time we don't know
what the right thing is.

00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:55.300 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Right.

00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:57.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But we learn by
making these decisions.

00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:59.232 align:middle line:84%
Taking a step here
and a correction

00:34:59.232 --> 00:35:00.440 align:middle line:90%
there and a correction there.

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:01.240 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Right.

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:04.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if you can
get a planet to the people

00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:08.330 align:middle line:84%
to the point where everyone's
paralyzed in fear disassociated

00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:11.720 align:middle line:84%
from self and others, you've
got quite a pliable species

00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:14.210 align:middle line:84%
to work with and you can
pretty much sell them anything.

00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:14.870 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Exactly.

00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:16.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In fact, I've
got to just insert this,

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:18.260 align:middle line:84%
because I thought
it was interesting.

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:21.920 align:middle line:84%
So I met this woman yesterday,
was chatting with her.

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:23.840 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you
know that thing

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.370 align:middle line:90%
we were just talking about?

00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:26.420 align:middle line:90%
I said, yeah.

00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:30.140 align:middle line:84%
She said, well, my cellphone's
just been sitting here.

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And this has been going
on for a long time.

00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:36.320 align:middle line:84%
She said, every time I have
a conversation with someone,

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:39.770 align:middle line:84%
within a few minutes, an article
or an advertisement on that

00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:41.700 align:middle line:90%
subject pops up on my phone.

00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:45.170 align:middle line:84%
So go ahead and talk
about this, because these

00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:49.730 align:middle line:84%
are the insidious ways in which
our minds are being manipulated

00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:51.030 align:middle line:90%
through these natural laws.

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:51.960 align:middle line:90%
So talk about it.

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:53.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: So just
on a practical level--

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:54.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:56.378 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: --turn
off location services.

00:35:56.378 --> 00:35:57.178 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:35:57.178 --> 00:35:58.070 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:58.070 --> 00:35:59.247 align:middle line:90%
Turn off location location.

00:35:59.247 --> 00:36:01.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: In your privacy,
just turn off the location,

00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:01.910 align:middle line:90%
because--

00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:03.785 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I should go
back and tell her that.

00:36:03.785 --> 00:36:04.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:05.650 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:36:05.650 --> 00:36:09.008 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Turn off
location services.

00:36:09.008 --> 00:36:11.300 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: Because I think
that's one of the ways that

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:13.443 align:middle line:90%
they're triangulating where--

00:36:13.443 --> 00:36:15.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
using your microphone.

00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:16.010 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:16.430 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:18.888 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To sell back to you,
even when your phone is just

00:36:18.888 --> 00:36:20.300 align:middle line:84%
sitting there in
an off position.

00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: Absolutely, because
I have had this time and time

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:25.190 align:middle line:84%
again with people that
I've been with that

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:27.740 align:middle line:84%
didn't have their location
services turned off.

00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And they had an ad for exactly
what they were in the store

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:31.820 align:middle line:90%
for--

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:32.677 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:32.677 --> 00:36:34.010 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: -just moments later.

00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:34.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:36.410 align:middle line:84%
In this case, it's
just conversation.

00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:37.210 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:38.380 align:middle line:90%
And that, too.

00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:40.980 align:middle line:90%
Those kinds of things happen.

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:44.470 align:middle line:84%
I've had it happen to me where
we're just talking about travel

00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:45.270 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:50.530 align:middle line:84%
The next thing that pops up
is an Airbnb ad or something

00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:51.330 align:middle line:90%
that-- yeah.

00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:52.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is how we're
losing our sovereignty.

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:53.730 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Exactly.

00:36:53.730 --> 00:36:54.772 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's important.

00:36:54.772 --> 00:36:56.010 align:middle line:90%
These aren't--

00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:57.990 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: So here's the thing.

00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:59.820 align:middle line:84%
It's actually
preying a little bit

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:01.848 align:middle line:84%
on the convenience,
the comfort level.

00:37:01.848 --> 00:37:02.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes, it is.

00:37:02.890 --> 00:37:06.180 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: And so if we
can just deal with the grit

00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:08.100 align:middle line:84%
and allow the fact
that we're going

00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:14.540 align:middle line:84%
to be uncomfortable for a
little bit and have that be OK.

00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:17.300 align:middle line:84%
Because this is how we're going
to find our own sovereignty.

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:22.560 align:middle line:84%
It's how we have our own
grounding again and remember

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:23.360 align:middle line:90%
who we are.

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:24.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:25.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: And not
let everything else

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:26.580 align:middle line:90%
tell us who we are.

00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:29.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us who we are
and entice us somewhere out

00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:31.460 align:middle line:84%
of convenience, because
we're all being enticed.

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:33.020 align:middle line:84%
Another thing--
this is just quirky,

00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:34.837 align:middle line:90%
but I was having for a while--

00:37:34.837 --> 00:37:36.170 align:middle line:90%
my phone would be sitting there.

00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:37.520 align:middle line:90%
I'd be talking with someone.

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And it would just turn on and
start recording and writing

00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:42.090 align:middle line:90%
everything I was saying.

00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:43.520 align:middle line:90%
It was texting.

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:46.640 align:middle line:84%
It would turn everything
I was saying into text.

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:49.010 align:middle line:84%
What do I have to
turn off for that one?

00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:50.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: Try your
location services.

00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:52.220 align:middle line:90%
And if not, I don't know.

00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:53.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:56.600 align:middle line:84%
Anybody out here who's techie
can under the comment section

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:59.930 align:middle line:84%
tell everybody what we need to
be turning off in these phones.

00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:02.480 align:middle line:84%
But this whole thing you're
talking about about the trance,

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:05.390 align:middle line:84%
people being asleep and those
who aren't-- and this gets

00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:07.760 align:middle line:84%
into what we're just
talking about-- convenience,

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:10.280 align:middle line:90%
just following what's easy.

00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:11.820 align:middle line:90%
Or you call it default patterns.

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:12.620 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:14.537 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about default patterns

00:38:14.537 --> 00:38:16.340 align:middle line:84%
and how we start wrecking
those things, how

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:17.430 align:middle line:90%
we start breaking them.

00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:18.230 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yeah.

00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:20.580 align:middle line:84%
So there's a region in the
brain called the default mode

00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:21.380 align:middle line:90%
network.

00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, it's just
replaying old stories.

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And it looks for evidence
for those stories.

00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:30.110 align:middle line:84%
So there's actually
a tight connection

00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:32.790 align:middle line:84%
to the reticular activating
system and the default mode

00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:33.590 align:middle line:90%
network.

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:35.390 align:middle line:84%
So the reticular
activating system

00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:38.000 align:middle line:84%
is helping us to be able
to see and recognize.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.540 align:middle line:84%
Like, oh, OK-- for
instance, these ads.

00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:43.910 align:middle line:84%
No, it's not your reticular
activating system.

00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:44.760 align:middle line:90%
That's programming.

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:45.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:47.852 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: Reticular activating
system has to do with,

00:38:47.852 --> 00:38:49.940 align:middle line:84%
what am I bringing in
my own consciousness

00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:54.410 align:middle line:84%
that I want to do, be, or have
or experience anything with?

00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:59.240 align:middle line:84%
The default mode network
says, no, you can't.

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:04.190 align:middle line:84%
And so it's playing in
this, almost a critical kind

00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:06.680 align:middle line:84%
of component, where it
actually-- what it's doing

00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:08.520 align:middle line:84%
is keeping us in
our survival brain.

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:09.320 align:middle line:90%
It's keeping--

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:09.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fear.

00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:10.820 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Fear, yes.

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:14.100 align:middle line:90%
And we can use both.

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:16.680 align:middle line:84%
Because everything
about our whole bodies,

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:18.680 align:middle line:84%
especially the brain,
is reprogrammable.

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:20.520 align:middle line:84%
But we need it to be
reprogrammed by us.

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:21.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:24.200 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: And it's
literally an operating system.

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And these elements get
laid down with emotion.

00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:32.960 align:middle line:84%
So the more emotional something
is, the more the default mode

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:33.950 align:middle line:90%
network has--

00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:35.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Strengthened.

00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:37.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: And
subscribed to whatever

00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:41.600 align:middle line:84%
that stress pattern is that
then creates, oh, well, this

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:43.163 align:middle line:90%
is my next known reality.

00:39:43.163 --> 00:39:46.562 align:middle line:90%


00:39:46.562 --> 00:39:48.770 align:middle line:84%
It's like it just is on a
little bit of an autopilot.

00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:49.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:52.415 align:middle line:90%
So how do you break it?

00:39:52.415 --> 00:39:54.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: Making the
unconscious conscious.

00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:54.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:56.180 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: By first
of all, making sure

00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:58.038 align:middle line:84%
that you are even
recognizing that this

00:39:58.038 --> 00:39:59.330 align:middle line:90%
is a pattern that you're doing.

00:39:59.330 --> 00:39:59.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:59.570 --> 00:40:01.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: In the same
way that the people

00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:02.912 align:middle line:84%
that are breaking
through, whether it

00:40:02.912 --> 00:40:06.380 align:middle line:84%
be empaths or people
just innocently being

00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:08.240 align:middle line:84%
in some of these
narcissistic relationships,

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:10.100 align:middle line:90%
watch the patterns.

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:11.150 align:middle line:90%
See what's coming up.

00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:12.170 align:middle line:90%
Make it unconscious.

00:40:12.170 --> 00:40:14.360 align:middle line:84%
Get into the observer
role a little bit,

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:16.130 align:middle line:90%
even in our own thinking.

00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:18.380 align:middle line:90%
And we love the phrase--

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:22.460 align:middle line:84%
there's a Vedantic teacher,
Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj.

00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:26.090 align:middle line:84%
And he loves to
use this saying of,

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:29.900 align:middle line:84%
that's interesting, as
a way to just step out

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:33.110 align:middle line:84%
of the dynamic of
this ping pong effect

00:40:33.110 --> 00:40:34.470 align:middle line:90%
that's going on in our systems.

00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:35.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: So making the
unconscious conscious.

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:39.530 align:middle line:84%
And that was a big thing
that Jung spoke about.

00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:39.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:41.837 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: And in fact,
that's a great quote.

00:40:41.837 --> 00:40:43.260 align:middle line:90%
We've said it here before.

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:45.295 align:middle line:84%
If you don't make the
unconscious conscious,

00:40:45.295 --> 00:40:47.420 align:middle line:84%
it will direct your life
and you will call it fate.

00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:48.295 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:40:48.295 --> 00:40:49.212 align:middle line:90%
You will call it fate.

00:40:49.212 --> 00:40:50.012 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:40:50.012 --> 00:40:50.930 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: It's not.

00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:53.880 align:middle line:84%
It's our bodies at
the end of the day.

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:55.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It is, our
body and our lives.

00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:58.433 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about
making the unconscious--

00:40:58.433 --> 00:40:59.350 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Conscious.

00:40:59.350 --> 00:41:00.267 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --conscious.

00:41:00.267 --> 00:41:03.500 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about maybe
even a bigger proposal

00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:07.340 align:middle line:84%
for every one of us, especially
in a time of descending

00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:10.710 align:middle line:84%
patterns, which means more
fear, more fear, more fear.

00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:14.000 align:middle line:84%
So as we have fear
building up, what

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.540 align:middle line:84%
happens is it cuts off our
relationship with the higher

00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:19.340 align:middle line:90%
self, with the soul.

00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And we cannot afford
to do that right now.

00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:24.710 align:middle line:84%
The one thing that
we're being called to do

00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:27.840 align:middle line:84%
is bring our two
full selves forward.

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:30.780 align:middle line:84%
So for a moment-- we only
have a few minutes left--

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:34.520 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about how we
reclaim our connection

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:39.060 align:middle line:84%
with soul in a world that's
just laden with fear.

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:42.270 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: More commitment.

00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:44.850 align:middle line:84%
Choosing more of what
it is that we want.

00:41:44.850 --> 00:41:50.190 align:middle line:84%
Not allowing the default
patterns to exist.

00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:52.320 align:middle line:84%
These people that
have broken free

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:58.060 align:middle line:84%
in these arenas in their
life, it takes courage.

00:41:58.060 --> 00:42:03.780 align:middle line:84%
It takes that
sovereign will to--

00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:06.060 align:middle line:90%
will to will thy will.

00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:10.290 align:middle line:84%
It is that courage
to say, I'm going to.

00:42:10.290 --> 00:42:12.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to begin to see
the things clearly that I

00:42:12.810 --> 00:42:13.858 align:middle line:90%
haven't been able to see.

00:42:13.858 --> 00:42:15.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm going to be
willing to look at them

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:18.580 align:middle line:84%
because it could cause
an inconvenience for me

00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:19.380 align:middle line:90%
to see this.

00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:20.213 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Exactly.

00:42:20.213 --> 00:42:22.920 align:middle line:90%
And the inconvenience is huge.

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:24.560 align:middle line:84%
How my money is
tied to something.

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:25.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:26.730 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: How-- everything.

00:42:26.730 --> 00:42:29.400 align:middle line:84%
Our lives get intertwined
with other people,

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:30.970 align:middle line:90%
that there's always a tradeoff.

00:42:30.970 --> 00:42:31.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:33.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: There's
always a tradeoff.

00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:37.260 align:middle line:84%
So then that turns on another
set of decision-making

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:39.450 align:middle line:84%
for ourselves of,
all right, what

00:42:39.450 --> 00:42:42.030 align:middle line:84%
am I not willing
to trade anymore?

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:44.430 align:middle line:84%
I am not willing
to trade myself.

00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:49.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the other thing to
me that's at this point in time

00:42:49.110 --> 00:42:51.210 align:middle line:84%
where people say
just what you just

00:42:51.210 --> 00:42:54.360 align:middle line:84%
said, for example, that you're
having to look at something

00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:56.430 align:middle line:84%
you don't want to look at
because the implication

00:42:56.430 --> 00:42:57.240 align:middle line:90%
is scary.

00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:59.470 align:middle line:84%
If you acknowledge it,
you have to make a choice,

00:42:59.470 --> 00:43:01.920 align:middle line:84%
and that choice
could make you, say,

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:03.660 align:middle line:84%
either emotionally
or financially

00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:05.820 align:middle line:90%
unstable very rapidly.

00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:08.290 align:middle line:84%
So then you think, oh my
god, what am I going to do?

00:43:08.290 --> 00:43:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you have to look
at your real assets in life.

00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:15.240 align:middle line:84%
Which number one, your own
inner strength and commitment

00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:16.590 align:middle line:90%
is your first asset.

00:43:16.590 --> 00:43:22.530 align:middle line:84%
But the other line of assets is,
who do you have loving, giving

00:43:22.530 --> 00:43:24.480 align:middle line:90%
relationships with?

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:27.150 align:middle line:84%
We all have people
that we're going

00:43:27.150 --> 00:43:30.030 align:middle line:84%
to need to turn to
when we're making

00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:32.200 align:middle line:90%
these bold decisions in life.

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And if we're not busy, if
we're not making it a priority

00:43:36.330 --> 00:43:40.170 align:middle line:84%
to have relationships anymore,
and to put love into it

00:43:40.170 --> 00:43:43.800 align:middle line:84%
and care into it, then where
are our assets in life?

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:44.970 align:middle line:90%
We're truly alone.

00:43:44.970 --> 00:43:46.110 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yeah.

00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:49.345 align:middle line:84%
We must find meaning in
everything we're doing.

00:43:49.345 --> 00:43:50.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We have to.

00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:54.100 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: And that
actually lays down,

00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:58.090 align:middle line:84%
from a biocognition point of
view within the default mode

00:43:58.090 --> 00:44:00.850 align:middle line:90%
network, creating new meaning--

00:44:00.850 --> 00:44:02.080 align:middle line:90%
what is my association?

00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:03.880 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I don't want
to be associated

00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:05.660 align:middle line:84%
with that thing
like that anymore.

00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:06.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:08.043 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: So what
is the new meaning

00:44:08.043 --> 00:44:09.440 align:middle line:90%
that I'm going to derive?

00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:11.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So don't
just take away.

00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:14.963 align:middle line:84%
Fill the cup back up with
something you truly desire.

00:44:14.963 --> 00:44:16.630 align:middle line:10%
>>BARSOTTI: That's
so important, Regina,

00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:20.740 align:middle line:10%
because where we have
created a void or a vacuum,

00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:24.430 align:middle line:10%
if we don't fill the space
with our conscious choice

00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:27.220 align:middle line:10%
and our conscious free
will, it gets filled up

00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:29.110 align:middle line:10%
with the default stuff.

00:44:29.110 --> 00:44:31.420 align:middle line:84%
So that's a really
important piece,

00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:34.780 align:middle line:84%
is, yes, the courage to
have to make a decision.

00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:38.982 align:middle line:84%
And then find meaning in that
next step that I'm taking.

00:44:38.982 --> 00:44:40.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because as
you say, many people

00:44:40.690 --> 00:44:43.000 align:middle line:84%
are waking up and
saying, no, I don't

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.210 align:middle line:90%
give my permission anymore.

00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:45.410 align:middle line:90%
I don't want that.

00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:46.910 align:middle line:84%
But we haven't taken
that next step.

00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:47.710 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:49.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What I
do want is this.

00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:49.810 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: What I do want.

00:44:49.810 --> 00:44:51.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then I'm
going to work toward that,

00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:55.960 align:middle line:84%
fulfilling or accomplishing
or feeling or whatever,

00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:57.160 align:middle line:90%
embracing that.

00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:59.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: We have to have
another conversation about

00:44:59.410 --> 00:45:00.210 align:middle line:90%
the--

00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:02.040 align:middle line:84%
I have my own model
of the triune brain.

00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:02.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We do.

00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, another
area we didn't get to

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:06.580 align:middle line:90%
was conception contracts.

00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:08.930 align:middle line:84%
So OK, we'll write
some notes down,

00:45:08.930 --> 00:45:11.100 align:middle line:84%
and those two things will
be our next conversation.

00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:11.900 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:13.820 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: That's a big topic.

00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:17.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As always, just
have such a clarity about you

00:45:17.410 --> 00:45:21.370 align:middle line:84%
and a spiritual beauty about you
that you so generously share.

00:45:21.370 --> 00:45:24.310 align:middle line:84%
And I congratulate
you on everything

00:45:24.310 --> 00:45:26.260 align:middle line:84%
that you've managed to
accomplish within that

00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:27.370 align:middle line:90%
as a spiritual being.

00:45:27.370 --> 00:45:28.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: And I
got my book done.

00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:29.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
got your book done.

00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:29.920 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: That's amazing.

00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:31.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Congratulations.

00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:31.970 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Thank you so much.

00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:32.870 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for the support

00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:33.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Until next time.

00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:35.770 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: Until
next time, thank you.
