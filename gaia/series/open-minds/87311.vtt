>>REGINA MEREDITH:
We've all heard

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.340 align:middle line:10%
of the old practice of putting
clove oil on a decaying tooth

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.500 align:middle line:10%
to blunt the pain, but
beyond that, little

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.230 align:middle line:10%
has been said of the ways in
which herbs and plants can

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.760 align:middle line:10%
help heal our mouths.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.250 align:middle line:84%
Linda Straub Bruce
and Leslie Alexander

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.750 align:middle line:84%
have laid out a
definitive approach

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.600 align:middle line:84%
to healing our teeth, gums,
and mouth of conditions

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.470 align:middle line:84%
that we have now
learned are affecting

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.290 align:middle line:84%
the health of our entire bodies,
and that includes cancer.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.220 align:middle line:84%
Linda's with us today
to speak about research

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.190 align:middle line:90%
in her book, "Dental Herbalism."

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.820 align:middle line:84%
And wow, what a great
job you guys have done.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:59.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDA STRAUB
BRUCE: Oh, thank you.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.910 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This should be in
everybody's-- if they have

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.540 align:middle line:84%
a mouth and if they
still have teeth,

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.230 align:middle line:84%
this should be in
everybody's household.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:06.230 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Exactly.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.420 align:middle line:90%
It covers everything--

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You guys
did a great job.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.270 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: -from A to Z.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.156 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does.

00:01:09.156 --> 00:01:11.530 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's give us a little
bit of your own background.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.597 align:middle line:84%
First, as dental hygienist,
you have seen it all.

00:01:14.597 --> 00:01:15.430 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Yes.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Some things I
hope I never have to see.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.370 align:middle line:90%
You people are courageous.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.410 align:middle line:84%
So let's get some
background in terms

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.320 align:middle line:84%
of what took you
from dental hygiene

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.410 align:middle line:84%
to having this incredible
passion that transitioned you

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.680 align:middle line:84%
over into the understanding--
well, your relationship

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.790 align:middle line:84%
with Leslie, and understanding
the use of herbs.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:32.120 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Sure.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.640 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.410 align:middle line:84%
I have been a full-time
dental hygienist for 25 years,

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:37.900 align:middle line:90%
and I have seen it all.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:38.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.891 align:middle line:10%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: I've seen
patients from every age group

00:01:40.891 --> 00:01:43.280 align:middle line:10%
from age one to over 100.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.610 align:middle line:84%
I've seen all kinds of different
diseases, healthy states,

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.600 align:middle line:84%
and the transitions
between them.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And the good part is, is
I've been in my same practice

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.580 align:middle line:90%
for 25 years.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.110 align:middle line:10%
So there are
patients I've seen--

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.680 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.388 align:middle line:10%
You have history.

00:01:56.388 --> 00:01:58.120 align:middle line:10%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE:
-for 25 years, yeah.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.800 align:middle line:84%
So you can really
see the transition

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.870 align:middle line:84%
in different people's lives
and how long-term things affect

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.350 align:middle line:84%
the oral cavity, the teeth,
and the body as a whole.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.100 align:middle line:84%
So I've always been very
passionate and I love my job,

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.960 align:middle line:84%
but where my transition
kind of came into play

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.620 align:middle line:84%
with being a little
more conscious

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.180 align:middle line:84%
about natural and
herbal products,

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.180 align:middle line:90%
I would say goes back to my son.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.970 align:middle line:90%
That's the easy answer.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.300 align:middle line:84%
I was in my mid 30s
and I hadn't been sure

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.890 align:middle line:90%
if I wanted to have children.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And I decided that I was
going to have my son.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.390 align:middle line:84%
So I kind of-- being
a project person,

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.980 align:middle line:84%
I kind of looked
at it as a project

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.950 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to read
everything and learn everything

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.270 align:middle line:84%
there was to know and make sure
I was really doing it right.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.040 align:middle line:84%
So I started reading about
it, and up until that point,

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.920 align:middle line:84%
I had never had
a health problem.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.160 align:middle line:84%
I had never had an issue
or a disease or a syndrome.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.840 align:middle line:84%
I had always felt good
and had unlimited energy.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.150 align:middle line:84%
But I never really realized
how poor my diet truly was.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.330 align:middle line:84%
I really started
paying attention,

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.530 align:middle line:84%
being cognizant that I was
building another entire human,

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.370 align:middle line:84%
and I have to watch
everything that I ingest,

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.110 align:middle line:84%
be it food or pharmaceuticals
or topical products that

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.850 align:middle line:84%
could be absorbed
through the skin.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.170 align:middle line:84%
So I really started to look
at how I was living my life

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.850 align:middle line:84%
and I couldn't believe
how bad it was.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.390 align:middle line:90%
My dietary was really bad.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.750 align:middle line:84%
I was eating a lot of
additives and different things

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.300 align:middle line:84%
that I wouldn't want
to expose him to.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.380 align:middle line:84%
So I kind of was learning
and dipping my toes

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.540 align:middle line:84%
in the water of food additives,
which was a huge subject.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And I started revolutionizing
and I had my first appointment,

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.500 align:middle line:84%
had a check up, did
everything right, so first try

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.510 align:middle line:90%
and I conceived.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.030 align:middle line:84%
So I was pregnant with
my son and I was over 35,

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.560 align:middle line:84%
so I was immediately
put into high risk.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.600 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't believe
it because I felt great.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.660 align:middle line:90%
I was invincible.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.145 align:middle line:90%
The pregnancy was going smooth.

00:04:06.145 --> 00:04:08.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was it arbitrary or
was it something about you?

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.570 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Well,
the procedure was over 35

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:15.160 align:middle line:84%
is considered geriatric and
it puts you into high risk.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.696 align:middle line:84%
So I had a lot of appointments,
a lot of sonograms.

00:04:17.696 --> 00:04:19.070 align:middle line:84%
I really enjoyed
seeing the baby.

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.060 align:middle line:90%
Everything was great.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, then I came up
to the 7 and 1/2 month.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.360 align:middle line:90%
Things started changing.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.670 align:middle line:84%
I started having
high blood pressure.

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.600 align:middle line:84%
I started having
a lot of issues.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.250 align:middle line:90%
I went into preterm labor.

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.330 align:middle line:90%
There was no good reason why.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.730 align:middle line:84%
I was doing
everything right and I

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.880 align:middle line:84%
was blessed that I had a
really knowledgeable midwife.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And initially when I started
having the high blood pressure

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.010 align:middle line:84%
problems, they talked
to me about preeclampsia

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.960 align:middle line:84%
and the dangers
that could happen.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.610 align:middle line:84%
And I was offered
some prescriptions

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:49.770 align:middle line:90%
that would bring it down.

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.478 align:middle line:84%
And I really read up
on the prescriptions

00:04:51.478 --> 00:04:53.180 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't want
to go that route.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.640 align:middle line:84%
The midwife that I had
was really fantastic.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.380 align:middle line:90%
She knew an herbalist.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And the herbalist was
familiar in treating patients

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.280 align:middle line:84%
that had had high blood pressure
and different issues like that.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.360 align:middle line:10%
So she kind of
coordinated the treatment.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.860 align:middle line:84%
And I spoke with
her and amazingly,

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.980 align:middle line:84%
right up until the very end of
my pregnancy, three herbs she

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.220 align:middle line:84%
had given me-- I
was on dandelion

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.340 align:middle line:84%
and I was on stinging nettle
and various herbal preparations,

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.440 align:middle line:84%
safely got my blood
pressure under control right

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.990 align:middle line:90%
until the very end.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.500 align:middle line:84%
So I get down to the last couple
weeks and it wasn't going well.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.890 align:middle line:84%
So the delivery came and the
delivery was very difficult.

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:36.240 align:middle line:90%
It was not good for my son or I.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.340 align:middle line:84%
My son had a brachial
plexus injury

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.210 align:middle line:90%
and I was in deep trouble.

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:41.530 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't know that.

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:42.630 align:middle line:90%
I had never had a baby.

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.020 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what it felt like.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.540 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what to expect.

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:46.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.149 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: I had
some major problems.

00:05:48.149 --> 00:05:49.630 align:middle line:90%
I was bleeding out.

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.500 align:middle line:84%
So needless to say, it
was a bad delivery, it

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.760 align:middle line:90%
was a bad recovery.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.520 align:middle line:84%
I had a hard time because
I had lost so much blood

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.210 align:middle line:84%
and I received six
transfusions and I was so weak.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.460 align:middle line:84%
And for the first time in
my life, I felt so bad.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And I had this new baby
and he had his problems

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.660 align:middle line:84%
and I was struggling
in the night

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.690 align:middle line:90%
to pick him up to nurse him.

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.640 align:middle line:90%
And I just wasn't rebounding.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And I went to the
OB/GYN and they kind of

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:22.540 align:middle line:84%
got through my
postpartum care, and you

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.200 align:middle line:84%
know, eat meat and try to
do what you can, take iron.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of felt
like I was on my own.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.900 align:middle line:84%
So it became a research
project, how could I

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.400 align:middle line:84%
revitalize myself and
rebuild what I had lost?

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.690 align:middle line:84%
And so I really got an
appreciation for food

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.510 align:middle line:84%
and the natural
benefits of food,

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:44.550 align:middle line:84%
as well as herbal and plant
products versus pharmaceuticals

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.004 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't want to take
while pregnant or nursing.

00:06:47.004 --> 00:06:47.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:50.285 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: So that kind of
laid the foundation, you know?

00:06:50.285 --> 00:06:50.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:51.450 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.060 align:middle line:84%
And so, you started
off on that path.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.975 align:middle line:84%
And so you took it-- you
took it on with zeal.

00:06:55.975 --> 00:06:57.100 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Sure, sure.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.190 align:middle line:84%
So every day I
work with patients,

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.710 align:middle line:84%
and every day I see
various different things.

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And I got to thinking
after my experience

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:08.830 align:middle line:84%
that the mouth is made
of mucous membranes.

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And if you want a fast
track into the bloodstream,

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:14.060 align:middle line:84%
it's the mucous membranes
with inhalation,

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.500 align:middle line:90%
through the tissues.

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.590 align:middle line:84%
A lot medications are
administered under the tongue.

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:22.370 align:middle line:84%
So what about the
bad things that might

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.780 align:middle line:84%
be a little more chemical
in the products that we use?

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:28.140 align:middle line:84%
So I really started to look
at the oral care home products

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:31.350 align:middle line:84%
and think what are we
exposing ourselves to?

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:35.100 align:middle line:84%
But I'll tell you,
in 25 years, I really

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.550 align:middle line:84%
had not had a lot of
continuing education courses

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:40.820 align:middle line:84%
in natural products
or herbal remedies.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:41.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I
wouldn't think so.

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:42.918 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that's what
I wanted to ask now.

00:07:42.918 --> 00:07:44.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, were you working
with a dentist that

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:48.640 align:middle line:84%
was open to your
exploration of using

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.550 align:middle line:84%
herbs and other
natural substances?

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:52.700 align:middle line:84%
Because they're usually
pretty strict about that.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.370 align:middle line:84%
It's like no, you can give
them a little fluoride

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:55.020 align:middle line:90%
and that's it.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:55.960 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Right, right.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, we didn't really use
the herbs in the office.

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:01.300 align:middle line:84%
But what I was noting and
seeing was a lot of our patients

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.090 align:middle line:84%
were turning to the
natural products--

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:03.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, OK.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.214 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE:
-and turning away

00:08:05.214 --> 00:08:09.510 align:middle line:84%
from some of the ingredients
in the home care products.

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:11.610 align:middle line:84%
And they were starting
to have dialogue with me,

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:13.510 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't have great answers.

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:16.740 align:middle line:84%
And we take continuing
education every year

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:18.200 align:middle line:90%
to keep our licenses current.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And in 25 years, I
had had one course

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:23.890 align:middle line:84%
that talked about
various herbals

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:26.310 align:middle line:84%
that people take
for other conditions

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:29.060 align:middle line:84%
and how they relate to
bleeding or the anesthesia

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:30.000 align:middle line:90%
that we may give them.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That-- that reflects
the whole medical community,

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:32.870 align:middle line:90%
though.

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:33.260 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Right.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:34.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's consistent.

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:36.330 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: But there really
wasn't a lot of good resources.

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:37.014 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:08:37.014 --> 00:08:39.450 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Yeah, so
I kind of looked into it

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:41.549 align:middle line:90%
and I was trying to explore it.

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And coincidentally,
Leslie Alexander

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:46.720 align:middle line:84%
is a medical herbalist,
she's my co-author.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And she-- we met
through a mutual friend

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.760 align:middle line:84%
that she was helping
with a skin condition.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And she came up with the idea
because even the herbalists

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:02.880 align:middle line:84%
struggle to find good,
solid dental information.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.020 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
misinformation out there,

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.900 align:middle line:84%
and there's not a
really good resource

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.972 align:middle line:84%
that married true referenced
dental information.

00:09:10.972 --> 00:09:12.805 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going
to ask you about that,

00:09:12.805 --> 00:09:15.390 align:middle line:84%
that herbalists don't-- that's
not an area they cover that

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:16.360 align:middle line:90%
much as a rule.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:16.750 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Right.

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:17.250 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:20.280 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
tongue diagnoses

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.950 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot of
ancient Chinese tradition

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:26.550 align:middle line:84%
with evaluating the tongue
and the color and the zones.

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:28.710 align:middle line:84%
But as far as
looking beyond that,

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:33.240 align:middle line:84%
I really don't feel like
they have a good resource.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:37.610 align:middle line:84%
So Leslie and I teamed up,
recognizing this important need

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:40.930 align:middle line:84%
to bring a resource to
educate the herbalists,

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:43.370 align:middle line:84%
to kind of educate the
dental professional, too--

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:44.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.536 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE:
-on the other end,

00:09:45.536 --> 00:09:47.040 align:middle line:84%
and then take it
across the board.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For the home
consumer, absolutely.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.200 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Right.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.920 align:middle line:84%
So we came up with a concept
of writing this publication

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.940 align:middle line:84%
and it's nearly 500
pages from A to Z.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:59.620 align:middle line:84%
It's a great overview of
anything you could possibly

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:00.320 align:middle line:90%
want to know.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.069 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, you've
done a beautiful job.

00:10:02.069 --> 00:10:03.379 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Thank you.

00:10:03.379 --> 00:10:05.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
where big pharma plays

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:07.222 align:middle line:90%
into the story of dental care.

00:10:07.222 --> 00:10:08.680 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: I
think that as far

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.420 align:middle line:84%
as the pharmaceutical
industries go,

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:14.550 align:middle line:84%
they're probably a little more
medical driven than dental

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:17.310 align:middle line:84%
driven as far as the
typical prescriptions.

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:22.260 align:middle line:84%
We don't write a lot of
prescriptions in our office.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.610 align:middle line:84%
Not as much as I think
you would see necessarily

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:26.670 align:middle line:90%
in a medical office.

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And an example I
would have with that

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:31.690 align:middle line:84%
would be that if someone
came in with a tooth that

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:33.650 align:middle line:84%
had a problem, we
would schedule them

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:34.864 align:middle line:90%
for treatment of that tooth.

00:10:34.864 --> 00:10:35.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:38.029 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: And if someone
comes into an endocrinologist

00:10:38.029 --> 00:10:41.540 align:middle line:84%
with diabetes, they may
not necessarily be able

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.810 align:middle line:84%
to reschedule them for one
appointment of treatment

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:45.340 align:middle line:90%
and send them on their way way--

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:46.006 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:46.006 --> 00:10:48.480 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: -but they
have to write a prescription.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:52.350 align:middle line:84%
I think that the oral care and
the pharmaceutical companies

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:56.830 align:middle line:84%
tend to more market
towards the consumer.

00:10:56.830 --> 00:11:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes to this
day, even this year, I'll

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.080 align:middle line:84%
have a patient come in and
tell me about a new oral care

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.860 align:middle line:84%
product on the market that
I had not heard about.

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:06.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.670 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: I think that
dentistry gets more affected

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:13.540 align:middle line:84%
possibly by the insurance
industry in what we can do,

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:17.380 align:middle line:84%
but we're not really-- we
don't have a ton of contact

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:18.880 align:middle line:84%
with the pharmaceutical
industry.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
insurance industry

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:22.900 align:middle line:84%
hasn't embraced an
herbal approach yet?

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:26.241 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: No,
they really haven't.

00:11:26.241 --> 00:11:27.990 align:middle line:84%
Depending on where you
are in the country,

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:31.124 align:middle line:84%
some care is more insurance
driven than other.

00:11:31.124 --> 00:11:31.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:33.990 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE:
Where I exist, we're

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:37.450 align:middle line:84%
more insurance related than
other areas of the country that

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:39.820 align:middle line:84%
are more fee for
service, so you kind of

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.320 align:middle line:84%
have to make your
recommendations

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.600 align:middle line:84%
and the patient makes
their decision sometimes

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.460 align:middle line:90%
based on their coverage.

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:49.820 align:middle line:84%
But there really isn't
a lot of availability

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:53.470 align:middle line:84%
for-- even teaching
dental home care is not

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:54.602 align:middle line:90%
a reimbursable service.

00:11:54.602 --> 00:11:55.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:56.520 align:middle line:90%
We all have teeth.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:58.980 align:middle line:84%
We all have family-- well,
a lot of us have families,

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:00.940 align:middle line:84%
at least we have our
own teeth, and there's

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:02.510 align:middle line:84%
a dearth of
information out there.

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:02.640 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Sure.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:03.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
that's why I was

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.250 align:middle line:84%
so happy to hear that
you had done this.

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:05.980 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Right, right.

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:07.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, and
there's an old British--

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:11.360 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to relate this
back to your experience when

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:15.480 align:middle line:84%
you were pregnant-- there's
an old wives' tale that said,

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.960 align:middle line:90%
a tooth per child.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.580 align:middle line:90%
Can you talk about that?

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:21.330 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: It's
not necessarily true.

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:22.121 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:22.121 --> 00:12:23.370 align:middle line:90%
That's why it's a wives' tale.

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:24.310 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Right, right.

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:26.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But talk
about the infant kind

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:28.120 align:middle line:84%
of leaching some
of the available

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.310 align:middle line:84%
nutrients from the body,
the bones and the teeth.

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:31.670 align:middle line:90%
Is that true or untrue?

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:33.610 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: It's
pretty much a wives' tale

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:37.190 align:middle line:84%
that the calcium is drawn
from the tooth by the baby.

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:41.880 align:middle line:84%
But, overall, the main
message and something

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.240 align:middle line:84%
that we're understanding
more and more

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.890 align:middle line:84%
with every week it seems
like another study coming out

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:50.560 align:middle line:84%
proving this, is our oral health
is related to everything else--

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:51.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:51.690 align:middle line:90%
We're going there.

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:53.565 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: -that's
going on in the body.

00:12:53.565 --> 00:12:56.360 align:middle line:84%
So pregnancy is a
burden on the body.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.000 align:middle line:84%
It is a load on the
mom's nutrition.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.280 align:middle line:90%
She is building that child.

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.170 align:middle line:84%
A lot of things happen
differently in the mouth

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:05.020 align:middle line:90%
during pregnancy.

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:07.130 align:middle line:84%
The hormone fluctuations
cause what's

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:08.960 align:middle line:90%
called pregnancy gingivitis.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:13.590 align:middle line:84%
It can differ from one
woman to another widely.

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:16.720 align:middle line:84%
Even within one woman, she
could have 10 pregnancies,

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.270 align:middle line:84%
one pregnancy she barely has any
and then another pregnancy it's

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:21.130 align:middle line:90%
severe.

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:25.310 align:middle line:84%
It just depends on that
particular circumstance.

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:27.300 align:middle line:84%
So what happens in
pregnancy gingivitis

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:31.960 align:middle line:84%
is the hormone fluctuations
cause the gums to swell.

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.790 align:middle line:84%
They become very
inflamed, very aggravated.

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:37.110 align:middle line:84%
Not even necessarily
to a lot of plaque.

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:38.680 align:middle line:90%
Even with excellent hygiene.

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.260 align:middle line:84%
So some people believe,
oh, my goodness, I'm

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.400 align:middle line:84%
brushing too hard because
my gums are sensitive,

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.100 align:middle line:84%
they're really bleeding,
so they rollback.

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:47.960 align:middle line:84%
They stop flossing,
they brush gently.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.180 align:middle line:84%
They brush maybe two times
a day instead of three,

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:51.370 align:middle line:90%
or down to one.

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:53.170 align:middle line:90%
And it actually gets it worse.

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:56.970 align:middle line:84%
Those swollen gums trap
bacteria, they trap plaque.

00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:59.310 align:middle line:90%
That produces more acid.

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:01.920 align:middle line:90%
Acid is what causes the decay.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:06.180 align:middle line:84%
So when pregnant women have
a lot of acidic environment

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:07.730 align:middle line:84%
just because of
what's going on--

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:08.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.100 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: -or the
high levels of bacteria,

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.740 align:middle line:90%
they tend to get more decay.

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:14.575 align:middle line:84%
The old wives' tale is that
it was calcium leached out,

00:14:14.575 --> 00:14:16.400 align:middle line:84%
but actually it
kind of translates

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.820 align:middle line:90%
to more acid exposure.

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:19.945 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, thank you
for clarifying that for us.

00:14:19.945 --> 00:14:20.820 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Sure.

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:23.215 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We got that wives'
tale checked off the list.

00:14:23.215 --> 00:14:24.840 align:middle line:84%
So the question I
was going to ask you,

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:31.070 align:middle line:84%
is it endemic to the aging
process that we go away

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:32.359 align:middle line:90%
from this life toothless?

00:14:32.359 --> 00:14:33.150 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: No.

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:33.800 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And you're seeing that
more and more that people--

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:41.970 align:middle line:84%
it was statistically
relevant in this century

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:45.660 align:middle line:84%
that one in four people
over 65 were toothless.

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:50.150 align:middle line:84%
That number is going to be
going down and lower and lower.

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:52.720 align:middle line:90%
We are doing more prevention.

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.650 align:middle line:90%
We are more aware of disease.

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:57.240 align:middle line:90%
Science is teaching us so much.

00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:00.430 align:middle line:84%
There are more treatment
options available.

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:03.000 align:middle line:84%
People are appreciating
their teeth more,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.040 align:middle line:84%
understanding, more
health conscious.

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.380 align:middle line:90%
Making better food choices.

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:08.546 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And maybe not so
willing to just give them

00:15:08.546 --> 00:15:10.120 align:middle line:84%
all up, I mean,
like my mother did.

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:13.580 align:middle line:84%
I think-- she had very-- her
teeth were prone to decay.

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.597 align:middle line:84%
By the time she was 36, she told
the dentist, who suggested it

00:15:16.597 --> 00:15:17.930 align:middle line:90%
I guess, oh, just pull them all.

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:18.270 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Right.

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:18.620 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:20.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so we're
not doing that anymore--

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:20.570 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Right.

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:21.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: -in that way.

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:23.435 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: When you
think that it's inevitable

00:15:23.435 --> 00:15:24.976 align:middle line:84%
that you're going
to lose your teeth,

00:15:24.976 --> 00:15:26.360 align:middle line:84%
you kind of feel
like why bother.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:26.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:28.408 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Let's
just get there now.

00:15:28.408 --> 00:15:29.800 align:middle line:90%
But it's not inevitable.

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.550 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes if teeth
are lost, it's

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:35.040 align:middle line:84%
usually because
of patient option

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.764 align:middle line:84%
or because they've waited
until it was too late.

00:15:37.764 --> 00:15:38.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:39.304 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Yeah.

00:15:39.304 --> 00:15:42.570 align:middle line:84%
The most common reason
for us to pull a tooth

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:45.090 align:middle line:84%
is because bone loss
has got so severe.

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And the way that we
like to say that is

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:48.910 align:middle line:84%
if you think of your
tooth as a house,

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:52.750 align:middle line:84%
you can't build a house
on a sandy foundation.

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:56.390 align:middle line:84%
You need a solid foundation
for your home to-- you

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:58.910 align:middle line:84%
can have a great home, but
if the foundation is bad,

00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:00.090 align:middle line:90%
it's not going to work.

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:03.350 align:middle line:84%
So the periodontium,
the gums, the ligaments

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:05.660 align:middle line:84%
that hold the teeth
to the bone, the bone,

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:08.460 align:middle line:84%
need to be healthy
to keep our teeth.

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:12.250 align:middle line:84%
Usually if a tooth
breaks or gets decay,

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:15.260 align:middle line:84%
there's almost always
a restorative option

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:16.510 align:middle line:90%
to save a tooth.

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:18.740 align:middle line:84%
But once we lose
our bone, it's gone.

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:20.320 align:middle line:90%
We can't get that back.

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:24.990 align:middle line:84%
So if we can understand
and appreciate gum disease

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:28.210 align:middle line:84%
and prevent it and treat
it in the early stages,

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:31.740 align:middle line:84%
there is no reason why teeth
can't be kept for a lifetime.

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:32.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's good to know.

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And I remember being impressed,
I was reading one of the books

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.970 align:middle line:84%
from the Weston
Price Foundation,

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:40.180 align:middle line:84%
I think it was Sal-- an
interview with Sal-- or Sally

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:41.550 align:middle line:90%
Fallon that had written it.

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And it showed those images
from back when of people in,

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:46.710 align:middle line:90%
I think it was the Amazon.

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:50.300 align:middle line:84%
He had traveled the world
and the indigenous people

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:52.490 align:middle line:84%
who had not been
exposed to refined foods

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:55.300 align:middle line:84%
had these beautiful,
beautiful teeth at all ages.

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And you say that there's a more
definitive study from roughly

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.840 align:middle line:84%
that area, even earlier
from Willoughby Miller,

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.420 align:middle line:84%
can you talk about what
was understood then even-

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:04.680 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Yeah.

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.599 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -and then we'll
start moving forward.

00:17:06.599 --> 00:17:07.474 align:middle line:10%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Sure.

00:17:07.474 --> 00:17:10.760 align:middle line:10%
Weston Price found that the
diets of these people that he

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:13.130 align:middle line:10%
was studying is
nothing like our diet.

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:15.980 align:middle line:84%
Our diet is laden with
artificial ingredients

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:19.960 align:middle line:84%
and preservatives and high
fructose corn syrup everywhere.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:24.760 align:middle line:84%
We really have to think
about our food choices.

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:30.310 align:middle line:84%
And those indigenous populations
were living on raw vegetables

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:32.277 align:middle line:90%
and not consuming--

00:17:32.277 --> 00:17:33.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And herbs.

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.330 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Yes.

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:34.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Herbs, nuts, berries.

00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:35.810 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Exactly.

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:40.080 align:middle line:84%
Yep, they were-- the raw foods
would clean the teeth by nature

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.100 align:middle line:84%
just because they
were crunchy, and they

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:44.760 align:middle line:84%
didn't have the fermentable
carbohydrates and the sugars

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:45.880 align:middle line:90%
that we consume.

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:48.920 align:middle line:84%
In addition to that,
they would use herbs.

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.290 align:middle line:90%
Herbs in their drink.

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:54.320 align:middle line:84%
Herbs as part of their culinary
diet, and herbs as therapy

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:57.800 align:middle line:84%
that have antiseptic and
anti-inflammatory and

00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.417 align:middle line:90%
acid-reducing properties.

00:17:59.417 --> 00:18:00.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.970 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: So they didn't
have the diet that we have,

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:03.620 align:middle line:90%
so they didn't get the decay.

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:07.799 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's as though the
mouth was formed beautifully.

00:18:07.799 --> 00:18:09.840 align:middle line:84%
You didn't see-- well, at
least in the-- we don't

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:12.131 align:middle line:84%
know the truth of it, but at
least in the illustrations

00:18:12.131 --> 00:18:15.220 align:middle line:84%
he brought back, you didn't
see crowding of teeth.

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.754 align:middle line:84%
You didn't see undersized
jaws and the like.

00:18:17.754 --> 00:18:18.670 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Right.

00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:19.169 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:18:19.169 --> 00:18:23.450 align:middle line:84%
It's more of a natural
lifestyle and it's

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:25.130 align:middle line:90%
more of an evidence of that.

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And Willoughby Miller brought
up some great information

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:30.960 align:middle line:90%
with his studies.

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:33.810 align:middle line:84%
He was a dentist, and
there was a whole explosion

00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:35.820 align:middle line:90%
of information in the 1800s.

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And the theory that he kind
of with the other people that

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:45.110 align:middle line:84%
were doing research termed
was called the focal infection

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:47.660 align:middle line:84%
theory, or the theory
of focal infection.

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:51.330 align:middle line:84%
That is the old version
of the retooled, renamed,

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:54.830 align:middle line:84%
redesigned oral systemic
connection we have today.

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:58.310 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have the science
to back it up back then,

00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:59.970 align:middle line:90%
but they had it right.

00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:04.590 align:middle line:84%
Bacteria plus sugar equals
acid that causes decay.

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:08.060 align:middle line:84%
It was the theory that
Willoughby Miller hypothesized.

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:12.880 align:middle line:84%
He also hypothesized that
there were infections,

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:18.040 align:middle line:84%
or focal infections in
the mouth existing that

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.310 align:middle line:84%
carried bacteria
that were harmful.

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:23.530 align:middle line:84%
And since the mouth is a
portal to the digestive tract,

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:27.090 align:middle line:84%
the respiratory tract,
and the blood circulating

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:29.510 align:middle line:84%
through all parts
of our body, what

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:33.200 align:middle line:84%
these infectious
microorganisms could do

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:37.460 align:middle line:84%
would travel to other part of
the body and cause problems.

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:39.830 align:middle line:84%
Exacerbate other
systemic disease.

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:43.020 align:middle line:90%
Cause other focus of infection.

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And he couldn't prove that
because it wasn't until later

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:49.600 align:middle line:84%
that C Edmund Kells
brought x-ray technology

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.230 align:middle line:84%
into the United
States and proved

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:54.990 align:middle line:84%
what Willoughby Miller
had hypothesized.

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:57.850 align:middle line:84%
That on an x-ray
there are abscess,

00:19:57.850 --> 00:20:01.440 align:middle line:84%
there are infections full
of virulent microorganisms,

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.500 align:middle line:84%
and the mouth is connected
to the rest of the body.

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:08.370 align:middle line:84%
There is a relationship
between oral disease

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:11.170 align:middle line:84%
and the rest of the
body and other diseases,

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:12.585 align:middle line:84%
especially
inflammatory diseases.

00:20:12.585 --> 00:20:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, well
speaking of inflammatory,

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:16.180 align:middle line:90%
let's talk about gingivitis.

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:18.480 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about gum disease
because unless someone

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:21.560 align:middle line:84%
is brushing their teeth
and they're pouring blood

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:23.300 align:middle line:84%
or have horrible
pain of some kind,

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:25.830 align:middle line:84%
most people have no idea
that this is taking place.

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:27.660 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
that for a bit?

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:29.300 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: We
see that every day.

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And for 25 years I almost can't
believe it hasn't changed.

00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:38.690 align:middle line:84%
If I washed my hair and my scalp
bled when I washed my hair,

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:39.890 align:middle line:90%
I would worry.

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:44.030 align:middle line:84%
Gums are not meant to bleed
when they're cleaned or flossed

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:44.740 align:middle line:90%
or brushed.

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:48.010 align:middle line:84%
But somehow it becomes accepted
that they bleed when I floss.

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:50.400 align:middle line:84%
Or I often hear,
I don't floss them

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.680 align:middle line:90%
because that makes them bleed.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:54.640 align:middle line:84%
Healthy gum tissue
does not bleed

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.920 align:middle line:84%
when you brush, when
you floss, when you eat,

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:01.320 align:middle line:84%
when your dental professional
does an exam on you.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.210 align:middle line:90%
They aren't supposed to bleed.

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:06.080 align:middle line:84%
Gingivitis is a sign,
it's a warning sign,

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.260 align:middle line:84%
it's a beacon that
something's going on.

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:09.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Can you see it?

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:10.970 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE:
Sometimes you can.

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:13.980 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you can see
redness in the tissue.

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:16.660 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you can see
inflammation in the tissue.

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:18.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
thing that there's

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:22.910 align:middle line:84%
such a spectrum on how gum
disease manifests and visually

00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:26.530 align:middle line:84%
shows up that you can't always
rely on just what you see.

00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:29.090 align:middle line:84%
But what the gums
should have is,

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:31.740 align:middle line:84%
if you looked at a close
up picture of gum tissue,

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:33.300 align:middle line:84%
it should have an
orange peel effect.

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:35.030 align:middle line:90%
That's called stippling.

00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:37.500 align:middle line:84%
That shows that there's
no inflammation.

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:40.180 align:middle line:84%
Those are the little
connective tissue rods,

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:42.670 align:middle line:84%
the fibers that hold the
gum tissue to the bone.

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:45.980 align:middle line:84%
If there's no inflammation,
that beautiful orange peel look

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:46.930 align:middle line:90%
is on the gums.

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:48.370 align:middle line:90%
They should be coral pink.

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:53.120 align:middle line:84%
Some different ethnic groups
do have brown or gray spots.

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:55.190 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't necessarily
mean a problem.

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:57.850 align:middle line:84%
But the key to the
first step of gum

00:21:57.850 --> 00:21:59.840 align:middle line:84%
disease, gingivitis,
is that there's

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:02.450 align:middle line:90%
bleeding and inflammation.

00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:05.187 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so when
you go to the dentist

00:22:05.187 --> 00:22:07.770 align:middle line:84%
for your little checkup, so you
use that little torture device

00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:11.150 align:middle line:84%
there that you have, and they
go and they examine your pockets

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:12.250 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you can show us
a little bit about that

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:19.890 align:middle line:84%
and what is a normal-- is any
depth of pocket normal to where

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:22.080 align:middle line:84%
you're in pretty bad
shape and you need to go

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.330 align:middle line:84%
and you need to have some
periodontal work done?

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:24.830 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Sure, sure.

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:25.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:27.830 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: It's hard when
we go to the office because we

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:29.600 align:middle line:84%
can't see what the dental
professional is doing--

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:30.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:32.655 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: -and I have
a wonderful intraoral camera,

00:22:32.655 --> 00:22:35.230 align:middle line:84%
but I can't run it and do a
dental exam at the same time.

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:37.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're in--
a lot of times in fear.

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:37.940 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Yeah, right.

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:38.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, OK.

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:39.160 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Exactly.

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:40.576 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes
you're just thinking

00:22:40.576 --> 00:22:43.280 align:middle line:84%
about other things,
not what's going on.

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:45.780 align:middle line:84%
So what I brought with us today
is I brought a little tooth

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:48.720 align:middle line:84%
model to kind of demonstrate
what we have going on.

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:53.710 align:middle line:84%
This is called a probe, and this
takes millimeter measurements

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:54.740 align:middle line:90%
under the gum.

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:58.650 align:middle line:84%
The one I use in practice
has 10 little stripes on it.

00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:00.010 align:middle line:90%
It's a metal instrument.

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:02.570 align:middle line:84%
This one just kind of
makes it a little easier

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:05.210 align:middle line:84%
to kind of delineate
where we're talking here.

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:09.480 align:middle line:84%
The green area is 3
millimeters and below.

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:12.190 align:middle line:84%
The middle red band
is five millimeters.

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:12.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:13.960 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE:
The thick red band

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:15.164 align:middle line:90%
is seven to 10 millimeters.

00:23:15.164 --> 00:23:16.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wow,
that's deep though.

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:17.450 align:middle line:90%
That's really deep.

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:18.366 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Right.

00:23:18.366 --> 00:23:21.530 align:middle line:84%
So what we do when we check
the gum tissue for health,

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:23.640 align:middle line:84%
we take the
millimeter measurement

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:26.270 align:middle line:84%
and we take six measurements
around each tooth.

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:29.910 align:middle line:84%
Three on the outside,
one, two, three.

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:31.950 align:middle line:84%
And three on the
inside, same thing.

00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:33.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's when
they're calling out the numbers?

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:34.190 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Correct.

00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:34.800 align:middle line:90%
Correct.

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And what you ideally
want in most situations

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:38.770 align:middle line:90%
is three and below.

00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:39.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:42.220 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: You can have a
healthy four-millimeter pocket,

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:45.130 align:middle line:84%
and you can also have an
inflamed two-millimeter pocket.

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:47.670 align:middle line:84%
So it's not only
the pocket depth.

00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:51.130 align:middle line:84%
We're also looking for any signs
of infection or inflammation.

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:54.140 align:middle line:84%
So when we measure three
millimeters below the tissue

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:56.540 align:middle line:84%
or less, there's
no inflammation,

00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:59.110 align:middle line:84%
there's no bleeding, we
consider that healthy gums.

00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:03.070 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: When we
measure three millimeters

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:06.350 align:middle line:84%
and above and there is
no bone loss that we

00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:09.200 align:middle line:84%
see on x-rays,
typically if there's

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:12.290 align:middle line:84%
bleeding or inflammation,
we consider that gingivitis.

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:12.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:14.580 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE:
The big transition

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:17.530 align:middle line:90%
is gingivitis is reversible.

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:21.630 align:middle line:84%
We can take our tissues and
get that irritating plaque,

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:27.120 align:middle line:84%
bacteria, use anti-inflammatory,
herbal mouth rinses,

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:31.450 align:middle line:84%
take good care, have good diet,
and reverse that and go exactly

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:33.270 align:middle line:84%
back to health right
where we started.

00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:35.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So people's mouths
can repair themselves?

00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:36.750 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: They
can, definitely.

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:37.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:38.843 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of times
people hear this news

00:24:38.843 --> 00:24:41.610 align:middle line:84%
and they're frightened
and think, oh my god,

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:43.630 align:middle line:84%
what's that going to
cost, you know, this time?

00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:43.985 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Exactly.

00:24:43.985 --> 00:24:44.560 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:45.380 align:middle line:90%
Right, right.

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:47.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, if gingivitis
is allowed to progress

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:50.420 align:middle line:84%
to the next phase, what happens
is we get a little deeper.

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:52.830 align:middle line:84%
The gums form a turtleneck
around the tooth

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:54.610 align:middle line:84%
and they're attached
at the base.

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:57.540 align:middle line:84%
So that inflammation
gets higher,

00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:59.520 align:middle line:90%
which leads to a deeper pocket.

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:03.160 align:middle line:84%
Plus it may start affecting
the attachment where

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:06.630 align:middle line:84%
that gum attaches to the tooth
and start pushing it down.

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:08.840 align:middle line:84%
The tartar starts to
build up under the gum.

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:11.620 align:middle line:84%
The bacteria that lives
under the gum is anaerobic.

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:13.530 align:middle line:90%
It hates oxygen.

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:15.160 align:middle line:90%
They are the bad bugs.

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:17.730 align:middle line:84%
We never want a sterile
mouth because the good bugs

00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:20.450 align:middle line:84%
above the gum line keep
other things at bay

00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:22.280 align:middle line:90%
and help with digestion.

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:25.680 align:middle line:84%
But under the gum, you can
get some pretty bad bacteria

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:30.200 align:middle line:84%
that can start living in the
tartar and bacterial-laden

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:32.060 align:middle line:90%
plaque that gets under the gum.

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:34.390 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is,
as it progresses,

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:37.750 align:middle line:84%
once it transitions
to the bone, that's

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:40.020 align:middle line:90%
where we call it periodontitis.

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:42.597 align:middle line:84%
Once bone dissolves
and bone is lost--

00:25:42.597 --> 00:25:44.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the bacteria
is dissolving the bone?

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:46.990 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: The
byproducts from the bacteria.

00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:47.490 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And so we get into a
vicious cycle that,

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:55.190 align:middle line:84%
say you have a area of gum
disease here and you have

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:58.662 align:middle line:84%
a five-millimeter pocket,
you cannot brush or floss--

00:25:58.662 --> 00:26:00.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, there's
nothing you can do there.

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:01.790 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB BRUCE: five
millemeters below the tissue.

00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:02.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:04.016 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: So
it's a vicious cycle.

00:26:04.016 --> 00:26:06.390 align:middle line:84%
The buildup-- the plaque
calcifies and gets

00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:09.830 align:middle line:84%
hard and stuck on the tooth
and that's called tarter.

00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And it irritates
the gum, it acts

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:12.810 align:middle line:90%
like a sliver in your skin.

00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:15.170 align:middle line:84%
Your skin would swell and
irritate and pull away

00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:16.660 align:middle line:90%
from that irritation.

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:18.610 align:middle line:90%
So it's a progressive disease.

00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:22.660 align:middle line:84%
And if we were to peel away the
gum tissue to look at the bone,

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:24.910 align:middle line:84%
the bone would
recede down and we

00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:28.443 align:middle line:84%
would have deposits of
tarter on the teeth--

00:26:28.443 --> 00:26:29.526 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All under there.

00:26:29.526 --> 00:26:30.580 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: -that
is full of bacteria.

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:30.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:33.345 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: And eventually
when you lose enough bone,

00:26:33.345 --> 00:26:36.110 align:middle line:84%
the teeth become mobile and
that's where we're in trouble.

00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:39.240 align:middle line:84%
But the amazing part
is that typically it's

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:40.960 align:middle line:90%
a painless process.

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.080 align:middle line:90%
Bone doesn't have nerve endings.

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:46.200 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to throb
and hurt and let you know.

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:49.650 align:middle line:84%
The gums don't have the
same type of nerve response

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:51.470 align:middle line:90%
as if you cut your finger.

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:55.260 align:middle line:84%
So until it's in the
very severe stages,

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:56.704 align:middle line:90%
it's typically painless.

00:26:56.704 --> 00:26:57.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:26:57.370 --> 00:26:58.180 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE:
So that's why it's

00:26:58.180 --> 00:26:59.846 align:middle line:84%
important to have a
dental professional.

00:26:59.846 --> 00:27:03.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so let's say it
gets pretty bad like that, what

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:06.850 align:middle line:84%
are some of the best
dental techniques

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:09.800 align:middle line:84%
available that can be used,
like planing and so forth?

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:12.979 align:middle line:84%
What happens once you hit
like a six level pocket

00:27:12.979 --> 00:27:14.770 align:middle line:84%
and you have all this
build up underneath--

00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:15.000 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Sure.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -and you're trying
to recover your mouth.

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.277 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:27:17.277 --> 00:27:19.610 align:middle line:84%
This is before we get into
any of the herbs, by the way.

00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:20.520 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Right, right.

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:21.820 align:middle line:84%
So what you would
come in is you would

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:23.540 align:middle line:84%
come into the dental
office for what's

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:26.220 align:middle line:84%
called a deep cleaning
and scaling ideally.

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:30.380 align:middle line:84%
We try to avoid all surgical
procedures if possible.

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:33.950 align:middle line:84%
The best thing to do is to
go do the deep cleaning,

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:36.830 align:middle line:84%
get all the buildup out
from underneath the gums,

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:41.110 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that there's
smooth root surfaces

00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:43.730 align:middle line:84%
and that's called root
planing, and make sure

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:46.654 align:middle line:84%
that we're taking out that
bacterial irritant that's

00:27:46.654 --> 00:27:48.820 align:middle line:84%
causing that problem like
that sliver under the gum.

00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:49.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I know
sometimes don't they

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:51.110 align:middle line:90%
put antibiotics in there then?

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:52.109 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Exactly.

00:27:52.109 --> 00:27:54.075 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, how do
you feel about that?

00:27:54.075 --> 00:27:55.450 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE:
It's interesting.

00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:58.710 align:middle line:84%
I typically have
used, for years,

00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:02.110 align:middle line:84%
a chlorhexidine gluconate
flush under the gum

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:03.500 align:middle line:90%
to fight the bacteria.

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:07.430 align:middle line:84%
But there's a new product
that I was introduced

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:10.610 align:middle line:84%
to by Dr. Michael Kolodychak,
he's an oral surgeon,

00:28:10.610 --> 00:28:13.280 align:middle line:84%
and he uses the product
for wound healing

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:14.710 align:middle line:90%
after extractions.

00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:17.060 align:middle line:84%
It's an all-natural
product called Socket

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:21.750 align:middle line:84%
and I'm implementing it
now into dental practice.

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:25.120 align:middle line:84%
And this has been some of the
limitations to implementing

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:29.630 align:middle line:84%
natural and herbal
products is that we are,

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:33.140 align:middle line:84%
by the standard of care, bound
to identifying the products

00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:33.920 align:middle line:90%
that we use.

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:35.440 align:middle line:84%
I can't, as a
dental professional,

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:38.594 align:middle line:84%
go out to a field and
wild craft an herb

00:28:38.594 --> 00:28:40.260 align:middle line:84%
and bring it in and
use it on a patient.

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:40.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:41.716 align:middle line:84%
That's what I was
referring to earlier

00:28:41.716 --> 00:28:42.830 align:middle line:90%
in the conversation, yes.

00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:43.100 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Right.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:43.410 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:44.410 align:middle line:90%
But we're getting there.

00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:45.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:47.285 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: The
pharmaceutical companies,

00:28:47.285 --> 00:28:49.720 align:middle line:84%
the oral care companies,
they're doing great research.

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:52.340 align:middle line:84%
It's coming out all
the time right now,

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:53.840 align:middle line:90%
that's really exciting.

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:59.730 align:middle line:84%
So this Socket uses oil of
clove and cinnamon and aloe,

00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:01.830 align:middle line:90%
and it is an approved product.

00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:03.211 align:middle line:90%
It's a wound healing product.

00:29:03.211 --> 00:29:04.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, wonderful.

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:06.540 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: And it's
all-natural, completely safe

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:07.450 align:middle line:90%
if swallowed.

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And what I'll do is
I'll administer it

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:12.935 align:middle line:84%
under the gum instead of a
more chemical pharmaceutical.

00:29:12.935 --> 00:29:14.864 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And is it
equally as effective

00:29:14.864 --> 00:29:16.280 align:middle line:84%
as those little
antibiotic things?

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:16.930 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: It is.

00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:17.510 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:18.343 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wonderful.

00:29:18.343 --> 00:29:20.300 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: The
science is amazing.

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:24.120 align:middle line:84%
You do not have to worry
about using something

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:29.620 align:middle line:84%
like an antibiotic chip or
an antibiotic fiber or gel

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:32.940 align:middle line:84%
and risk bacterial
drug-resistance.

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:36.702 align:middle line:84%
It is all-natural, it's
safe, and it works.

00:29:36.702 --> 00:29:37.410 align:middle line:90%
So we're excited.

00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:37.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's fabulous.

00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:38.780 align:middle line:90%
So we have to write that down.

00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:39.591 align:middle line:90%
It's called Socket.

00:29:39.591 --> 00:29:40.590 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Exactly.

00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:41.131 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:29:41.131 --> 00:29:43.890 align:middle line:84%
And now, is that only available
in that kind of situation

00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:45.550 align:middle line:84%
through the
professional industry?

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:47.250 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: It
is as far as I know.

00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:47.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:49.120 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: But
it's getting picked up

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:51.330 align:middle line:90%
by more and more vendors.

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:55.470 align:middle line:84%
And what you do is you get a
syringe of this viscous gel

00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:59.400 align:middle line:84%
and you apply it during the
procedure to, number one, act

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:02.450 align:middle line:84%
as a volinary or
healing product.

00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:03.840 align:middle line:90%
It's an antiseptic.

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:05.530 align:middle line:90%
It's an anti-inflammatory.

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:08.010 align:middle line:90%
It has analgesic effects to it.

00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:09.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The clove oil.

00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:09.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:10.120 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: And
you give the patient

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:12.940 align:middle line:84%
the remainder of the syringe
to take home and safely

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:13.610 align:middle line:90%
use at home.

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:14.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, that's fabulous.

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:17.260 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: And I'm
hoping that products like this

00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:19.030 align:middle line:84%
are going to get a
little more mainstream.

00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:19.790 align:middle line:90%
They're safe.

00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:20.520 align:middle line:90%
They're easy.

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:22.647 align:middle line:84%
And the science
proves they work.

00:30:22.647 --> 00:30:23.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good news.

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:25.396 align:middle line:84%
OK, what about when
you're doing root planing,

00:30:25.396 --> 00:30:26.600 align:middle line:90%
there are different options.

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:28.270 align:middle line:90%
How do you feel about laser?

00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:30.280 align:middle line:84%
Using the laser
for root planing?

00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:31.890 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE:
Well, in my state,

00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:34.250 align:middle line:84%
you know, unfortunately,
in the United

00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:37.180 align:middle line:84%
States as dental professionals,
we're all on different islands.

00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:40.270 align:middle line:84%
In my state, I'm not
permitted to use a laser,

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:43.940 align:middle line:84%
so typically I don't use--
we don't use little--

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:46.234 align:middle line:84%
I do the gum disease
treatments in the office.

00:30:46.234 --> 00:30:46.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:49.390 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: And we
don't use a laser with them.

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:49.890 align:middle line:90%
There are--

00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:51.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is there any
preference of laser

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:53.290 align:middle line:90%
over regular tools, or?

00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:57.040 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Well, as far
as the surgical procedures,

00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:59.960 align:middle line:84%
you definitely want to
aim towards the laser

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:03.259 align:middle line:84%
because the wound healing
is so much better.

00:31:03.259 --> 00:31:03.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:05.800 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: You want
to try to catch the gum

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:08.610 align:middle line:84%
disease before it really
needs surgical reduction.

00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:11.130 align:middle line:84%
If it does, the
laser's the way to go.

00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:13.520 align:middle line:84%
The laser can also
sterilize pockets

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:16.270 align:middle line:90%
and reduce bacterial levels.

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:20.020 align:middle line:84%
It is a less traumatic
way to reduce pockets

00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:21.670 align:middle line:90%
if we're to that point.

00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:22.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, OK.

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:24.850 align:middle line:90%
I just had to put that in there.

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:26.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, each time you're
saying something,

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:29.910 align:middle line:84%
it's triggering another
thought or remembrance.

00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:31.500 align:middle line:84%
One thing I've heard
is that if people

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:36.390 align:middle line:84%
use traditional mouthwashes that
have a lot of chemicals in them

00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:37.900 align:middle line:84%
that one of the
downsides of that

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:40.109 align:middle line:84%
is that it can kill all
that lovely good bacteria

00:31:40.109 --> 00:31:40.650 align:middle line:90%
in the mouth.

00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:41.417 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:31:41.417 --> 00:31:43.250 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Yes,
there is truth to that.

00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:46.830 align:middle line:84%
Long term use of particular
antibiotic mouth rinses

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:50.780 align:middle line:84%
will change the normal
flora in your mouth.

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:53.930 align:middle line:84%
It can lead you to-- whenever
there's a bacterial disruption,

00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:55.900 align:middle line:84%
you could have
different things happen.

00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:57.630 align:middle line:90%
Thrush is the most common.

00:31:57.630 --> 00:32:00.830 align:middle line:84%
If the good bacteria doesn't
keep the fungus in check,

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:02.690 align:middle line:90%
then you can get thrush.

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:05.782 align:middle line:84%
And thrush can be, although
it's not dangerous to--

00:32:05.782 --> 00:32:06.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very painful.

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:08.360 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE:
-life, it's miserable.

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:08.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:09.930 align:middle line:90%
I know people who've had that.

00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:11.180 align:middle line:90%
It's horrible.

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:11.977 align:middle line:90%
They can't eat.

00:32:11.977 --> 00:32:13.560 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE:
Infants can get thrush

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:16.500 align:middle line:84%
because their mother was
on a course of antibiotics

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:18.940 align:middle line:84%
and was breastfeeding them,
and they're still building up

00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:21.490 align:middle line:90%
that normal bacterial flora.

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:23.760 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing
to keep in mind

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:25.830 align:middle line:84%
when you're talking
about any home

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:28.540 align:middle line:84%
care products--
commercial home care

00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:31.130 align:middle line:84%
products is looking
at the ingredient.

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:34.380 align:middle line:84%
We've become, finally,
accustomed to really reading

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:35.310 align:middle line:90%
food labels.

00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:40.360 align:middle line:84%
We need to look at oral
care products, cosmetics,

00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:42.410 align:middle line:90%
different labels as well.

00:32:42.410 --> 00:32:44.200 align:middle line:84%
Because the mucous
membranes in the mouth

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.990 align:middle line:84%
can uptake what's
in those products.

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:49.040 align:middle line:84%
And if we look at
some of the products,

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:52.700 align:middle line:84%
we have a lot of
artificial colors.

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:55.650 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of
artificial sweeteners.

00:32:55.650 --> 00:32:58.700 align:middle line:84%
The artificial blues
are of a concern

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:00.180 align:middle line:90%
and being looked at right now.

00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:03.960 align:middle line:84%
But the big one I tend
to see the problem with

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:06.820 align:middle line:90%
is SLS, sodium lauryl sulfate.

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:08.560 align:middle line:90%
It's a surfactant.

00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:11.017 align:middle line:84%
It's an industrial
detergent agent.

00:33:11.017 --> 00:33:11.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:14.880 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: And back in
the day, before our time,

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:17.970 align:middle line:84%
everybody used tooth powder
and it didn't foam up.

00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:21.890 align:middle line:84%
But SLS got added to toothpaste
to give that foaming action,

00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:24.070 align:middle line:84%
and it's in a lot of
shampoos to really foam.

00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:27.590 align:middle line:84%
So foam equates
psychologically with clean.

00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:30.770 align:middle line:84%
But it actually doesn't
do anything to help,

00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:32.460 align:middle line:84%
and studies are
proving that it's

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:34.900 align:middle line:90%
increasing tooth sensitivity.

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:38.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's also being
implicated in aphthous ulcers,

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:40.650 align:middle line:90%
or commonly called canker sores.

00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:44.550 align:middle line:84%
So SLS, there's no good reason
to really have to have that,

00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:46.900 align:middle line:90%
and it's a good one to avoid.

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:49.320 align:middle line:84%
There's a controversy
going on right now

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:52.510 align:middle line:84%
on a product that's found
in a lot of deodorants

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:55.480 align:middle line:84%
and health care products,
primarily oral care products,

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:56.910 align:middle line:90%
called triclosan.

00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:58.660 align:middle line:90%
Some people call it triclosan.

00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And it was just
banned in Minnesota

00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:05.379 align:middle line:84%
as of 2017, I believe it is,
it has to be out of the soaps.

00:34:05.379 --> 00:34:07.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so what is
its effect in the mouth?

00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:10.130 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: It is
an antimicrobial agent.

00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:12.520 align:middle line:84%
And what they're
finding is, yes, it

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:17.070 align:middle line:84%
is an antimicrobial agent; but
in reference to your question,

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:21.940 align:middle line:84%
it's suspected in causing
drug-resistant bacteria

00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:27.800 align:middle line:84%
and altering the normal flora
of the mouth over long-term use.

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:30.469 align:middle line:84%
But on top of that, we're
seeing an environmental impact,

00:34:30.469 --> 00:34:34.250 align:middle line:84%
that it does not degrade so
it goes into the water system

00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:37.699 align:middle line:84%
and it's killing off algae that
are involved in photosynthesis

00:34:37.699 --> 00:34:38.199 align:middle line:90%
for the--

00:34:38.199 --> 00:34:38.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So--

00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:38.790 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: -planet.

00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:39.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: -off the list.

00:34:39.790 --> 00:34:40.290 align:middle line:90%
Avoid that.

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:41.206 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Right.

00:34:41.206 --> 00:34:41.750 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:42.194 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:34:42.194 --> 00:34:42.639 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
excellent information.

00:34:42.639 --> 00:34:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: -it
can really change

00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:46.530 align:middle line:84%
the good bacteria
that's in your mouth.

00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:48.969 align:middle line:84%
It can morph them
into being something

00:34:48.969 --> 00:34:51.570 align:middle line:84%
that they weren't meant to be,
and it can alter their balance.

00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:53.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so now let's
go into the herbal part

00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:54.480 align:middle line:90%
for a little while--

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:54.800 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Sure.

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -and talk
about what you would

00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:59.760 align:middle line:84%
consider to be maybe one of
the best types of toothpaste

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:03.005 align:middle line:84%
if you have a relatively
normal and healthy mouth.

00:35:03.005 --> 00:35:04.880 align:middle line:84%
The ones that are
available as pastes already

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:07.277 align:middle line:84%
versus maybe making your
own paste or powder.

00:35:07.277 --> 00:35:08.860 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Well,
I've tried both.

00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:12.210 align:middle line:84%
I've tried a homemade paste
with all different kinds

00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:13.660 align:middle line:90%
of crazy ingredients.

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And I've tried more
naturally marketed,

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:18.760 align:middle line:84%
available toothpaste
that weren't

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:21.020 align:middle line:84%
the typical in the
toothpaste aisle.

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:23.030 align:middle line:90%
And it's kind of exciting.

00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:25.770 align:middle line:84%
And I guess it depends on
your personal preference

00:35:25.770 --> 00:35:27.690 align:middle line:90%
and what works for you.

00:35:27.690 --> 00:35:31.120 align:middle line:84%
If someone is interested in
making their own toothpaste,

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:34.880 align:middle line:84%
the amount of options
are unlimited.

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:37.395 align:middle line:84%
It's like a full
cocktail that you

00:35:37.395 --> 00:35:39.770 align:middle line:84%
can make with a little bit of
this and a little bit that.

00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:41.770 align:middle line:84%
And we go into great
detail of that in the book.

00:35:41.770 --> 00:35:43.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, you do.

00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:45.690 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: We
picked 41 safe--

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:50.240 align:middle line:84%
we aimed for the safest herbs
that anyone could use and are

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:51.980 align:middle line:90%
safest, most readily available--

00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:52.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So give
us an idea of--

00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:52.880 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB BRUCE: like culinary.

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.885 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -what they are
and the form they're in

00:35:54.885 --> 00:35:56.532 align:middle line:84%
and how they would
be administered.

00:35:56.532 --> 00:35:57.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because
sometimes if you're

00:35:57.990 --> 00:35:59.910 align:middle line:84%
thinking in terms of an
essential oil, you know,

00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:01.173 align:middle line:90%
it's like, ow, ow, ow, you know.

00:36:01.173 --> 00:36:01.536 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Right.

00:36:01.536 --> 00:36:02.030 align:middle line:90%
You have to be careful.

00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:02.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That stuff burns.

00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:03.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:04.400 align:middle line:90%
So what--

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:07.200 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: One of
the favorite ones is sage.

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:10.320 align:middle line:84%
Sage is great because
you can make a tea.

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:13.500 align:middle line:84%
You could cool the tea
and add other elements

00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:15.334 align:middle line:84%
and make it an
excellent mouth rinse.

00:36:15.334 --> 00:36:16.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.330 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: You could
add salt scrub to it.

00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:21.930 align:middle line:84%
You can take a variety
of other herbs.

00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:27.700 align:middle line:84%
Each herb has a property or
a multiple list of properties

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:30.850 align:middle line:84%
that it has to it based
on its compounds that

00:36:30.850 --> 00:36:33.160 align:middle line:84%
are part of that herb,
the effective compounds.

00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:36.890 align:middle line:84%
So in the book we identify--
say, we take sage.

00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And sage may be antimicrobial,
anti-inflammatory.

00:36:41.290 --> 00:36:47.400 align:middle line:84%
And you could have clove, which
is an analgesic or a volinary

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:48.490 align:middle line:90%
or healing herb.

00:36:48.490 --> 00:36:52.110 align:middle line:84%
So say that's what your
situation is right now.

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:53.840 align:middle line:84%
You just had some
dental treatment,

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:56.340 align:middle line:84%
you have some infection,
you have some inflammation.

00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:58.690 align:middle line:84%
You could take a
nice sage tea, you

00:36:58.690 --> 00:37:02.170 align:middle line:84%
can cool it into--
make it a mouth rinse.

00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:03.710 align:middle line:84%
You could add a
little baking soda

00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:06.730 align:middle line:84%
as a neutralizing agent,
spraying a little clove in.

00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:09.940 align:middle line:84%
You could add a drop or two of
essential oil, very diluted,

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:11.770 align:middle line:84%
and kind of make
your own cocktail

00:37:11.770 --> 00:37:14.290 align:middle line:84%
and find out what
tastes good for you

00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:18.100 align:middle line:84%
and what fits your
particular circumstance.

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:22.080 align:middle line:84%
But also, sage leaves have
been used as a natural tooth

00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:22.630 align:middle line:90%
cleaner.

00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:24.497 align:middle line:84%
You can rub them
right on the teeth

00:37:24.497 --> 00:37:26.080 align:middle line:84%
and you can whiten
your teeth with it,

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:27.340 align:middle line:84%
and it's a great
breath freshener.

00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:28.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA:And they're
a little bit furry,

00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:30.215 align:middle line:84%
so it creates a little
bit of friction.

00:37:30.215 --> 00:37:32.298 align:middle line:84%
What about the notion, and
you just brought it up,

00:37:32.298 --> 00:37:34.404 align:middle line:84%
I was going to ask about
it, of baking soda?

00:37:34.404 --> 00:37:35.904 align:middle line:84%
And there are some
little, you know,

00:37:35.904 --> 00:37:38.403 align:middle line:84%
that you squeeze out of little
bottles that are commercially

00:37:38.403 --> 00:37:42.150 align:middle line:84%
available, as well just sticking
it in the Arm & Hammer box.

00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:44.280 align:middle line:84%
How does that do
as a toothpaste?

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:46.930 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: As a
toothpaste, it's a great base.

00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:49.180 align:middle line:90%
It's an acid neutralizer.

00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:52.500 align:middle line:84%
The big thing is is, especially
with the American diet,

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:55.420 align:middle line:90%
we have a high acid environment.

00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:56.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:58.860 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: And so
it's an alkaline agent,

00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:03.370 align:middle line:84%
so it brings us
closer to a neutral pH

00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:06.560 align:middle line:84%
where our mouth wants to be,
where our saliva is happy.

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:09.870 align:middle line:90%
So baking soda is great.

00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:13.040 align:middle line:84%
Although it's a crystalline
structure and it feels gritty,

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:16.490 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people translate
that it's too abrasive.

00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:17.830 align:middle line:90%
It really isn't.

00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:21.200 align:middle line:84%
The abrasive tests on it
show that it crumbles easily.

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:22.425 align:middle line:90%
It's easily dissolved.

00:38:22.425 --> 00:38:23.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It dissolves easily.

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:23.630 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Right.

00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:25.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And your teeth
feel so good afterwards.

00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:25.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:26.385 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Yeah.

00:38:26.385 --> 00:38:30.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm a big fan of baking soda,
natural unprocessed sea salts

00:38:30.970 --> 00:38:33.910 align:middle line:84%
as a scrub mixed with
like an herbal tea,

00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:37.957 align:middle line:84%
or possibly even an
herbal oil infusion.

00:38:37.957 --> 00:38:38.623 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:38:38.623 --> 00:38:40.123 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: And
those are great.

00:38:40.123 --> 00:38:42.248 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What are some of
the best essential oils?

00:38:42.248 --> 00:38:44.289 align:middle line:84%
I know you talked about
clove a little while ago,

00:38:44.289 --> 00:38:46.110 align:middle line:84%
but what are some
other really good ones?

00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:48.190 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE:
Peppermint, wintergreen.

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:49.315 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I love those.

00:38:49.315 --> 00:38:49.700 align:middle line:90%
All of those.

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:50.741 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Cinammon.

00:38:50.741 --> 00:38:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, it's
funny because if you

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:58.430 align:middle line:84%
look at oral care products,
these herbal products have been

00:38:58.430 --> 00:39:02.220 align:middle line:84%
ingredients in commercial
oral care products for years.

00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:05.240 align:middle line:84%
We don't necessarily
recognize them.

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:09.020 align:middle line:84%
Thymol is the basis
for Listerine.

00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:11.650 align:middle line:84%
Most Listerine
products have thymol.

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:13.900 align:middle line:84%
It always has since
it was invented

00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:15.960 align:middle line:90%
as a surgical antiseptic.

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And thymol is an element, a
chemical compound of thyme,

00:39:20.010 --> 00:39:21.450 align:middle line:90%
the herb thyme.

00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:24.360 align:middle line:90%
So it's not like it's new.

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:27.560 align:middle line:84%
We readily use Eugenol
in the dental office.

00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:33.070 align:middle line:84%
Eugenol is a compound pulled
from clove and different

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:34.840 align:middle line:90%
other natural products.

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:36.600 align:middle line:84%
We're using them, but
we're calling them

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:38.730 align:middle line:84%
something different,
so sometimes we

00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:41.600 align:middle line:84%
don't recognize that they
are tried and true that we

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:42.680 align:middle line:90%
use across the board.

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:45.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And sometimes you
see these wonderful, exotic,

00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:48.580 align:middle line:84%
natural concoctions that
are ayurvedic, for example.

00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And they have usually quite a
wide variety of herbs in them

00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:54.580 align:middle line:84%
and they're often a kind
of a brownish or beige kind

00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:55.080 align:middle line:90%
of paste.

00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:57.450 align:middle line:84%
Do you find a lot of those
to be really beneficial?

00:39:57.450 --> 00:39:58.620 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: They are.

00:39:58.620 --> 00:39:59.750 align:middle line:90%
They're amazing.

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And the good thing
about the book

00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:04.015 align:middle line:84%
is we have a big
chart so you can take,

00:40:04.015 --> 00:40:07.460 align:middle line:84%
am I looking for something
antimicrobial right now?

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:11.160 align:middle line:84%
Do I have a child
teething that's unhappy?

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:14.590 align:middle line:84%
You could make a chamomile
tea and soak a washcloth in it

00:40:14.590 --> 00:40:18.590 align:middle line:84%
and freeze it, and have the
baby suck on the washcloth.

00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:20.530 align:middle line:90%
There are the popsicles.

00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:23.760 align:middle line:84%
You can do popsicles
because it's cooling.

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:25.920 align:middle line:84%
It's unlimited
possibilities, and it's

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:28.040 align:middle line:90%
getting more mainstream.

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's exciting for me
because it brings more science

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:32.340 align:middle line:90%
to back up--

00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:32.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:33.430 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE:
-what we're saying.

00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:34.830 align:middle line:90%
It brings more data.

00:40:34.830 --> 00:40:36.450 align:middle line:90%
It brings more familiarity.

00:40:36.450 --> 00:40:39.810 align:middle line:84%
It makes it more open to
a wider range of people.

00:40:39.810 --> 00:40:41.870 align:middle line:84%
There's an exciting
toothpaste from a dentist

00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:45.680 align:middle line:84%
in New Orleans that isolated
an element in chocolate that

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:46.730 align:middle line:90%
is antibacterial.

00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:47.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, people will like--

00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:47.930 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: -the toothpaste.

00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:48.730 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: -hearing that.

00:40:48.730 --> 00:40:50.396 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Yeah,
but the toothpaste

00:40:50.396 --> 00:40:52.431 align:middle line:84%
supposedly doesn't
taste like chocolate.

00:40:52.431 --> 00:40:52.930 align:middle line:90%
But it--

00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:54.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Doesn't mean eat
a Hershey's bar necessarily

00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:54.880 align:middle line:90%
before it.

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:55.440 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Exactly.

00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:56.340 align:middle line:90%
Right, right.

00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:58.340 align:middle line:84%
But one that I'm in
love with right now,

00:40:58.340 --> 00:41:01.410 align:middle line:84%
I've been trying
Jason toothpaste

00:41:01.410 --> 00:41:03.730 align:middle line:84%
and various different
natural toothpastes

00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:05.650 align:middle line:90%
that you can purchase.

00:41:05.650 --> 00:41:08.540 align:middle line:84%
The one I love right now
and I keep going back to it

00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:11.790 align:middle line:84%
is TheraNeem Toothpaste
by Organix South.

00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:12.977 align:middle line:90%
And neem is--

00:41:12.977 --> 00:41:13.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Neem, yes.

00:41:13.810 --> 00:41:16.130 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: -a fantastic
product for the mouth.

00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:16.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:17.770 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: It is amazing.

00:41:17.770 --> 00:41:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And they have a
tooth powder, and I

00:41:19.530 --> 00:41:22.629 align:middle line:84%
consider myself to be
a pretty good brusher,

00:41:22.629 --> 00:41:25.170 align:middle line:84%
but my teeth have never felt so
clean when I brush with that.

00:41:25.170 --> 00:41:26.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, what's the
name of that product?

00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:27.190 align:middle line:90%
Is that Jason?

00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:27.905 align:middle line:90%
Is that Jason?

00:41:27.905 --> 00:41:29.150 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE:
That's Organix South--

00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:29.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Organix South--

00:41:29.310 --> 00:41:30.460 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE:
-TheraNeem Tooth Powder.

00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:32.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -TheraNeem
Tooth Powder.

00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:32.580 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:34.750 align:middle line:84%
So give everyone a chance
to write that down.

00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:35.340 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Right, right.

00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:36.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How-- where do
you get that, by the way?

00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:37.410 align:middle line:90%
I want to try it.

00:41:37.410 --> 00:41:38.909 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: I
got it mail order.

00:41:38.909 --> 00:41:40.390 align:middle line:90%
I mail order it direct.

00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:42.750 align:middle line:84%
I think it's readily
on the Amazon.

00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:45.920 align:middle line:84%
I think you can go right
to their website with that.

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:49.180 align:middle line:84%
They have a variety of
products, Neem Mouth

00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:53.277 align:middle line:84%
Rinse, Neem-saturated floss,
but I am a good brusher.

00:41:53.277 --> 00:41:54.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I've got a star on it.

00:41:54.610 --> 00:41:54.860 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Yeah.

00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:55.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:56.160 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:56.790 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:59.382 align:middle line:84%
I keep trying other ones,
but I love that one.

00:41:59.382 --> 00:42:00.340 align:middle line:90%
That one's my favorite.

00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:03.276 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so that gives
us a little bit of knowledge

00:42:03.276 --> 00:42:05.400 align:middle line:84%
we can take home and do
something about right away.

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:08.240 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about--
I have a few ways

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:10.800 align:middle line:84%
I want to go before
we come to our close.

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:12.269 align:middle line:84%
One of them is--
let's talk about,

00:42:12.269 --> 00:42:14.560 align:middle line:84%
because that's your specialty--
the systemic connection

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:18.080 align:middle line:84%
between your mouth and
the rest of your body.

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:20.346 align:middle line:84%
Some of the diseases people
would be surprised to see.

00:42:20.346 --> 00:42:21.470 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you have diabetes--

00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:21.900 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Definitely.

00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:22.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: -cancer.

00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:25.350 align:middle line:84%
All kinds of diseases
that are related in there.

00:42:25.350 --> 00:42:26.266 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Right.

00:42:26.266 --> 00:42:27.820 align:middle line:90%
Diabetes is the tried and true.

00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:31.160 align:middle line:84%
We've known for 50
years plus that diabetes

00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:34.130 align:middle line:84%
has a direct relationship
with gum disease.

00:42:34.130 --> 00:42:37.480 align:middle line:84%
There's newer links coming
out it seems all the time.

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:38.840 align:middle line:90%
Science is in an explosion.

00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:40.970 align:middle line:90%
It's really an exciting time.

00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:43.150 align:middle line:84%
The mouth is a
portal to the body.

00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:45.440 align:middle line:84%
If there is chronic
inflammation--

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:49.520 align:middle line:84%
chronic periodontal disease
is the most common type

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:50.330 align:middle line:90%
of gum disease.

00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:50.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:52.250 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: It
is the one you're

00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:53.510 align:middle line:90%
going to see all the time.

00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:56.370 align:middle line:84%
There's nine different
categories of gum disease,

00:42:56.370 --> 00:42:58.700 align:middle line:84%
but that's the
everyday one we have.

00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:00.570 align:middle line:84%
It's a chronic
inflammatory disease.

00:43:00.570 --> 00:43:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And what it does is, when
it's going on in your mouth,

00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:06.760 align:middle line:84%
it causes your body to release
inflammatory mediators.

00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:09.400 align:middle line:84%
Things like C-reactive
proteins and cytokines

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:11.610 align:middle line:84%
that circulate
through your blood.

00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:15.540 align:middle line:84%
In addition, when you have
an irritated inner lining

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:19.880 align:middle line:84%
of that gum tissue and this
virulent, bad bacteria sitting

00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:23.040 align:middle line:84%
right next to it, it will
enter the bloodstream.

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:26.040 align:middle line:84%
It will travel through
ulcerated tissue.

00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:28.480 align:middle line:84%
Plus, the inflammatory
mediators right there

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:32.040 align:middle line:84%
at that infected gum
tissue will travel straight

00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:33.070 align:middle line:90%
through the bloodstream.

00:43:33.070 --> 00:43:36.160 align:middle line:84%
So what's going on in your
mouth is not a separate entity

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:41.480 align:middle line:84%
like we kind of have treated it
being-- going to your dentist

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:42.775 align:middle line:90%
and they do this.

00:43:42.775 --> 00:43:45.330 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's all
related together.

00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:49.840 align:middle line:84%
Gum disease is tried and
true related with diabetes.

00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:51.440 align:middle line:90%
It's a two-way street.

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:55.250 align:middle line:84%
Diabetes makes gum disease worse
and makes you more prone to it,

00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:56.510 align:middle line:90%
and vice versa.

00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:58.050 align:middle line:84%
When your gum
disease is present,

00:43:58.050 --> 00:44:01.020 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have a harder
time getting glycemic control.

00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:03.640 align:middle line:84%
There's new studies out
looking at new links

00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:07.040 align:middle line:84%
between gum disease
and pancreatic cancer.

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:08.090 align:middle line:90%
Alzheimer's.

00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:12.020 align:middle line:84%
There was a really compelling
study that came out;

00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:14.710 align:middle line:84%
it was a very small
study so we're

00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:16.740 align:middle line:84%
waiting for more
information before we really

00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:19.220 align:middle line:84%
declare a causative
relationship,

00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:21.720 align:middle line:84%
but there's definitely
an association,

00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:25.020 align:middle line:84%
or what we would
call a risk factor.

00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:30.230 align:middle line:84%
They took brain tissue of
10 Alzheimer's patients.

00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And they found the virulent
bacteria, P gingivalis,

00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:38.390 align:middle line:84%
F nucleatum, all the bad
bugs in the brain tissue

00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:42.052 align:middle line:84%
of four of the 10
Alzheimer's patients.

00:44:42.052 --> 00:44:43.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, what was
Earth-shattering about that

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:46.170 align:middle line:84%
is these bacteria
were not believed

00:44:46.170 --> 00:44:49.020 align:middle line:84%
to be able to cross the
blood-brain barrier.

00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:51.030 align:middle line:84%
There's only one
bacteria, Spirochete,

00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:53.610 align:middle line:84%
known to be able to cross
the blood-brain barrier.

00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:57.720 align:middle line:84%
So the question became did
the bacteria morph and cross

00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:00.400 align:middle line:84%
the blood-brain barrier, or
did the blood-brain barrier

00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:01.637 align:middle line:90%
drop down?

00:45:01.637 --> 00:45:03.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And were those
particular bacteria

00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:06.030 align:middle line:84%
implicated in the effects
of Alzheimer's as well?

00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:07.363 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: They don't know.

00:45:07.363 --> 00:45:08.560 align:middle line:90%
They're still looking at it.

00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:11.900 align:middle line:84%
But in the brains of patients
without Alzheimer's, they

00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:14.440 align:middle line:84%
did not find any
of these bacteria.

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:17.850 align:middle line:84%
It is suspected, which they're
working right now to prove,

00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:20.200 align:middle line:84%
that the inflammatory
mediators that

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:22.080 align:middle line:84%
are circulating
through the blood

00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:25.590 align:middle line:84%
makes the blood-brain
barrier more permeable, more

00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:26.760 align:middle line:90%
penetrable.

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:28.890 align:middle line:90%
It drops our defenses.

00:45:28.890 --> 00:45:33.310 align:middle line:84%
It is a constant systemic load
on our immune system bringing

00:45:33.310 --> 00:45:34.540 align:middle line:90%
our immunity down.

00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:37.880 align:middle line:84%
So our immunity is busy over
here fighting our chronic perio

00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:41.230 align:middle line:84%
disease, how can it
go over here and fight

00:45:41.230 --> 00:45:43.290 align:middle line:84%
too many other battles
at the same time?

00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:46.047 align:middle line:84%
And another interesting one
is rheumatoid arthritis.

00:45:46.047 --> 00:45:46.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:48.300 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: If
you look at the blood

00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:52.170 align:middle line:84%
profile of a patient with
chronic periodontal disease

00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:54.910 align:middle line:84%
and a patient with
rheumatoid arthritis,

00:45:54.910 --> 00:45:57.510 align:middle line:84%
and they only have one,
they look identical.

00:45:57.510 --> 00:46:00.610 align:middle line:84%
They are chronic,
they are inflammatory.

00:46:00.610 --> 00:46:04.680 align:middle line:84%
If you have both, they're
going to make each other worse.

00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:07.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
let's talk about some

00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:10.970 align:middle line:84%
of the foods that are
aggravating that chronically

00:46:10.970 --> 00:46:14.260 align:middle line:84%
inflamed condition in
any tissues of the body.

00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:17.870 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: I would say
that acidic foods, sugary foods,

00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:20.480 align:middle line:84%
anything that promotes
bacterial growth.

00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:21.855 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you feed
these bacteria,

00:46:21.855 --> 00:46:22.938 align:middle line:90%
they're going to be happy.

00:46:22.938 --> 00:46:24.220 align:middle line:90%
They're going to overgrow.

00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:27.340 align:middle line:84%
So there are so many
factors in tooth decay.

00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:29.910 align:middle line:84%
There are many factors
in gum disease.

00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:33.090 align:middle line:84%
Food and nutrition
is so important.

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:36.790 align:middle line:84%
If you have good
B vitamin intake,

00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:39.370 align:middle line:84%
you have good C vitamin,
your oral tissues

00:46:39.370 --> 00:46:40.560 align:middle line:90%
are going to be healthier.

00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:42.880 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be
able to fight off

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:45.020 align:middle line:90%
inflammation a lot better.

00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:48.010 align:middle line:90%
Diet is so important.

00:46:48.010 --> 00:46:51.410 align:middle line:84%
The additives that
we're using are not

00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:53.340 align:middle line:90%
meant to be in our bodies.

00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:57.830 align:middle line:84%
They can inflame tissue, they
can add to systemic disease,

00:46:57.830 --> 00:46:59.860 align:middle line:84%
and they can
aggravate conditions

00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:01.740 align:middle line:90%
that we may already have.

00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:04.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now
let's hop it along.

00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:06.750 align:middle line:84%
So maybe we didn't
do such a great job,

00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:13.480 align:middle line:84%
so we've had gingivitis and
now it's impacted our bone.

00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And now we've
started losing teeth.

00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens with the
loss of a tooth in the mouth?

00:47:21.210 --> 00:47:22.650 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE:
If you think of it

00:47:22.650 --> 00:47:25.860 align:middle line:84%
like a jigsaw puzzle
together, or if we go back

00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:28.790 align:middle line:84%
to the foundation of a house
and you pull one block out,

00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:29.960 align:middle line:90%
it's a problem.

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:32.510 align:middle line:84%
If you lose one tooth
and it's not replaced,

00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:34.810 align:middle line:84%
the other teeth will
start tilting in.

00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:39.730 align:middle line:84%
The tooth above that or below
it that has the opposition bite

00:47:39.730 --> 00:47:42.190 align:middle line:84%
will start continuing to
come out of the gum line.

00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:45.440 align:middle line:84%
Teeth don't have a set
eruption rate where they stop.

00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:47.370 align:middle line:84%
They stop when they
hit something else.

00:47:47.370 --> 00:47:49.130 align:middle line:84%
If it has nothing to
hit, it'll continue

00:47:49.130 --> 00:47:50.647 align:middle line:84%
to erupt until it
hits something,

00:47:50.647 --> 00:47:51.980 align:middle line:90%
and usually that'll be the gums.

00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:53.145 align:middle line:90%
And that'll be really bad.

00:47:53.145 --> 00:47:53.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:47:53.770 --> 00:47:55.145 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE:
So it's important

00:47:55.145 --> 00:47:57.720 align:middle line:84%
that once we get into
those malalignments,

00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:02.170 align:middle line:84%
if we lose a tooth, that we
replace it as soon as possible

00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:04.680 align:middle line:84%
and keep those malalignments
from happening.

00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:06.440 align:middle line:90%
It'll trap more bacteria.

00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:08.510 align:middle line:90%
It will trap more food.

00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:11.530 align:middle line:90%
It can cause headaches.

00:48:11.530 --> 00:48:14.980 align:middle line:84%
It can cause TMJ dysfunction
of the jaw joint.

00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:18.520 align:middle line:84%
It can cause a lot of
issues with the bite.

00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:21.970 align:middle line:84%
It can cause trauma
to other teeth.

00:48:21.970 --> 00:48:24.670 align:middle line:84%
When we walk, we
use the whole foot.

00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:27.000 align:middle line:84%
It's important to spread
all of our chewing

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.620 align:middle line:90%
across the entire mouth.

00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:29.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:32.470 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I'm going to ask you
something kind of personal now.

00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:34.022 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Sure.

00:48:34.022 --> 00:48:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There was something
going on with my teeth.

00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:37.540 align:middle line:84%
It was just kind
of wacky and it was

00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:38.970 align:middle line:84%
impacting the bone
and everything.

00:48:38.970 --> 00:48:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And finally this one brilliant,
old-fashioned dentist,

00:48:42.350 --> 00:48:46.350 align:middle line:84%
who loves bites, he just
loves adjusting bites, said,

00:48:46.350 --> 00:48:48.504 align:middle line:84%
you have the screwiest
looking bite.

00:48:48.504 --> 00:48:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And because my teeth
have always been straight

00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:53.429 align:middle line:84%
and I've never have any kind of
orthodontic work or anything,

00:48:53.429 --> 00:48:54.720 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't have suspected that.

00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:56.420 align:middle line:84%
But, in fact, for
whatever reason,

00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:59.140 align:middle line:84%
they'd started moving around
a little bit in the very back.

00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:05.000 align:middle line:84%
So he suggested that I
try Invisaligns and bring

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.290 align:middle line:84%
those teeth into
the proper alignment

00:49:07.290 --> 00:49:10.300 align:middle line:84%
again, because he was talking
about this misalignment

00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:13.610 align:middle line:84%
creating pressures and stresses
on the bite that actually

00:49:13.610 --> 00:49:17.925 align:middle line:84%
will start working
against the bone itself.

00:49:17.925 --> 00:49:18.925 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Exactly.

00:49:18.925 --> 00:49:20.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
disintegrating the bone.

00:49:20.250 --> 00:49:21.791 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
bite a little bit?

00:49:21.791 --> 00:49:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll go on
to something else.

00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:23.830 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Sure.

00:49:23.830 --> 00:49:24.520 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:27.410 align:middle line:84%
When you have a
traumatic bite, something

00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:28.920 align:middle line:90%
has to take the impact.

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:31.150 align:middle line:90%
If-- teeth are dynamic.

00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:33.720 align:middle line:84%
They don't erupt and when
we're 18 that's where they are

00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:34.520 align:middle line:90%
and that's where they stay.

00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:36.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're moving
around a bit, yeah.

00:49:36.030 --> 00:49:36.946 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Right.

00:49:36.946 --> 00:49:39.320 align:middle line:84%
Our bone is constantly
dissolving and regenerating.

00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:41.700 align:middle line:84%
And the teeth are held
into the bone by ligaments,

00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:45.470 align:middle line:84%
so they do move over time,
and they will shift over time.

00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:47.990 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes that
shift is very gradual,

00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:50.940 align:middle line:84%
but will evolve into
a traumatic bite.

00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:54.180 align:middle line:84%
If you have two teeth that
are hitting together too hard,

00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:56.080 align:middle line:84%
something is going
to take the impact.

00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:57.890 align:middle line:84%
That is going to
come down to the bone

00:49:57.890 --> 00:49:59.140 align:middle line:90%
and the ligament of the tooth.

00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:01.750 align:middle line:84%
That can cause a
traumatic bone injury.

00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:04.290 align:middle line:84%
So that can cause
the bone to dissolve.

00:50:04.290 --> 00:50:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And additionally,
it can also affect

00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:08.220 align:middle line:90%
the root structure of the tooth.

00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:10.690 align:middle line:84%
It can cause something that
we call root resorption,

00:50:10.690 --> 00:50:13.150 align:middle line:84%
causing it to dissolve
due to trauma.

00:50:13.150 --> 00:50:16.520 align:middle line:84%
And in severe cases, it
can cause the actual nerve

00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:18.460 align:middle line:84%
within the tooth to
die due to trauma.

00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:19.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know,
it's interesting

00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:22.960 align:middle line:84%
because most people would-- I
had no idea my bite was off.

00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:25.020 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't anything
really odd or noticeable.

00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:25.936 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Right.

00:50:25.936 --> 00:50:29.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how would a person
know that the problems they're

00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:32.200 align:middle line:84%
having in their mouth
might be due to having

00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:33.430 align:middle line:90%
a bite that's gone off?

00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Right, right.

00:50:34.070 --> 00:50:35.700 align:middle line:84%
If your teeth are
straight, you may not

00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:39.070 align:middle line:84%
realize it because it's
how they lock together.

00:50:39.070 --> 00:50:43.100 align:middle line:84%
They were meant to have pits and
fissures and peaks and valleys

00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:46.440 align:middle line:84%
that mesh together
perfectly to chew our food.

00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:49.480 align:middle line:84%
That's not something that you
can easily bite down and see.

00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:52.090 align:middle line:84%
So some of the
clues you may see is

00:50:52.090 --> 00:50:53.710 align:middle line:84%
that you may have
clicking or popping

00:50:53.710 --> 00:50:55.750 align:middle line:90%
in the jaw joint by the ear.

00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:57.920 align:middle line:84%
You may have limited
opening, pain on opening.

00:50:57.920 --> 00:50:59.630 align:middle line:84%
You may be having
persistent headaches

00:50:59.630 --> 00:51:02.620 align:middle line:84%
and it may progress
through to the neck.

00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:04.970 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, if you
take a bite paper--

00:51:04.970 --> 00:51:07.580 align:middle line:84%
if you go to the dental office
and they take a bite paper,

00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:10.660 align:middle line:84%
they can identify areas
that are hitting hard

00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:12.120 align:middle line:84%
that weren't meant
to hit together.

00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And those areas you
definitely want to correct.

00:51:14.970 --> 00:51:18.290 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you can feel a
manifestation in the bone.

00:51:18.290 --> 00:51:19.880 align:middle line:90%
It'll feel like a bruise.

00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:22.310 align:middle line:84%
You can say that this tooth
hurts when I chew food

00:51:22.310 --> 00:51:24.430 align:middle line:84%
and I think it's this
one, but maybe that one.

00:51:24.430 --> 00:51:27.210 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't identify
to an individual tooth.

00:51:27.210 --> 00:51:30.110 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of diffuse and
wanders because it's the bone,

00:51:30.110 --> 00:51:32.110 align:middle line:84%
and the bone doesn't have
those particular nerve

00:51:32.110 --> 00:51:32.550 align:middle line:90%
fibers in them.

00:51:32.550 --> 00:51:33.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:36.060 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: But a good
dental exam can identify those,

00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:37.650 align:middle line:84%
and that's definitely something
that you want to correct.

00:51:37.650 --> 00:51:38.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's
important because it

00:51:38.170 --> 00:51:39.600 align:middle line:84%
could cause the
loss of the tooth.

00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And I followed his
advice, and I thought,

00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:43.560 align:middle line:84%
OK, it's a little late in life
to do Invisaligns, you know.

00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:44.476 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Never.

00:51:44.476 --> 00:51:47.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But anyway, I decided
to do-- I just do it at night.

00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:50.860 align:middle line:84%
But six months or a year
later, he looks at it and says,

00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:51.640 align:middle line:90%
my god.

00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:54.720 align:middle line:84%
The bone is where-- is growing
back where it needs to be.

00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:56.414 align:middle line:84%
The teeth are really
good and solid

00:51:56.414 --> 00:51:57.830 align:middle line:84%
and moving right
toward where they

00:51:57.830 --> 00:52:00.430 align:middle line:84%
need to be and just a
tiny little adjustment,

00:52:00.430 --> 00:52:01.890 align:middle line:90%
buff it out at the end of that.

00:52:01.890 --> 00:52:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And then just stay with
sleeping with those

00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:07.247 align:middle line:84%
at night throughout,
if you want,

00:52:07.247 --> 00:52:08.330 align:middle line:90%
the rest of your lifetime.

00:52:08.330 --> 00:52:10.204 align:middle line:84%
It keeps all of your
teeth exactly where they

00:52:10.204 --> 00:52:11.970 align:middle line:84%
need to be to avoid
all this trauma

00:52:11.970 --> 00:52:15.200 align:middle line:84%
and movement that happens
throughout a lifetime.

00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:16.440 align:middle line:90%
So you're a big fan of that?

00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:18.065 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: I did
Invisalign when I was 41.

00:52:18.065 --> 00:52:19.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, you did?

00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:19.420 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:19.670 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Yeah.

00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:22.710 align:middle line:84%
I had-- my front teeth decided
out of the blue to bail ship

00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:25.560 align:middle line:84%
and decided to drift
all of a sudden,

00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:27.830 align:middle line:90%
and I knew what was going on.

00:52:27.830 --> 00:52:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And I felt a traumatic
bite developing.

00:52:30.850 --> 00:52:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And we did Invisalign
of me in my office.

00:52:33.350 --> 00:52:35.620 align:middle line:90%
I am a big fan of Invisalign.

00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:38.090 align:middle line:84%
Traditional braces are
great, but the Invisalign

00:52:38.090 --> 00:52:41.320 align:middle line:84%
has the advantage that you
don't have them affixed

00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:42.944 align:middle line:84%
to the teeth to
trap those bacteria.

00:52:42.944 --> 00:52:43.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:52:43.610 --> 00:52:45.150 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: It's
less of a risk of decay

00:52:45.150 --> 00:52:46.630 align:middle line:84%
because you can
effectively clean,

00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:48.170 align:middle line:90%
you can take them out to eat.

00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:50.380 align:middle line:84%
So it's not an
option for everyone,

00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:52.075 align:middle line:90%
but it's a great option.

00:52:52.075 --> 00:52:52.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:54.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm happy
you brought it up.

00:52:54.570 --> 00:52:56.510 align:middle line:10%
OK, so we only have
a few minutes left

00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:58.830 align:middle line:10%
and we have to get onto
one of controversial issues

00:52:58.830 --> 00:53:00.880 align:middle line:10%
and that is the use of fluoride.

00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:02.260 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Yes.

00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:04.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know, even though
I've done shows on fluoride

00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:07.020 align:middle line:84%
and what it does systemically
and what it's also

00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:09.270 align:middle line:84%
suspected to do, and kind
of the nature of what it is.

00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:09.500 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Right.

00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:10.586 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I've talked
to other people who

00:53:10.586 --> 00:53:12.419 align:middle line:84%
have said, you know,
if it's used topically,

00:53:12.419 --> 00:53:14.340 align:middle line:84%
it can also stop
the decay process.

00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:16.169 align:middle line:90%
What's the truth about fluoride?

00:53:16.169 --> 00:53:18.210 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: There's
a ton of misinformation--

00:53:18.210 --> 00:53:18.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, there is.

00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:19.973 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: -about fluoride.

00:53:19.973 --> 00:53:22.200 align:middle line:84%
We could do a
whole show on this.

00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:25.600 align:middle line:84%
The big misconceptions
is you have

00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:27.940 align:middle line:90%
to look at fluoride in two ways.

00:53:27.940 --> 00:53:30.890 align:middle line:84%
There's systemic fluoride
that would be taken as a pill,

00:53:30.890 --> 00:53:32.870 align:middle line:84%
like a supplement,
or in the water,

00:53:32.870 --> 00:53:34.790 align:middle line:90%
or in a fluoridated salt.

00:53:34.790 --> 00:53:36.467 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
topical fluoride--

00:53:36.467 --> 00:53:37.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:53:37.050 --> 00:53:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: -that can
help remineralize enamel.

00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:42.970 align:middle line:84%
On the systemic
fluoride, it is proven

00:53:42.970 --> 00:53:48.900 align:middle line:84%
that enamel that was formed
during fluoride administration

00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:51.290 align:middle line:90%
is more resistant to decay.

00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:54.210 align:middle line:84%
But the controversy comes
in, and rightfully so,

00:53:54.210 --> 00:53:57.350 align:middle line:84%
that if you're fluoridating
an entire population,

00:53:57.350 --> 00:53:59.270 align:middle line:90%
you're not giving them a choice.

00:53:59.270 --> 00:54:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And so, oftentimes
on the internet,

00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:04.000 align:middle line:84%
you read that this
country or that country

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:07.130 align:middle line:84%
doesn't fluoridate their water
and their decay levels are low.

00:54:07.130 --> 00:54:10.350 align:middle line:84%
But we have to look at all the
factors in the big picture.

00:54:10.350 --> 00:54:13.870 align:middle line:84%
Some of them opt
for fluoridated salt

00:54:13.870 --> 00:54:16.900 align:middle line:84%
so the consumer has the
choice instead of fluoridating

00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:19.410 align:middle line:84%
the entire population
in the municipal water,

00:54:19.410 --> 00:54:21.250 align:middle line:84%
you can choose to
buy fluoridated salt

00:54:21.250 --> 00:54:22.650 align:middle line:90%
or non-fluoridated salt.

00:54:22.650 --> 00:54:24.560 align:middle line:84%
In some of the
European countries,

00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:28.550 align:middle line:84%
the dental care for children is
part of what happens in school.

00:54:28.550 --> 00:54:29.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:32.680 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE:
Unfortunately, in the US,

00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:34.459 align:middle line:84%
we're dropping the
ball on the kids.

00:54:34.459 --> 00:54:35.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Big time.

00:54:35.250 --> 00:54:36.500 align:middle line:10%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: It's big time.

00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:37.520 align:middle line:10%
It shouldn't be.

00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:40.980 align:middle line:10%
And so, the kids are all taken
care of in a different way.

00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:43.010 align:middle line:84%
So we have to kind of
look at all the factors,

00:54:43.010 --> 00:54:46.420 align:middle line:84%
but I do respect that
it should be an option.

00:54:46.420 --> 00:54:49.370 align:middle line:84%
But when we look at topical
fluoride, it's important.

00:54:49.370 --> 00:54:52.990 align:middle line:10%
And what we practice
in our practice

00:54:52.990 --> 00:54:55.150 align:middle line:10%
is a caries risk assessment.

00:54:55.150 --> 00:54:59.305 align:middle line:84%
If someone is an adult patient
with dry mouth undergoing head

00:54:59.305 --> 00:55:02.930 align:middle line:84%
and neck radiation therapy
with the saliva that

00:55:02.930 --> 00:55:06.740 align:middle line:84%
helps fight decay
next to non-existent,

00:55:06.740 --> 00:55:09.210 align:middle line:84%
they are a high-risk
person that could benefit

00:55:09.210 --> 00:55:11.059 align:middle line:84%
from an application
of fluoride varnish.

00:55:11.059 --> 00:55:11.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:14.250 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: But say you
have a 40-year-old that comes in

00:55:14.250 --> 00:55:18.510 align:middle line:84%
and has never had a filling,
never had decay, strong enamel,

00:55:18.510 --> 00:55:19.640 align:middle line:90%
great diet.

00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:22.520 align:middle line:84%
Do you necessarily need
to apply fluoride there?

00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:26.217 align:middle line:84%
I think it needs to
be risk assessed.

00:55:26.217 --> 00:55:27.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Dependent.

00:55:27.050 --> 00:55:28.360 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Yeah.

00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:31.500 align:middle line:90%
And it is a personal choice.

00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:33.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We have only a minute
left, just a few seconds.

00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:36.509 align:middle line:84%
Any final thoughts that
we haven't gotten to yet?

00:55:36.509 --> 00:55:38.800 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: No, the main
message that we have is it

00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:41.220 align:middle line:84%
was really important for
us to write this piece

00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:43.710 align:middle line:84%
and there's nothing
else like that.

00:55:43.710 --> 00:55:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And the more
natural and educated

00:55:46.010 --> 00:55:49.260 align:middle line:84%
we are about our choices, I
think the better off we are

00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:51.176 align:middle line:84%
and it's good to know
what our options are.

00:55:51.176 --> 00:55:52.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:55:52.050 --> 00:55:52.990 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Linda.

00:55:52.990 --> 00:55:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And you have a beautiful
smile, beautiful teeth.

00:55:54.730 --> 00:55:55.370 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAUB-BRUCE: Thank you.

00:55:55.370 --> 00:55:57.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Good
example for your book.

00:55:57.220 --> 00:55:59.320 align:middle line:84%
Again, the book is called
"Dental Herbalism,"

00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:01.517 align:middle line:84%
