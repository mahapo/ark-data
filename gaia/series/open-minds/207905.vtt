00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.280 align:middle line:84%
>> I would like people to really
free up their imaginations.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.700 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you can remember the
whole story of a whole dynasty

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.070 align:middle line:84%
just from reading a
fictional portrayal of it.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:21.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.130 align:middle line:90%
It's nonfiction.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.380 align:middle line:84%
It's basically
left-brain data analysis.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.890 align:middle line:84%
And what's going on with
fiction, if you think about it,

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:28.980 align:middle line:90%
is imagination.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:29.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.040 align:middle line:84%
>> What we're seeing in this
trilogy is the living out

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.050 align:middle line:84%
of this period of time through
the lives and personalities

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.910 align:middle line:84%
of some really
interesting characters.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.000 align:middle line:84%
So "Aquarian Age" is
dealing with the shift out

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.090 align:middle line:84%
of the Age of Pisces and into
the Age of Aquarius, which

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.080 align:middle line:90%
is what's happening right now.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.410 align:middle line:84%
And this book, in this
case, is covering thousands

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.590 align:middle line:84%
of years going way
back even to Atlantis

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.330 align:middle line:90%
through Alessandro de' Medici.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.930 align:middle line:90%
One character thinks one thing.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:58.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Another character
seeking something else.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.990 align:middle line:84%
And if you put it
together in your brain,

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.550 align:middle line:90%
you start to get the point.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.094 align:middle line:84%
The essence of being human
is to be imaginative.

00:01:08.094 --> 00:01:11.793 align:middle line:90%


00:01:11.793 --> 00:01:13.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: This
is a very special show

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.440 align:middle line:84%
in that Barbara Hand Clow
is wrapping up a decade

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.530 align:middle line:84%
long journey with her trilogy,
the final book titled,

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.240 align:middle line:90%
"Revelations From The Source."

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.690 align:middle line:84%
The story is set in Italy with
the Catholic Church and a cast

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.000 align:middle line:84%
of archetypal
characters converging

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.760 align:middle line:84%
to illustrate the disruptive
nature of our times.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.060 align:middle line:84%
Everything is up for review
in this final chapter.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.320 align:middle line:90%
Barbara, welcome back.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.713 align:middle line:90%
>>BARBARA HAND CLOW: Hi, Regina.

00:01:34.713 --> 00:01:35.010 align:middle line:90%
Good to see you.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I've been on
this journey with you.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:37.335 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yes.

00:01:37.335 --> 00:01:39.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think we were
talking about it when you first

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.840 align:middle line:84%
started and what
a decision it was

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.780 align:middle line:84%
to move from your
previous work to fiction.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:47.580 align:middle line:10%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.920 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And this
was a really--

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.490 align:middle line:10%
this was a huge shift
internally for you to do this,

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.140 align:middle line:10%
and I am so grateful
that you did.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.240 align:middle line:84%
Because personally,
I think it's because

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.220 align:middle line:84%
of the emotional nature
and the textures that

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.050 align:middle line:90%
can be set in fiction.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.280 align:middle line:84%
I have always learned
best through fiction,

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.490 align:middle line:84%
whether it's historical
novels or whatnot.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And your work has been so deep
and complex over the decades

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.710 align:middle line:84%
that you were able
to embed everything

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.960 align:middle line:84%
you've ever written
about in this trilogy

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.190 align:middle line:90%
through these characters.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's how
personally I learn best.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: And it's interesting
also how you remember best

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.950 align:middle line:90%
because--

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:27.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.630 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: --because sometimes you
can remember the whole story

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.990 align:middle line:84%
of a whole dynasty
just from reading

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.750 align:middle line:90%
a fictional portrayal of it.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:35.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.170 align:middle line:90%


00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.900 align:middle line:84%
There was a study done
that humans learn best

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.130 align:middle line:90%
through storytelling.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.750 align:middle line:84%
That's how we
remember, and that's

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.240 align:middle line:84%
what we retained to
pass on in old times

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.455 align:middle line:90%
to the next generations.

00:02:47.455 --> 00:02:48.380 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: That's right.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so that's very
different than relaying data,

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.590 align:middle line:90%
relaying information.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.610 align:middle line:84%
And your books are fabulously
full of information.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And now, you've taken
this all to a story

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.430 align:middle line:84%
that you feel you connect
with the characters,

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.960 align:middle line:84%
so you start embracing
the knowledge differently.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.158 align:middle line:84%
So what was your intention at
the very beginning in putting

00:03:09.158 --> 00:03:10.450 align:middle line:90%
all this into these characters?

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: I think first
of all, this trilogy

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.370 align:middle line:84%
also has lots of information,
and all the background

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.800 align:middle line:84%
information in the
trilogy is correct.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And so hopefully,
people will really

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.240 align:middle line:84%
learn a lot about how
the church operates

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.800 align:middle line:84%
and how politics
operate in all of that.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.640 align:middle line:84%
But I think the real reason
that it's so much more

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.090 align:middle line:84%
powerful than nonfiction
is nonfiction is basically

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.560 align:middle line:90%
left-brain data analysis.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.100 align:middle line:84%
And what's going on with
fiction, if you think about it,

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.130 align:middle line:90%
is imagination.

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: And in the new
age, one of the things

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.880 align:middle line:84%
we've been learning
for the last 50, 60, 70

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.920 align:middle line:84%
years is the power
of the imagination.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And so I think it's
time for people

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.360 align:middle line:90%
to return to the imagination.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.560 align:middle line:84%
Because right now, we're
having an amazing lack

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.250 align:middle line:84%
of availability of news
and information in general.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.810 align:middle line:90%
It's just going away.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And now we need to
use our imaginations,

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.050 align:middle line:84%
and so that was the
point of the trilogy.

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And when I first
conceived of it,

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.440 align:middle line:84%
I realized that it
was very important

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.560 align:middle line:84%
that I cover this period
of time, which is basically

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.430 align:middle line:90%
2012 to 2021.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.810 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: And I knew way
back then as an astrologer

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.990 align:middle line:84%
that this was going to be an
incredible period in history.

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And I knew-- I could
see as an astrologer

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.420 align:middle line:84%
that our world was going
to crack apart in 2020,

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.350 align:middle line:90%
and it actually happened.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.740 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're
seeing in this trilogy

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.850 align:middle line:84%
is the living out of
this period of time

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.830 align:middle line:84%
through the lives and
personalities of some really

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.255 align:middle line:90%
interesting characters.

00:04:40.255 --> 00:04:44.280 align:middle line:84%
The other key to this trilogy is
there aren't any boring people

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.080 align:middle line:90%
in this trilogy.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.163 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, they're not.

00:04:46.163 --> 00:04:47.755 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's got a
place in the story.

00:04:47.755 --> 00:04:49.360 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: They are
really complicated.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.552 align:middle line:84%
You can't afford to have
marginal characters when

00:04:51.552 --> 00:04:53.590 align:middle line:84%
you have this much
to bring information

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.150 align:middle line:84%
to bring through
these characters.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.600 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: That's right.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And then what I couldn't
have anticipated,

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.100 align:middle line:84%
but what I can see
now in retrospect,

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.210 align:middle line:84%
is that we're really losing the
fabric of our creative reality

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.330 align:middle line:84%
right now just because of
what's going on in the world.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.410 align:middle line:84%
And this trilogy really brings
that back and refreshes it,

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:12.720 align:middle line:90%
because we can't let that go.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We can't.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: The essence of being
human is to be imaginative.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:17.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.120 align:middle line:84%
And so this gets
into the paradigm

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.850 align:middle line:84%
shift of the Age of
Aquarius, we have astrology,

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.540 align:middle line:84%
we have multidimensionality,
we have the rising wave

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.840 align:middle line:84%
of the feminine coming in
and going into collaboration

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.580 align:middle line:90%
with the masculine.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.775 align:middle line:84%
All of that's embedded
in this story, the things

00:05:32.775 --> 00:05:33.650 align:middle line:90%
you've written about.

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.730 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd like to do
is backtrack a little bit

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.100 align:middle line:84%
and go back to the beginning,
"Revelations of the Ruby

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.260 align:middle line:84%
Crystal," and just
hopscotch quickly

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.832 align:middle line:90%
through how you set it up.

00:05:42.832 --> 00:05:44.290 align:middle line:84%
We'll go to number
two, and then we

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.180 align:middle line:84%
spend the rest of the
time on the new book.

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.980 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.750 align:middle line:10%
So back to 2012
through 2015, which

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.700 align:middle line:10%
is what "Ruby Crystal" covers.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to say that as are
worth writing "Ruby Crystal"

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.630 align:middle line:84%
and developing the characters,
I had no idea what would happen

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.390 align:middle line:84%
to them in "Aquarian Age" and in
"Revelations From The Source."

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:04.690 align:middle line:84%
So in "Ruby Crystal,"
we get the real fabric

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.300 align:middle line:84%
of their private
lives, their family

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.530 align:middle line:90%
relationships, their homes.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.840 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of just real
rich context of their reality

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:13.640 align:middle line:90%
in "Ruby Crystal."

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I want to
get a ticket to Rome.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.600 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, why
is it located in Rome?

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, that was a
strategic decision.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.780 align:middle line:84%
But I really didn't have
much choice about that

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.790 align:middle line:84%
because of the way the
characters came through

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:29.270 align:middle line:90%
in the first place.

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.140 align:middle line:84%
All of the characters
appeared in my writing room

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:33.940 align:middle line:90%
in May of 2011.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And they gave me their names,
their professions, their ages,

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:38.810 align:middle line:90%
their family relationships.

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.780 align:middle line:84%
They gave me the whole
context of their lives.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.020 align:middle line:90%
And 80% of them were Italians.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:45.350 align:middle line:90%
So it had to be in Italy.

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:46.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:47.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Located in Italy.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, there's some
important deeper reason

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.850 align:middle line:90%
for that.

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:51.017 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Well, yeah there is.

00:06:51.017 --> 00:06:54.130 align:middle line:84%
And then also, Italy is the
midline for the planet, where

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.220 align:middle line:84%
the issues between
East and West meet up

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:01.750 align:middle line:84%
and the conflicts between dark
and light and all those things

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.490 align:middle line:90%
are accentuated in Italy.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And other writers have
also written about this.

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:07.858 align:middle line:84%
This is a fascination
with Italy.

00:07:07.858 --> 00:07:10.150 align:middle line:84%
People go there and they go
like, what's going on here?

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.170 align:middle line:84%
They have such a
deep experience.

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:16.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's the experience of
the midline especially in Rome.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And so it ended up
being located in Italy,

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:22.630 align:middle line:84%
and then what happened is
when I sat down to write it,

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:26.440 align:middle line:84%
the first one, "Ruby Crystal,"
I didn't even have a plot.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.700 align:middle line:84%
I just let the characters take
over, and it was such fun.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.950 align:middle line:84%
That was probably the
easiest book to write,

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:34.575 align:middle line:84%
because I just let
them do their thing.

00:07:34.575 --> 00:07:35.375 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:35.375 --> 00:07:37.030 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: And then
when I came-- when

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:40.480 align:middle line:84%
it came time to write "Aquarian
Age," which covers 2015

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:45.430 align:middle line:84%
to 2018, then I had to deal with
how the timeline was unfolding.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:48.100 align:middle line:84%
Because by the time
we get up to 2015,

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:52.120 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure that most
listeners and people tuning

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.660 align:middle line:84%
into the show, I think they'll
go back and recognize how

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.380 align:middle line:90%
much things started to change.

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:59.380 align:middle line:84%
You didn't know what was
going on at that point,

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.810 align:middle line:84%
but things were
definitely changing.

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And so "Aquarian Age" is
dealing with the shift out

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:08.350 align:middle line:84%
of the Age of Pisces and into
the Age of Aquarius, which

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:10.640 align:middle line:90%
is what's happening right now.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And so the "Aquarian
Age" is more

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:16.450 align:middle line:84%
about working with the timeline,
and working with history,

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:19.520 align:middle line:84%
and working with the
change that was going on.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And then when we get into
"Revelations From The Source,"

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:25.210 align:middle line:84%
we're getting into
the keys to where

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:29.080 align:middle line:84%
all of this energy, and
consciousness, and meaning,

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.760 align:middle line:84%
and change is
actually coming from.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.960 align:middle line:84%
And so "Source" I think is
the finest of the three.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:36.760 align:middle line:90%
Maybe because--

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I would agree.

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:43.390 align:middle line:84%
It's a very intense experience,
and you're such a sensitive--

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:45.880 align:middle line:84%
I actually was worried about
you while you were writing it,

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.650 align:middle line:84%
because you had to
really immerse yourself

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:50.108 align:middle line:84%
in all the feelings to express
this through the characters.

00:08:50.108 --> 00:08:50.908 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:08:50.908 --> 00:08:52.540 align:middle line:84%
The degree that I
have to go in deep

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:56.170 align:middle line:84%
was really intense including
working with crystals.

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:58.030 align:middle line:84%
This book has some
of the best teachings

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:02.150 align:middle line:84%
about working with crystals
that exist on the planet.

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:06.880 align:middle line:84%
And so I went into the real
source of the breakdown.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And in the whole
trilogy, the main context

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:15.700 align:middle line:84%
is looking at it regarding
world religions and especially

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:16.930 align:middle line:90%
Catholicism.

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:21.160 align:middle line:84%
Because the Age of Pisces is
the age of organized religion.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.310 align:middle line:84%
And so then also, while
we're dealing with religion,

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:26.050 align:middle line:84%
we're also dealing
with politics.

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:29.210 align:middle line:90%
Because they both go in tandem.

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:30.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting because
the characters are Italian

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:35.920 align:middle line:84%
and it's set across some
of my favorite cities

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.030 align:middle line:84%
in the world, Rome,
Florence, Siena.

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:39.240 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The characters
were very much

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:43.300 align:middle line:84%
focused on what was
happening in America.

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:46.810 align:middle line:84%
So still America was at the
center of it prior to COVID,

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:49.750 align:middle line:84%
and then this book goes
into COVID, all of it,

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:52.540 align:middle line:84%
the politics of it, the reality
on the ground of what happens

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:54.620 align:middle line:90%
with families, and so forth.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:56.650 align:middle line:90%
So why America?

00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:58.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Well, that
was a hard one,

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:01.670 align:middle line:84%
because I hate it when people
are what I call Amerocentric.

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:02.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:04.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: But because I have
a lot of friends in Europe,

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:07.360 align:middle line:84%
and because I was spending
a lot of time in Italy,

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.490 align:middle line:84%
I can assure you that
almost everybody has

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:11.110 align:middle line:90%
been focused on America.

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And Trump became like
an obsession like--

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:14.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.378 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: --people
in the media would

00:10:16.378 --> 00:10:18.550 align:middle line:84%
have loved to have
just gotten rid of him,

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:20.675 align:middle line:84%
but all they did was talk
about Trump all the time.

00:10:20.675 --> 00:10:21.475 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:21.475 --> 00:10:22.900 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: And so I
was really forced

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:26.890 align:middle line:84%
to have Trump and America play
a strong role in this book.

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:29.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it also
points to the devolution

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:33.490 align:middle line:84%
of American culture as a
result of the decisions

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:36.530 align:middle line:84%
we've made in mass and as a
result of COVID, our response

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:37.330 align:middle line:90%
to it.

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.700 align:middle line:84%
But that's a global
breakdown right there.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.400 align:middle line:84%
The COVID thing is more of a
global breakdown of culture.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:42.610 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:43.630 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:44.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:46.900 align:middle line:84%
So do you want to get into
the book, the "Revelations

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:48.820 align:middle line:84%
From Source," and
start setting it up?

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:49.210 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:50.080 align:middle line:90%
Here's how I did.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:50.880 align:middle line:90%
It.

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.170 align:middle line:84%
First of all, this centers
around this artistic genius

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:54.790 align:middle line:90%
named Armando.

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:59.590 align:middle line:84%
A handsome, very elite man,
who lives between dimensions.

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:02.440 align:middle line:84%
He has a very,
very dark side that

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:07.060 align:middle line:84%
is trying to transcend into the
light and into companionship

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:07.960 align:middle line:90%
with the feminine.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:10.300 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
Armando's journey

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:11.860 align:middle line:90%
first, because he's the one.

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:13.460 align:middle line:90%
His painting is the catalyst.

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:14.260 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.320 align:middle line:84%
So Armando showed up in
the first book, of course.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.840 align:middle line:84%
And in the first
book, he was very bad.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:24.190 align:middle line:84%
A sexual abuser of young women
all the way through his 20s

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:27.850 align:middle line:84%
and 30s and including a
beloved girlfriend, Claudia,

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:30.910 align:middle line:84%
who becomes a character all the
way through the whole trilogy.

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And my daughter at
that point, Liz Clow,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.590 align:middle line:84%
is the Illustrator
for this trilogy.

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:36.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She did
a beautiful job.

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:37.000 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: She did.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:37.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:38.550 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:41.380 align:middle line:84%
And so Liz, being a
real deep Scorpio, said,

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:44.770 align:middle line:84%
no matter what you do,
mom, make him really bad.

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:47.140 align:middle line:84%
Because Liz is
used to me being--

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:50.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm really a mom, and a
wife, and a very nice person.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:51.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You are.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:52.660 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: A sweet person.

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:55.840 align:middle line:84%
And I had to create this
really major bad character.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's why I
was worried about you.

00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:58.860 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:02.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's a good point,
Regina, because what did happen

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:07.643 align:middle line:84%
is this trilogy really ended up
confronting the source of evil.

00:12:07.643 --> 00:12:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's really interesting
in the third book, where

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:14.230 align:middle line:84%
it starts to really get into
where is this evil coming from?

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:16.120 align:middle line:90%
Why is brutality this way?

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.580 align:middle line:84%
Why, for example, in
the current moment,

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:21.250 align:middle line:84%
why are we being tortured the
way we are by public health?

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:22.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:24.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: This just simply
doesn't make any sense.

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And the only way
that we can really

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:29.070 align:middle line:84%
begin to understand
what's going on

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:32.550 align:middle line:84%
is to understand how evil
is functioning in the world.

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:36.750 align:middle line:84%
And this trilogy, by no
means, figures it out.

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:38.250 align:middle line:84%
But it goes deeply
into the issue.

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:39.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It illustrates.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: It really goes
deeply into the issue,

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.180 align:middle line:84%
and it's something that we
need to understand better.

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:44.640 align:middle line:84%
So they're in the
middle of that.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.500 align:middle line:90%
Back to dear Armando.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.960 align:middle line:84%
Armando, meanwhile,
is a tortured soul.

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:52.410 align:middle line:84%
Because he was abused as a young
child by a Catholic priest.

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:55.470 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, this is
the basic background thesis

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:59.790 align:middle line:84%
throughout the whole trilogy,
the issue of sexual abuse

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:02.940 align:middle line:84%
especially abuse of children
in the Catholic Church,

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:04.860 align:middle line:84%
because this is
the ultimate evil.

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:09.090 align:middle line:84%
What is there that's worse than
innocent children being abused?

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:10.330 align:middle line:90%
Nothing's worse.

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:15.760 align:middle line:84%
And so Armando gradually begins
to come in "Aquarian Age,"

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:16.830 align:middle line:90%
the second book.

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:20.730 align:middle line:84%
He finds the love of
his life and develops--

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:23.070 align:middle line:84%
and she's also a very
wounded being herself.

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:24.850 align:middle line:84%
So we have two people
getting together,

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:28.680 align:middle line:84%
which is typical, who have
their own wounding and conflicts

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.770 align:middle line:84%
to deal with, so that they
can understand each other.

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And Armando in
"Aquarian Age" goes

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:37.770 align:middle line:84%
to that level of a well-adjusted
husband and father.

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's really wonderful
to see that progression,

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:43.240 align:middle line:84%
because the trilogy also
has the parents involved.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:45.720 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: So with our
major characters,

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.220 align:middle line:90%
we have mom and dad.

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And so we get to watch the
transformation of a child,

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:54.840 align:middle line:84%
and we get to watch how the
parents are responding to that,

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:58.020 align:middle line:84%
which is like what
bigger deal do most of us

00:13:58.020 --> 00:13:59.915 align:middle line:90%
live with than that right there?

00:13:59.915 --> 00:14:00.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is true.

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:01.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: This is
the central issue.

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:04.027 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And these aren't
just ordinary characters,

00:14:04.027 --> 00:14:07.590 align:middle line:84%
because you can't afford to have
anyone ordinary in this book.

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:09.720 align:middle line:84%
They each have to
hold something that's

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:11.700 align:middle line:84%
unique and special by
way of wisdom, knowledge,

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:12.810 align:middle line:90%
or experience.

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:15.240 align:middle line:90%
And I loved his dad.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.350 align:middle line:84%
I thought he was a
wonderful man in the book.

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:20.160 align:middle line:84%
I really enjoyed Mr.
Pierleoni's character,

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.110 align:middle line:84%
but one of the
things we see here

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:24.150 align:middle line:84%
is you're bringing in
the ancient mysteries

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:27.960 align:middle line:84%
in the passing of the baton
in the most ancient mysteries

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.700 align:middle line:84%
through the male
lineage in this as well.

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:31.500 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yes.

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:32.410 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:33.210 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And people might
even criticize me

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:38.460 align:middle line:84%
for focusing on the male
lineage the way I did.

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.020 align:middle line:84%
But to tell you
the truth, that's

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:41.670 align:middle line:84%
the way it's worked
for a long time.

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:42.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It has.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.400 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: It has.

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:49.350 align:middle line:84%
But meanwhile, we have Claudia
Tagliati, who's a photographer.

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:51.720 align:middle line:84%
Actually, she's
fashion designer.

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:53.850 align:middle line:90%
And we have Claudia coming in.

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And she's a really, really
powerful feminine archetype.

00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:58.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:03.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: And then we have Sarah
Appel, the early Christian--

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:04.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Scholar.

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:04.925 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: --researcher.

00:15:04.925 --> 00:15:06.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, scholar and researcher.

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And so even though the male
lineage is rolling along

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:12.510 align:middle line:84%
as usual generation by
generation, and this book,

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:14.220 align:middle line:84%
in this case, is
covering thousands

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:17.400 align:middle line:84%
of years going way
back even to Atlantis

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:20.160 align:middle line:90%
through Alessandro de' Medici.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.410 align:middle line:84%
So it's going back
through the timelines,

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:25.255 align:middle line:84%
because that is how it passes
through the male lineage--

00:15:25.255 --> 00:15:26.055 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:26.055 --> 00:15:29.040 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: --in terms of
the data, but the spirit

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.450 align:middle line:90%
passes through the women.

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And so we see that
passage through the women.

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And also, let's notice that
the male lineage people

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:40.770 align:middle line:84%
in this novel are basically
taking the cues from the women.

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:42.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They are.

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:45.325 align:middle line:84%
So the women are
much more living in--

00:15:45.325 --> 00:15:47.700 align:middle line:84%
even though each might have
their issues such as Claudia,

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:49.920 align:middle line:84%
but they're still living
in a more balanced way

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.620 align:middle line:90%
than the men are at this point.

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:55.380 align:middle line:84%
Because the patriarchy itself
has gone out of balance,

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:58.920 align:middle line:84%
and they've been subject
to the churches themselves.

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:02.070 align:middle line:84%
But one thing you bring
in early on in the book,

00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:03.810 align:middle line:84%
and you and I talked
about this years ago

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:07.140 align:middle line:84%
and in fact, I think our last
interview up in your place,

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:12.030 align:middle line:84%
in your library, had
to do with the work,

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:14.670 align:middle line:90%
the secret tomb of Jesus.

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:18.420 align:middle line:84%
James Cameron turned this
into a film, a documentary.

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:22.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Simcha Jacobovici,
an incredible filmmaker.

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:24.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: An
incredible filmmaker.

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And he and Cameron worked as EP
and put a documentary together,

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:32.100 align:middle line:84%
basically,
documenting everything

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:33.520 align:middle line:90%
that was in the original book.

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:34.395 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: That's right.

00:16:34.395 --> 00:16:36.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, you focus
on this for a reason.

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And you bring it up a few
times throughout about what

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:46.170 align:middle line:84%
happens if humanity can
acknowledge that Jesus lived,

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:49.980 align:middle line:84%
they found his tomb, And
in his tomb was his wife,

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:52.890 align:middle line:84%
was his mother, were
his children, brothers,

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:53.700 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:55.410 align:middle line:84%
Why do you bring this
into this into the story?

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:56.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: And this has
basically been proven.

00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:57.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:57.470 align:middle line:90%
The evidence is incredible.

00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:58.002 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: And people
are just going

00:16:58.002 --> 00:16:59.640 align:middle line:84%
to have to do the
research on it.

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:00.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: May I just
say something now?

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:01.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Sure.

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:02.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can
find this on Amazon.

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:04.760 align:middle line:84%
You have to pay for it,
same amount as the book.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:06.270 align:middle line:90%
It's like $18 to rent.

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:09.109 align:middle line:84%
It's worth renting because
they did a wonderful forensics

00:17:09.109 --> 00:17:10.170 align:middle line:90%
job on this.

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:11.000 align:middle line:90%
So let's go for it.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:11.800 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: They did.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.630 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, as this
whole thing unfolded,

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:16.609 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know where
it was going myself.

00:17:16.609 --> 00:17:18.260 align:middle line:84%
I just want you to
know, the characters

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.420 align:middle line:84%
were really in charge
of where this is going.

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:23.746 align:middle line:84%
And Simon was just not going
to let go, Simon Appel.

00:17:23.746 --> 00:17:24.829 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Dog with a bone.

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:28.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Simon Appel, who is
a reporter for "The New York

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:30.620 align:middle line:84%
Times" as well as
various Italian papers,

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:32.590 align:middle line:90%
and he's Sarah Appe's husband.

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:34.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And she's the
early Christian scholar.

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:34.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:36.093 align:middle line:90%
So the two of them get together.

00:17:36.093 --> 00:17:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's fun, because he's
Jewish and she's Catholic.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And she eventually
leaves the church.

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And so just the dialogue going
on between the two of them--

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.630 align:middle line:84%
because we're also dealing
with the Age of Aries

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:51.500 align:middle line:84%
in this trilogy, which is the
period of time from about 0

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.600 align:middle line:90%
AD to 2000 BC.

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.210 align:middle line:10%
And that's the age
of organized warfare,

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:58.820 align:middle line:10%
and then we go into the
Age of Pisces, which

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:01.190 align:middle line:10%
became the age of wars for God.

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to deal
with all 4,000 years,

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:06.200 align:middle line:84%
because what we're
actually doing right now

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:11.730 align:middle line:84%
is we're transforming 4,000
years of human consciousness.

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:15.350 align:middle line:84%
So regarding the tomb of
Jesus, whether anybody likes it

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:18.200 align:middle line:84%
or not, it's been discovered,
it's been authenticated.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And the facts are there's
a Jesus family tomb,

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:24.780 align:middle line:84%
and Jesus was buried with
his family in his tomb.

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:28.340 align:middle line:84%
But meanwhile, he's
supposedly resurrected.

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:32.360 align:middle line:84%
And so the reason there is
such resistance to recognizing

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.640 align:middle line:84%
that this tomb is
authentic is because it

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:36.470 align:middle line:84%
goes against the
Christian doctrine

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:38.640 align:middle line:90%
of the resurrection of Jesus.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:39.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:41.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, when it was
discovered in Israel,

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:43.975 align:middle line:84%
both the Jews and the
Christians tried to squash this.

00:18:43.975 --> 00:18:44.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: That's right.

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:45.320 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's why no
one knows this book exists

00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:47.840 align:middle line:90%
or this film exists.

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:48.420 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: That's right.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:49.220 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And Sarah and Simon, to
the end of the trilogy,

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:54.890 align:middle line:84%
can't figure out why
the Jews are resisting

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:58.490 align:middle line:84%
the issue because we're talking
about a tourist site in Israel.

00:18:58.490 --> 00:18:59.985 align:middle line:84%
This should be
number one, right?

00:18:59.985 --> 00:19:00.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:03.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: And apparently,
according to my research

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:09.680 align:middle line:84%
in Source, it was the main
tourist site back at factoring

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.005 align:middle line:90%
like 1200 to 1300 BC--

00:19:11.005 --> 00:19:12.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Doing
Templar-- you say

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:14.110 align:middle line:84%
it is a pilgrimage
site for the Templar.

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:15.710 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: So information
is coming forth

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:19.160 align:middle line:84%
regarding the Templar as
guardians of the tomb.

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And as Christians,
you have to wonder

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:25.370 align:middle line:84%
why were these Christians going
all the way to the Holy Land

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:26.570 align:middle line:90%
during the Middle Ages?

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:28.910 align:middle line:84%
Just imagine taking
that journey.

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:31.190 align:middle line:84%
They were going to
visit the tomb of Jesus.

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And that in itself
is a revelation.

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:33.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And Mary Magdalene.

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:34.570 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And yes, the other issue is Mary
Magdalene being Jesus' wife.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.940 align:middle line:84%
So then what happened,
Regina, with this whole issue

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:45.510 align:middle line:84%
is a deeper level started to
come through the characters,

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:50.030 align:middle line:84%
especially through a character
called Father Giorgio Faccini,

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:54.380 align:middle line:84%
who's a Jesuit and who's a
keeper of the Vatican Library.

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:56.660 align:middle line:84%
And the deeper issue
that starts coming

00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:00.170 align:middle line:84%
through as we start to let go
of the resurrection and all

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:04.590 align:middle line:84%
that stuff, who was Jesus
and where did he come from?

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And so toward the latter
parts of "Source,"

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:10.220 align:middle line:84%
we start to get into the
issue of the possibility

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:13.700 align:middle line:84%
that all of those early
church controversies around,

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:14.670 align:middle line:90%
was Jesus God?

00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:15.470 align:middle line:90%
Was he man?

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:16.460 align:middle line:90%
Was he man, God?

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:17.810 align:middle line:90%
Who was he?

00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:21.090 align:middle line:84%
The reason there was such a big
argument going on in the third,

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:22.970 align:middle line:84%
fourth, and fifth
centuries is probably

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:25.760 align:middle line:84%
because they knew he
was an extraterrestrial.

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:28.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, this doesn't come out
explicitly in the book.

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:29.020 align:middle line:90%
This is where--

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:29.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You hint at it.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.512 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: This is where
you get to this point

00:20:31.512 --> 00:20:33.830 align:middle line:84%
where one character
thinks one thing,

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:36.360 align:middle line:84%
another character
is something else.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And if you put it
together in your brain,

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:39.890 align:middle line:90%
you start to get the point.

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:42.590 align:middle line:84%
And so if there's going to be
a sequel to this, if there's

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:46.410 align:middle line:84%
going to be a fourth
book, if it comes through,

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:49.525 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be probably
to resolve that issue.

00:20:49.525 --> 00:20:51.650 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what all
those early church councils

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:52.680 align:middle line:90%
were all about.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's why Sarah
is so fascinating.

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:55.970 align:middle line:90%
She's just dogging it.

00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:58.040 align:middle line:90%
Who was he?

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And OK, people watching this
are of all different religious

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:05.420 align:middle line:84%
backgrounds, and yet every
religion on the planet

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:08.960 align:middle line:84%
has been influenced in some
way by the arrival of Jesus.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:12.320 align:middle line:84%
There's something
mysterious about the impact

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:14.750 align:middle line:84%
of this individual,
whether you're a Christian,

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:18.470 align:middle line:84%
or a Jew, and especially
regarding people

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:22.970 align:middle line:84%
Muslim and Islamic culture,
is that the Quran actually

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:25.430 align:middle line:84%
saves some of the
early data about Jesus

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:27.260 align:middle line:84%
that's not in the
Christian scripture.

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:28.920 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
don't know this,

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.070 align:middle line:84%
but some of the really
authentic material

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:33.288 align:middle line:90%
is in Islamic scholarship.

00:21:33.288 --> 00:21:35.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because they
accepted him as a prophet.

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:39.932 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Well, so again,
there's something.

00:21:39.932 --> 00:21:42.860 align:middle line:84%
Even from friends of mine
who were like into Buddhism

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:44.990 align:middle line:84%
and different things,
will say, yeah, there

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:47.190 align:middle line:84%
is something about the
impact of this individual.

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:49.430 align:middle line:84%
He had some impact
on this planet.

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And I've come to the
conclusion myself

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:55.100 align:middle line:84%
that he's the key
to our relationship

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:56.270 align:middle line:90%
to other dimensions.

00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
we're going right now.

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:01.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you play this
out on many different levels

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:04.340 align:middle line:84%
in conversation but down
into the Catholic Church,

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:08.680 align:middle line:84%
into deep rituals, into hidden
artifacts, into black magic.

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:10.385 align:middle line:90%
It just keeps descending.

00:22:10.385 --> 00:22:11.185 align:middle line:90%
The story keeps--

00:22:11.185 --> 00:22:11.650 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: It just won't go away.

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:13.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It won't go away.

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things, when you look

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:20.965 align:middle line:84%
back on it, why did
the Catholic Church--

00:22:20.965 --> 00:22:23.920 align:middle line:90%


00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:29.440 align:middle line:84%
why did it have to have such a
dark root system to it really?

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:34.210 align:middle line:84%
Because as I've read through
the years and comments

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:36.130 align:middle line:84%
from people who have
been in the church

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:40.500 align:middle line:84%
that there are a lot of atheists
among the Cardinals and others.

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:42.250 align:middle line:84%
They don't believe
this stuff that they're

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:45.162 align:middle line:84%
propagating and foisting
upon the people at all.

00:22:45.162 --> 00:22:46.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: It's what I
call the fairy story.

00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:48.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The fairy story.

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.980 align:middle line:84%
They're projecting this
fairy story on the public

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:55.090 align:middle line:84%
while they're living in these
realms of extreme power,

00:22:55.090 --> 00:23:00.670 align:middle line:84%
politics, and corruption, and
including corrupting children

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:04.060 align:middle line:84%
from their youth and using their
innocence to feed themselves.

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And you have a character that's
quite lascivious in this book.

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:09.220 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:11.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He's just detestable.

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And then as you say, Faccini
falls somewhere in between.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.108 align:middle line:84%
And I end up having a lot
of compassion for him.

00:23:17.108 --> 00:23:19.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Faccini is another
one of the characters,

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:22.510 align:middle line:84%
like Armando, who in the
beginning of the book

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:26.020 align:middle line:84%
is a Vatican agent
basically who was

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:28.040 align:middle line:90%
dogging the other characters.

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:31.220 align:middle line:84%
But he ends up being really
transformed human being.

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:34.540 align:middle line:84%
And that was a key issue for
me to show that transformation.

00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:37.180 align:middle line:84%
But back to that
issue of the darkness,

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:39.700 align:middle line:84%
and you've just sparked
an insight in my mind

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:42.850 align:middle line:84%
that today that I
really appreciate,

00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:47.530 align:middle line:84%
which is the more you try
to cover up the truth,

00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:50.890 align:middle line:84%
the more dark and
evil you become.

00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:53.800 align:middle line:84%
I think the break up
of the Catholic Church

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:57.460 align:middle line:84%
and the exposure of child
abuse is a breakthrough.

00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're going to get
big breakthroughs regarding

00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:02.058 align:middle line:84%
what's being done
to human health.

00:24:02.058 --> 00:24:04.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think we are too,
but it's going to come from us.

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:05.720 align:middle line:84%
It's going to come
from the bottom up.

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:06.520 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yes.

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:09.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It will be a reaction
from the masses, we people.

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:10.390 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:13.120 align:middle line:84%
You get into modern times
in the Catholic Church,

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.520 align:middle line:84%
you get into Francis,
and it's interesting

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:17.710 align:middle line:84%
how you treat Pope
Francis in the book.

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:19.180 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:21.833 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And maybe tell
us a little bit about that,

00:24:21.833 --> 00:24:22.750 align:middle line:90%
what your thought was.

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:24.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Well, that for
me has been an adventure.

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:28.237 align:middle line:84%
Because I still can't figure out
what Francis is really doing,

00:24:28.237 --> 00:24:30.070 align:middle line:84%
and I think a lot of
people can't figure out

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:31.210 align:middle line:90%
what he's doing.

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:36.950 align:middle line:84%
Personally, I think he's having
a positive effect on things.

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:40.090 align:middle line:84%
So people are going to just
have to see what happens,

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:43.390 align:middle line:84%
because we see Pope Francis
when he's meditating,

00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:45.550 align:middle line:84%
we see him when
he's ill, we see him

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:47.940 align:middle line:84%
when he's having different
experiences in his life.

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:48.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:50.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: And, of course,
that's all fictional.

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:53.200 align:middle line:84%
Like Pope Francis and
the fact that he's

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:56.350 align:middle line:84%
the Pope is all in the book,
all the backgrounds correct.

00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:58.300 align:middle line:84%
But the experiences with
him are all fiction.

00:24:58.300 --> 00:24:59.800 align:middle line:90%
He's a fictional character.

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:02.050 align:middle line:84%
So people are just going to
have to see how they feel.

00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:03.675 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There have
been documentaries

00:25:03.675 --> 00:25:05.050 align:middle line:90%
about him, the people's Pope.

00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:08.080 align:middle line:84%
And like you say,
a lot of people

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:11.680 align:middle line:84%
feel that he is on some
larger level doing some good

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:17.960 align:middle line:84%
and progressing the Catholic
Church out of his own agendas.

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:20.210 align:middle line:84%
But then others have
been overlooked,

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:22.060 align:middle line:84%
and the whole notion
of priestly abuse

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:25.505 align:middle line:84%
and some of the true life events
that happened under his watch--

00:25:25.505 --> 00:25:26.380 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: That's right.

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:28.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --were
pretty heinous also.

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:31.660 align:middle line:84%
So you're again
having a time where--

00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:34.710 align:middle line:84%
and you get into this in
the book, gosh, forgive me.

00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:37.330 align:middle line:84%
I've read the book
twice, the name

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:41.590 align:middle line:84%
of the organization
that actually runs

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:43.420 align:middle line:90%
the popes and everyone else.

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:44.230 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: The entity.

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:45.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The entity.

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:46.600 align:middle line:90%
So here you have--

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:48.473 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't know
about The entity.

00:25:48.473 --> 00:25:50.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: The entity
is just like the CIA.

00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:50.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's like the CIA.

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:53.098 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: And again, we're
going back to this principle

00:25:53.098 --> 00:25:54.860 align:middle line:84%
that you're really
waking me up to,

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:57.400 align:middle line:84%
these are the organizations
that are based on the deepest

00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:58.880 align:middle line:90%
level of secrecy and lying.

00:25:58.880 --> 00:25:59.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:01.660 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: And then what
happens is they finally

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:05.980 align:middle line:84%
become co-opted by
the lies themselves.

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:09.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and the
players, surrounding players

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.800 align:middle line:84%
are going to essentially
have to do business

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:13.910 align:middle line:84%
with the entity on
one level or another.

00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And so it appears that
Francis made some unfortunate

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:20.710 align:middle line:84%
compromises that
did not serve some

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:24.660 align:middle line:84%
of the victims of sexual
abuse in other countries,

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:25.660 align:middle line:90%
and we won't go into it.

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:26.920 align:middle line:84%
They can read about
it in the book.

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:27.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:29.625 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: At the same time,
trying to implement something

00:26:29.625 --> 00:26:30.880 align:middle line:90%
that could be for the better.

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:34.300 align:middle line:84%
Because everyone's
answering to the entity.

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:36.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you've written
your other books,

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:39.070 align:middle line:84%
it seems that the people
who appear to be in power

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:42.470 align:middle line:84%
are also answering to some
entities of some kind.

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:46.370 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about this top
down authoritarian struggle

00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:49.540 align:middle line:90%
humanity is having in general.

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:52.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: And this is a tough one,
because where does it start?

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:54.010 align:middle line:84%
It's an issue of
pyramid, and there's

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:57.280 align:middle line:84%
somebody at the very top of
the pyramid who basically

00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:59.080 align:middle line:90%
is a really evil force.

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And then they start
sending orders down

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:03.520 align:middle line:84%
through the pyramid, down
through the managers,

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:06.920 align:middle line:84%
and down through the
people who act things out.

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:11.380 align:middle line:84%
And the question is what's going
on at that top of that pyramid?

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's another issue that
I think we're facing right now

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:17.668 align:middle line:84%
is the issue of extraterrestrial
influence on this planet.

00:27:17.668 --> 00:27:19.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I will tell
you one thing I interviewed

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:22.390 align:middle line:84%
a man named John
Warner IV, his father

00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:25.780 align:middle line:84%
was Senator John Warner, who
five terms Virginia, married

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:28.690 align:middle line:84%
to Elizabeth Taylor, took
his son to the Pentagon

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:29.860 align:middle line:90%
to do his homework.

00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:33.550 align:middle line:84%
He knew about the ET issue, the
power players, and such power

00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:35.500 align:middle line:84%
players that you
never see in America.

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And he said, when it came
down to it in the end,

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:39.540 align:middle line:84%
everybody there in
the Pentagon knew.

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:42.330 align:middle line:84%
If you ask them who's in
charge, one of the generals

00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:46.830 align:middle line:84%
said, it's the aliens,
my son, young man.

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:49.320 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought it
was interesting coming

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:52.050 align:middle line:84%
through him after reading
your work and others.

00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:55.200 align:middle line:84%
Is there any-- and then
may I say something else?

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:59.490 align:middle line:84%
The various people who channel,
who I interview many of them,

00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:03.960 align:middle line:84%
I have asked them on camera
and privately about those

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:06.300 align:middle line:90%
including my own guides.

00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:09.270 align:middle line:84%
They just shake their heads
and say, this is real.

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:12.180 align:middle line:84%
There's really nothing we can
say to you at this time that's

00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:13.320 align:middle line:90%
going to matter.

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:14.730 align:middle line:90%
And they all say it.

00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:17.310 align:middle line:84%
They won't talk about
whatever this is.

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:18.340 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:19.140 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Oh, boy.

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:21.040 align:middle line:84%
That's a hard
question, isn't it?

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:21.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why?

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:22.230 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:23.030 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:25.470 align:middle line:84%
I agree because it's
a question that I

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:30.210 align:middle line:84%
ask every day, in the sense,
that I am attempting to really

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:32.850 align:middle line:90%
figure this out.

00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:35.060 align:middle line:90%
So I can't answer.

00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:35.860 align:middle line:10%
I can't answer--

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:38.130 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: They grapple with
this and they ask the questions

00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:38.340 align:middle line:10%
in the book--

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:40.465 align:middle line:10%
>>CLOW: The only thing I
can say is one of my books

00:28:40.465 --> 00:28:43.650 align:middle line:10%
years ago was called "Signet
of Atlantis, War in Heaven

00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:48.600 align:middle line:10%
Bypass," where I was exploring
the idea that we live

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.460 align:middle line:10%
on the Earth, and we
have all this warfare,

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:51.660 align:middle line:10%
and all this conflict.

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And then in the outer realms
and other outer dimensions,

00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:57.270 align:middle line:90%
that there's a war going on.

00:28:57.270 --> 00:28:59.430 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
really do feel

00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:03.420 align:middle line:84%
there's a war going on right now
between positive and negative

00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:05.880 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrials.

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:09.720 align:middle line:84%
And I guess the best
I've been able to do

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:14.490 align:middle line:84%
is to show through a character
like Armando or Giorgio Faccini

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:18.940 align:middle line:84%
to show what it's like to
finally shake the evil off.

00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:19.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And you do a
beautiful job of that.

00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:25.020 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: And the evil is
always coming from abuse.

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:26.430 align:middle line:90%
It's always coming for abuse.

00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And as everybody knows
about me since I've

00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:31.530 align:middle line:84%
written about it in
therapeutic books,

00:29:31.530 --> 00:29:34.830 align:middle line:84%
I was abused as a very
small child from 18 months

00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:36.450 align:middle line:90%
to three years old.

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And I had to heal from that,
and I had to recover from that.

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And the way I recovered from
that, it's really interesting,

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:45.930 align:middle line:84%
was in the session
where the therapist

00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:49.110 align:middle line:84%
helped me realize that
my energy was part of it.

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:51.300 align:middle line:84%
That there was
something within me

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:54.930 align:middle line:84%
that needed to work itself
out, and that it isn't all.

00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:57.550 align:middle line:84%
You can't blame it
all on one person.

00:29:57.550 --> 00:30:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to defend
the abuse of a child ever,

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:03.480 align:middle line:84%
and that's very, very
clear in this book.

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:06.240 align:middle line:84%
But somehow, the child
who has been abused

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:09.480 align:middle line:84%
has to work through the way
in which energy affected them.

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:12.630 align:middle line:84%
Because basically, what happens
with child's sexual abuse

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:16.110 align:middle line:84%
in particular is a
person is co-opted often

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:17.950 align:middle line:84%
into a lot of really
evil behavior.

00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:18.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: And that
didn't happen to me.

00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:20.900 align:middle line:90%
That didn't.

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:23.190 align:middle line:84%
I was more like the
martyr type versus the--

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:25.140 align:middle line:90%
like an Armando.

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:28.920 align:middle line:84%
But being a martyr isn't
going to do you any good, and.

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:31.000 align:middle line:90%
Just to suffer for some reason.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And being an evil abuser
isn't going to do any good.

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:36.000 align:middle line:84%
So really at a very
deep level, this book

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.580 align:middle line:84%
is working with those
kinds of energies.

00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:40.890 align:middle line:84%
Because hopefully, I'm
triggering the reader

00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:43.950 align:middle line:84%
into resolving some of
the inner conflicts that

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:46.230 align:middle line:84%
have been driving them
and confusing them.

00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:47.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And when you were talking a
moment ago about this pyramid,

00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:52.440 align:middle line:84%
the pyramidal structure and
of course, David Icke I think

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:53.190 align:middle line:90%
popularized the pyramidal--

00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:54.090 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Yeah, David Icke
really did a great job on that.

00:30:54.090 --> 00:30:54.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
pyramidal structure.

00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:56.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Got to credit him, yeah.

00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:58.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So about a year,
a year and a half ago,

00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:00.730 align:middle line:90%
I thought, you know what?

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:03.120 align:middle line:90%
That's not applicable anymore.

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:06.210 align:middle line:84%
They got the pyramid wrong,
and I created a new pyramid.

00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:09.390 align:middle line:84%
I sent it to David, and I
heard that David used it

00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:11.550 align:middle line:84%
in his Trafalgar
Square presentation

00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:13.060 align:middle line:90%
by way of describing it.

00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:15.300 align:middle line:90%
And what it is, is it's flipped.

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:17.220 align:middle line:90%
It's an inverted pyramid.

00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:20.250 align:middle line:84%
The quote "masses"
are the power.

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:23.460 align:middle line:84%
We're the psychic power of
the planet not those few.

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And I put them at the bottom,
more kind of like bottom

00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:26.990 align:middle line:90%
feeders.

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:30.300 align:middle line:84%
The part that was at the top
in that previous pyramid.

00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think the power of
our awakening together,

00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:35.420 align:middle line:84%
our recognizing these
things in ourselves the way

00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:37.170 align:middle line:84%
you're illustrating
through the characters

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:40.410 align:middle line:84%
is the beginning of
the masses now being

00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:41.760 align:middle line:90%
at the top of the pyramid.

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And that stuff
that trickles down

00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:45.253 align:middle line:90%
will ultimately be vanquished.

00:31:45.253 --> 00:31:47.670 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: This is so interesting,
because I taught workshops

00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:50.830 align:middle line:84%
with that exact model
for a number of years.

00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:54.150 align:middle line:84%
And what it had to do
was working with students

00:31:54.150 --> 00:31:57.442 align:middle line:84%
to teach them how to
change the dynamic

00:31:57.442 --> 00:31:58.650 align:middle line:90%
at the bottom of the pyramid.

00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:00.300 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
like how they could

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:03.960 align:middle line:84%
re-envision the whole
reality that they existed in.

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:08.040 align:middle line:84%
And once somebody changes it
at the bottom of the pyramid,

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:09.840 align:middle line:90%
the whole pyramid gets busted.

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:10.845 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:32:10.845 --> 00:32:12.090 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work the same.

00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:12.890 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:12.890 --> 00:32:16.620 align:middle line:84%
So in this, you and I were
going back and forth recently,

00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:19.363 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to talk just a
little bit about Sarah,

00:32:19.363 --> 00:32:21.030 align:middle line:84%
a little more about
the character Sarah,

00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:24.540 align:middle line:84%
because she had been
with Armando previously.

00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:27.630 align:middle line:84%
The one who is the
early Christian scholar,

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:30.060 align:middle line:84%
beautiful young woman
from a Catholic family

00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:33.900 align:middle line:90%
that had its own abuse in it.

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:36.270 align:middle line:90%
And she got away from Armando.

00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:37.255 align:middle line:90%
She could not handle.

00:32:37.255 --> 00:32:38.630 align:middle line:90%
It was shattering.

00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:41.060 align:middle line:84%
He had to take a woman who
was a little more-- had

00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:42.470 align:middle line:84%
a little more
darkness in herself

00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:43.970 align:middle line:90%
to work it through together.

00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:46.370 align:middle line:84%
So why did Sarah
intrigue you so much out

00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:47.900 align:middle line:90%
of all these characters?

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:50.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: I think Sarah
is probably the one who

00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:51.848 align:middle line:90%
the most autobiographical.

00:32:51.848 --> 00:32:52.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It seems to me.

00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:53.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:57.380 align:middle line:90%


00:32:57.380 --> 00:32:59.495 align:middle line:84%
The way to interpret
that would be

00:32:59.495 --> 00:33:01.620 align:middle line:84%
in how she has chosen
to live her life.

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:07.130 align:middle line:84%
So when I was 42
years old, I graduated

00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:10.970 align:middle line:84%
from-- got a Master's in
Theology with Matthew Fox.

00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And I also had a husband
and four children,

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:15.800 align:middle line:90%
and a job as a publisher.

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And I really wanted to
go to graduate school,

00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:21.110 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to go to
graduate school in Patristics,

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:22.820 align:middle line:90%
which is early church studies.

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:25.550 align:middle line:84%
So what I did, since I
couldn't go to graduate school,

00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:28.140 align:middle line:84%
is I did graduate
school for 30 years.

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:31.160 align:middle line:84%
So Sarah is the one who's
really carrying my background

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:33.320 align:middle line:84%
knowledge in early
Church History.

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:35.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's fascinating
to me, Regina,

00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:40.520 align:middle line:84%
because the end
result of my PhD is

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:44.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm beginning to realize
that Jesus had to have

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:48.200 align:middle line:90%
come from another star system.

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:51.870 align:middle line:84%
So when you study patristics,
you study all those arguments.

00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:52.670 align:middle line:90%
Is he God?

00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:53.470 align:middle line:90%
Is he man?

00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:55.100 align:middle line:90%
All those stuff.

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:56.000 align:middle line:90%
What is he?

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And I've really come
to the conclusion

00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:02.750 align:middle line:84%
that Jesus did come from
another star system.

00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:06.270 align:middle line:84%
I think the person who has
the closest analysis of this

00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:10.990 align:middle line:84%
so far, the most correct one is
Len Kasten in his book on Serpo

00:34:10.990 --> 00:34:11.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: On Serpo.

00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:12.590 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:14.060 align:middle line:84%
So it's an issue
of Jesus actually

00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:17.300 align:middle line:84%
being a person who lived on
Serpo 2,000 years ago who

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:19.969 align:middle line:90%
came to the Earth.

00:34:19.969 --> 00:34:22.850 align:middle line:84%
And if people start to realize
this, and all they have to do

00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:26.090 align:middle line:84%
is start reading about Serpo
and they'll find out a lot.

00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:27.597 align:middle line:84%
But if people start
realizing this,

00:34:27.597 --> 00:34:29.389 align:middle line:84%
we're going to start
realizing that someone

00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:32.900 align:middle line:84%
came here from the
stars 2,000 years ago

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:34.670 align:middle line:90%
and became fully human.

00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:37.909 align:middle line:84%
He married, had
children, and there's

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:41.130 align:middle line:84%
a whole story behind the
actual life of Jesus.

00:34:41.130 --> 00:34:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And this is what the church
has been trying to cover up.

00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And so when I went
into patristics,

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:51.620 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to get into
those early controversies.

00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:52.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:55.030 align:middle line:84%
So you're sparking
something in me here.

00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:57.970 align:middle line:84%
It seems though one religion
that actually does wear this

00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:01.540 align:middle line:84%
a little bit on the sleeve
is the Mormon faith.

00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:02.470 align:middle line:90%
They talk about--

00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:03.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: That's true.

00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:03.910 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:05.827 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So can you
just share a little bit--

00:35:05.827 --> 00:35:08.230 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: It's a very
interesting point on your part,

00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:11.050 align:middle line:84%
because another thing I've
been into for many years

00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:12.640 align:middle line:84%
is the issue of what
was really going

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.770 align:middle line:84%
on in early America,
what about who

00:35:14.770 --> 00:35:16.850 align:middle line:84%
were the Native
Americans really.

00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:19.120 align:middle line:84%
And in my case,
I'm part Cherokee.

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:22.550 align:middle line:84%
And the Mormons, as a
religion, are like what

00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:24.860 align:middle line:90%
150 years old at this point.

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:26.920 align:middle line:84%
So it's a relatively
new religion

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:29.920 align:middle line:84%
that went deeply
into the issue of who

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:31.600 align:middle line:90%
was really here in America.

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:33.520 align:middle line:84%
Some of their research
on who was here

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:37.390 align:middle line:84%
at the time, some of their
DNA research is fantastic.

00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And so I think the
Mormons are probably

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:43.570 align:middle line:84%
closer to this question than,
you're absolutely right,

00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:44.890 align:middle line:90%
than any other religion.

00:35:44.890 --> 00:35:48.040 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately,
the Mormons are deeply

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:49.623 align:middle line:84%
absorbed in patriarchal
consciousness.

00:35:49.623 --> 00:35:50.665 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, absolutely.

00:35:50.665 --> 00:35:52.720 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: They're the most
patriarchal religion

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:55.510 align:middle line:90%
practically on the planet.

00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And the patriarchy
is a disaster,

00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:01.390 align:middle line:84%
because the patriarchy
is misogyny and based

00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:03.370 align:middle line:90%
on hatred and control of women.

00:36:03.370 --> 00:36:04.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:06.800 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: You and me, no way.

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:07.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No way.

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:09.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: We're not
doing that one.

00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:10.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:13.300 align:middle line:84%
Now let's go into something
else here and that is--

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:15.370 align:middle line:84%
you and I were writing
back and forth privately

00:36:15.370 --> 00:36:17.120 align:middle line:90%
recently about cycles of time.

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's like I'm asking
you, geez, Barbara

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:21.010 align:middle line:90%
what is going on out there?

00:36:21.010 --> 00:36:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And you're talking
about something

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:26.630 align:middle line:84%
you had been researching
lately, these 735-year cycles.

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:27.430 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:29.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So share a
little bit about that.

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:31.660 align:middle line:84%
This is getting into your
astrological background.

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:33.790 align:middle line:84%
But keeping the astrology
brief, because we only

00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:36.310 align:middle line:84%
have a short time
left, the impact

00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:38.980 align:middle line:84%
of these cycles when they
start when-- what happens

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:40.150 align:middle line:90%
when they start and end?

00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:41.920 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Well, what
happened in 2020

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:45.770 align:middle line:84%
was the beginning of
a new 735-year cycle.

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And so then what
we astrologers do

00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:50.050 align:middle line:84%
is we just go back
to the previous one,

00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:51.710 align:middle line:84%
and the previous one,
and previous one.

00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:53.150 align:middle line:90%
So I started doing that.

00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:57.100 align:middle line:84%
And the previous one
is 1285 AD, and that's

00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:59.170 align:middle line:84%
when modern banking
started, that's

00:36:59.170 --> 00:37:03.040 align:middle line:84%
when modern economics started,
that's when globalism started.

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:06.610 align:middle line:84%
And now, we've come
through that 735 years,

00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:08.900 align:middle line:84%
and it has been
cracked wide open.

00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And it looks like
the next stage is

00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:13.090 align:middle line:84%
going to be artificial
intelligence, but we'll see.

00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:15.640 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, from the point of
view of the "Aquarian Age,"

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:16.910 align:middle line:90%
it looks like that.

00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:17.830 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:19.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us how that
could be a good thing.

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:20.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Well, of course,
it could, especially--

00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:21.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:23.240 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
it from the positive.

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:25.120 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: It's just
that I hate it myself.

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:25.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:26.110 align:middle line:90%
I do too.

00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:27.850 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk
about how that could

00:37:27.850 --> 00:37:31.210 align:middle line:84%
be a good thing, because
it can if it's used wisely.

00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:35.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Well, but I don't know
enough about quantum physics,

00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:37.990 align:middle line:84%
et cetera to
really-- but I think

00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:40.660 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be a quantum-based
reality in some way, which

00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:43.270 align:middle line:84%
is automatically going
to be multidimensional.

00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:46.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes and I interviewed
a young fellow who's Canadian,

00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:50.000 align:middle line:84%
Deep Prasad, as
in D-E-E-P Prasad.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And he's one of
the young geniuses

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:54.420 align:middle line:84%
on the planet in
quantum computing,

00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:55.420 align:middle line:90%
and that was on my site.

00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:56.890 align:middle line:90%
We had a lovely conversation.

00:37:56.890 --> 00:38:00.100 align:middle line:84%
And Deep was saying once
quantum computing becomes

00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:02.740 align:middle line:84%
the dominant reality and
the Chinese are ahead on it

00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:06.520 align:middle line:84%
right now, then what happens is
there is no security anymore.

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Anything we talk about,
cybersecurity, all of this

00:38:09.130 --> 00:38:10.535 align:middle line:90%
is over.

00:38:10.535 --> 00:38:12.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: And that
would be a good thing.

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:12.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
would be a good thing.

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:15.400 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Because then you're
starting to end the secrets.

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:16.465 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
starting to end secrecy.

00:38:16.465 --> 00:38:18.090 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: And the
secrets are to create--

00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:20.543 align:middle line:84%
are what create a lot of
these control dynamics

00:38:20.543 --> 00:38:21.460 align:middle line:90%
that we're struggling.

00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:22.585 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He said, it ends.

00:38:22.585 --> 00:38:25.760 align:middle line:84%
You can't stop any information
flow from that point forward.

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:27.755 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Right.

00:38:27.755 --> 00:38:29.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's an
interesting thought

00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:32.350 align:middle line:90%
when we were developing AI.

00:38:32.350 --> 00:38:34.840 align:middle line:84%
And now, let's talk about
some of the other potentials

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:37.850 align:middle line:84%
where it can-- if
we choose correctly,

00:38:37.850 --> 00:38:40.870 align:middle line:84%
this can be a flourishing era,
if we blend it with the heart

00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:41.980 align:middle line:90%
and soul of humanity.

00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:43.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Well, then
this is based again

00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:48.790 align:middle line:84%
upon really dealing with the
meaning of evil and how evil

00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:50.530 align:middle line:90%
enters the world.

00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what this
whole trilogy is all about.

00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:56.620 align:middle line:84%
It's starting to really take a
very deep seated look at evil.

00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And the reason it's
so hard right now

00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:02.200 align:middle line:84%
is it's really such a
hard thing to look at.

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:04.810 align:middle line:84%
It's such a hard
thing to face up to,

00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:09.370 align:middle line:84%
and that's what
I've been writing

00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:11.600 align:middle line:90%
using my imagination for.

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:12.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:16.600 align:middle line:84%
So if we look at your
characters and their background,

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:18.760 align:middle line:84%
and we look at what's
mounting right now,

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:20.230 align:middle line:84%
and we look at--
there used to be

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:21.820 align:middle line:90%
a site called intelligence.org.

00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:22.825 align:middle line:90%
It was taken down.

00:39:22.825 --> 00:39:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And I started looking
into all the characters

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:28.000 align:middle line:84%
years ago, because the primary
ones out of MIT developing

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.560 align:middle line:90%
AI and such.

00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:31.730 align:middle line:84%
It was fascinating to look
into their backgrounds.

00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:36.670 align:middle line:84%
But what you're talking about
is a heavily atheistic agenda.

00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:38.080 align:middle line:90%
You're looking at dust to dust.

00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:40.420 align:middle line:84%
There is no spirit
that transcends life.

00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:44.560 align:middle line:84%
So thus, great amounts of fear
of annihilation, and then you

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:47.320 align:middle line:84%
can be manipulated very
easily from that level.

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:48.920 align:middle line:84%
Because everything
wants to exist.

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:51.310 align:middle line:90%
Life wants to exist.

00:39:51.310 --> 00:39:55.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Well, except that it
changes when people face up

00:39:55.210 --> 00:39:56.800 align:middle line:90%
to the issue of death.

00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:58.945 align:middle line:84%
And once you realize
you live many lifetimes,

00:39:58.945 --> 00:40:01.750 align:middle line:84%
and once you realize you
go into many realities,

00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:03.105 align:middle line:90%
then it doesn't matter anymore.

00:40:03.105 --> 00:40:03.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It doesn't.

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:08.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I say this
is an atheistic agenda.

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:10.420 align:middle line:84%
The perpetuation
of consciousness

00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:13.390 align:middle line:84%
through whatever kind of means
and body you can get hold of.

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:15.503 align:middle line:84%
Immortality, who
needs immortality?

00:40:15.503 --> 00:40:17.170 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be
in this body forever.

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:19.040 align:middle line:90%
I want to try a new one on.

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:20.980 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:23.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we know that
the expansion of awareness

00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:25.750 align:middle line:84%
of their very, very
early religions

00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:29.500 align:middle line:84%
in the world, which understood
we come back cyclically.

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:31.048 align:middle line:90%
We continue to grow and learn.

00:40:31.048 --> 00:40:33.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Well, see, that's
another issue in this trilogy

00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:37.430 align:middle line:84%
is what Christianity took
away at 2,000 years ago.

00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:39.140 align:middle line:90%
It's a very, very deep issue.

00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And I think the things
that Christianity took away

00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:47.110 align:middle line:84%
by creating the fairy story
about how Jesus supposedly

00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:51.400 align:middle line:84%
la,la,la, and then ascended
and all that kind of stuff,

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:53.680 align:middle line:84%
are dealt with very,
very deeply in this book.

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:55.490 align:middle line:84%
But as the fairy
story goes away,

00:40:55.490 --> 00:40:57.250 align:middle line:90%
then the truth comes back in.

00:40:57.250 --> 00:40:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
happening right now.

00:40:59.350 --> 00:41:03.690 align:middle line:84%
As hard as this is, a lot
of truth is being faced now.

00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:04.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:04.490 --> 00:41:05.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: It really is.

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know you didn't--
when you started this trilogy,

00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:09.040 align:middle line:84%
you didn't know where
it was going to end.

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:12.638 align:middle line:84%
Were you at all surprised by
where it ended at this point?

00:41:12.638 --> 00:41:13.930 align:middle line:90%
Like you said, you just hinted.

00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:15.860 align:middle line:90%
You may even do a fourth one.

00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:18.070 align:middle line:84%
But at this point,
were you surprised

00:41:18.070 --> 00:41:22.060 align:middle line:84%
where it ended on one hand
in terms of the trilogy?

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And then were you even
remotely surprised

00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:27.610 align:middle line:84%
where it ended coming
as an astrologer?

00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:29.590 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Well,
bringing up astrology.

00:41:29.590 --> 00:41:32.200 align:middle line:84%
Again, astrology just doesn't
exist in the first two books,

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:34.280 align:middle line:84%
except the discussion
about the Age of Aquarius.

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:35.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: And so people shouldn't
be afraid of astrology.

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:40.210 align:middle line:84%
At this point,
astrology is really

00:41:40.210 --> 00:41:43.370 align:middle line:84%
being used by a lot of
people to interpret reality.

00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:45.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Including those
in positions of power.

00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:46.210 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yes.

00:41:46.210 --> 00:41:49.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, OK, first of all,
it's assumed and described

00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:51.910 align:middle line:84%
in the book about how people
in power use astrology.

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:54.070 align:middle line:90%
And they used the 2020--

00:41:54.070 --> 00:41:56.440 align:middle line:84%
they started calling
it the Great Reset.

00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:59.170 align:middle line:84%
And the Great Reset is
an astrological term

00:41:59.170 --> 00:42:01.900 align:middle line:90%
for this 735-year cycle.

00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:04.780 align:middle line:84%
I was amazed when I
saw Davos coming up

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:08.200 align:middle line:84%
with the idea of
The Great Reset.

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:10.300 align:middle line:84%
It's not it discussed a
lot, because people have

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:11.920 align:middle line:90%
a hard time with astrology.

00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:14.290 align:middle line:84%
But it's discussed in
a way that makes sense,

00:42:14.290 --> 00:42:17.315 align:middle line:84%
because these large historical
cycles really do affect us.

00:42:17.315 --> 00:42:18.190 align:middle line:90%
So we really are in--

00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:19.815 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the
characters went really

00:42:19.815 --> 00:42:20.980 align:middle line:90%
according to the astrology.

00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:21.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:24.490 align:middle line:84%
We're really at this
key turning point.

00:42:24.490 --> 00:42:26.680 align:middle line:84%
People are really going
to see a big change

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:29.750 align:middle line:90%
in Christmas of 2021.

00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And the novel only goes
through part of 2021,

00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:34.240 align:middle line:90%
because it had to get published.

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:36.520 align:middle line:84%
But there's going to
be a real awareness

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:40.873 align:middle line:84%
of a great shift at the end
of 2021 and going into 2022.

00:42:40.873 --> 00:42:42.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And really,
the way you described it

00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:45.002 align:middle line:84%
to me, privately and
off camera, is this

00:42:45.002 --> 00:42:46.210 align:middle line:90%
we're going to be challenged.

00:42:46.210 --> 00:42:48.040 align:middle line:84%
Women will be
particularly challenged.

00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:50.388 align:middle line:84%
Some of it could be around
the choice of what they're

00:42:50.388 --> 00:42:52.930 align:middle line:84%
going to do with their children,
around the issue of vaccines

00:42:52.930 --> 00:42:55.240 align:middle line:84%
could force these
kinds of issues

00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:56.770 align:middle line:90%
forward to the forefront.

00:42:56.770 --> 00:42:59.500 align:middle line:84%
But that it's really
going to come down

00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:02.570 align:middle line:84%
to human sovereignty and choice
at that point on a large scale.

00:43:02.570 --> 00:43:03.370 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:43:03.370 --> 00:43:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And let's go back to that
issue of ending the pyramid.

00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:07.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:07.330 --> 00:43:09.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: What happened
because of COVID

00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:12.010 align:middle line:84%
was that a whole
lot of people got

00:43:12.010 --> 00:43:14.870 align:middle line:84%
to spend a whole lot of
time for the last year

00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:18.760 align:middle line:84%
to a year and a half
exploring new realities.

00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:21.790 align:middle line:84%
They got out of jobs
that were a treadmill,

00:43:21.790 --> 00:43:24.220 align:middle line:84%
and they got into a
whole new reality.

00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of women are
not going to be going back

00:43:27.010 --> 00:43:29.162 align:middle line:84%
to work anymore who
are raising children,

00:43:29.162 --> 00:43:31.120 align:middle line:84%
because they're going to
go back to realizing--

00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:32.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
quitting in droves.

00:43:32.350 --> 00:43:34.017 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Yes, they're
quitting in droves.

00:43:34.017 --> 00:43:36.160 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
starting to realize that

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:38.440 align:middle line:84%
the most precious time
of your whole life

00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:41.260 align:middle line:84%
is your opportunity to
be with a small child.

00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And to be coerced
and manipulated

00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:47.740 align:middle line:84%
into leaving your
baby behind, there's

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:48.970 align:middle line:90%
a lot of issues with that.

00:43:48.970 --> 00:43:49.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There are.

00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And the fact is women
are quite capable.

00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:52.683 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to put
a suit and tie on

00:43:52.683 --> 00:43:54.730 align:middle line:84%
to be able to do a job
and care for children,

00:43:54.730 --> 00:43:57.022 align:middle line:84%
if we can do it in our own
environment and our own pace

00:43:57.022 --> 00:43:57.822 align:middle line:90%
and way.

00:43:57.822 --> 00:43:58.630 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:43:58.630 --> 00:43:59.590 align:middle line:90%
I've had four children.

00:43:59.590 --> 00:44:02.750 align:middle line:84%
I've never had any problem
not doing what I needed to do.

00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:03.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:04.930 align:middle line:84%
It's just doing it
in the way that it's

00:44:04.930 --> 00:44:06.490 align:middle line:84%
been laid out in a corporate
and institutional manner.

00:44:06.490 --> 00:44:07.900 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: So I didn't want
to leave my children.

00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:09.650 align:middle line:84%
I didn't leave them
until they were three,

00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:10.850 align:middle line:90%
when they were in preschool.

00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:11.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:12.272 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: I didn't want to.

00:44:12.272 --> 00:44:13.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:44:13.330 --> 00:44:16.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, very quickly,
we're out of time.

00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:18.550 align:middle line:84%
What is the one takeaway
you'd like people

00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:20.530 align:middle line:90%
to have from that trilogy?

00:44:20.530 --> 00:44:23.110 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: I would like
people to really free up

00:44:23.110 --> 00:44:24.580 align:middle line:90%
their imaginations.

00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:29.290 align:middle line:84%
These characters are-- they're
very complex psychologically,

00:44:29.290 --> 00:44:33.430 align:middle line:84%
psychically, intellectually
in terms of history,

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:34.900 align:middle line:90%
in terms of their families.

00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:37.120 align:middle line:90%
And I would like people to--

00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:39.340 align:middle line:90%
these characters are very--

00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:41.480 align:middle line:84%
I didn't choose them,
because they came to me.

00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:43.530 align:middle line:90%
They wanted to speak through me.

00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:49.710 align:middle line:84%
And they are really wonderful,
really complex, beautiful

00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:50.700 align:middle line:90%
human beings.

00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And we've got to start using
people like that as models.

00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:55.053 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:44:55.053 --> 00:44:56.220 align:middle line:90%
In fact, I thought, oh, man.

00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:59.220 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to be in that
beautiful dining room and part

00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:00.993 align:middle line:90%
of that conversation with them.

00:45:00.993 --> 00:45:02.160 align:middle line:90%
But fortunately, I have you.

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:03.570 align:middle line:90%
We have these conversations.

00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:04.733 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Right.

00:45:04.733 --> 00:45:06.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Barbara, thank
you so much for persevering

00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:09.310 align:middle line:84%
through these three books
over the last nine, 10 years.

00:45:09.310 --> 00:45:10.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
your support, Regina.

00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:12.990 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You're most welcome.

00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:14.400 align:middle line:10%
My pleasure truly.

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:17.490 align:middle line:84%
Again, the title of the latest
of the Revelations trilogy

00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:19.440 align:middle line:84%
is "Revelations
From The Source."

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:22.350 align:middle line:84%
