>>REGINA MEREDITH: The New
Age movement is no longer new,

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.770 align:middle line:10%
as witnessed by the fact that
a second generation of people

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.430 align:middle line:10%
raised by those who comprise the
New Age movement are now of age

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.030 align:middle line:10%
and writing their own books.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.549 align:middle line:84%
One such young woman
is Elizabeth April,

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:35.480 align:middle line:84%
raised from birth with the
kind of education and knowledge

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.340 align:middle line:84%
that the rest of us only
grew into in adulthood.

She's here today to speak
about her take on universal law

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.323 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:44.323 --> 00:00:45.240 align:middle line:90%
It's good to meet you.

>>ELIZABETH APRIL:
Thank you so much.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.640 align:middle line:90%
Likewise.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.500 align:middle line:90%
Happy to be here.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So as when I
was preparing the script,

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.410 align:middle line:84%
you and I have a lot of very
similar takes on where we're

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.310 align:middle line:84%
going as a people, what we
need to do to raise ourselves

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.040 align:middle line:84%
up and overcome some
deliberate obstacles that

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.250 align:middle line:90%
have been placed in our way.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.868 align:middle line:84%
I would call them
deliberate, right?

00:01:03.868 --> 00:01:04.910 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yes, absolutely.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so I
thought we'd start

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.040 align:middle line:84%
because you are one of
those fortunate people who

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.680 align:middle line:84%
were born into already
advanced knowledge,

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.040 align:middle line:84%
just as your little boy has
been born into even more

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.330 align:middle line:90%
advanced knowledge.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.240 align:middle line:90%
So we're kicking it up fast.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.470 align:middle line:84%
So tell us about you and
your childhood a little bit,

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.900 align:middle line:84%
what you're born into and
what you started recognizing

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.115 align:middle line:90%
at a very early age.

00:01:26.115 --> 00:01:29.010 align:middle line:10%
>>APRIL: Yeah, so
my parents tell me

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.500 align:middle line:10%
that around the
age of two, I was

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.770 align:middle line:10%
seeing things and communicating
with things that they weren't

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.810 align:middle line:10%
able to see or perceive.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.190 align:middle line:10%
And there was a difference.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.500 align:middle line:10%
I had a brother who
was a year older,

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.450 align:middle line:10%
so he wasn't necessarily having
the same sort of interactions.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And so I was able to see spirits
and ghosts and chakras and auras

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.290 align:middle line:84%
and feel energies and all of
that stuff at a young age.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.560 align:middle line:84%
But my framework
was Catholicism.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.050 align:middle line:84%
So I thought at a very young
age that I was talking to God.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And for a very
long time, I wanted

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.760 align:middle line:84%
to be a nun because,
of course, I

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.605 align:middle line:84%
wanted to devote myself to
being the communicator of God

00:02:10.605 --> 00:02:12.630 align:middle line:90%
and spreading his messages.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that
freaked my mom out

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.440 align:middle line:90%
because she wasn't Catholic.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.710 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't want me
to throw my life away.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.280 align:middle line:90%
But that was my framework.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.630 align:middle line:90%
That was my context.

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, it was really difficult to
make friends when I was younger.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.410 align:middle line:84%
I was always the outcast
or the weird kid.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.210 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.335 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And the observer.

00:02:30.335 --> 00:02:33.030 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: I was
definitely the observer.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for example, at
around the age of six,

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.840 align:middle line:84%
I went over to my
friend's house.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.290 align:middle line:84%
And I was like it's so nice
that your grandfather is

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.410 align:middle line:90%
visiting you.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.910 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, her grandfather
passed away four years earlier.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.940 align:middle line:84%
And he was just
around the house.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.440 align:middle line:90%
And so that was who I was.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't realize
that no one else

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.162 align:middle line:84%
could see what I was seeing
until I really got into school.

00:02:55.162 --> 00:02:57.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And did that
become like a little bit

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.540 align:middle line:90%
of a slap or what?

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.490 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: I think I went within.

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.190 align:middle line:84%
I think I really
reclused out a little bit

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.280 align:middle line:84%
because I all of a sudden
felt different when

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.530 align:middle line:90%
I felt really normal before.

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.645 align:middle line:84%
And so at 10, I shut all
of those abilities down.

00:03:14.645 --> 00:03:16.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But let me
ask you a question.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.990 align:middle line:84%
Were your parents familiar
enough and comfortable enough

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.250 align:middle line:90%
that you could have--

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.620 align:middle line:84%
they would have been happy to
assist you in staying open?

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.500 align:middle line:84%
Or did you just have
enough experience

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.580 align:middle line:84%
to know, I need to
stop this for a while?

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.420 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Yeah, so my mom
was, I think, overwhelmed.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.880 align:middle line:90%
She didn't know how to navigate.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.740 align:middle line:84%
She was freaked out, I think,
by my abilities, especially

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.840 align:middle line:84%
when I saw ghosts
around the house.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.470 align:middle line:84%
My dad was more, once again,
from that Catholic perspective.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.410 align:middle line:84%
He thought I really had a gift
but a gift to talk to God.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.670 align:middle line:90%
So he would interview me.

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.058 align:middle line:84%
He'd be like, OK, well,
what's God telling you today?

00:03:51.058 --> 00:03:51.975 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:03:51.975 --> 00:03:52.990 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yeah.

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.985 align:middle line:90%
So he helped--

00:03:53.985 --> 00:03:55.443 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He
validated you, really.

00:03:55.443 --> 00:03:58.000 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: He absolutely
did, yes, which was great.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.065 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But in school?

00:04:00.065 --> 00:04:02.560 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: In school,
no, not so much.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.710 align:middle line:84%
I really kept those
things hidden,

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.350 align:middle line:84%
especially when I
discovered that it

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.260 align:middle line:90%
wasn't normal to be that way.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.500 align:middle line:84%
But around the age
of 14, after a couple

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.100 align:middle line:84%
of years of shutting that down
and being normal and having

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.610 align:middle line:84%
friends, I got into a really
deep state of depression,

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:24.000 align:middle line:84%
a lot of depression,
anxiety, really feelings

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.330 align:middle line:90%
of not wanting to be here.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.830 align:middle line:90%
It was my dad who--

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.260 align:middle line:84%
interesting
combination, engineer,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.140 align:middle line:84%
Catholic, but also did some
courses on past life regression.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.940 align:middle line:90%
So at 16--

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.125 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow, great.

00:04:37.125 --> 00:04:38.280 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: I know.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And so he said, would you be
interested in experiencing

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.110 align:middle line:90%
a past life regression?

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.133 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, I was
willing to try anything.

00:04:47.133 --> 00:04:48.050 align:middle line:90%
So I said, absolutely.

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, for
a Catholic, no less.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.160 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.280 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: For a
Catholic, no less.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.080 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.300 align:middle line:84%
And so in about an
hour and a half,

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.910 align:middle line:84%
we went into around four or
five different lifetimes.

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And in each of
these lifetimes, I

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.730 align:middle line:84%
was typically either
a shaman or a healer,

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.640 align:middle line:84%
someone who was able to
gain access to information

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.910 align:middle line:90%
and then relay it.

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And I realized at 16 that, A,
time is an illusion, and B,

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.530 align:middle line:90%
reincarnation is real.

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And it just blew the
lid off of my reality

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.880 align:middle line:84%
so much that I thought I could
maybe take this to other people.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.830 align:middle line:84%
So I ended up writing down the
notes from my dad's past life

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:26.880 align:middle line:90%
regression book.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And two years later,
at 18, I started

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.000 align:middle line:84%
giving past life regressions
to anyone who was open to it.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's fun.

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.610 align:middle line:84%
I had a little
hypnotherapy clinic.

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's mostly
what I did, too.

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:38.223 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Incredible.

00:05:38.223 --> 00:05:39.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I loved it.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:40.990 align:middle line:90%
You watch people wake up.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.790 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yes.

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And as you know, being in
that role as the observer.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.900 align:middle line:84%
If you think about giving one
hundred people a past life

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.320 align:middle line:84%
regression, experiencing
potentially five lifetimes each,

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:57.840 align:middle line:84%
that's 500 lifetimes that we
get to observe and learn from.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.800 align:middle line:90%
And so it was really incredible.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's when all of
my gifts and abilities

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.030 align:middle line:84%
started coming
back online at 18.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.720 align:middle line:84%
So remote viewing
and deep states

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.410 align:middle line:84%
of trance meditation,
mediumship, channeling.

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:14.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you ask me if
aliens existed at that time,

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.040 align:middle line:84%
I would say, for sure
there's got to be something

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.610 align:middle line:90%
else out there in the universe.

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.570 align:middle line:84%
But there's no way
they would be here.

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.870 align:middle line:84%
Why would they bother with
little old us, you know?

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:23.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:26.080 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: And around
that time, I ended up

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.960 align:middle line:84%
getting abducted by aliens,
by interdimensionals.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.560 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very
physical abduction.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.360 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it was
another huge awakening.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.730 align:middle line:84%
Once again, there's
so much more out there

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:41.690 align:middle line:90%
that we're not fully aware of.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:42.910 align:middle line:90%
So who are they?

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:44.050 align:middle line:90%
And why are they here?

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And why are they so
interested in us?

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And so that was more
than a decade ago.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And since then, I've been
applying my channeling

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.080 align:middle line:84%
and remote viewing abilities
with interdimensionals

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.660 align:middle line:84%
and the ascension to
really better understand

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:03.550 align:middle line:84%
what's going on planet Earth and
what we can learn at this time

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.290 align:middle line:84%
so that we can move forward
with ease and grace.

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:09.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So most of your
guidance, would you say then,

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:14.350 align:middle line:84%
is coming from other dimensional
beings or ETs directly?

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:17.470 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Yeah, I get guidance
from a multitude of places.

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.170 align:middle line:84%
So I'll talk to
interdimensionals who work

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:21.760 align:middle line:90%
with the Galactic Federation.

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.880 align:middle line:90%
I'll talk to my higher self.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.520 align:middle line:84%
I'll just tune in to the
collective of humanity,

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.560 align:middle line:84%
see where they're
at energetically.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.560 align:middle line:84%
I'll even talk to, say, Mother
Gaia, as a consciousness,

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.360 align:middle line:84%
see where she's at with
this whole ascension.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.350 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:38.020 align:middle line:84%
And I'll also talk
to source directly,

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.520 align:middle line:84%
too, to gain access
to other information.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I've interviewed
a woman named Dr. Linda

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.700 align:middle line:90%
Backman a couple of times now.

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And one thing she does,
she is a psychologist who

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:54.490 align:middle line:90%
takes people into regression.

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:57.090 align:middle line:84%
But what she started
noticing years ago

00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:59.100 align:middle line:84%
is that so many
people were regressed

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.870 align:middle line:90%
to a place that wasn't Earth.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:01.830 align:middle line:90%
And she said now--

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:03.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, now her
business is flooded

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:06.690 align:middle line:84%
with people who are--
she calls them IPs,

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:11.370 align:middle line:84%
interplanetary beings, that
many, many people incarnating

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:13.720 align:middle line:90%
now are of other sources.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.720 align:middle line:84%
And would you say that
about yourself and that's

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.875 align:middle line:84%
why you were contacted
at such an early age?

00:08:18.875 --> 00:08:23.160 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: I definitely believe
I'm not from this planet.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's not everybody.

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:26.770 align:middle line:84%
But it's a decent
percentage of people.

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:27.603 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yes, it is.

00:08:27.603 --> 00:08:30.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I would dare
say that of the people

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:33.750 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed, for example,
people like yourselves,

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:36.909 align:middle line:90%
most of them are here to help.

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And that is what the
directive is with the IPs,

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:43.990 align:middle line:84%
is to come at a very
intense time of change

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:47.120 align:middle line:84%
and help usher humanity
through those changes.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.390 align:middle line:90%
So we've identified you.

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:50.557 align:middle line:90%
We know who you are now.

00:08:50.557 --> 00:08:51.890 align:middle line:90%
We don't know where you're from.

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:52.973 align:middle line:90%
Do you know where you're--

00:08:52.973 --> 00:08:54.205 align:middle line:90%
where maybe your last--

00:08:54.205 --> 00:08:55.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't even like to
say where you're from,

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.940 align:middle line:84%
where your last stop was,
because some of us go all over.

00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:58.840 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Absolutely.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.970 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I believe that
a lot of the starseeds

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:05.140 align:middle line:84%
or galactic volunteers are
super multidimensional,

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:06.530 align:middle line:90%
so they come from many places.

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:10.330 align:middle line:84%
But for me, I'm very
connected to the Greys.

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:13.600 align:middle line:90%
So that was my past self.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.580 align:middle line:84%
I was a Grey when I chose
to come here as a human.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:20.200 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm also very
connected to my future self

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.208 align:middle line:90%
who is a mantis being.

00:09:21.208 --> 00:09:22.125 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:09:22.125 --> 00:09:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: But the majority of
my contact and connections

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:26.340 align:middle line:90%
are all with Pleiadians.

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.940 align:middle line:84%
It seems like a lot of
people I know and interview

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.770 align:middle line:84%
and are friends of
mine, myself included,

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:36.385 align:middle line:84%
have all had some history
with the Pleiades.

00:09:36.385 --> 00:09:39.730 align:middle line:84%
That's their directive now,
is to help us figure out

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:41.930 align:middle line:84%
the last piece is to
make that next step.

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:44.980 align:middle line:90%
So from the Grey, why--

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:48.340 align:middle line:84%
when you went back,
what was your soul's

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:51.970 align:middle line:84%
charter from the status
of Grey, coming here

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:52.905 align:middle line:90%
to do what you do now?

00:09:52.905 --> 00:09:55.810 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Yeah, so I was a
Grey ambassador for my species

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:57.170 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:09:57.170 --> 00:10:01.900 align:middle line:84%
And I was actually one of the
original individuals who started

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:03.920 align:middle line:90%
the hybrid movement back then.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:08.050 align:middle line:84%
So the Galactic Federation
contacted me and essentially

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:10.420 align:middle line:84%
my civilization to
say, we would really

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:14.000 align:middle line:84%
love to do some technology
transfer with you, exchange.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.337 align:middle line:90%
We'll give you information.

00:10:15.337 --> 00:10:17.170 align:middle line:84%
If you want to join the
Galactic Federation,

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:21.350 align:middle line:84%
we could really use your
understanding of hybridization.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:23.440 align:middle line:84%
And so we worked with
the Galactic Federation

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.360 align:middle line:84%
back then to help splice
DNA for human beings.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When you say back
then, what are we talking about?

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.040 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: We're talking--

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.335 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Toward the beginning?

00:10:32.335 --> 00:10:35.650 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: I mean, even before
the beginning of planet Earth.

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:38.590 align:middle line:84%
So we were working with
them on the hybrid project,

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:40.500 align:middle line:90%
which is the human beings.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:44.170 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe that
this is a prophecy planet.

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:46.840 align:middle line:84%
This has been prophesied
for quite some time

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:50.860 align:middle line:84%
to have us as human
beings here because it's

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:53.685 align:middle line:84%
quite a special dynamic that
we've got going on here.

00:10:53.685 --> 00:10:57.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah, nothing
normal about humans.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what's so
wonderful about humans

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:03.380 align:middle line:84%
is the-- well, obviously,
though, it sounds like a cliche,

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:05.830 align:middle line:84%
it's not-- the notion
that we have choice

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:07.970 align:middle line:84%
because choice doesn't
exist to this extent

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:12.910 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of other places,
paired with incredible diversity

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:15.370 align:middle line:90%
of every kind.

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:16.980 align:middle line:84%
It's like throw
them in the sandbox

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:18.105 align:middle line:90%
and let's see what happens.

00:11:18.105 --> 00:11:18.910 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Exactly.

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:20.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
we're looking around.

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:22.660 align:middle line:84%
We can see what's
happened because this is

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:28.460 align:middle line:90%
our collective creation, right?

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:29.260 align:middle line:90%
Do you have like--

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.870 align:middle line:84%
OK, so just to get
down to it, you

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:33.310 align:middle line:90%
tap into all different sources.

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And one of your primary areas of
interest at this time, and some

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:40.470 align:middle line:84%
might even say in
their view of it,

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:44.027 align:middle line:84%
concern is the progression
of planet Earth.

00:11:44.027 --> 00:11:46.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we all know we're
going to a better place.

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:49.570 align:middle line:84%
But getting there is of
interest to many people.

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:51.515 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
this phase we're in?

00:11:51.515 --> 00:11:52.710 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Absolutely.

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:57.360 align:middle line:84%
So I'm a big believer in
the interdimensional realm.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:01.000 align:middle line:84%
We're not just existing in
a linear state of being.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.180 align:middle line:84%
We're existing in a
quantum state of being.

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And essentially what that
means is even though we're both

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.840 align:middle line:84%
sitting in this
beautiful room, there

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:13.590 align:middle line:84%
are many different frequencies,
vibrations, dimensional levels

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:16.170 align:middle line:84%
and layers that are happening
right here, right now.

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And what's really
interesting is the Earth

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:20.670 align:middle line:84%
is shifting from one
dimensional level

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:22.450 align:middle line:90%
to another dimensional level.

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And we get to do this
at an individual level.

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually, when
enough individuals do this,

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:30.940 align:middle line:90%
we can shift collectively.

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what's
going on here.

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of the
solar flares that we're

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:39.040 align:middle line:84%
getting hit with are
helping with this ascension.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.670 align:middle line:84%
Things have got to get worse
before they get better.

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:46.030 align:middle line:84%
So we've got to purge out the
old dense vibrations before we

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:47.600 align:middle line:90%
get into the lighter ones.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And I always say that the number
one thing we all need in order

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:55.720 align:middle line:84%
to shift is, A, the
willingness to change,

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:59.740 align:middle line:84%
and B, gratitude and
appreciation because that truly

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:02.290 align:middle line:84%
is that unconditional
love frequency that

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:03.675 align:middle line:90%
will raise our vibration.

00:13:03.675 --> 00:13:06.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a
very high frequency.

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:08.050 align:middle line:90%
People talk about love a lot.

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:10.213 align:middle line:90%
But love is a loaded word.

00:13:10.213 --> 00:13:12.130 align:middle line:84%
It means different things
to different people.

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:14.170 align:middle line:84%
Gratitude means
one thing to all.

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:16.390 align:middle line:84%
If you can actually
connect and feel it,

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:18.590 align:middle line:84%
you're in a much
higher state of being.

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:20.960 align:middle line:84%
And so I agree with
you 100% on that.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:24.490 align:middle line:84%
So just if we made
that one shift

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:27.610 align:middle line:84%
so that we were
collectively in that field,

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:29.740 align:middle line:84%
that higher frequency
range, that's

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:32.860 align:middle line:84%
when that mass leap
can take place.

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:38.730 align:middle line:84%
So I just wanted to also bring
up something around that.

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:42.610 align:middle line:84%
Probably, it's been quite a few,
maybe a few decades ago now.

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:45.000 align:middle line:84%
I was talking to my
guides and asking them

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.010 align:middle line:84%
questions about
what was going on

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:50.670 align:middle line:84%
because there's such a diversity
in consciousness on Earth.

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's because I'd heard them
say something in a regression

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:57.120 align:middle line:84%
that this is through
another person.

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.220 align:middle line:90%
We're from the same soul tribe.

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:01.000 align:middle line:84%
We're from where
those beings are from.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.120 align:middle line:90%
And they were talking about--

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.800 align:middle line:84%
as she was giving
a channeling, I

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.430 align:middle line:84%
was in the back of
the room listening.

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:10.835 align:middle line:84%
And they said, oh, yeah,
that's not a problem.

00:14:10.835 --> 00:14:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And they blew
something off they,

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:14.520 align:middle line:84%
would never blow off
about someone's concern

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.500 align:middle line:84%
about their mother
who was passing.

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.430 align:middle line:84%
And I said, hey, what
was that about later?

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And they said, they'll be
going to the new Earth--

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.560 align:middle line:90%
to the other Earth.

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:23.860 align:middle line:90%
They didn't call it new Earth.

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:25.680 align:middle line:90%
They called it other Earth.

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:28.770 align:middle line:84%
And they started coming up in
Dolores Cannon's work as well,

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:30.960 align:middle line:84%
that there is
another Earth that's

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.450 align:middle line:84%
been formed over a very
long period of time

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:38.430 align:middle line:84%
at a density that allows
us now to stay more

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:42.120 align:middle line:84%
with our own vibration and
people of a similar vibration.

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:45.180 align:middle line:84%
And as our Earth, this
Earth, is transiting

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:48.820 align:middle line:84%
into her new frequency
field, we have to keep step.

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:51.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you're talking
about, love and gratitude.

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:53.970 align:middle line:84%
But if you're not keeping
step and you're still

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:57.810 align:middle line:84%
in the kindergarten and first
grade lessons of don't steal,

00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:00.000 align:middle line:84%
rape, beat, and so
forth, each other,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.708 align:middle line:84%
go to the other Earth
for a little while.

00:15:01.708 --> 00:15:02.958 align:middle line:90%
You don't know the difference.

00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:03.870 align:middle line:90%
We forget anyway.

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:06.460 align:middle line:84%
And keep learning, amongst
others, learning the same thing.

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:07.890 align:middle line:90%
So it's rapid learning.

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:10.390 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I was--
that's what I was told,

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:13.060 align:middle line:84%
is the time of clearing
things with family

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:17.050 align:middle line:84%
has come because we now go to
different vibrations of Earth.

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:18.240 align:middle line:90%
How do you feel about that?

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.380 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Yeah, I mean,
that's exactly what

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:21.360 align:middle line:90%
I've channeled as well.

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, wonderful.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:25.240 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Yeah, and a
really good example

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.820 align:middle line:84%
because it's such an
intangible concept

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:31.300 align:middle line:84%
almost that we've got these two
planet, these two earths that

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:33.040 align:middle line:84%
are overlapping
different dimensions.

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just
different vibrations.

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:35.758 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Just
different vibrations.

00:15:35.758 --> 00:15:38.680 align:middle line:84%
But a really good
comparison is if you

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:43.330 align:middle line:84%
live in, say, an apartment
or even like the suburbs

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:47.570 align:middle line:84%
and you've got neighbors, you
will go out at different times

00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:48.370 align:middle line:90%
during the week.

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And you'll always come across
the same neighbors, always.

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.155 align:middle line:84%
But you've got hundreds,
if not thousands, of others

00:15:54.155 --> 00:15:55.280 align:middle line:90%
that you could come across.

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.070 align:middle line:90%
But it's always the same people.

00:15:57.070 --> 00:15:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And yet you never
see anyone else.

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:01.630 align:middle line:84%
And so that's a
really good comparison

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:04.490 align:middle line:84%
of how both Earths
are coexisting.

00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:06.370 align:middle line:84%
Everyone lives in the
same neighborhood.

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And yet because of the
different frequencies,

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:12.015 align:middle line:84%
we actually only interact with
those who are at our level.

00:16:12.015 --> 00:16:13.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:16.990 align:middle line:84%
One time I traveled back
into it or over, whatever,

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:18.350 align:middle line:90%
into that density.

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:21.020 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to see what it
felt like or what it was like.

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:21.950 align:middle line:90%
I was curious.

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:23.830 align:middle line:84%
One thing I noticed
that it was like Earth.

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:26.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it has the flora,
fauna, looks like Earth.

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:29.960 align:middle line:84%
But what I noticed,
in the other one where

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:34.480 align:middle line:84%
the lessons that are a little
more basic are still occurring,

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:37.600 align:middle line:84%
there was virtually
no technology.

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.110 align:middle line:90%
It was very simple.

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:41.140 align:middle line:84%
You get to work things
out with each other.

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:43.900 align:middle line:84%
You have your food and
animals and everything.

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:45.710 align:middle line:90%
But there was no technology.

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:47.900 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
that would make sense.

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:50.200 align:middle line:84%
Technology requires
a pretty advanced,

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:53.440 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to do
it right, thinking.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:57.340 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: And part of my concern
with a lot of the technological

00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:01.120 align:middle line:84%
developments and AI and things
that we see these days is

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.580 align:middle line:84%
it's not necessarily
the technology itself

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:06.319 align:middle line:84%
that's concerning, it's more
so the individuals who are

00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:07.119 align:middle line:90%
in charge of--

00:17:07.119 --> 00:17:07.389 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, absolutely.

00:17:07.389 --> 00:17:09.290 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: --programming
the technology.

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's where's their vibration
at which is fascinating.

00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:14.869 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it is.

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:16.760 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
that a little bit.

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:20.230 align:middle line:84%
First of all, the timelines,
you have certain timelines,

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:23.680 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, that you're
looking at for the advancement

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:26.410 align:middle line:84%
of the species that chooses
to live in gratitude

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:29.150 align:middle line:84%
and stay with the
Earth's frequencies.

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:30.140 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about it.

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:32.110 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Yeah, so there's
two main timelines

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:35.560 align:middle line:84%
that the Galactic Federation has
specifically mentioned to me.

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And this has been over 10 years
that these two main timelines

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:40.370 align:middle line:90%
have emerged.

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:44.240 align:middle line:84%
One is a rip the Band-Aid
off sort of timeline.

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.960 align:middle line:84%
It's a huge solar flare
hitting the planet,

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.770 align:middle line:90%
wiping out our electrical grid.

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:50.360 align:middle line:90%
Everything goes in chaos.

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:55.240 align:middle line:84%
But coming from that is
ascension, a higher vibration,

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:58.940 align:middle line:84%
and also things like
free energy technology.

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:00.730 align:middle line:84%
We can't repair the
grid, so we have

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:02.820 align:middle line:90%
to bring in alternate solutions.

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:04.780 align:middle line:90%
So that's part of it.

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And then the other timeline,
which I personally prefer,

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:12.780 align:middle line:84%
is a little bit of a slower
or more gradual shift getting

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:15.575 align:middle line:84%
hit with, yes, strong
solar flares still.

00:18:15.575 --> 00:18:17.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're having
those right now as we speak.

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:19.090 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: We are in
the middle of it.

00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:19.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Huge.

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:23.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, decades it's been
since these have happened.

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:26.830 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: And we are in this
solar maximum period as well,

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:30.330 align:middle line:84%
so getting hit with
these strong solar flares

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:32.940 align:middle line:84%
ascending, being
forced to look inward,

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:36.240 align:middle line:84%
being forced to let go of all
of that attachment and fear

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:40.500 align:middle line:84%
and doubt and all of that, and
shifting gradually so that we

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.070 align:middle line:90%
can all shift together.

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:46.500 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of people want
that immediate ascension

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:47.470 align:middle line:90%
to happen.

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:49.110 align:middle line:84%
But what we don't
realize is that we're

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:50.257 align:middle line:90%
a very fragile species.

00:18:50.257 --> 00:18:51.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, it
just adds more trauma

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.140 align:middle line:84%
to the trauma we've
already experienced.

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:53.940 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Bingo.

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:55.720 align:middle line:90%
It just adds way more trauma.

00:18:55.720 --> 00:19:01.470 align:middle line:84%
And it'll take a lot of repair
after a situation like that.

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:02.270 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:03.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm not
voting for that one.

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:04.770 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Exactly.

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:06.990 align:middle line:10%
And luckily, the
Galactic Federation

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:12.615 align:middle line:10%
seems to be really on our side
with more of a gradual shift.

00:19:12.615 --> 00:19:15.480 align:middle line:84%
They do have the
technology to prevent

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:19.630 align:middle line:84%
a very massive solar flare
from wiping out our grid.

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:22.950 align:middle line:84%
And so they've been
monitoring those specifically

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:26.205 align:middle line:84%
to help us gradually shift
rather than shift all at once.

00:19:26.205 --> 00:19:27.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's good.

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.760 align:middle line:84%
What about the notion,
though, of the sun

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:36.870 align:middle line:84%
itself, which is a vast, vastly
intelligent, life-giving entity?

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:39.910 align:middle line:84%
Where does that part
of the story come in?

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:41.460 align:middle line:84%
Because I actually
have not heard

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:46.080 align:middle line:84%
anybody talking about the
sun's choice and all of this?

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.710 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: I love that
you bring that up.

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:53.310 align:middle line:84%
So I have spoken with mostly
Mother Gaia as a consciousness

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:54.700 align:middle line:90%
and where she's at.

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And then I have also spoken
with the sun as a consciousness,

00:19:58.290 --> 00:19:59.255 align:middle line:90%
much more masculine--

00:19:59.255 --> 00:20:00.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very much.

00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:02.820 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: --whereas
Gaia is so feminine.

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:04.985 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, very strong,
masculine energy.

00:20:04.985 --> 00:20:08.520 align:middle line:90%


00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.980 align:middle line:84%
Imagine like an
energetic-- imagine

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:14.310 align:middle line:84%
you're about to step on stage
in front of thousands of people

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:17.280 align:middle line:84%
and the anxiety and the
emotions and the energy

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:20.340 align:middle line:84%
and the excitement and all of
the things that are in you.

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:24.720 align:middle line:84%
That's where the sun is at
right now, just on his own path,

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.010 align:middle line:90%
in a sense.

00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a
building of energy.

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And then there needs to
be a releasing of energy.

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And of course, this
is all contracted.

00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:35.397 align:middle line:84%
It's all aligned to where
the Earth needs to be at--

00:20:35.397 --> 00:20:36.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We've aligned with it.

00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:38.063 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: --during our ascension.

00:20:38.063 --> 00:20:40.653 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We chose to, before
birth, to be here at this time.

00:20:40.653 --> 00:20:42.070 align:middle line:84%
It's really important
for everyone

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:44.030 align:middle line:84%
to remember there
are no victims here.

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:46.420 align:middle line:84%
We all chose to
incarnate for this party.

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:55.010 align:middle line:84%
So the sun can choose how he
wishes to release the energy.

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:58.510 align:middle line:90%
And is there--

00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:01.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, according to the
beings that you speak with, do

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:07.070 align:middle line:84%
you get any sense of whether the
sun wants to just let it all go

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:10.700 align:middle line:84%
or be a little bit more
patient for the very reasons

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:12.500 align:middle line:84%
of its interface
with consciousness

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:13.880 align:middle line:90%
in our solar system.

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Yeah,
that's fascinating.

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:23.153 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where the sun is at
as far as what he would prefer,

00:21:23.153 --> 00:21:24.195 align:middle line:90%
what that consciousness--

00:21:24.195 --> 00:21:25.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We need to ask him.

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:27.320 align:middle line:84%
I guess we should just
talk to him and find out.

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:28.403 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yeah, absolutely.

00:21:28.403 --> 00:21:30.625 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We do a morning
sun meditation and ask.

00:21:30.625 --> 00:21:31.425 align:middle line:90%
I haven't asked.

00:21:31.425 --> 00:21:33.120 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Yeah, I
haven't asked either,

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:36.470 align:middle line:84%
so that would be very
fascinating to get into.

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:38.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, because
there is compassion here.

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And Earth herself is so
magnificently regenerative.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.560 align:middle line:84%
If we just stop kicking
her, she recovers overnight.

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:46.825 align:middle line:90%
COVID taught us that.

00:21:46.825 --> 00:21:47.625 align:middle line:90%
She's amazing.

00:21:47.625 --> 00:21:48.425 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Exactly.

00:21:48.425 --> 00:21:50.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And she's
working with the sun.

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:52.540 align:middle line:84%
Nothing here lives
without the sun.

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:55.510 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just saying,
let's take it

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:58.930 align:middle line:84%
to the highest level and maybe
all meditate on that for a bit

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:01.240 align:middle line:84%
and ask that we be
given some grace.

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:02.145 align:middle line:90%
We can request.

00:22:02.145 --> 00:22:03.630 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: I didn't
even think about that.

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:04.440 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:05.240 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:05.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:06.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's just a thought.

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:10.720 align:middle line:84%
So now, the other thing
is about timelines.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.970 align:middle line:84%
We both like the notion
of the slower timeline,

00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:16.760 align:middle line:84%
about timeline jumping,
timeline shifting.

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:19.060 align:middle line:84%
Talk to us a little bit
about that because that is,

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:21.660 align:middle line:84%
I think, harder for people
to understand sometimes.

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:24.600 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get to the
Mandela effect, by the way.

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.590 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: And it is quite
an overwhelming concept

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:32.090 align:middle line:84%
to cover and to think
about and even to explain.

00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm a clairvoyant, which
means that I can see energies.

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:40.800 align:middle line:84%
And so I can see the quantum
world and how everything works.

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:44.960 align:middle line:84%
So for example, today I chose
water to be in this cup.

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.180 align:middle line:84%
But there was an infinite
number of other choices.

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:49.430 align:middle line:84%
It could have been coconut
water, could have been tea,

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:50.300 align:middle line:90%
could have been coffee.

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:51.410 align:middle line:90%
It could have been juice.

00:22:51.410 --> 00:22:52.890 align:middle line:90%
It could have been anything.

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:55.490 align:middle line:84%
And so those are all
actually separate timelines

00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:57.090 align:middle line:90%
that are coexisting.

00:22:57.090 --> 00:23:01.280 align:middle line:84%
So one of the easiest ways to
explain timelines and timeline

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:03.890 align:middle line:84%
jumping and time
itself is instead

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:07.190 align:middle line:84%
of the past, the present,
and the future happening

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:10.250 align:middle line:84%
in a linear fashion, it's
the past, the present,

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:12.560 align:middle line:84%
and the future
happening simultaneously

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:14.010 align:middle line:90%
on top of each other.

00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And so when we
take a look at all

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:20.570 align:middle line:84%
of these different variations
of timelines, what happens

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:25.480 align:middle line:84%
is we create a timeline
first in a nonphysical sense

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:27.500 align:middle line:90%
by focusing on it.

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:30.520 align:middle line:84%
So if this morning I was like,
I'm really craving orange juice

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:33.310 align:middle line:84%
but I don't know where I
would get orange juice,

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:35.852 align:middle line:84%
and then all of a sudden someone
comes up to me in the studio

00:23:35.852 --> 00:23:37.310 align:middle line:84%
and says, hey, you
know what, we've

00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:39.470 align:middle line:84%
got some fresh orange juice,
great, I'll take that,

00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:41.300 align:middle line:84%
and there would be
orange juice in my cup.

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:43.670 align:middle line:84%
But the thought
of it comes first.

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:46.750 align:middle line:84%
So when we think about hopping
into different timelines,

00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:50.150 align:middle line:84%
it does happen sometimes
randomly but not so randomly.

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:52.240 align:middle line:84%
But most of the time,
it happens first

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:55.220 align:middle line:84%
with conscious focus
and conscious thought.

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And so I always think about
solidifying a timeline.

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:03.970 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if you wanted
to manifest something, something

00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:06.760 align:middle line:84%
random like a basketball,
for example, you're like,

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:08.800 align:middle line:84%
I don't really interact
with basketball,

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:11.750 align:middle line:84%
so I want to test out my
manifestation abilities.

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:13.540 align:middle line:84%
You think about a
basketball once.

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:17.300 align:middle line:84%
And in your mind, it
is a transparent layer.

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:19.770 align:middle line:84%
You think about a basketball
again, another transparent

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:20.570 align:middle line:90%
layer.

00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:22.680 align:middle line:84%
I think about it again
and again and again.

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, you're
adding density--

00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:26.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely,
through repetition.

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:29.495 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: --through repetition,
through thought, through focus.

00:24:29.495 --> 00:24:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, the
thought of the basketball

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:34.208 align:middle line:84%
is so dense that it
pops into this reality.

00:24:34.208 --> 00:24:35.500 align:middle line:90%
And you hop into that timeline.

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:39.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it sounds like
another word for timeline

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:44.090 align:middle line:84%
because people attach
time rather than outcome,

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:44.960 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:47.690 align:middle line:84%
So another word for timeline
could be an ultimately created

00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:48.490 align:middle line:90%
reality.

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:49.250 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Bingo.

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:50.083 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's it.

00:24:50.083 --> 00:24:52.910 align:middle line:90%
So it's not about time per se.

00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:54.980 align:middle line:84%
But I know the way
you're referring to it

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:57.240 align:middle line:84%
is how others refer
to it as well.

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.120 align:middle line:84%
So it's an ultimately
created reality

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:02.690 align:middle line:84%
through our own desire
and repetition of thought

00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:04.110 align:middle line:90%
that reinforces it.

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:06.650 align:middle line:84%
So we have to be-- this is
the whole thing, people.

00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:10.040 align:middle line:84%
I think we're just now getting
to where we realize, yeah,

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:12.050 align:middle line:84%
I do need to really start
thinking about where

00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:16.280 align:middle line:84%
my mind's going because we think
you can sit down and meditate.

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And because you meditated
that day, you're good to go.

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
trashy thoughts all day.

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:23.480 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't work.

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:26.600 align:middle line:84%
Forget the meditation if you're
going to forget something

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.456 align:middle line:84%
and look at the quality of
thoughts during the day.

00:25:29.456 --> 00:25:32.840 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: And so I have
another really good example.

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:36.200 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people come to me and
they're like, well, Elizabeth,

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:38.490 align:middle line:90%
my relationship is terrible.

00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:39.980 align:middle line:90%
My job is terrible.

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:41.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm not getting paid enough.

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:42.960 align:middle line:90%
My living situation is terrible.

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:45.320 align:middle line:84%
How can I find gratitude
in all of this?

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:48.482 align:middle line:84%
And I have to reframe
their reality.

00:25:48.482 --> 00:25:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And a big part of
it is if you have

00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:54.570 align:middle line:84%
access to tap water that's
drinkable, that's huge.

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:57.410 align:middle line:84%
30% of the entire population
do not have access

00:25:57.410 --> 00:25:58.620 align:middle line:90%
to clean drinking water.

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:02.960 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we may not want to drink
the tap water but we can.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.280 align:middle line:90%
Access to the internet.

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:06.478 align:middle line:84%
Once again, 30, 40%
of the population

00:26:06.478 --> 00:26:08.270 align:middle line:84%
does not have access
to the internet, which

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:10.110 align:middle line:90%
is essentially free education.

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:12.030 align:middle line:90%
It's consciousness sharing.

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:14.910 align:middle line:84%
And so there's always
something to be grateful for.

00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:17.210 align:middle line:84%
I can walk down the street
and have a terrible day

00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:19.790 align:middle line:84%
and see a blooming
flower and just see

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:22.010 align:middle line:90%
the beauty in the world.

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And the more that we
shift our perception--

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:27.650 align:middle line:84%
so even if, for example, a
terrible job, you're like,

00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:30.360 align:middle line:84%
you hate your job, you're not
getting paid enough, I get it.

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:32.540 align:middle line:84%
But you are still
getting a paycheck.

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:34.190 align:middle line:84%
And that paycheck
is still paying

00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:36.010 align:middle line:90%
for the roof over your head.

00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:39.170 align:middle line:84%
So at the end of the day, maybe
there's nothing about your job

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:41.850 align:middle line:84%
other than that paycheck
that you can be grateful for.

00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:43.500 align:middle line:90%
So focus on that thing.

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:44.670 align:middle line:90%
Focus on the gratitude.

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And when you raise the vibration
of the reality that you're in,

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:52.110 align:middle line:84%
the reality that you're
in begins to shift.

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:54.260 align:middle line:90%
And then you lose your job.

00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:55.960 align:middle line:90%
And you find a better one.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:58.220 align:middle line:84%
Your relationship
shifts for a better one

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:00.890 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:04.370 align:middle line:84%
I think that gratitude piece
is we can all-- especially

00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:06.140 align:middle line:84%
in the Western world,
I think that we're

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:08.960 align:middle line:84%
so privileged in so
many ways, we don't even

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.710 align:middle line:90%
understand our privilege.

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And so to take a look at
the people who are suffering

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:16.580 align:middle line:84%
and realize that access
to clean drinking water

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:19.130 align:middle line:84%
and food and a roof over
our head and internet

00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:22.445 align:middle line:84%
are all things to be
really deeply grateful for.

00:27:22.445 --> 00:27:23.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:25.300 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't agree with you more.

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:27.490 align:middle line:84%
And you're right, it
can be a terrible day.

00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:28.960 align:middle line:90%
But there's a beautiful flower.

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think once anyone gets
to that point where they cannot

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:35.280 align:middle line:84%
just walk past that flower
feeling grumpy, you've changed.

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:37.060 align:middle line:90%
So that was a beautiful example.

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:38.715 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:27:38.715 --> 00:27:41.130 align:middle line:84%
This might seem like a
bit of a non sequitur,

00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:43.770 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going
somewhere else with it.

00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:46.530 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of the
reason people feel

00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:52.020 align:middle line:84%
the way they do is by judgment
and comparison with other.

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:53.520 align:middle line:90%
Someone else has more.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:56.200 align:middle line:84%
So we're not doing well enough
because someone else has more.

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:59.130 align:middle line:84%
It is a condition,
human condition that we

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:00.960 align:middle line:90%
need to work on, obviously.

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:06.180 align:middle line:84%
So that's going to get into the
feeding the matrix part of this.

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:08.940 align:middle line:84%
But the segue is when
you speak with the beings

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:10.800 align:middle line:84%
from other places,
those who even

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:13.530 align:middle line:84%
have the capability of
traveling planetarily

00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:17.220 align:middle line:84%
and such as many people watching
have in their past lives,

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:22.170 align:middle line:84%
is AI absolutely an essential
part, a critical part

00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:23.470 align:middle line:90%
of this development?

00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:27.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can't really
expand out physically probably

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:29.880 align:middle line:84%
without some type of
artificial intelligence.

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:32.630 align:middle line:90%
And the time has arrived for it.

00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:33.600 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yes.

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:34.930 align:middle line:90%
OK, great question.

00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:38.160 align:middle line:84%
So, so many people are
really scared of AI.

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And like I referenced
earlier, I'm

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:42.600 align:middle line:84%
more worried about
the developers of AI

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:45.600 align:middle line:84%
and how they're programming
it than the technology itself.

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:48.180 align:middle line:84%
When I connect with
the Galactic Federation

00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:52.090 align:middle line:84%
and I share my fears and
worries from humanity about AI

00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:55.660 align:middle line:84%
and the potential takeover
and all this stuff, they say,

00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:58.820 align:middle line:84%
well, Elizabeth, what have
we been doing for centuries?

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:02.170 align:middle line:84%
We've been working
with AI, a sentient AI.

00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:05.590 align:middle line:84%
Robots, all of that have
been out there for millennia,

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:06.970 align:middle line:90%
for many, many years.

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:10.965 align:middle line:84%
And we just know how to
navigate it properly.

00:29:10.965 --> 00:29:16.960 align:middle line:84%
And so, like anything, we
cannot put a halt on progression

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.050 align:middle line:90%
because of fears.

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:20.620 align:middle line:84%
We just need to come
up with new solutions

00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:22.180 align:middle line:90%
if we have new problems.

00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:23.000 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.930 align:middle line:84%
So I really do think that
it's about connecting

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:29.290 align:middle line:84%
with the technology and allowing
it to progress us forward.

00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:31.180 align:middle line:84%
And even up on
those ships, I mean,

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:34.430 align:middle line:84%
there's no separation between
consciousness and technology.

00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:35.710 align:middle line:90%
It's one and the same.

00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:38.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they control their ships
by simply thinking, go right,

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:39.860 align:middle line:90%
and they go right.

00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:42.710 align:middle line:84%
And so that's where
we're going to get to.

00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:46.720 align:middle line:84%
But we do need to be in a place
of a higher conscious vibration

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:49.900 align:middle line:84%
before we get to that place
where we can very seamlessly

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:51.520 align:middle line:90%
integrate with technology.

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:53.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
and that brings us

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:57.510 align:middle line:84%
to then the larger question
of dominant control themes

00:29:57.510 --> 00:29:59.050 align:middle line:84%
that are happening
on the planet.

00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And we're both
concerned about that.

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:05.100 align:middle line:84%
In fact, just as an aside,
Lee Harris and I wrote a book

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:07.540 align:middle line:84%
together recently called
"The Future Human."

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I was asking all
the questions and did my thing.

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:13.360 align:middle line:90%
And I did ask about AI.

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:16.270 align:middle line:84%
They said, oh, AI has visited
Earth many times before.

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:18.040 align:middle line:84%
This isn't the
first introduction.

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:20.370 align:middle line:84%
So we had ancient
times, Atlantean times,

00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:21.480 align:middle line:90%
it's already been here.

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:23.170 align:middle line:90%
So it's just re-emerging.

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And again, now we get to the
problem of the developers,

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:29.550 align:middle line:90%
the controllers of it.

00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll do another little
segue because it's fascinating.

00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:37.530 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about that
from your point of view.

00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:39.330 align:middle line:84%
What's happening
with the algorithms

00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:42.026 align:middle line:84%
and feeding the
beast in each person?

00:30:42.026 --> 00:30:43.240 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yeah, OK.

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:45.498 align:middle line:90%
So when we think about--

00:30:45.498 --> 00:30:46.540 align:middle line:90%
there's a high vibration.

00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:47.707 align:middle line:90%
And there's a low vibration.

00:30:47.707 --> 00:30:49.020 align:middle line:90%
We live in a binary universe.

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:52.370 align:middle line:84%
We live in a binary
system, binary planet.

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:57.800 align:middle line:84%
With technology and AI,
there is unity or separation.

00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And so if you think about
just basic technology

00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:02.950 align:middle line:90%
these days, we've got programs.

00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:04.180 align:middle line:90%
We've got social media.

00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:05.200 align:middle line:90%
We've got TV.

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:08.265 align:middle line:90%
We've got Netflix.

00:31:08.265 --> 00:31:09.640 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm in
the mom world now,

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:11.350 align:middle line:90%
we've got flashing baby toys.

00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:13.580 align:middle line:90%
And it's just so stimulating.

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:15.080 align:middle line:90%
And what does that do?

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:17.230 align:middle line:84%
What does all of this
technology-- all of this,

00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:21.770 align:middle line:84%
the algorithms, the social
media, it separates us further.

00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:23.210 align:middle line:90%
It makes us more anxious.

00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:26.620 align:middle line:84%
It makes us feel even more
different, even more comparison,

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:31.180 align:middle line:84%
even more of the filtered
girls on there and all of that.

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:33.290 align:middle line:90%
And so it can be quite damaging.

00:31:33.290 --> 00:31:36.680 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the time when
we turn off our technology

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:40.460 align:middle line:84%
and we reconnect to nature,
we feel unified again.

00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:44.300 align:middle line:84%
When we reconnect with each
other, we feel the unity again.

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:46.780 align:middle line:84%
So I think the
turning point for us

00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:53.260 align:middle line:84%
is, how do we utilize technology
to actually help unify humanity

00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:56.575 align:middle line:84%
rather than continue
to separate it?

00:31:56.575 --> 00:32:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And we do see some really
incredible examples of this

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:03.460 align:middle line:84%
as well in society where
technology has brought people

00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:05.740 align:middle line:90%
together around a similar cause.

00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And we can all get together
and stand up against the powers

00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:09.800 align:middle line:90%
that be.

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:13.570 align:middle line:84%
I like to call them
the powers that were.

00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:16.330 align:middle line:90%
And so that's all they want.

00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:17.600 align:middle line:90%
They want more control.

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.100 align:middle line:90%
They want more separation.

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:20.417 align:middle line:90%
They want to dull us down.

00:32:20.417 --> 00:32:22.500 align:middle line:84%
They want to make sure
that we're not questioning.

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:29.110 align:middle line:84%
I actually did a pyramid that's
inverted from the one that's

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:30.080 align:middle line:90%
been put out there.

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:31.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't call them
the powers that be.

00:32:31.790 --> 00:32:35.290 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the pyramid is
us doing the things we do,

00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:37.480 align:middle line:84%
being people and singing
and having children

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:40.160 align:middle line:84%
and loving nature and
working, doing what we do.

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.400 align:middle line:84%
And at the very bottom
are these little grim

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:45.685 align:middle line:84%
photos of the controllers, which
I actually-- it's not very nice.

00:32:45.685 --> 00:32:47.560 align:middle line:84%
But I call them bottom
feeders because that's

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:48.500 align:middle line:90%
where you get that--

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:52.510 align:middle line:84%
you skim off that dense, fearful
energy is like a bottom feeder.

00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And so the bottom
feeders, sadly,

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:59.400 align:middle line:84%
still have a fair amount
of control but not forever.

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:03.420 align:middle line:84%
And so to what you speak
of, taking this technology

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:07.710 align:middle line:84%
and making it work for us
on the most really almost

00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:11.010 align:middle line:90%
subliminal ways, for example--

00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:13.863 align:middle line:84%
I did a commentary
recently on this--

00:33:13.863 --> 00:33:16.280 align:middle line:84%
when you wake up in the morning
and you open up the phone,

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:17.950 align:middle line:84%
you get your phone
or your computer

00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:20.770 align:middle line:84%
and all your preferences
start coming in--

00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:23.950 align:middle line:84%
my feed, if I were
to open YouTube,

00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:27.340 align:middle line:84%
will be babies,
bunnies, and puppies.

00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:30.365 align:middle line:84%
So I wake up just,
oh, isn't that cute?

00:33:30.365 --> 00:33:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
wake up to every day,

00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:33.410 align:middle line:90%
is babies, bunnies, and puppies.

00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's really
because I've allowed

00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:39.730 align:middle line:84%
it to work for me in
that sense because I

00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:43.130 align:middle line:84%
don't care for its intrusion
of things that aren't mine.

00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:46.600 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at humanity,
huge percentage of people

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:49.540 align:middle line:84%
open up to bunnies,
babies, and puppies.

00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:51.250 align:middle line:90%
And we share it with each other.

00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:52.640 align:middle line:90%
And it warms our heart.

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:55.360 align:middle line:84%
But look what we're being
fed from the top down

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:58.730 align:middle line:84%
in the control systems of
media and entertainment.

00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:00.730 align:middle line:90%
That's not who we are.

00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:02.380 align:middle line:90%
But it's addictive.

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:05.580 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about not
feeding that matrix.

00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:06.550 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yes.

00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:10.719 align:middle line:84%
So just like hopping timelines
or creating alternate realities

00:34:10.719 --> 00:34:14.070 align:middle line:84%
and improving your life,
it's the same thing.

00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:15.949 align:middle line:84%
Wherever your
focus goes is where

00:34:15.949 --> 00:34:19.100 align:middle line:84%
you feed that reality,
that collective reality.

00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:22.670 align:middle line:84%
So I try and tell people,
stop watching the news.

00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:25.670 align:middle line:84%
Stop feeding in even
all of the agendas

00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:30.170 align:middle line:84%
and the conspiracies because one
of the first stages of awakening

00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:31.739 align:middle line:90%
is you question everything.

00:34:31.739 --> 00:34:32.659 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:34:32.659 --> 00:34:34.400 align:middle line:90%
Who's in control?

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:35.320 align:middle line:90%
What am I doing?

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:36.120 align:middle line:90%
Am I happy.

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:38.489 align:middle line:84%
Those sort of things,
which is great to question.

00:34:38.489 --> 00:34:41.560 align:middle line:84%
But the questioning will
lead us into the conspiracies

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:42.360 align:middle line:90%
and the agendas.

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:43.160 align:middle line:90%
And then a lot--

00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:44.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I call
it the entry drug.

00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:45.737 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: There you go.

00:34:45.737 --> 00:34:46.537 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:34:46.537 --> 00:34:48.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I've
been involved with it.

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:50.850 align:middle line:84%
For many years, I've
done thick and--

00:34:50.850 --> 00:34:52.199 align:middle line:90%
I've interviewed them all.

00:34:52.199 --> 00:34:54.179 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yeah, exactly.

00:34:54.179 --> 00:34:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And so we're now at a point
where, yes, we understand

00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:59.750 align:middle line:90%
these things are happening.

00:34:59.750 --> 00:35:00.685 align:middle line:90%
But then what?

00:35:00.685 --> 00:35:01.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Then what?

00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:02.990 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: What else is going on?

00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:03.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:04.910 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: And
there's so much more

00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:10.460 align:middle line:84%
going on that's beautiful
and lovely and unifying.

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:13.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's what God is,
or that's what source is.

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:14.340 align:middle line:90%
It's everything.

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:16.590 align:middle line:90%
It's light and dark combined.

00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:18.240 align:middle line:84%
So we have to go
through the suffering.

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:19.740 align:middle line:84%
We have to go through
the challenge.

00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:22.830 align:middle line:84%
We have to go through the
darkness to see the light.

00:35:22.830 --> 00:35:27.680 align:middle line:84%
But it's no longer time to
feed into any sort of fear,

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:31.010 align:middle line:84%
whether it be fear coming
from mainstream news or fear

00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:33.395 align:middle line:90%
coming from alternate news.

00:35:33.395 --> 00:35:37.850 align:middle line:84%
It's time to really feed the
new Earth with puppies, bunnies,

00:35:37.850 --> 00:35:41.450 align:middle line:84%
and babies and love and
gratitude and stopping

00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:44.780 align:middle line:84%
to smell that flower
because, wow, what a gift.

00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really just what our
focus is on throughout the day,

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:51.300 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:52.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:55.190 align:middle line:84%
It's actually that
simple because the fact

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:57.110 align:middle line:84%
is you can read
about the conspiracy.

00:35:57.110 --> 00:35:58.140 align:middle line:90%
And it can be true.

00:35:58.140 --> 00:35:59.917 align:middle line:90%
It's not a conspiracy.

00:35:59.917 --> 00:36:01.500 align:middle line:84%
Someone actually
conspired to do that.

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:03.150 align:middle line:90%
And they're doing it.

00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:06.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, again, reading
that stuff for decades.

00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:09.810 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, the only
thing that can correct it

00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:14.010 align:middle line:84%
is our collective
optimism, gratitude,

00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:16.710 align:middle line:84%
and love which is going
to shift that field away

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:18.510 align:middle line:90%
from those realities.

00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:22.140 align:middle line:84%
And just like you
said a moment ago,

00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:25.530 align:middle line:84%
the disconnect is
so obvious, anybody

00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:27.960 align:middle line:84%
can see it now because
I do believe people way

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:29.100 align:middle line:90%
on the side of light.

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:31.120 align:middle line:90%
Humanity in general is good.

00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:34.780 align:middle line:84%
We love, we want the same things
for our children and our bunnies

00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:35.580 align:middle line:90%
and puppies.

00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:37.630 align:middle line:90%
And we want the same things.

00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:40.200 align:middle line:84%
We all have our little
darkness here and there,

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:41.770 align:middle line:90%
our shadow that we deal with.

00:36:41.770 --> 00:36:46.150 align:middle line:84%
But walking around by day,
most of us aren't dark souls.

00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:48.210 align:middle line:84%
So why is that being
reflected back to us

00:36:48.210 --> 00:36:50.210 align:middle line:90%
from the top of the media chain?

00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:52.240 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Exactly.

00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:53.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Nonsense.

00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:55.380 align:middle line:90%
Don't buy it anymore.

00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:58.370 align:middle line:84%
OK, now let's talk about people
that say, all right, I hear you.

00:36:58.370 --> 00:36:59.170 align:middle line:90%
I've got it.

00:36:59.170 --> 00:37:00.475 align:middle line:90%
But I'm just really struggling.

00:37:00.475 --> 00:37:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And they want to turn
to their guidance

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:05.310 align:middle line:84%
to help them overcome all
this darkness and suffering

00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:06.820 align:middle line:90%
and unfairness in the world.

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:09.182 align:middle line:90%
You see it a little differently.

00:37:09.182 --> 00:37:11.430 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Yeah, well, I
mean, I truly believe

00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:13.170 align:middle line:90%
that we're all channelers.

00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:14.530 align:middle line:90%
We are all psychic.

00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:15.790 align:middle line:90%
We are all tapped in.

00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:18.000 align:middle line:84%
We are energy bodies
first, as you know,

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.930 align:middle line:90%
and then physical bodies after.

00:37:19.930 --> 00:37:22.860 align:middle line:90%
And so this is the time.

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:26.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it is the
time right now where

00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:30.330 align:middle line:84%
we see ourselves for this
incredible, infinite being

00:37:30.330 --> 00:37:32.220 align:middle line:90%
that we are.

00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And I'm hoping that one
day I'm out of a job.

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:37.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm hoping that one
day I am no longer

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:40.560 align:middle line:84%
the conduit of information
because everyone has access

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:43.125 align:middle line:90%
to that information themselves.

00:37:43.125 --> 00:37:44.680 align:middle line:90%
And that's where we're going.

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not about
following a teacher anymore.

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:50.230 align:middle line:90%
It's about becoming the teacher.

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:53.825 align:middle line:84%
It's about becoming the
wayshower and embodying that.

00:37:53.825 --> 00:37:56.905 align:middle line:90%


00:37:56.905 --> 00:37:59.070 align:middle line:84%
That's the most important
thing right now,

00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:02.550 align:middle line:84%
is to see ourselves for how
incredible and powerful we are

00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:04.710 align:middle line:84%
and to step into
that and to help

00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:06.280 align:middle line:90%
the rest of the world with that.

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:10.050 align:middle line:84%
But of course, we cannot help
anyone else out first if we

00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:11.290 align:middle line:90%
haven't helped ourselves.

00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:15.180 align:middle line:84%
I always say, we have to
give from a place of overflow

00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:17.550 align:middle line:84%
because if we're giving
from a place of lack,

00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:19.090 align:middle line:90%
then all we're giving is lack.

00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:20.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:21.750 align:middle line:90%
Very well put.

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:25.050 align:middle line:84%
And the notion also of
working with other beings.

00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:27.280 align:middle line:84%
We have been stepped on
for quite a long time.

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:30.870 align:middle line:84%
We've had a boot on our necks
for quite a long time on Earth.

00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And now we're putting our
own boots on our own necks

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:36.240 align:middle line:84%
because we've been appropriately
programmed to see ourselves

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:38.310 align:middle line:90%
as less than and lacking.

00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:40.860 align:middle line:90%
OK, that game is ending.

00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:43.740 align:middle line:84%
But what we've tended to do
is then give our power away

00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:45.900 align:middle line:84%
because another being
is from somewhere else.

00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:47.520 align:middle line:90%
And we worship.

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:48.640 align:middle line:90%
It's not about worship.

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:50.260 align:middle line:90%
We should not be worshipping.

00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:51.060 align:middle line:90%
Give love.

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:52.690 align:middle line:90%
Give respect and gratitude.

00:38:52.690 --> 00:38:57.760 align:middle line:84%
We should not be throwing our
power before another being.

00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:58.830 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Absolutely.

00:38:58.830 --> 00:39:00.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's really important.

00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:03.930 align:middle line:84%
And you think about, how did
all of the religions in the past

00:39:03.930 --> 00:39:06.060 align:middle line:90%
actually get started?

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And it was some sort of contact
with an extraterrestrial being.

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:11.442 align:middle line:84%
And they had some
profound experience.

00:39:11.442 --> 00:39:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And then they
believed that they're

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:14.038 align:middle line:90%
the Messiah of that being.

00:39:14.038 --> 00:39:15.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you worship them.

00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:16.360 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: And you worship them.

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:17.160 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:18.570 align:middle line:90%
And so that's just--

00:39:18.570 --> 00:39:20.170 align:middle line:90%
that's not the case anymore.

00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:21.820 align:middle line:90%
It's a unification.

00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:23.580 align:middle line:90%
It's a togetherness.

00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:26.460 align:middle line:84%
It's understanding that we
all have this connection

00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:30.160 align:middle line:84%
to pure divine source
and no worship.

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:33.360 align:middle line:84%
But I will say that
what I've been noticing

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:37.470 align:middle line:84%
is the Individuals with some
of the greatest networks--

00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:40.170 align:middle line:84%
and I'm talking about,
say, a community,

00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:42.240 align:middle line:90%
social media, online networks.

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:45.240 align:middle line:84%
The individuals who have
the biggest networks

00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:47.875 align:middle line:84%
are typically the
most inauthentic.

00:39:47.875 --> 00:39:48.675 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:39:48.675 --> 00:39:51.960 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: And the ones who are
the real deal, like they're

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:54.690 align:middle line:84%
doing the work, they're
really authentic, they've

00:39:54.690 --> 00:39:57.885 align:middle line:84%
learned discernment, no
one knows who they are.

00:39:57.885 --> 00:40:00.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because they're
not about self-promotion.

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:02.930 align:middle line:84%
They're about the
information and sharing.

00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:05.150 align:middle line:84%
Believe me, I'm
always combing, trying

00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:07.280 align:middle line:84%
to find the beautiful
souls that are not

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:09.435 align:middle line:90%
about just selling themselves.

00:40:09.435 --> 00:40:10.235 align:middle line:90%
This is hard.

00:40:10.235 --> 00:40:12.115 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: They're the
diamonds in the rough.

00:40:12.115 --> 00:40:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And also, there's a
reflection, too, of if

00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:17.360 align:middle line:84%
the individual who
is, say-- and there's

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:22.070 align:middle line:84%
a lot of false spirituality out
there, the ones with the egos.

00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:23.660 align:middle line:84%
And they've got
these big networks.

00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder to myself, how
can none of these people

00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:28.363 align:middle line:90%
see the truth?

00:40:28.363 --> 00:40:29.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I wonder the same.

00:40:29.530 --> 00:40:30.738 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: How do they not see?

00:40:30.738 --> 00:40:34.190 align:middle line:84%
But I think that they match
each other in the vibration.

00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And I know that once
we tip those scales,

00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:39.960 align:middle line:84%
all of those people will be
seen for who they truly are.

00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And I really do believe
that the ones who have not

00:40:43.070 --> 00:40:45.860 align:middle line:84%
been seen because they are
just doing their own thing

00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:48.260 align:middle line:84%
and they're giving back
and they're authentic, I do

00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:50.090 align:middle line:84%
believe that they
will have a platform

00:40:50.090 --> 00:40:53.000 align:middle line:84%
because the rest of humanity
will get to that level too.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And they'll all mirror
each other's vibration.

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:56.200 align:middle line:84%
It's just where
we're at right now.

00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:56.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's where
we're at right now.

00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:57.925 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: It's kind
of a waiting game.

00:40:57.925 --> 00:40:58.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And I totally agree
with you on that.

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so glad that you
are authentic because you're

00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:05.680 align:middle line:84%
going to be taking
off in media here,

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:08.730 align:middle line:84%
it sounds like, the
thing we've talked about.

00:41:08.730 --> 00:41:10.470 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
that for just--

00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:13.870 align:middle line:84%
we have a few minutes left
before your final thoughts.

00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:16.990 align:middle line:84%
My understanding is you might
be doing something with Peacock.

00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:17.790 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:18.640 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Oh, yeah.

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:23.430 align:middle line:84%
So I did just do a
TV show with Peacock

00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:27.390 align:middle line:84%
helping Demi Lovato, which is
crazy that there's celebrities

00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:31.090 align:middle line:84%
who are waking up, helped her
connect with extraterrestrials.

00:41:31.090 --> 00:41:35.340 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, I'm really working
on two books right now.

00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:38.853 align:middle line:84%
And that's my main trajectory
in helping humanity.

00:41:38.853 --> 00:41:40.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
are they about?

00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:42.030 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: So one is
more mainstream.

00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's called "Your Anxiety
is Giving Me Anxiety."

00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:46.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:49.470 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: I mean, children,
adults, everyone suffering.

00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:50.860 align:middle line:90%
And no one really knows why.

00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:53.100 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like I have
some answers there

00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:55.030 align:middle line:90%
as a chronic sufferer myself.

00:41:55.030 --> 00:41:56.980 align:middle line:90%
So that's all about anxiety.

00:41:56.980 --> 00:42:00.270 align:middle line:84%
And then the other one, the
working title is "Cosmic

00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:01.200 align:middle line:90%
Conversations."

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And it is straight
dialogue between me

00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:07.110 align:middle line:84%
and extraterrestrials
to help humanity better

00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:09.450 align:middle line:84%
understand where
we're at and how we

00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:11.860 align:middle line:90%
can move across this ascension.

00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:16.228 align:middle line:84%
So much more interdimensional at
a very high level information.

00:42:16.228 --> 00:42:17.645 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For your
other audience.

00:42:17.645 --> 00:42:19.660 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: For my other
audience, exactly.

00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:22.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And any final thoughts
here about this wonderful time

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:25.800 align:middle line:84%
we're in with solar flares,
all the institutions

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:27.780 align:middle line:84%
crumbling and
changing and morphing

00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:30.480 align:middle line:84%
into something else and
people just not knowing quite

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:32.190 align:middle line:84%
where to put their
foot down next.

00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:33.550 align:middle line:90%
Final thoughts on that.

00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:36.750 align:middle line:10%
>>APRIL: Final thoughts
is hang in there

00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:39.450 align:middle line:10%
because we are
finally at the time.

00:42:39.450 --> 00:42:41.200 align:middle line:10%
And take action.

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:45.810 align:middle line:10%
So if you're at a place where
you've been coasting along

00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:50.730 align:middle line:10%
and you've been waiting and
you've been just allowing things

00:42:50.730 --> 00:42:54.820 align:middle line:10%
to pass you by, this is the time
to ask for what you really want.

00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:57.720 align:middle line:84%
This is the time to step
into that energy of,

00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:00.580 align:middle line:84%
I deserve a healthy
relationship.

00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:05.060 align:middle line:84%
I deserve a career where I feel
excited to wake up every day

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:08.050 align:middle line:84%
because when we follow
that joy, that's

00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:09.760 align:middle line:90%
when everything unfolds for us.

00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And we can step into
that higher timeline.

00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:14.390 align:middle line:90%
So it's no longer time to wait.

00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:17.660 align:middle line:84%
It's time to act
because the time is now.

00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:19.370 align:middle line:84%
It's a very exciting
time to be here.

00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:21.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And in
an odd way, COVID

00:43:21.310 --> 00:43:23.110 align:middle line:84%
added to that because
people stopped

00:43:23.110 --> 00:43:25.630 align:middle line:84%
doing the things they didn't
like because they couldn't

00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:29.590 align:middle line:84%
go to work and just couldn't get
it together to go back and do

00:43:29.590 --> 00:43:30.850 align:middle line:90%
things they didn't like.

00:43:30.850 --> 00:43:33.740 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing it everywhere
you go, shortage of employees.

00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:35.620 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't even matter
what the industry is,

00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:37.210 align:middle line:84%
because so many
people were there

00:43:37.210 --> 00:43:39.290 align:middle line:90%
because they didn't want to be.

00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:41.380 align:middle line:84%
So in a strange way,
it halted everything

00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:44.440 align:middle line:84%
to let us see our--
feel our own feelings.

00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:48.370 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's
perfect and beautiful.

00:43:48.370 --> 00:43:51.230 align:middle line:84%
It's going to change economic
systems, it already has.

00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:52.900 align:middle line:90%
Everything is changing.

00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:56.120 align:middle line:84%
But it's all toward letting
us live authentically.

00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:57.700 align:middle line:84%
And what about the
little kids now?

00:43:57.700 --> 00:43:59.980 align:middle line:84%
They're coming in with a
more advanced knowledge,

00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:01.040 align:middle line:90%
more awareness.

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:01.840 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: I do.

00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:05.130 align:middle line:84%
I have so much hope for
the future generations.

00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:07.840 align:middle line:90%
Every day I have more hope.

00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:11.220 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I lose a little bit
of hope, and then I get it back.

00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:14.820 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe that these
children are going to change

00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:17.310 align:middle line:90%
the system as we know it.

00:44:17.310 --> 00:44:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's up to us
to support them

00:44:19.530 --> 00:44:21.990 align:middle line:90%
as best as we can to do that.

00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:23.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Listen to them.

00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:23.940 align:middle line:90%
Love them.

00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:25.560 align:middle line:84%
But give them a
little bit of grist

00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:27.570 align:middle line:84%
so they have some
challenge as well, right?

00:44:27.570 --> 00:44:28.500 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yes.

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:30.292 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I'm
sure you're going to be

00:44:30.292 --> 00:44:32.290 align:middle line:90%
an absolutely wonderful mother.

00:44:32.290 --> 00:44:33.700 align:middle line:90%
You are a wonderful mother.

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:36.690 align:middle line:84%
And I thank you so much for your
authenticity and your beauty,

00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:37.707 align:middle line:90%
your internal beauty.

00:44:37.707 --> 00:44:40.290 align:middle line:84%
You're beautiful on the outside,
too, but your internal beauty

00:44:40.290 --> 00:44:41.860 align:middle line:90%
and being true to yourself.

00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:42.760 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Thank you.

00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:43.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's been
wonderful talking to you.

00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:44.822 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Such a pleasure.

00:44:44.822 --> 00:44:47.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can go to
