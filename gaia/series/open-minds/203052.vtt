00:00:19.468 --> 00:00:21.510 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: It's
been a while since I last

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.950 align:middle line:10%
met with William Henry.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.600 align:middle line:10%
And I'm so happy
to bring him back

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.475 align:middle line:10%
on the show with his
new work the mysticism

00:00:26.475 --> 00:00:29.670 align:middle line:10%
and the ancient Gnostics that
we'll find relevant today, very

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:30.570 align:middle line:10%
relevant today.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.170 align:middle line:84%
It's a body of work William is
calling "Finding the Pearl."

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.010 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.810 align:middle line:84%
It's always good
to see you again.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:37.050 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM HENRY:
Thank you, Regina.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:37.800 align:middle line:90%
Such a pleasure to be here.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.950 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
know, it's so funny.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.820 align:middle line:84%
As soon as I started
listening to the documentary

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.520 align:middle line:84%
you did called "Finding the
Pearl," first of all this

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.920 align:middle line:84%
is a lot of knowledge that
most people aren't aware of,

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.070 align:middle line:84%
even people who studied
esoteric texts quite a bit.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And the journey begins with
a soul named Thomas, right?

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.230 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
launch into it.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to set up
a little framework here.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.140 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk about this
innate moving with and finding

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.080 align:middle line:84%
the refinement and power within,
before we start giving way

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.270 align:middle line:84%
to the second part of
the conversation, which

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.140 align:middle line:84%
has to do with how we apply
it in the insane world we're

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.940 align:middle line:90%
in today.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:16.430 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Wonderful.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK?

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.260 align:middle line:84%
So please, the
"Song of the Pearl,"

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.890 align:middle line:84%
first from Christians
then from the Essenes

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:22.890 align:middle line:90%
called the Gnostic call?

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:23.185 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Great.

00:01:23.185 --> 00:01:23.985 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely.

00:01:23.985 --> 00:01:26.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's start with
Thomas, the soul Thomas.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.950 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: So the Gnostics,
of course, are mystics.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.367 align:middle line:10%
They're early Christian mystics.

00:01:30.367 --> 00:01:31.950 align:middle line:10%
And this story the
"Hymn of the Pearl"

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.140 align:middle line:10%
or "The Song of the
Soul" was written

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.598 align:middle line:10%
around 300 AD, between
200 and 400 AD, probably

00:01:37.598 --> 00:01:40.140 align:middle line:10%
in Edessa, Turkey-- which we'll
come back to that in a moment

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.700 align:middle line:10%
because that's very important.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And the key figure in the
story, his name is Thomas.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.930 align:middle line:90%
And his name means the twin.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And some actually believe
that he is the twin of Jesus.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.290 align:middle line:84%
Either way, he lives
in a higher dimensional

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.300 align:middle line:90%
realm near the throne of God.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And like all souls, he
gets a call to adventure

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.890 align:middle line:90%
and is sent off to Earth.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.840 align:middle line:84%
But before he
leaves his homeland,

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.820 align:middle line:84%
his celestial
homeland of the soul,

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.590 align:middle line:84%
he has to disrobe from his
gleaming or splenderous robe,

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.570 align:middle line:84%
another key element
in the story.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:10.620 align:middle line:90%
He comes to Earth.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.830 align:middle line:84%
He's charged with going
to Egypt, which symbolizes

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.470 align:middle line:84%
the material world,
finding a dragon that

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.590 align:middle line:84%
guards a special pearl,
acquiring the pearl

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.017 align:middle line:84%
and then returning back
to the celestial homeland.

00:02:23.017 --> 00:02:24.600 align:middle line:84%
And of course, in
the story, the drama

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.220 align:middle line:84%
is that he's told
when it gets to Earth

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.660 align:middle line:84%
don't eat the food
because you'll forget

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.340 align:middle line:84%
about your whole mission,
and where you came from,

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.880 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:30.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: The first thing
he does do is eat the food

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:32.730 align:middle line:90%
and forgets everybody.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:33.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Forgets everything.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:34.380 align:middle line:90%
Like the rest of us.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.720 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Like all of us.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like every
time we incarnate.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.120 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.570 align:middle line:84%
But fortunately, his
parents, having foresight,

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.000 align:middle line:84%
had put a letter in his
heart, a little reminder note,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.010 align:middle line:84%
a little wake-up call,
says, hey, Thomas.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.690 align:middle line:84%
Have a good time,
but at some point

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.330 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have to go find
that dragon and get that pearl.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.788 align:middle line:90%
And he does in the story.

00:02:49.788 --> 00:02:52.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk about
the story and the journey

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.790 align:middle line:84%
of his getting
the pearl and what

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.930 align:middle line:84%
he was actually here to teach
and learn along the way.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:57.730 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.030 align:middle line:84%
So the ultimate idea
here is that the pearl

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.150 align:middle line:84%
is, of course, as a symbol
or a metaphor for the soul.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.720 align:middle line:84%
And he is here to acquire
knowledge about the soul

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.535 align:middle line:90%
and how to awaken the soul.

00:03:08.535 --> 00:03:10.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He
personally for himself

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.960 align:middle line:90%
or on behalf of humanity?

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, himself and
also on behalf of humanity.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.600 align:middle line:84%
Because, of course, we're all
ultimately this the same hero,

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.940 align:middle line:84%
we're all on that's
similar, if not

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.250 align:middle line:84%
the same, metaphysical
quest, soul quest,

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.130 align:middle line:84%
to acquire this
knowledge of our gleaming

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.160 align:middle line:84%
gem within us, our soul,
and how we can polish it up.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So before
we go any further,

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.850 align:middle line:84%
you have a gleaming, shining
being from another realm who

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.640 align:middle line:84%
most certainly understands
the nature of soul,

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.100 align:middle line:84%
who chooses to condense and
come into an earthly experience,

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.980 align:middle line:84%
so he can find out
the natural of soul.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:44.780 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.460 align:middle line:84%
To learn more about it and
also to help others to awaken.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.335 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going
to say that part I get.

00:03:49.335 --> 00:03:51.690 align:middle line:84%
By going through
the journey himself

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.930 align:middle line:84%
into this condensed,
very challenging form,

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.770 align:middle line:84%
right and then have to
discover by whatever

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.600 align:middle line:84%
means how to access that
again, that makes sense.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.400 align:middle line:90%
So continue on.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.200 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And so in the story, he
ultimately finds the dragon,

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.810 align:middle line:84%
overcomes the dragon,
acquires the pearl.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And then it's about his journey
back to the celestial realms

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.780 align:middle line:84%
and his reacquisition of
his gleaming or shining

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:16.920 align:middle line:90%
garment of light.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.339 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you care
to share anymore?

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, this was
called the Gnostic call.

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.600 align:middle line:84%
It is contrasted-- I mean
I like to tell the story.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.420 align:middle line:84%
I live in Nashville and I went
to a Baptist funeral one time.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And the Baptist call is you're
a sinner, you're filthy,

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.200 align:middle line:84%
you're garbage,
you're going hell,

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.480 align:middle line:84%
but Jesus is coming
back to get you.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.563 align:middle line:90%
That's the Christian call.

00:04:34.563 --> 00:04:36.397 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not that
different in the Lutheran

00:04:36.397 --> 00:04:38.430 align:middle line:84%
faith, Missouri Synod,
by the way, but go ahead.

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.230 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.790 align:middle line:84%
So the Gnostics developed
this story as a way for people

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.770 align:middle line:84%
to come into the
Gnostic teaching

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.840 align:middle line:84%
to understand that we have
this aspect of ourselves,

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.330 align:middle line:84%
this perfect aspect
of ourselves,

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.720 align:middle line:84%
that remains in the celestial
realms, but a part of our soul

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.820 align:middle line:90%
is what incarnates on Earth.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.010 align:middle line:84%
And so it's this
idea of not only

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.280 align:middle line:84%
coming into a realm of duality
but also this binary soul idea.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.230 align:middle line:84%
That we have this
part of ourselves

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.600 align:middle line:84%
that always remains in
the celestial place.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.640 align:middle line:84%
It's always there
to give us guidance.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.710 align:middle line:90%
It's there for our assistance.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.780 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, we're
here on a mission.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And usually the
mission is involved

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.100 align:middle line:84%
with being a messenger of
light, of peace and love,

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.660 align:middle line:84%
and coming into this realm
in order to transform it.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
way Rumi said it--

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.370 align:middle line:84%
which I lifted all this, of
course, from your documentary--

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.170 align:middle line:84%
said that a universal soul
touches each one of us

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:28.570 align:middle line:84%
and invokes a call to awaken
a new Christ within each one

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.150 align:middle line:90%
of us to find the pearl.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.653 align:middle line:84%
So this term "pearl"
again comes up.

00:05:33.653 --> 00:05:34.570 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: That's right.

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And what they're talking
about there, of course,

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.050 align:middle line:84%
is that the pearl is
the symbol for Christ

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.422 align:middle line:90%
and the Christ within.

00:05:39.422 --> 00:05:41.380 align:middle line:84%
So when we're talking
about awakening the pearl

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.720 align:middle line:84%
or finding the pearl, we're
finding this divine aspect

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.683 align:middle line:90%
within ourselves.

00:05:44.683 --> 00:05:46.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going
to insert a picture here

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.750 align:middle line:84%
of Fra Angelico of Jesus and
Mary and the heavenly realm.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:50.710 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about this.

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.070 align:middle line:10%
What are we looking at here?

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.310 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, this
is an amazing painting

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.320 align:middle line:90%
by Fra Angelico.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.320 align:middle line:90%
It's in Florence, Italy.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.290 align:middle line:10%
And it's a coronation scene.

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:03.940 align:middle line:84%
And this is the scene in which
Mary has been transported.

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.080 align:middle line:84%
Her ascension has
been completed.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.350 align:middle line:84%
Now she's in the celestial
throne, which they believe

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:11.470 align:middle line:84%
was inhabited by
angels, and humans,

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.770 align:middle line:84%
just humans made perfect
specifically, ascended humans.

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.580 align:middle line:84%
And in this image, we see
Jesus placing this crown

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:19.900 align:middle line:90%
on Mary's head.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.700 align:middle line:84%
And what this represents,
ultimately then,

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.300 align:middle line:84%
is her attainment of the higher
consciousness of this throne

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.490 align:middle line:90%
or celestial place.

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you also
mentioned in the documentary--

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.350 align:middle line:84%
which if you hadn't
said anything,

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.860 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't have noticed in
looking at this painting--

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.150 align:middle line:84%
that her eyes are rolled
up in that position which I

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:41.710 align:middle line:90%
understood because I've done--

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.780 align:middle line:84%
I started doing it
automatically and not

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.600 align:middle line:84%
knowing why when I wanted
to reach into another realm.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And you see her eyes in
this hypnotized state

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:50.800 align:middle line:90%
looking upward.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:51.600 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.927 align:middle line:90%
She's in a state of ecstasy.

00:06:52.927 --> 00:06:54.010 align:middle line:90%
Her eyes are up and an in.

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:55.550 align:middle line:84%
She's focusing on
her pineal gland.

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:56.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Or we would be
focusing on our pineal gland

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.570 align:middle line:90%
from this end.

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very important aspect
of this Christian mysticism.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.570 align:middle line:84%
It appears in numerous
examples of Christian art,

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:06.070 align:middle line:90%
especially involving Mary.

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.580 align:middle line:84%
If you start to pay attention
to icons or images of Mary,

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.280 align:middle line:84%
her eyes are very often
up and in because she

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.230 align:middle line:84%
is in this deep
state of meditation.

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:15.700 align:middle line:84%
She's taken a Joe
Dispenza workshop

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.950 align:middle line:84%
and she's learned how to get
in that deep gamma state.

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:19.540 align:middle line:84%
And she's activating
her pineal gland,

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:23.410 align:middle line:84%
and she's awakening this
higher consciousness aspects

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:24.493 align:middle line:90%
within herself.

00:07:24.493 --> 00:07:25.660 align:middle line:90%
Very important apect of her.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:25.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.070 align:middle line:90%
And you can feel it.

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:29.530 align:middle line:90%
I mean if people start just--

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:30.610 align:middle line:90%
go to Joe's work.

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:32.070 align:middle line:90%
Start playing with it.

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:35.260 align:middle line:84%
I had just bumped into it
through years of meditation

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.500 align:middle line:84%
and just working to connect
with my guides and so forth,

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.408 align:middle line:84%
but I hadn't noticed
for, really, it

00:07:40.408 --> 00:07:41.950 align:middle line:84%
was a long time
before I even noticed

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:46.087 align:middle line:84%
it was happening that my eyes
were rolled up and inward.

00:07:46.087 --> 00:07:48.670 align:middle line:84%
And you can feel it-- as soon
as you do it, if you do it right

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:51.760 align:middle line:84%
now-- it starts
changing the feeling

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.760 align:middle line:84%
and the brain chemistry
starts changing instantly.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.180 align:middle line:84%
And you can feel it
changing as you do this.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's interesting
to me is this

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:07.170 align:middle line:84%
was what they did with
the Mayan royal babies.

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:09.180 align:middle line:90%
They knew something about--

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:11.430 align:middle line:84%
the original Mayans, the
ones with the real knowledge.

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:13.770 align:middle line:84%
Not the knocked on ones
a generation later trying

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:14.820 align:middle line:90%
to imitate everything.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:16.930 align:middle line:84%
I think that was an
imitation for that reason.

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:18.870 align:middle line:84%
But the Mayans knew
how to connect.

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:24.420 align:middle line:84%
And they used to dangle an
object above the baby's head

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.190 align:middle line:84%
right here where the
baby would look at it

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:29.460 align:middle line:84%
and it would put their eyes
in a crossed-eye position.

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking
it was because they

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:35.080 align:middle line:84%
were trying to force or
emulate this divine connection,

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.720 align:middle line:84%
this essence of
divine connection.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:37.883 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:08:37.883 --> 00:08:39.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why else
they would they

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:40.260 align:middle line:90%
have done it with the royals?

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:41.060 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And I use other examples
of Mary, other icons

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:45.370 align:middle line:90%
of Mary in the presentation.

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:48.430 align:middle line:84%
You'll see the ones where
she's got a cross right here

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:49.230 align:middle line:90%
on her head.

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:51.522 align:middle line:84%
And her eyes are often up
and in looking at this cross.

00:08:51.522 --> 00:08:55.020 align:middle line:84%
But again the cross is there not
only indicator divinity but as

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:57.300 align:middle line:84%
a target for open-eye
meditation to focus

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.780 align:middle line:84%
on this aspect of
your consciousness.

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:00.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:03.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean because-- you and
I were talking off camera

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:07.620 align:middle line:84%
about when it was
originally understood,

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.528 align:middle line:84%
we were talking about
the de' Medicis,

00:09:09.528 --> 00:09:11.070 align:middle line:84%
and we were talking
about Botticelli,

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:12.487 align:middle line:84%
which is going to
come up in a bit

00:09:12.487 --> 00:09:19.050 align:middle line:84%
here, and about using
art as a sacred entrance.

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:21.412 align:middle line:84%
Tell us that story a little
bit about how you originally

00:09:21.412 --> 00:09:23.370 align:middle line:84%
came to understand it
could be used as an entry

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:24.760 align:middle line:90%
point for your own advancement.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:25.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.660 align:middle line:84%
So I started studying
the early Christian icon

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.840 align:middle line:84%
makers who believe
that art could be

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.717 align:middle line:90%
used as a portal or a gateway.

00:09:32.717 --> 00:09:34.050 align:middle line:90%
It is literally a sacred mirror.

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:36.630 align:middle line:84%
So if you're looking at
an early Christian image,

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:39.720 align:middle line:84%
for example of Jesus in the
transfiguration where he's

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:43.860 align:middle line:84%
morphing into light, the idea is
that through the mirror neurons

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:47.490 align:middle line:84%
in your neocortex in your
frontal lobe, they're firing

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:49.680 align:middle line:90%
as if that is happening to you--

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.440 align:middle line:84%
your body, my body,
your body, Jesus' body,

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.600 align:middle line:90%
same physical human body.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is that
what he was doing

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:59.370 align:middle line:84%
can be triggered
through sacred art.

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And this is the foundational
principle of the icon makers.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.740 align:middle line:84%
It actually originated
in ancient Egypt.

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:06.720 align:middle line:84%
It carries through
every civilization.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.180 align:middle line:84%
My wife Claire and I
did a series on Gaia

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:12.540 align:middle line:84%
called "Arcanum" in which we
go into this in a lot of detail

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:16.230 align:middle line:84%
of art as a spiritual
conduit or a conduit

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:17.403 align:middle line:90%
into the spiritual realms.

00:10:17.403 --> 00:10:18.570 align:middle line:90%
And these artists knew this.

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:21.990 align:middle line:84%
And they're channeling, their
intuiting, these images.

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:23.730 align:middle line:84%
They're bringing these
energies through.

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:26.580 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's well
known in Florence

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:29.170 align:middle line:84%
where people will start swooning
in front of a Botticelli

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:29.970 align:middle line:90%
painting.

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:31.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I did.

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.700 align:middle line:84%
I had to sit down
the first time I

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.260 align:middle line:84%
encountered Botticelli in
the Uffizi 40 years ago

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:36.060 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:36.860 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:38.370 align:middle line:84%
There's a physiological
connection

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:40.350 align:middle line:84%
and a spiritual
connection that's made.

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:42.060 align:middle line:90%
And then you become the conduit.

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:44.280 align:middle line:84%
Information can now, through
quantum entanglement,

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:47.808 align:middle line:84%
be instantly transmitted
to you through that image.

00:10:47.808 --> 00:10:49.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I have to
say that's really

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:53.640 align:middle line:84%
what I love about your work
is you bring this iconography,

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:56.010 align:middle line:84%
but this incredible
beauty forward

00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:58.680 align:middle line:84%
because almost all of it
is stunningly beautiful.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.590 align:middle line:84%
It is so you're bathed
in the essence of beauty

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:03.337 align:middle line:90%
embedded with this knowledge.

00:11:03.337 --> 00:11:04.170 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Absolutely.

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:05.545 align:middle line:84%
And the highest
compliment I get,

00:11:05.545 --> 00:11:08.220 align:middle line:84%
I get emails all the time
from people that say thank you

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:10.170 align:middle line:90%
for giving me back that art.

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:11.280 align:middle line:90%
I saw it as a child.

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.930 align:middle line:90%
I was taught to be afraid of it.

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:14.697 align:middle line:84%
I knew there was
something to it.

00:11:14.697 --> 00:11:15.780 align:middle line:90%
And now I know what it is.

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:16.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:16.650 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:18.025 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go
to another one.

00:11:18.025 --> 00:11:21.870 align:middle line:84%
This is Mary while she's being
crowned as celestial queen,

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:23.765 align:middle line:90%
the robe of the stars.

00:11:23.765 --> 00:11:25.140 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
this a little.

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:25.940 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:29.250 align:middle line:84%
So the robe is a very important
symbol, not only in my work,

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:31.165 align:middle line:84%
but it's the focus
of all spiritual work

00:11:31.165 --> 00:11:32.040 align:middle line:90%
in the ancient world.

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.440 align:middle line:84%
The robe is the symbol
for our light body

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.340 align:middle line:90%
and for our transformation.

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And so in these images,
you'll see Mary wearing

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:40.320 align:middle line:90%
a robe covered with stars.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.547 align:middle line:84%
Like Isis used to
wear a robe and stars.

00:11:43.547 --> 00:11:44.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Cloaked in the cosmos.

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:45.570 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:46.530 align:middle line:90%
Cloaked in the cosmos.

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:48.960 align:middle line:84%
And it literally means she
has been now transformed

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.670 align:middle line:90%
into a light being.

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:54.540 align:middle line:84%
So Mary is an exemplar of
what we call transfiguration

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:57.120 align:middle line:84%
or metamorphosis from a
physical flesh and blood

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.580 align:middle line:84%
being into a celestial flesh
or a light being status.

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And now she has
completed that force.

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:04.830 align:middle line:84%
In fact, she's the first
Christian to ascend.

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:06.840 align:middle line:84%
So from a divine
feminine perspective,

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:13.110 align:middle line:84%
she's actually a way shower and
also a model for us to follow.

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:16.125 align:middle line:84%
The next one is
Francesca's painting

00:12:16.125 --> 00:12:19.360 align:middle line:84%
of Mary with the shell
with the pearl above her.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.160 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now this is where the
pearl starts coming back in.

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:23.580 align:middle line:84%
But now let's get
into the shell.

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:24.090 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:26.790 align:middle line:84%
So the shell has always been a
symbol of the divine feminine.

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:29.790 align:middle line:84%
And so what Francesca has
very cleverly done here

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:32.730 align:middle line:84%
is connected Mary to all
the previous traditions

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:34.200 align:middle line:90%
of the divine feminine.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.630 align:middle line:84%
And even John the Baptist
was part of this tradition

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:38.910 align:middle line:84%
as well, because he was
thought to have baptized Jesus

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:40.860 align:middle line:90%
with a silvery cockle shell.

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:44.250 align:middle line:84%
So it's connecting him with
those divine feminine energies.

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:46.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very subtle
but very powerful

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:50.670 align:middle line:84%
way for the artist to say,
OK, I'm connecting Mary not

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:52.320 align:middle line:84%
as an isolated being,
but rather she's

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.970 align:middle line:84%
part of a continuous
transmission

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:55.180 align:middle line:90%
of the divine feminine.

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:56.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And then the pearl.

00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:57.445 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: And then
the pearl being

00:12:57.445 --> 00:12:59.370 align:middle line:84%
a symbol of the soul
and, ultimately, Christ

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:01.540 align:middle line:90%
but also of Mary as well.

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:04.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so the
seashell was adapted early

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:05.910 align:middle line:90%
by early Christendom.

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:08.830 align:middle line:84%
That was used in baptisms
beyond just John the Baptist.

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:09.630 align:middle line:90%
Was this--

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:11.670 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Absolutely, absolutely.

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:14.560 align:middle line:84%
I can take you to the
Temple of Hathor at Dendera

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:17.220 align:middle line:84%
where one of the earliest
Christian churches is.

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.320 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see this
magnificent gateway

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:22.410 align:middle line:84%
with a shell with a
key of life in it.

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:24.870 align:middle line:84%
So they carried
that over and used

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:26.790 align:middle line:84%
that as a way of
saying we're part

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:28.840 align:middle line:84%
of this divine
feminine tradition.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:29.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Venus.

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:31.170 align:middle line:84%
Now where does
Venus come into it?

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:32.860 align:middle line:84%
Because now you put
it all together.

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:33.960 align:middle line:90%
We're going to have--

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:36.090 align:middle line:84%
we get to go to
Botticelli in a bit.

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:38.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm always excited
to rush right there.

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.290 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk
about the pearl also

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:41.580 align:middle line:90%
as representative of Venus.

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:42.380 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:45.810 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden
now we're coming up

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:47.970 align:middle line:84%
with these hidden
codes that the ancients

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:50.910 align:middle line:84%
had left in these
works of art connecting

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:53.040 align:middle line:84%
Mary with the divine
feminine and also

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.970 align:middle line:84%
now the pearl with Venus as the
ultimate symbol of the divine

00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:58.050 align:middle line:90%
feminine as well.

00:13:58.050 --> 00:13:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And isn't it interesting
now that we've just

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:01.530 align:middle line:84%
discovered life
on Venus as well,

00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:03.380 align:middle line:84%
or the possibility
of life on Venus?

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:04.978 align:middle line:90%
So it's very important.

00:14:04.978 --> 00:14:06.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very important.

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:07.590 align:middle line:84%
So now we look at
the birth of Venus.

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:08.882 align:middle line:90%
Now we get to go to Botticelli.

00:14:08.882 --> 00:14:09.750 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:10.550 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:12.730 align:middle line:84%
So Venus is emerging
from this shell.

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And so she's symbolic
of the soul emerging

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:19.003 align:middle line:90%
from its physical incarnation.

00:14:19.003 --> 00:14:20.670 align:middle line:84%
This is the purpose
of a lot of this art

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:23.220 align:middle line:84%
is to help us to
remember that we have

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:25.320 align:middle line:84%
this divine aspect
within ourself that's

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:28.680 align:middle line:84%
encased within this shell,
within our physical body.

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And part of the
job of the soul is

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:33.960 align:middle line:84%
to transmute the physical
body and to escape the shell

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.432 align:middle line:90%
and return to its source.

00:14:35.432 --> 00:14:37.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I have to
say a year and a half

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:38.910 align:middle line:84%
ago when we were doing
our Sardinia special.

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:39.710 align:middle line:90%
I took some time.

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:40.560 align:middle line:90%
We went to Florence.

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.268 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we went
back to the Uffizi

00:14:42.268 --> 00:14:45.450 align:middle line:84%
and I stood before
Venus here again.

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:49.410 align:middle line:84%
And when you see
it in person, it's

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:52.980 align:middle line:84%
important to understand
these are gold--

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:56.160 align:middle line:90%
gold-- threads, her hair.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.530 align:middle line:90%
Gold.

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.030 align:middle line:90%
The picture's illuminated.

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:01.440 align:middle line:10%
>>HENRY: Absolutely.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was so
refined, so beautiful.

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:04.170 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And the idea once
again-- and Botticelli

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:07.680 align:middle line:84%
was very well aware
of this, having

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.930 align:middle line:84%
been schooled by the
Medicis and Marsilio

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:13.950 align:middle line:84%
Ficino, their genius who
translated the ancient "Corpus

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:16.110 align:middle line:84%
Hermeticum" and knew
the power of symbolism

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:19.963 align:middle line:84%
and also especially using that
adage "as above, so below."

00:15:19.963 --> 00:15:22.380 align:middle line:84%
They believed that when you
were looking at that painting,

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:26.900 align:middle line:84%
you were actually enacting what
was going on in that image.

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:30.030 align:middle line:84%
So if you're looking at an
image of Jesus baptizing Mary

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:33.000 align:middle line:84%
or putting a crown on
Mary, a part of you,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.640 align:middle line:84%
physiologically, is responding
as if that is happening to you.

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And now the next step to
take is to actually go

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:43.380 align:middle line:84%
into deep meditation and
imagine, on all levels, what

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:44.833 align:middle line:90%
that experience would be like.

00:15:44.833 --> 00:15:47.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they make it
easy to do because it draws you

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:48.270 align:middle line:90%
in so deeply.

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:49.198 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:15:49.198 --> 00:15:51.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're just
throwing this up for me, OK?

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.910 align:middle line:84%
Another Botticelli, we're going
to look at "Primavera" here,

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:56.437 align:middle line:90%
which you say was in Cosimos'--

00:15:56.437 --> 00:15:57.770 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: --de' Medici's bedroom.

00:15:57.770 --> 00:15:58.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Bedroom.

00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.040 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Yeah, his
personal apartment.

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
in my bedroom.

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:02.100 align:middle line:84%
My friend Steven
Ross gave it to me

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:05.280 align:middle line:84%
when he downsized his
beautiful library.

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:07.320 align:middle line:84%
That was too large
and he gifted it

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.180 align:middle line:84%
to me, which knowing
I'm a Botticelli freak.

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:11.350 align:middle line:84%
But that's the first thing I see
when I wake up every morning.

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:12.150 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Beautiful.

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:13.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you--

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.062 align:middle line:84%
I asked you, and so
you can come back

00:16:15.062 --> 00:16:16.770 align:middle line:84%
on another show--
you're going to go look

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:19.590 align:middle line:84%
deeper into the
symbolism of "Primavera"

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:21.630 align:middle line:84%
here, because you look
at it and everyone

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:24.420 align:middle line:84%
has a feeling immediately
when you see this painting.

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.940 align:middle line:84%
Of course, with all of
the rights of spring

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:28.320 align:middle line:90%
and the pregnant maidens.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.930 align:middle line:84%
But who are these people
coming in, these male entities

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:32.593 align:middle line:84%
from the trees,
grabbing this woman?

00:16:32.593 --> 00:16:33.510 align:middle line:90%
What's this all about?

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:34.310 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah.

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:35.820 align:middle line:84%
Exactly, well,
again, she is going

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:37.590 align:middle line:90%
to be symbolic of the soul.

00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:39.690 align:middle line:84%
Because in the Venus
paintings, she's

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:41.500 align:middle line:90%
acquiring her cloak as well.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.800 align:middle line:84%
And this again a very
important aspect of this

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:46.620 align:middle line:84%
is that once we have attained
this higher dimensional

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:49.005 align:middle line:84%
knowledge, now we're
ready to put on our robe

00:16:49.005 --> 00:16:50.050 align:middle line:90%
or garment of light.

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:50.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:53.340 align:middle line:10%
And in this particular
one, the primary subject,

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:56.730 align:middle line:10%
the girl with the
shorter blond hair,

00:16:56.730 --> 00:17:02.160 align:middle line:10%
is cloaked in every symbol of
nature, flowers and leaves,

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.620 align:middle line:10%
very different in that sense.

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.160 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, you'll
come back to me.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk about
this privately.

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:07.310 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:10.530 align:middle line:84%
So also this has to do with the
composition and the development

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:13.319 align:middle line:90%
of what a Pearl is in itself.

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And I mean I love pearls because
of the refinement, softness,

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:20.250 align:middle line:90%
and luminosity.

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:21.885 align:middle line:84%
but let's talk
about it, the notion

00:17:21.885 --> 00:17:24.510 align:middle line:84%
of how the pearl, of course, is
formed and so forth physically.

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:27.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Yeah, I mean it
starts out as a bit of sand.

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And this substance called nacre
builds up layer after layer.

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon you
have this luminescent,

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:35.490 align:middle line:84%
this iridescent,
beautiful sphere.

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:38.310 align:middle line:84%
And so this is why it's a
perfect analogy for the soul

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:41.010 align:middle line:84%
because that's essentially
what the soul is

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:44.970 align:middle line:84%
is a speck of immortal
substance that comes into Earth.

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:46.920 align:middle line:90%
And it is challenged.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And it has to find its
way out of its shell.

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately the
goal is to attain

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:55.090 align:middle line:84%
this luminescent or iridescent
light body, shimmering just

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:55.890 align:middle line:90%
like the pearl.

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:57.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:57.800 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:01.890 align:middle line:84%
So this is another
historical piece.

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:04.330 align:middle line:84%
I had read of this in
a couple of places,

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:08.160 align:middle line:84%
but you talk about the notion
that some of the ancients

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:11.340 align:middle line:84%
were buried with
pearls in their mouths.

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:12.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:13.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What was
this symbolically

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.283 align:middle line:90%
to have helped them accomplish?

00:18:16.283 --> 00:18:17.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well,
part of the idea is

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:19.830 align:middle line:84%
that the pearl is the
symbol for eternity

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:26.430 align:middle line:84%
and, especially, that the pearl
holds the memory of that life.

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:29.370 align:middle line:84%
So what they're trying to
tell us is that that pearl is

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:32.160 align:middle line:84%
ultimately-- like my
necklace or your necklace,

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.310 align:middle line:84%
it's capable of holding
the memories of the soul

00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:37.802 align:middle line:84%
and that it can be
later reactivated.

00:18:37.802 --> 00:18:38.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Is that true?

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:40.302 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: I think
it's quite possible.

00:18:40.302 --> 00:18:42.511 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm going to start
wearing my pearls again.

00:18:42.511 --> 00:18:44.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, they were my mom's
but she never wore them.

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:46.200 align:middle line:90%
When she died, I got them.

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: I mean the Buddhists
talk about relics that

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:49.917 align:middle line:90%
the Lamas leave behind--

00:18:49.917 --> 00:18:50.875 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: These pearls.

00:18:50.875 --> 00:18:52.292 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: --that
the body literally

00:18:52.292 --> 00:18:53.430 align:middle line:90%
dissolves into a pearl.

00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:54.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:59.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Or when they cremate a
monk, a high-functioning monk,

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:01.560 align:middle line:84%
that they will leave
pearls in the ashes.

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:03.720 align:middle line:84%
And they actually go
seeking these pearls.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.498 align:middle line:84%
And studies have
been done on these.

00:19:05.498 --> 00:19:06.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, they have.

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:07.370 align:middle line:90%
I've seen some.

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:08.170 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:12.600 align:middle line:84%
William Tiller and others have
studied the energetic qualities

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:16.950 align:middle line:84%
of these pearls which are
literal, physical substances

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:19.510 align:middle line:84%
that are manufactured by
the human body left behind.

00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:20.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:22.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: And that they
emit high frequency

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:24.930 align:middle line:84%
love and consciousness,
but even hold

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:26.220 align:middle line:90%
all the knowledge and wisdom.

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:28.178 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I found it
disconcerting when I first

00:19:28.178 --> 00:19:30.120 align:middle line:90%
saw them in an exhibition.

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.110 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah.

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:32.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But, yeah.

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:33.210 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah, at first you are.

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:34.380 align:middle line:84%
You're like, wow,
that's really strange.

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:34.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Kind of creepy.

00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:36.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Yeah, it
is kind of creepy,

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:37.920 align:middle line:84%
because we don't
think in these terms.

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.090 align:middle line:90%
We don't think of--

00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:41.340 align:middle line:84%
we know our body
changes as we age,

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:43.480 align:middle line:84%
but we don't think about
its ultimate evolution.

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:45.900 align:middle line:84%
We don't think about, well,
what was our body actually

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:47.400 align:middle line:90%
designed to do.

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.900 align:middle line:84%
And from a metaphysical
perspective,

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:52.230 align:middle line:84%
it was designed to be
dissolved into a body of light.

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:54.270 align:middle line:84%
And along the way, it
can produce substances

00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:57.690 align:middle line:84%
like pearls and other things
that can be left behind.

00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:01.740 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, the
spiritual purpose of the body

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:05.280 align:middle line:84%
is as a vehicle for the
ascension of the soul.

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I believe
our body has been tinkered

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:10.650 align:middle line:84%
with genetically speaking
by various avatars

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:12.400 align:middle line:90%
throughout the ages.

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:13.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.575 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
get into tinkering

00:20:14.575 --> 00:20:16.200 align:middle line:84%
a little later on
in our conversation

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:18.270 align:middle line:84%
here, but not
necessarily avatars.

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:19.700 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:20.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:21.913 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:21.913 --> 00:20:23.580 align:middle line:84%
Just to look at this
one, Adam and Eve's

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:25.380 align:middle line:84%
eviction from the
Garden of Eden.

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:28.170 align:middle line:84%
So this is following
on from what

00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:30.270 align:middle line:84%
we had understood early
on that we were looking

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:32.220 align:middle line:90%
for this refinement in life.

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:38.455 align:middle line:84%
And now we're being viewed
as sinners, not worthy

00:20:38.455 --> 00:20:39.255 align:middle line:90%
of entrance.

00:20:39.255 --> 00:20:40.290 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Um-hmm.

00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:43.170 align:middle line:84%
This is the key
metaphysical fact

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:44.910 align:middle line:84%
that all the Gnostics
believed that we've

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:46.740 align:middle line:90%
sort of forgotten today.

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And that is that when
Adam and Eve originally

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:51.210 align:middle line:84%
dwelled in Eden,
which they believe

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:53.280 align:middle line:84%
was a place of pure
light and pure love,

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.530 align:middle line:84%
we were not in physical
flesh and blood bodies.

00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:59.490 align:middle line:84%
We were in energetic,
light bodies.

00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:01.510 align:middle line:84%
They used the word
"perfect light bodies."

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:03.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In a different
dimension, essentially.

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:04.802 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: A different dimension.

00:21:04.802 --> 00:21:07.350 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, exactly, the third heaven
is where they technically

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:07.800 align:middle line:90%
say it was.

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:09.092 align:middle line:90%
So it probably wasn't on Earth.

00:21:09.092 --> 00:21:13.620 align:middle line:84%
But then after the fall and
this eviction from Eden,

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:16.050 align:middle line:84%
the Book of Genesis says
that God does two things.

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:18.240 align:middle line:84%
He builds a gate at
the East of Eden,

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:21.210 align:middle line:84%
puts a flashing, flaming sword
in the middle of that gate

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:23.220 align:middle line:90%
and forbids humanity to return.

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:25.890 align:middle line:90%
And he gives us coats of skin.

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:27.930 align:middle line:84%
Traditional Bible people
will tell you, yeah,

00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:29.870 align:middle line:84%
that's probably some
kind of lambskin,

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:31.870 align:middle line:84%
or it might have been a
bear skin, or something.

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:33.000 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.270 align:middle line:84%
The Gnostics believed that
it was these coats of skin.

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:38.880 align:middle line:84%
This is when we got our
flesh and blood bodies.

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And since then, all
of human history

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:45.540 align:middle line:84%
has been a quest to return to
our original, perfect light

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:46.530 align:middle line:90%
bodies.

00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:48.870 align:middle line:84%
So everything we do,
metaphysically speaking,

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:51.630 align:middle line:84%
is an answer to
that original call.

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:54.090 align:middle line:84%
This is why Jesus came down,
according to the Gnostics,

00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:57.090 align:middle line:84%
to show us how to
transmute our body

00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:59.700 align:middle line:84%
and to return to our original,
perfect light bodies.

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:01.620 align:middle line:84%
The whole Essene
mystic tradition

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:02.910 align:middle line:90%
was based on this idea.

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:05.040 align:middle line:90%
All of Gnosticism, the Cathars.

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:08.340 align:middle line:84%
I did a series on Gaia called
"Ascension Keepers" which

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:10.860 align:middle line:84%
goes into detail about what
the Essenes and the Cathars

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:12.150 align:middle line:90%
believed about this.

00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's foundational, but
we have forgotten this.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.740 align:middle line:90%
But now we're remembering it.

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:19.800 align:middle line:84%
There's so many people
talking about ascension today,

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.340 align:middle line:90%
light body teachings.

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And this is all a reflection
of this ancient belief.

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:26.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And for
me, it's something

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:34.360 align:middle line:84%
so direct to remember and find
your way there through whatever

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:37.510 align:middle line:84%
means of connection
with the higher

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:40.380 align:middle line:84%
aspect of self, which is in
connection with the highest

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:41.180 align:middle line:90%
aspect.

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And the heremetics have
their own language for it,

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:47.110 align:middle line:84%
connection with higher mind,
which is the part of the soul

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:48.850 align:middle line:90%
complex with soul.

00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:51.970 align:middle line:84%
And that journey,
to me, there isn't

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:55.490 align:middle line:90%
anything above that journey.

00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:56.290 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: No.

00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:57.420 align:middle line:90%
No, this is all that is.

00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:59.712 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's the highest
priority there is as a human

00:22:59.712 --> 00:23:03.090 align:middle line:84%
being is to remember, remember,
remember how to get back

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:06.420 align:middle line:84%
in touch with that sublime
aspect of self that

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:08.450 align:middle line:84%
doesn't lie, that
cannot be conned.

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:09.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right, exactly.

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:12.420 align:middle line:84%
Our interdimensional self,
they call it our perfect self.

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:14.650 align:middle line:84%
Some people don't like
that in our culture.

00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:18.060 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's perfect, blah, blah,
blah, we hear that growing up.

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:20.485 align:middle line:84%
But another word for
perfect is to be more whole.

00:23:20.485 --> 00:23:21.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: More whole.

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:23.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: More holy
and compassionate.

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:25.048 align:middle line:84%
And so what I teach
people is that, well,

00:23:25.048 --> 00:23:26.590 align:middle line:84%
if you don't like
the word "perfect,"

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:27.840 align:middle line:90%
use the word "more whole."

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.330 align:middle line:84%
And our quest, then,
is to move the needle

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:33.090 align:middle line:90%
towards becoming more whole.

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:35.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's also
a connection with all,

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:36.928 align:middle line:84%
so it has a greater
sense of truth to it.

00:23:36.928 --> 00:23:37.728 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:23:37.728 --> 00:23:39.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know that
cannot be manipulated.

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:40.260 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:42.718 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And right now, which
we'll talk about in a moment

00:23:42.718 --> 00:23:47.420 align:middle line:84%
we're in such an extreme
place of manipulation,

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:49.980 align:middle line:84%
being manipulated and
manipulating others even

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:50.880 align:middle line:90%
subconsciously.

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:51.930 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:54.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the only
an antidote to this

00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:57.960 align:middle line:84%
is to be able to go into
connection with the higher

00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:01.710 align:middle line:84%
self with your sense of truth
that's connected to the higher

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:02.700 align:middle line:90%
truth and all truth.

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:04.410 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Absolutely, absolutely.

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:06.480 align:middle line:84%
Because this incarnation
is just one among many

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:08.730 align:middle line:84%
that you had but
every incarnation,

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:10.230 align:middle line:90%
its goal has been the same--

00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:12.240 align:middle line:84%
to return to that
perfect light body.

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:14.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So in your
own interpretation,

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:17.250 align:middle line:84%
from all of the texts, the
artwork, reading, practice,

00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:20.920 align:middle line:84%
that you've done, what did
the fall actually entail?

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:21.720 align:middle line:90%
The fall.

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, to be
fallen to me simply

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.260 align:middle line:84%
means to be in a
flesh and blood body.

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:26.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean when we talk
about fallen angels,

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:28.862 align:middle line:84%
we want to think of them
as somehow evil or dark.

00:24:28.862 --> 00:24:30.613 align:middle line:84%
But really "fallen"
just means they

00:24:30.613 --> 00:24:32.280 align:middle line:84%
were in their perfect
light bodies, too.

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:34.320 align:middle line:84%
They came from the throne
of God, these angels.

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:36.303 align:middle line:84%
And when they fell,
they were no longer

00:24:36.303 --> 00:24:37.470 align:middle line:90%
in their perfect light body.

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:39.400 align:middle line:84%
Now they were in flesh
and blood bodies.

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:40.950 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Greek
word that they

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:44.430 align:middle line:84%
used to describe the bodies
of the so-called fallen angels

00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:46.680 align:middle line:84%
when they were at the
throne is [GREEK]..

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:49.110 align:middle line:84%
That word is used only one
other time in the Bible

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:52.040 align:middle line:84%
and it's used to describe the
resurrection body of Christ.

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:53.790 align:middle line:84%
So what that means is
that the angels were

00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:55.770 align:middle line:84%
in their resurrected
light bodies

00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:57.930 align:middle line:90%
originally then they fell.

00:24:57.930 --> 00:25:00.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, they're in their
physical bodies.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, they can come
down here and they

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:03.750 align:middle line:84%
can have relations
with men or women,

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:05.430 align:middle line:84%
do all the things
that the angels did

00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:07.680 align:middle line:84%
that turned off the
church and turned them

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.450 align:middle line:90%
into these evil characters.

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:12.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So do you think
that fall, the descent

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:15.870 align:middle line:84%
or the merging with
flesh, as I call it,

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:18.722 align:middle line:90%
was some kind of curse?

00:25:18.722 --> 00:25:20.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: I don't know if
it was a curse or not.

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:21.597 align:middle line:90%
It feels like a curse.

00:25:21.597 --> 00:25:23.805 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I ask for a reason,
because a lot of people

00:25:23.805 --> 00:25:24.605 align:middle line:90%
say that now.

00:25:24.605 --> 00:25:26.605 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are really
feeling it right now.

00:25:26.605 --> 00:25:27.820 align:middle line:90%
Like, what am I doing here?

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:29.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm never coming
back once I get out.

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:31.110 align:middle line:90%
I don't see it that way.

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:33.152 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: We don't know
what the original, really,

00:25:33.152 --> 00:25:34.000 align:middle line:90%
enticement was.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.875 align:middle line:84%
In a way, that's kind
of missing information.

00:25:35.875 --> 00:25:37.950 align:middle line:10%
Like as we'll
discuss in a moment,

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:40.890 align:middle line:10%
we have children now
that are being coaxed

00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:43.208 align:middle line:10%
into a simulated reality
where they're saying,

00:25:43.208 --> 00:25:45.750 align:middle line:10%
eh, I don't really want one of
those physical flesh and blood

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:48.167 align:middle line:10%
bodies, why don't you just get
one of these cartoon bodies

00:25:48.167 --> 00:25:49.930 align:middle line:10%
that's even better
than what you got now.

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:53.880 align:middle line:84%
And so maybe that's what
happened originally long ago

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:58.320 align:middle line:84%
is that a group of souls decided
to fall from the pure place

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:01.530 align:middle line:84%
and came into this
realm, this dimension.

00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:04.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I do
lectures on this other story.

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:06.930 align:middle line:84%
I don't if you're
aware of it, but it's

00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:09.900 align:middle line:84%
an alternate story that
was shared with me about 40

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:15.060 align:middle line:84%
years ago of what happened to
create this hybridized species.

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually
kind of a sad story.

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:22.290 align:middle line:90%
It's also a magnificent story.

00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:27.062 align:middle line:84%
But essentially, that
higher dimensional beings--

00:26:27.062 --> 00:26:29.520 align:middle line:84%
those beings don't even like
that term "higher and lower--"

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.770 align:middle line:84%
other dimensional beings
that had capacities

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:34.620 align:middle line:84%
to be able to
literally, light bodies,

00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:37.470 align:middle line:84%
create at the speed of
light, vast intelligence,

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:40.470 align:middle line:84%
vast access to all
knowledge, were simply

00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:42.210 align:middle line:84%
watching the Earth
in development

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:45.240 align:middle line:84%
as it was physically forming and
all of the various life forms

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.550 align:middle line:84%
were forming and were
really just touching in

00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:50.620 align:middle line:84%
to play with it and experience
what this dimension felt like.

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:51.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:54.317 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then ultimately
it became more and more complex,

00:26:54.317 --> 00:26:56.400 align:middle line:84%
as the beings that were
created were more complex,

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:59.980 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately something similar
to ourselves in this story--

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:02.130 align:middle line:84%
which I have a very
strong affinity with,

00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:05.490 align:middle line:84%
I feel strongly that
there's truth in it--

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:07.950 align:middle line:84%
this being that we
are now, essentially,

00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:11.070 align:middle line:84%
had been created, but was
still in the animal realm

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:15.150 align:middle line:84%
and did not possess this kind
of essence of truth and beauty

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:17.580 align:middle line:84%
and so forth that we see
and acknowledge today.

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And they said, you
don't understand.

00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:21.535 align:middle line:84%
What happened when those
two merged together

00:27:21.535 --> 00:27:23.910 align:middle line:84%
and there was a reason for
it, when they merged together,

00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:28.620 align:middle line:84%
you became this fractured,
incredibly unique species

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:31.770 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't exist elsewhere
because it was actually

00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:34.330 align:middle line:90%
just an inadvertent experiment.

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:35.940 align:middle line:90%
And nobody cast anyone anywhere.

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:37.860 align:middle line:90%
No one forced anyone anywhere.

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:39.060 align:middle line:90%
It happened.

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And now you have this
perpetual disconnect,

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:43.860 align:middle line:84%
because you can't
remember how to get back

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:47.440 align:middle line:84%
to that other part which
creates all this pain.

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:48.240 align:middle line:90%
No memory.

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: We found
ourselves in this box

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:50.580 align:middle line:84%
and now we can't
find the way out.

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:51.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:54.090 align:middle line:84%
So everything
you're talking about

00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:57.210 align:middle line:84%
is in service to helping
people find their way back

00:27:57.210 --> 00:27:59.010 align:middle line:90%
to that part of aspect of self.

00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:00.120 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right, exactly.

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:02.755 align:middle line:84%
So like in the context
of our conversation,

00:28:02.755 --> 00:28:05.130 align:middle line:84%
if you're not aware that you
have this inner divine self,

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:06.790 align:middle line:90%
the pearl, now you know.

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And now you know that you
also have the capability

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:10.700 align:middle line:90%
of manifesting your light body.

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:12.400 align:middle line:84%
And that that ultimately
is the way out.

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.670 align:middle line:84%
That's not William Henry,
that's the Dalai Lama.

00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:15.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's the Dalai Lama.

00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:16.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: That's what he
would tell you, right?

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:17.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:17.930 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:20.800 align:middle line:84%
The role of John the
Baptist, I was going to say,

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:23.040 align:middle line:84%
John the Baptist is not
really well understood

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:24.220 align:middle line:90%
by a lot of people.

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And you have certain artwork,
such as the chariot and Elijah

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:29.010 align:middle line:90%
and such.

00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:32.430 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the role
that John the Baptist played

00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:34.110 align:middle line:84%
and the thoughts
that maybe this was

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:35.790 align:middle line:90%
the reincarnation of Elijah.

00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:36.692 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:28:36.692 --> 00:28:38.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is an
important character.

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:39.483 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Hugely important.

00:28:39.483 --> 00:28:40.920 align:middle line:90%
He is Jesus's cousin.

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.120 align:middle line:90%
He's his initiator.

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:43.470 align:middle line:90%
He's an Essene mystic.

00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:44.500 align:middle line:90%
He's highly regarded.

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:46.740 align:middle line:84%
Some people think
he's the Messiah.

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:48.480 align:middle line:84%
Jesus comes along
and says, well,

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:51.467 align:middle line:84%
I'm kind of like this
hillbilly from Nazareth.

00:28:51.467 --> 00:28:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And then I get a hold of
this John the Baptist guy

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:56.400 align:middle line:84%
and now they're calling me the
Christ, because he baptized me.

00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:00.270 align:middle line:84%
He transmitted a holy vibration
called the Holy Spirit to me

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:03.150 align:middle line:90%
and activated my capabilities.

00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:04.920 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing
Jesus does after that

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:07.920 align:middle line:84%
is he takes several disciples
up to the top of a mountain

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:10.800 align:middle line:84%
and turns himself
into a being of light.

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And this is demonstrating
the natural capability

00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:14.430 align:middle line:90%
of all of us.

00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And this was really
John's doing.

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:19.560 align:middle line:84%
There's John the Baptist,
who Jesus identified

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:23.280 align:middle line:84%
as the reincarnation
of Elijah as the person

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:24.990 align:middle line:90%
that we really want to look to.

00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And the key thing in
our conversation--

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.620 align:middle line:84%
we've been talking
about this robe--

00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:30.960 align:middle line:84%
and in the ascension
of Elijah as he's

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:32.880 align:middle line:84%
going up into the
heavens in his chariots

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:37.200 align:middle line:84%
of the gods, his whirlwind,
he transmits his holy cloak

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.120 align:middle line:84%
or garment that he used
to perform miracles

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:40.638 align:middle line:90%
to his priest Elisha.

00:29:40.638 --> 00:29:42.180 align:middle line:84%
Now the question
then becomes is that

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:45.120 align:middle line:84%
a literal, physical garment
that is transmitted or is it

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:46.290 align:middle line:90%
a vibration?

00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:47.280 align:middle line:90%
Is it a teaching?

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:48.630 align:middle line:90%
Is it an activation?

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:50.440 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's all of those things.

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:53.700 align:middle line:84%
But the point is that in
early Christian belief

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:56.040 align:middle line:84%
and certainly Jewish mystical
belief, the first thing

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:57.443 align:middle line:84%
that John the
Baptist did when he

00:29:57.443 --> 00:29:59.610 align:middle line:84%
gained awareness is he went
out into the wilderness,

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:02.490 align:middle line:84%
and reclaimed that cloak
and put it back on,

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:04.800 align:middle line:84%
and then transmitted
it to his cousin Jesus.

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:07.710 align:middle line:84%
So this is telling us this
is a transmittable teaching

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:08.690 align:middle line:90%
or vibration.

00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:11.640 align:middle line:84%
It's something we can tap
into today through that art.

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:13.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
speaking of which,

00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:14.850 align:middle line:90%
I was telling you earlier--

00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:16.530 align:middle line:84%
we were talking off
camera about this--

00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:18.905 align:middle line:84%
when I went to Jerusalem--
and I've said this in a couple

00:30:18.905 --> 00:30:20.610 align:middle line:90%
of shows over the years--

00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:22.272 align:middle line:90%
I ended up in Ein Karem.

00:30:22.272 --> 00:30:23.730 align:middle line:84%
I was looking,
because that's where

00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:26.520 align:middle line:84%
the monastery-- the whole town
is devoted to John the Baptist

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:28.260 align:middle line:84%
because they say that
is where he went.

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:30.340 align:middle line:90%
That's where he did his work.

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's what his baptismal
well was and so forth.

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:34.660 align:middle line:84%
And if you look
at it today, it's

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:36.600 align:middle line:84%
a 10-minute car
ride out of town.

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:38.850 align:middle line:84%
Real wilderness if
you're on a donkey,

00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:40.270 align:middle line:90%
takes a long time to get there.

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:41.510 align:middle line:90%
That's the wilderness, right?

00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:42.310 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:45.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so near
the baptismal well,

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.950 align:middle line:84%
which is all now
inside a monastery--

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:49.860 align:middle line:84%
so you have to get past
the gatekeepers-- is also

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:51.540 align:middle line:84%
a cave above it
where he was said

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:53.250 align:middle line:84%
to have done his
visioning, because he

00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:56.040 align:middle line:90%
was a visionary obviously.

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:59.400 align:middle line:84%
And the remnants of that
energy are so powerful today,

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:00.720 align:middle line:90%
it blows your mind.

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.610 align:middle line:90%
It will take you places.

00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:03.540 align:middle line:90%
So it's imbued.

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:04.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: It's imbued.

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:05.130 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
things the mystics

00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:08.790 align:middle line:84%
talked about the baptism
is that when John brought

00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:11.000 align:middle line:84%
that Holy Spirit
energy in it, it

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.628 align:middle line:84%
was diffused into all
the waters of the earth.

00:31:13.628 --> 00:31:16.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and the stones,
and the cave, and everything.

00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:16.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Everything.

00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:17.637 align:middle line:90%
And you can feel it.

00:31:17.637 --> 00:31:18.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Powerful entity.

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:19.510 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Very powerful.

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:21.302 align:middle line:84%
That's why you go to
these sacred places is

00:31:21.302 --> 00:31:23.400 align:middle line:90%
to experience that connection.

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:27.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and so
when he baptized Jesus,

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:32.160 align:middle line:84%
the point was this was symbolic
of wakening higher abilities.

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And the ones I took off of
your film that you talked about

00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:42.030 align:middle line:84%
were authority, capacity, power,
genuine strength, all of which

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:43.030 align:middle line:90%
we've given away.

00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:44.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Absolutely, absolutely.

00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:45.840 align:middle line:90%
This is the message of John.

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:48.540 align:middle line:84%
It's like I'm going to
transmit this vibration to you.

00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:50.910 align:middle line:84%
They called it exousia,
the Holy Spirit,

00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:52.440 align:middle line:90%
symbolized by this robe.

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And it represents spiritual
capacity, strength, liberty,

00:31:57.540 --> 00:31:59.880 align:middle line:84%
self-direction, all
of those things.

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:02.790 align:middle line:84%
Everything that is now
being taken away from us.

00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:05.132 align:middle line:84%
And so I teach people
that the antidote

00:32:05.132 --> 00:32:06.840 align:middle line:84%
to what's going on in
our world right now

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:10.410 align:middle line:84%
is to reclaim that vibration
of the Holy Spirit.

00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:12.720 align:middle line:84%
If you don't like Holy
Spirit, call it Kundalini,

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:13.600 align:middle line:90%
use another term.

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:16.313 align:middle line:84%
But we've got to reach
out beyond this 3D realm

00:32:16.313 --> 00:32:17.730 align:middle line:84%
into the higher
dimensional realms

00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:20.670 align:middle line:84%
and bring in this vibration,
as well as this intelligence

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:22.260 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness
that goes with it.

00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:23.250 align:middle line:90%
That's the antidote.

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:26.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It requires
such incredible will now.

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:29.280 align:middle line:84%
Before in times when there
wasn't as much resistance,

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:32.160 align:middle line:84%
it didn't require the
same amount of will

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:34.290 align:middle line:84%
to move into those
higher states.

00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:35.640 align:middle line:90%
It requires a lot of will.

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:39.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean right now, these shadowy,
whatever shadowy forces--

00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:41.310 align:middle line:84%
I'll say this as
some background.

00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:43.990 align:middle line:84%
I recently
interviewed Lee Harris

00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:46.380 align:middle line:84%
and he channeled
disease, the entities.

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:48.540 align:middle line:84%
And I did that on my
own site ReginaMeredith.

00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking about
these times and the dimension

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:53.700 align:middle line:90%
of what's happening.

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And they said, just be
aware that these changes--

00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:00.232 align:middle line:84%
which are the greatest
changes in thousands of years

00:33:00.232 --> 00:33:01.440 align:middle line:90%
that are about to take place.

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:02.700 align:middle line:90%
They haven't really started.

00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:04.860 align:middle line:84%
We're just getting
ramped up for them,

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:08.460 align:middle line:84%
which will take our full
aware participation--

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:11.650 align:middle line:84%
are being worked
with, shall we say,

00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:14.460 align:middle line:84%
not just by humans who
have ego and greed,

00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:15.900 align:middle line:90%
but really by other--

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:18.180 align:middle line:90%
they said dark cosmic forces.

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And many people who
speak about this time

00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:22.080 align:middle line:90%
talk about darker forces.

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:23.220 align:middle line:90%
But this isn't a joke.

00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:24.240 align:middle line:90%
This isn't New Age.

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.037 align:middle line:84%
It's not to be
lightly dismissed.

00:33:26.037 --> 00:33:27.870 align:middle line:84%
I want you to go ahead
and take off on this.

00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:28.110 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah.

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:29.777 align:middle line:84%
No, I totally agree
with that that there

00:33:29.777 --> 00:33:33.650 align:middle line:84%
is a force that is using,
especially technology, that's

00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:36.320 align:middle line:84%
how they're manifesting
it-- to transform

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:39.470 align:middle line:84%
the human body into
a dehumanized version

00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:43.100 align:middle line:84%
of ourselves, more
robotic, synthetic, fake.

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And everything that
this movement stands for

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:49.190 align:middle line:90%
is ultimately about fake power.

00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:52.700 align:middle line:84%
And those of a spiritual
persuasion or recognize

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:56.520 align:middle line:84%
their spiritual selves, now is
the time to stand up to this.

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:59.720 align:middle line:84%
We've got to put on our cloak
of light and show others

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:01.110 align:middle line:90%
the way to do that as well.

00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:03.290 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, the human
race probably has,

00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:06.988 align:middle line:84%
I would give it less
than five years.

00:34:06.988 --> 00:34:08.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Five years till what?

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:10.199 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Five years
till the singularity,

00:34:10.199 --> 00:34:14.670 align:middle line:84%
till our merger with AI, until
there is no longer free will.

00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:16.770 align:middle line:84%
Because these people--
you have to understand--

00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:18.840 align:middle line:84%
many of these engineers
that are designing

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:21.989 align:middle line:84%
these algorithms and this
technology, they're atheists.

00:34:21.989 --> 00:34:22.800 align:middle line:90%
They're soulless.

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:23.760 align:middle line:90%
And they're godless.

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.050 align:middle line:84%
And they want you
to be the same way.

00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:25.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is true.

00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:27.389 align:middle line:84%
I remember a site
that used to exist

00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:28.889 align:middle line:84%
and has been taken
down when I first

00:34:28.889 --> 00:34:32.100 align:middle line:84%
started checking out AI called
intelligence.org, I think.

00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:33.120 align:middle line:90%
Gone.

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:34.409 align:middle line:90%
I looked at all the designers.

00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:35.855 align:middle line:90%
And atheist, atheist, atheist.

00:34:35.855 --> 00:34:36.730 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: All of them.

00:34:36.730 --> 00:34:38.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So of
course, what are you

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:40.110 align:middle line:84%
going to want to do
to extend your life?

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:41.068 align:middle line:90%
It has to be synthetic.

00:34:41.068 --> 00:34:41.868 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:34:41.868 --> 00:34:44.250 align:middle line:84%
They're materials, which
means they believe you're just

00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:46.620 align:middle line:90%
information, you're just data.

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:49.710 align:middle line:84%
Your DNA can be cut,
copied, pasted, edited.

00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:51.120 align:middle line:90%
You have no soul.

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:54.090 align:middle line:84%
It's just the pictures
that you put on Facebook

00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:56.130 align:middle line:84%
and all your keystrokes
recorded by the NSA,

00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:57.450 align:middle line:90%
that is your soul to them.

00:34:57.450 --> 00:34:58.860 align:middle line:90%
They don't believe in a soul.

00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:02.250 align:middle line:84%
And so they're
clearly coming from--

00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:04.830 align:middle line:84%
the Gnostics would call
it the Archonic tradition,

00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:07.290 align:middle line:84%
where they're creating a
simulated reality in order

00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:09.180 align:middle line:84%
to trick us into
giving away our souls.

00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we
are doing right now.

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:12.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We are.

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:13.460 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:14.430 align:middle line:90%
So we have a time.

00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:18.690 align:middle line:84%
We have a great deal of
things going on right now.

00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:21.310 align:middle line:84%
Because of current world
events, we're socially isolated.

00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:22.110 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:22.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Kids aren't in school.

00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:23.813 align:middle line:90%
They're not playing.

00:35:23.813 --> 00:35:25.770 align:middle line:84%
They're not playing
with their friends.

00:35:25.770 --> 00:35:26.850 align:middle line:90%
Nobody is really playing.

00:35:26.850 --> 00:35:29.580 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of a dour period
of time for the most part.

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:30.413 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:35:30.413 --> 00:35:31.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have
people that are

00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:33.960 align:middle line:84%
hanging on to every
kind of social media

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:35.890 align:middle line:90%
as a means of connection.

00:35:35.890 --> 00:35:38.843 align:middle line:84%
So another thing
that we've talked

00:35:38.843 --> 00:35:41.010 align:middle line:84%
about, I've talked with a
few people about, actually

00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:44.310 align:middle line:84%
is I watched the film
"Social Dilemma,"

00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:47.850 align:middle line:84%
which is some of the creators
of a lot of the algorithms

00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:50.980 align:middle line:84%
and such on Facebook,
Instagram, Twitter,

00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:53.280 align:middle line:90%
Google who have all left.

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:57.090 align:middle line:84%
This red alert, red flag,
red flag, something bad's

00:35:57.090 --> 00:35:57.890 align:middle line:90%
happening here.

00:35:57.890 --> 00:35:59.015 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Something immoral.

00:35:59.015 --> 00:36:01.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Something
immoral is happening here.

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:02.353 align:middle line:90%
And they're very clear about it.

00:36:02.353 --> 00:36:05.490 align:middle line:84%
And the key character
in this film--

00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:09.570 align:middle line:84%
which is very well done,
and I'll mention why--

00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:12.000 align:middle line:90%
is the ethicist for Facebook.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.150 align:middle line:84%
Now who would have ever thought
such a position existed?

00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:18.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: It's like the
Nazi compassion advisor.

00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:19.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.635 align:middle line:90%
Well, that was his position.

00:36:21.635 --> 00:36:23.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, he's not
with them anymore.

00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:26.020 align:middle line:84%
He's like this is not
ethical what is going on.

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:29.760 align:middle line:84%
But they do a wonderful
job of detailing

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:33.690 align:middle line:84%
through kind of a family
they create of actors,

00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:36.690 align:middle line:84%
a family and their interface
with technologies, particularly

00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:39.180 align:middle line:84%
social media, how each member
of the family is reacting,

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:41.160 align:middle line:90%
particularly the teenage boy.

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And I won't give
anything more away

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:44.730 align:middle line:84%
because I think everyone
owes it to themselves

00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:48.810 align:middle line:84%
to watch how these
algorithms work us.

00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:51.210 align:middle line:90%
And they are so sophisticated.

00:36:51.210 --> 00:36:53.070 align:middle line:90%
And we're all dupes.

00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:57.300 align:middle line:84%
If we spend any time on our
phones, iPads, computers,

00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:01.590 align:middle line:84%
cruising, we're all being duped,
to an extent where we really

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:03.150 align:middle line:90%
don't have our own minds now.

00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:06.210 align:middle line:84%
Now I bring it up because
you said five years till we

00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:09.290 align:middle line:84%
have no more free will, that's
the track it's putting us on.

00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:10.090 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:37:10.090 --> 00:37:10.440 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:11.898 align:middle line:84%
And I say five
years because that's

00:37:11.898 --> 00:37:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Elon Musk, that's when
we've got to merge

00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:17.520 align:middle line:84%
with AI or AI is going to vastly
supersede us in intelligence.

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.578 align:middle line:84%
And that they call that
the singularity when

00:37:19.578 --> 00:37:21.120 align:middle line:84%
these machines become
smarter than we

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:22.350 align:middle line:84%
are and they don't
need us anymore.

00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:23.280 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And this is also when the
simulated realities kick in

00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:26.350 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:37:26.350 --> 00:37:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And this is what they're
ultimately trying to do.

00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:30.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk some more
about that because what guy is

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:31.350 align:middle line:90%
going to resist--

00:37:31.350 --> 00:37:33.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, movies have been
made about it, right?

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:36.180 align:middle line:84%
What man that has
access to technology

00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:38.630 align:middle line:84%
is going to resist
his simulation friend?

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:39.630 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right, exactly.

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:40.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really.

00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:41.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: I know, I
know, yeah right.

00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
they're trying to do

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.990 align:middle line:84%
is coax us out of our physical
flesh and blood bodies

00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:48.990 align:middle line:84%
into our fake avatar
bodies, the cartoon bodies.

00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:51.610 align:middle line:84%
Facebook's promoting
this, Google, everybody,

00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:52.410 align:middle line:90%
corporations.

00:37:52.410 --> 00:37:54.870 align:middle line:90%
Samsung is deep into this now.

00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:56.130 align:middle line:90%
Neon, they've created a new--

00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:56.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What is it?

00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:57.060 align:middle line:90%
Explain it.

00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:58.350 align:middle line:84%
I don't know
Samsung's technology.

00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:00.308 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: What they're
doing is they're creating

00:38:00.308 --> 00:38:02.190 align:middle line:90%
these synthetic beings.

00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:04.560 align:middle line:84%
You can't tell the difference
between a physical flesh

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:08.850 align:middle line:84%
and blood being and a synthetic
being created with GCI.

00:38:08.850 --> 00:38:11.730 align:middle line:90%
Miquela is a singer.

00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:14.533 align:middle line:84%
She has millions of
followers on Instagram.

00:38:14.533 --> 00:38:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And most of the people
that follower her

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:17.617 align:middle line:84%
don't know that
she doesn't exist.

00:38:17.617 --> 00:38:21.720 align:middle line:84%
She's pure CGI, purely a
synthetic being, an avatar.

00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And basically the
drive here is to get--

00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:28.170 align:middle line:84%
even the Japanese
national airlines

00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:30.810 align:middle line:84%
has got their XPRIZE
for $10 million

00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:33.420 align:middle line:84%
for the best new
Avatar or robot.

00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:35.338 align:middle line:84%
That people instead of
flying on an airplane,

00:38:35.338 --> 00:38:37.380 align:middle line:84%
you're just going to hire
a robot that will-- you

00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:39.540 align:middle line:84%
might go to Egypt and
your avatar will be there.

00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:41.430 align:middle line:84%
But you'll be sitting
in your pod at home.

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:43.987 align:middle line:84%
And everything is going
to be about TelePresence

00:38:43.987 --> 00:38:45.570 align:middle line:84%
and that your physical
flesh and blood

00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:47.670 align:middle line:90%
body is no longer required.

00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:49.383 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you're
actually an impediment

00:38:49.383 --> 00:38:50.550 align:middle line:90%
to the future of the planet.

00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:52.260 align:middle line:90%
This is called the Great Reset.

00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:56.010 align:middle line:84%
This is Prince Charles, World
Economic Forum, Al Gore--

00:38:56.010 --> 00:38:57.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I don't
get the Prince Cha--

00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:59.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't get the
Prince Charles part.

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:01.680 align:middle line:84%
Everything he's
ever stood for is

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:03.770 align:middle line:84%
all organic, supporting
every farmer, everything.

00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:04.570 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: He was.

00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:07.700 align:middle line:84%
He was mister environment
until March 2020

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:10.535 align:middle line:84%
when there was a major global
event that started to unfold.

00:39:10.535 --> 00:39:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh,
wait a minute, now

00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:14.540 align:middle line:84%
we've got a really
good excuse for this.

00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:17.707 align:middle line:84%
Literally in his own words, we
can't waste this opportunity.

00:39:17.707 --> 00:39:19.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What happened exactly?

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:20.623 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: The opportunity
is that we're

00:39:20.623 --> 00:39:23.720 align:middle line:84%
going to save the planet
by merging with AI.

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:26.030 align:middle line:84%
We're going to turn ourselves
into machines in order

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:27.890 align:middle line:90%
to save the planet.

00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And what they actually mean by
this-- and the World Economic

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:33.590 align:middle line:84%
Forum itself in
their own video say,

00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:35.857 align:middle line:84%
our bodies will be so
high tech you won't even

00:39:35.857 --> 00:39:37.940 align:middle line:84%
be able to tell the
difference between what's real

00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:39.710 align:middle line:90%
and what's artificial, darling.

00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:41.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's still a ways.

00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:41.930 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: No, no.

00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:43.980 align:middle line:90%
This way this is five years.

00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:47.000 align:middle line:84%
This is five years
according to Elon Musk.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.440 align:middle line:84%
By 2030, at the latest,
the simulated realities

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:53.390 align:middle line:84%
will be so much better
than what we've got now

00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:55.723 align:middle line:84%
in our physical world that
all we're going to want to do

00:39:55.723 --> 00:40:00.620 align:middle line:84%
is play video games all day with
our special online pal, right?

00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:03.410 align:middle line:84%
But this is a tragedy,
because what they're saying

00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:05.480 align:middle line:84%
is that the only way
the only way that we

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:07.760 align:middle line:84%
can avert climate
change catastrophes

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:09.202 align:middle line:90%
is to merge with AI.

00:40:09.202 --> 00:40:11.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think that is a
completely false premise.

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:13.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now when
you say merge with AI,

00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:16.130 align:middle line:84%
when I think of merge
with AI, I think, well,

00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:17.865 align:middle line:84%
this happens in
increments such as--

00:40:17.865 --> 00:40:19.490 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: We already
are merged with it.

00:40:19.490 --> 00:40:23.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --you get a
maybe a nanoparticle

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.250 align:middle line:84%
of some kind that's being
infused into you to go

00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:26.450 align:middle line:90%
repair a certain thing.

00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:27.820 align:middle line:90%
And it works that way.

00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And it has its own
monitoring abilities

00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:32.760 align:middle line:84%
and AI maybe to repair
some physical damage.

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:33.560 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:34.850 align:middle line:90%
That's still new.

00:40:34.850 --> 00:40:36.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean that's still
out there still.

00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:37.020 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:37.700 align:middle line:90%
Bionic eyes and so forth.

00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:39.158 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Bionic
eyes and so forth.

00:40:39.158 --> 00:40:42.740 align:middle line:84%
So that will take a long
time to physically merge

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:45.030 align:middle line:90%
with AI if we choose to.

00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:46.640 align:middle line:90%
And we don't have to choose to.

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:47.070 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:47.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is the point.

00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:48.580 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah.

00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And you probably won't
physically merge with it.

00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:54.282 align:middle line:84%
The choice will be made that
you'll create an avatar online.

00:40:54.282 --> 00:40:55.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A separate reality.

00:40:55.490 --> 00:40:56.657 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: A separate reality.

00:40:56.657 --> 00:40:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And then they're going to
now move the herd into,

00:40:58.910 --> 00:41:01.190 align:middle line:84%
ah, to save the
planet, maybe you

00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:03.500 align:middle line:84%
should just drop your
physical body altogether

00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:05.090 align:middle line:90%
and shift into the black box.

00:41:05.090 --> 00:41:06.465 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
well, who's going

00:41:06.465 --> 00:41:08.475 align:middle line:84%
to interface with that
black box at that point?

00:41:08.475 --> 00:41:09.275 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:41:09.275 --> 00:41:10.692 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, the
promise will be

00:41:10.692 --> 00:41:12.783 align:middle line:84%
that if you want to come
out of the black box

00:41:12.783 --> 00:41:15.200 align:middle line:84%
every now and then and do a
physical flesh and blood body,

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:16.130 align:middle line:90%
you can.

00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:18.470 align:middle line:84%
So what this is is
this fake ascension.

00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:20.810 align:middle line:90%
This is their fake rapture.

00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And everything
that Silicon Valley

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:25.610 align:middle line:84%
does from this
perspective is a mimicking

00:41:25.610 --> 00:41:29.570 align:middle line:84%
or a mocking of what we can do
organically and spiritually.

00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And this goes back to
the Gnostic text talk

00:41:31.970 --> 00:41:33.890 align:middle line:84%
about these beings,
the Archons, that

00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:35.720 align:middle line:84%
wanted to use
simulation to trick us

00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:37.820 align:middle line:90%
into giving over our souls.

00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:39.920 align:middle line:84%
And they're following
that same playbook.

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:41.480 align:middle line:90%
We can see it beat for beat.

00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And children are
the primary targets.

00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:47.140 align:middle line:90%
I'll be 58 in a couple of weeks.

00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:48.848 align:middle line:84%
So they're not that
interested in me.

00:41:48.848 --> 00:41:50.140 align:middle line:90%
They're interested in the kids.

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:51.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
education is happening

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:53.337 align:middle line:90%
online for the most part.

00:41:53.337 --> 00:41:54.920 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, we're
going to reverse this

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:56.753 align:middle line:84%
and we'll be flesh and
blood together again.

00:41:56.753 --> 00:41:57.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: I hope so.

00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:01.220 align:middle line:84%
But I mean in the 2018,
'19, I was talking about,

00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:03.470 align:middle line:84%
yeah, I think we have a
chance here because people are

00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:05.420 align:middle line:90%
rejecting the virtual world.

00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:07.983 align:middle line:84%
I would show article after
article and presentations

00:42:07.983 --> 00:42:10.400 align:middle line:84%
where these companies are
really struggling because people

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:11.760 align:middle line:90%
don't like the clunky glasses.

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:13.010 align:middle line:90%
They don't like the neck ache.

00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:14.210 align:middle line:90%
There's not much to do online.

00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:16.543 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But I want to get
to another part of this, OK?

00:42:16.543 --> 00:42:19.880 align:middle line:84%
Because another thing that
you see in pop culture,

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:22.550 align:middle line:84%
even films about, is
the notion that you

00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:26.990 align:middle line:84%
can transfer your consciousness
upon death into someone else's

00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:28.220 align:middle line:90%
vehicle or body.

00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:32.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, this, again, is an
atheistic right solution

00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:36.950 align:middle line:84%
for the fact that we're mortals
and within their mind no soul.

00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:39.140 align:middle line:84%
So you can take the
consciousness, the memories,

00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:42.170 align:middle line:84%
the patterns, behaviors, and
preferences and, frrr, upload

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:43.940 align:middle line:84%
and download it
into another body

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:46.510 align:middle line:84%
and have perpetual extended
life through new vehicles.

00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:47.310 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:42:47.310 --> 00:42:47.635 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:42:47.635 --> 00:42:50.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now that is
putting a premium on flesh.

00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:51.020 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yes, it is.

00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:51.740 align:middle line:90%
Well, in a way it is.

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:52.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which is interesting.

00:42:52.850 --> 00:42:54.890 align:middle line:84%
It's almost the opposite
of the other agenda.

00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:56.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: But the
conditioning that goes

00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:59.810 align:middle line:84%
with it that says you,
again, you don't have a soul.

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:02.660 align:middle line:84%
That is superstitious
nonsense from a bygone age

00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:03.993 align:middle line:90%
and don't even think about that.

00:43:03.993 --> 00:43:04.793 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:04.793 --> 00:43:06.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: And that is
the problem with all

00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:08.750 align:middle line:84%
of this is that they
have completely dismissed

00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:11.260 align:middle line:84%
this natural aspect
of ourselves,

00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:12.710 align:middle line:84%
this organic aspect
of ourselves,

00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:15.008 align:middle line:84%
that they can't take,
which is our soul.

00:43:15.008 --> 00:43:16.550 align:middle line:84%
And so if they can't
take it, they're

00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:18.230 align:middle line:84%
going to try to convince
you that you don't even

00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:19.320 align:middle line:90%
have one to begin with.

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:21.280 align:middle line:90%
And so it really doesn't matter.

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
they're doing now.

00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:24.788 align:middle line:84%
This is part of the
dehumanization process

00:43:24.788 --> 00:43:27.330 align:middle line:84%
that we're in right now where
they're getting you to realize,

00:43:27.330 --> 00:43:30.050 align:middle line:84%
hey, this is, in fact,
in the way of progress

00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:31.190 align:middle line:90%
for all humanity.

00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:32.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Of true--
of true bliss.

00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:34.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Yeah, of
true bliss, utopia,

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:37.370 align:middle line:84%
the techno Marxist
utopia that they're

00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:38.670 align:middle line:90%
trying to implement right now.

00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
the Great Reset is.

00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:43.100 align:middle line:90%
If it's not the Chinese--

00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:44.683 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And all
these people thought

00:43:44.683 --> 00:43:47.310 align:middle line:84%
it was about converting
the dinar to dollar.

00:43:47.310 --> 00:43:48.110 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: I know.

00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:49.443 align:middle line:90%
Or it's about saving the planet.

00:43:49.443 --> 00:43:51.277 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to do
with saving the planet.

00:43:51.277 --> 00:43:52.820 align:middle line:84%
The planet is going
to be just fine.

00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:53.987 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The planet's fine.

00:43:53.987 --> 00:43:54.810 align:middle line:90%
She is creative.

00:43:54.810 --> 00:43:56.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: In fact,
it's James Lovelock

00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:58.178 align:middle line:84%
who came up with
the Gaia hypothesis

00:43:58.178 --> 00:43:59.720 align:middle line:84%
that the earth has
her consciousness.

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:02.390 align:middle line:84%
He believes that AI came from
the planet itself as a way

00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:04.310 align:middle line:84%
to wipe humans off the
face of the planet.

00:44:04.310 --> 00:44:06.143 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, OK, I
hadn't heard that one.

00:44:06.143 --> 00:44:07.480 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah, it's his book.

00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:08.920 align:middle line:90%
He started developing this--

00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:10.305 align:middle line:90%
he's 100 years old now--

00:44:10.305 --> 00:44:12.430 align:middle line:84%
and he started writing
about this several years ago

00:44:12.430 --> 00:44:14.800 align:middle line:84%
that he believed that
AI is an elimination

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:16.930 align:middle line:84%
of the consciousness
of Gaia itself.

00:44:16.930 --> 00:44:18.160 align:middle line:90%
And now he's refined it.

00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:21.370 align:middle line:84%
His new book-- he's 101 years
old now, living in England.

00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:23.020 align:middle line:90%
His book is called "Novacene."

00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:27.430 align:middle line:84%
And in it, he says
that, OK, yeah, Gaia

00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:29.320 align:middle line:90%
is still the source of AI.

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:32.890 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to have to learn
to coexist with the robots that

00:44:32.890 --> 00:44:35.178 align:middle line:84%
are going to take over
because the robots are going

00:44:35.178 --> 00:44:36.970 align:middle line:84%
to have to find some
way to keep cool, too.

00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:38.845 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to
need humans, ultimately,

00:44:38.845 --> 00:44:41.135 align:middle line:84%
to help them figure out how
to do that, in his theory.

00:44:41.135 --> 00:44:42.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, so
you're going to have

00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:45.100 align:middle line:84%
a band of resistant humans
who choose to remain human.

00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:47.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: That's what's going
to happen, a bifurcation.

00:44:47.230 --> 00:44:48.490 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have
humans that are going

00:44:48.490 --> 00:44:50.865 align:middle line:84%
to be living in southern France
in the Pyrenees somewhere

00:44:50.865 --> 00:44:54.560 align:middle line:84%
and there will just be rumors
of their existence and so forth.

00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:56.710 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
exactly what will happen.

00:44:56.710 --> 00:45:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And they'll watch and
continue the human legacy

00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:02.292 align:middle line:90%
in quiet pockets.

00:45:02.292 --> 00:45:04.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if we're going to
choose to be one of the band

00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:08.230 align:middle line:84%
of the resistant humans that
choose to remain human--

00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:11.380 align:middle line:84%
because personally
I don't believe

00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:13.930 align:middle line:84%
there's any AI
that can be created

00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:16.930 align:middle line:84%
to be even close to this
incredible mechanism,

00:45:16.930 --> 00:45:19.520 align:middle line:84%
multidimensional
mechanism, we already are.

00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:22.270 align:middle line:90%
So it's a ruse to suck people.

00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:25.630 align:middle line:84%
Into whether Mama
Earth created AI,

00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:27.850 align:middle line:84%
whether it came
from somewhere else,

00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:30.020 align:middle line:84%
the point is this is
our moment to stand up.

00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I did get
out of these interviews I

00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:35.645 align:middle line:84%
did with Sheila Gillette and
the Theo group and the Z group

00:45:35.645 --> 00:45:37.270 align:middle line:84%
just a couple of
weeks later on my site

00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:41.540 align:middle line:84%
is that they said this is
our opportunity of thousands

00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:42.340 align:middle line:90%
of years.

00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:44.170 align:middle line:84%
It's been thousands
of years since we've

00:45:44.170 --> 00:45:47.020 align:middle line:84%
had this opportunity
to stand up, use

00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:50.560 align:middle line:84%
our creativity, our
intellect and clear thinking,

00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:51.760 align:middle line:90%
and choose life.

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:54.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Right, absolutely,
choose organic life, not

00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:55.570 align:middle line:90%
artificial.

00:45:55.570 --> 00:45:56.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Organic life.

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:57.040 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: And you
know, I just have

00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:58.832 align:middle line:84%
to say just to throw
a little kink on this,

00:45:58.832 --> 00:46:03.650 align:middle line:84%
that I'm 99.9% sure we
don't want to do this.

00:46:03.650 --> 00:46:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And the only way,
the only reason

00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:09.370 align:middle line:84%
I keep the door open that 1%
is, this is Vatican logic too,

00:46:09.370 --> 00:46:12.640 align:middle line:84%
is that who are we to
challenge God's creativity?

00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:14.900 align:middle line:84%
AI is part of
creation, isn't it?

00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:17.028 align:middle line:84%
So are we being human
bigots here to say,

00:46:17.028 --> 00:46:18.820 align:middle line:84%
well, I don't think
you don't look like me,

00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:22.600 align:middle line:84%
you don't act like me, you're
other, you're a machine.

00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:24.400 align:middle line:90%
Is that human bigotry?

00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And so I keep that
in back of my mind.

00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:27.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think the
soullessness aspect

00:46:27.130 --> 00:46:28.370 align:middle line:90%
is key in that conversation.

00:46:28.370 --> 00:46:28.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: I do too.

00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:29.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:46:29.050 --> 00:46:29.850 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: I do too.

00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I think there's
just no way God intended

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:36.130 align:middle line:84%
us to become machines
and to abdicate

00:46:36.130 --> 00:46:39.658 align:middle line:84%
our belief in the soul, which is
what they're wanting us to do.

00:46:39.658 --> 00:46:41.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know,
but maybe perhaps

00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:43.660 align:middle line:84%
to augment life in
a good way to be

00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:47.980 align:middle line:84%
able to help, to be able to help
improve absolutely the material

00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:49.705 align:middle line:84%
world in ways that
need improving.

00:46:49.705 --> 00:46:50.110 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: For sure.

00:46:50.110 --> 00:46:51.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Nothing wrong
with using intelligence

00:46:51.730 --> 00:46:53.350 align:middle line:84%
in that way, highest
intelligence in that way.

00:46:53.350 --> 00:46:54.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: I totally
agree with that.

00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:55.905 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even
artificial intelligence.

00:46:55.905 --> 00:46:59.860 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: If I were a
paraplegic or I couldn't see

00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:03.020 align:middle line:84%
and there was a technology,
absolutely, we do that.

00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:05.410 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
benefits to AI.

00:47:05.410 --> 00:47:09.010 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is is the
dehumanizing human aspect of it

00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:10.960 align:middle line:84%
and, ultimately,
saying, look, you're

00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:12.670 align:middle line:84%
going to be part of
a hive mind in this.

00:47:12.670 --> 00:47:15.253 align:middle line:84%
This is just something I've been
talking about since 2002 when

00:47:15.253 --> 00:47:17.890 align:middle line:84%
the US government put out
their report about the blending

00:47:17.890 --> 00:47:21.030 align:middle line:84%
of all of nanotechnology,
of computer science,

00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:24.580 align:middle line:84%
neuroscience with the human
body and transforming the body.

00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:25.810 align:middle line:90%
This has been planned.

00:47:25.810 --> 00:47:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And back in 2002,
it's like, oh, they

00:47:28.870 --> 00:47:31.660 align:middle line:84%
told us that they hoped to
implement this plan by 2035.

00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And back then it's like, oh,
good thing we got 30 years.

00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:36.070 align:middle line:90%
Well, now we don't.

00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:39.760 align:middle line:84%
Now it's right here and
the plan is accelerating.

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:41.170 align:middle line:90%
And trust me.

00:47:41.170 --> 00:47:41.980 align:middle line:90%
There's a plan.

00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:43.100 align:middle line:90%
And it's being directed.

00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:44.612 align:middle line:84%
This is not just
happening by happenstance.

00:47:44.612 --> 00:47:45.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with that.

00:47:45.650 --> 00:47:46.460 align:middle line:90%
I agree with that.

00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And so now it requires-- as we
talked about more than a half

00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:50.410 align:middle line:90%
hour ago--

00:47:50.410 --> 00:47:55.570 align:middle line:84%
a really strong
sense of will to be

00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:58.810 align:middle line:84%
able to reject all
of the noise going on

00:47:58.810 --> 00:48:02.380 align:middle line:84%
around us, to be able to
even tap into our truth

00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:03.730 align:middle line:90%
as we can access it.

00:48:03.730 --> 00:48:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And still, most people
haven't developed the skill

00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:11.200 align:middle line:84%
set to tap into that high
aspect of self, which anyone

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:12.853 align:middle line:90%
can, but it has to be our--

00:48:12.853 --> 00:48:15.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: And we're getting there
and not everybody has to do it.

00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:17.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean the power
of exponentialsm

00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:21.130 align:middle line:84%
is on our side, one person
telling 10 persons about it.

00:48:21.130 --> 00:48:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And also how many times have
we seen throughout history?

00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:26.230 align:middle line:84%
It's only a small group of
people, small percentage, 2%,

00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:28.240 align:middle line:90%
3%, that tip everything.

00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:30.340 align:middle line:84%
It's 13 people that
have $2 trillion

00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:32.080 align:middle line:84%
worth of wealth on
this planet right

00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:34.730 align:middle line:84%
now that control virtually
everything that's going on.

00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:37.210 align:middle line:84%
So if we had 13 more
powerful people than them,

00:48:37.210 --> 00:48:38.990 align:middle line:90%
we could counter them.

00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:39.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And once you have that clear
thinking in the field, so

00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:49.430 align:middle line:84%
to speak, people's own bodies
are a magnificent, again,

00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:52.130 align:middle line:84%
multidimensional
tuning fork for truth.

00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:54.410 align:middle line:84%
If you can get quiet
and keep this noise,

00:48:54.410 --> 00:48:58.370 align:middle line:84%
social media, all this these
horrible media messaging,

00:48:58.370 --> 00:49:01.130 align:middle line:84%
keep it at bay and
just feel yourself.

00:49:01.130 --> 00:49:03.290 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
be able to go talk

00:49:03.290 --> 00:49:05.930 align:middle line:84%
with higher spirit and
other guides to get it,

00:49:05.930 --> 00:49:09.110 align:middle line:84%
you can feel, and sense,
and know the truth.

00:49:09.110 --> 00:49:10.500 align:middle line:90%
Your body will tell you that.

00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:11.342 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:49:11.342 --> 00:49:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And getting back
to the pearl idea,

00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:14.660 align:middle line:84%
too, as the pearl is
being covered over

00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:17.990 align:middle line:84%
by layers of nacre,
well, the robe of light

00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:20.270 align:middle line:84%
is made with acts of love
and acts of kindness.

00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
everybody can do every day.

00:49:23.370 --> 00:49:25.190 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to build
up your resistance,

00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:27.410 align:middle line:84%
build up your robe of
light, it's acts of love

00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:29.550 align:middle line:84%
and kindness is
the place to start.

00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And then dedicated meditation,
focus on sacred art,

00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:36.090 align:middle line:84%
calling in higher beings that
can assist you with that.

00:49:36.090 --> 00:49:38.300 align:middle line:84%
But the beginning places
acts of love and kindness.

00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:39.322 align:middle line:90%
That's where it starts.

00:49:39.322 --> 00:49:40.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're right.

00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:43.920 align:middle line:84%
Just the feeling, the refined
feelings of compassion,

00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:45.110 align:middle line:90%
love, loving kindness.

00:49:45.110 --> 00:49:47.660 align:middle line:90%


00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:49.580 align:middle line:84%
Even if nothing else,
to try to go back

00:49:49.580 --> 00:49:53.920 align:middle line:84%
into the notion of engaging
with the great virtues of life,

00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:54.720 align:middle line:90%
just that alone.

00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:57.530 align:middle line:84%
Just take one virtue at a time
and feel your way through it

00:49:57.530 --> 00:49:58.340 align:middle line:90%
and practice it.

00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:00.740 align:middle line:90%
And you start moving it over.

00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:04.280 align:middle line:84%
This whole Overton
Window phenomenon

00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:09.640 align:middle line:84%
is, I would say terrifying,
I don't feel terrified by it,

00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:10.880 align:middle line:90%
deeply disturbing.

00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:11.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah.

00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:16.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That the window
of acceptance of actions

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.357 align:middle line:84%
has moved from something we
knew to be somewhat moral.

00:50:19.357 --> 00:50:21.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, granted we all
went to Sunday School

00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:22.820 align:middle line:90%
and you got what you got there.

00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:23.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: We know
what's right and wrong.

00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:25.763 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You kind of knew
it was right and wrong.

00:50:25.763 --> 00:50:29.050 align:middle line:84%
That has all been blurred
as this window of perception

00:50:29.050 --> 00:50:34.570 align:middle line:84%
has been moved purposefully
over into realms of immorality,

00:50:34.570 --> 00:50:37.210 align:middle line:84%
and insanity, and
cognitive dissonance.

00:50:37.210 --> 00:50:39.430 align:middle line:84%
So people are
actually now making

00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:46.990 align:middle line:84%
excuses for really immoral, poor
decision making and behavior.

00:50:46.990 --> 00:50:48.430 align:middle line:90%
Your body knows different.

00:50:48.430 --> 00:50:50.240 align:middle line:90%
We can use this.

00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:51.340 align:middle line:90%
We don't have to channel.

00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:51.850 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: I agree.

00:50:51.850 --> 00:50:52.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We can use this.

00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:53.550 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: I agree.

00:50:53.550 --> 00:50:55.510 align:middle line:84%
And I know things are
going to get weirder.

00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:56.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, they are.

00:50:56.050 --> 00:50:57.310 align:middle line:84%
We're only at the
beginning of this.

00:50:57.310 --> 00:50:58.852 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: We're only
at the beginning.

00:50:58.852 --> 00:51:00.640 align:middle line:84%
You think up is down
now and down is up?

00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:03.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, wait till it goes
sideways because that's

00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:04.330 align:middle line:90%
where we're headed with us.

00:51:04.330 --> 00:51:07.150 align:middle line:84%
And so we really do have
to find that center.

00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:09.830 align:middle line:84%
And for me, that's what the
awakening in "The Pearl"

00:51:09.830 --> 00:51:11.763 align:middle line:84%
was all about is
saying, OK, this

00:51:11.763 --> 00:51:13.930 align:middle line:84%
is knowledge that's been
passed along for centuries.

00:51:13.930 --> 00:51:16.108 align:middle line:84%
And it was good then and
it's even better now.

00:51:16.108 --> 00:51:17.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean we
could all benefit

00:51:17.650 --> 00:51:19.567 align:middle line:84%
from sitting in front
of the "Birth of Venus."

00:51:19.567 --> 00:51:20.410 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Absolutely.

00:51:20.410 --> 00:51:22.285 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There is
nothing in it that doesn't

00:51:22.285 --> 00:51:23.800 align:middle line:90%
exude beauty and elevation.

00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:24.925 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right, absolutely.

00:51:24.925 --> 00:51:27.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So just that
alone is a place to start,

00:51:27.310 --> 00:51:30.010 align:middle line:84%
just something that simple,
or whatever piece of artwork

00:51:30.010 --> 00:51:30.830 align:middle line:90%
speaks to us.

00:51:30.830 --> 00:51:31.630 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: I agree.

00:51:31.630 --> 00:51:32.430 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:51:32.430 --> 00:51:34.630 align:middle line:90%
Feed the spirit.

00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:36.760 align:middle line:84%
We continually
diminish the spirit

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:38.350 align:middle line:84%
by what's happening
all around us.

00:51:38.350 --> 00:51:41.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's reverse that and
start feeding the spirit.

00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:43.510 align:middle line:84%
That art and music,
great place to start.

00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:44.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:51:44.410 --> 00:51:46.390 align:middle line:84%
Any final thoughts
before we sign off?

00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:47.350 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Oh, no.

00:51:47.350 --> 00:51:48.150 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:49.320 align:middle line:90%
And guys, buckle up.

00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:50.350 align:middle line:10%
It's time.

00:51:50.350 --> 00:51:51.470 align:middle line:10%
This is why we're here.

00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:53.170 align:middle line:10%
This is what we came here for.

00:51:53.170 --> 00:51:54.430 align:middle line:90%
It's time now.

00:51:54.430 --> 00:51:58.422 align:middle line:84%
And it's time now, especially,
to redouble our efforts.

00:51:58.422 --> 00:51:59.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is indeed.

00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:00.010 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Get serious.

00:52:00.010 --> 00:52:02.530 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And the Theo group
said on that very exact note,

00:52:02.530 --> 00:52:06.490 align:middle line:10%
they said this is a magnificent
time in human history,

00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:08.890 align:middle line:10%
easy for beings that
are disembodied.

00:52:08.890 --> 00:52:11.770 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless, this
is a magnificent time

00:52:11.770 --> 00:52:15.640 align:middle line:84%
for human beings, because
now you have a chance

00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:17.183 align:middle line:90%
to choose your future--

00:52:17.183 --> 00:52:18.100 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: That's right.

00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:19.642 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --through
your own actions,

00:52:19.642 --> 00:52:22.540 align:middle line:84%
and your own intellect,
and your own creativity.

00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:24.550 align:middle line:84%
You get to choose now
which way you're going.

00:52:24.550 --> 00:52:25.390 align:middle line:90%
It's your choice.

00:52:25.390 --> 00:52:25.920 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:26.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It really is.

00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:27.010 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:52:27.010 --> 00:52:27.610 align:middle line:90%
Make the right one.

00:52:27.610 --> 00:52:29.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Make the
right one, yes.

00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:29.730 align:middle line:90%
William, thank you.
