00:00:27.879 --> 00:00:30.420 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: In my last
conversation with Cort Lindahl,

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.612 align:middle line:10%
we looked at the great
octagonal structures

00:00:32.612 --> 00:00:34.320 align:middle line:10%
of the world and their
interconnectedness

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.520 align:middle line:10%
with one another, and the
greater bloodline connections.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.990 align:middle line:84%
Today we move the story westward
to Nova Scotia and the United

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.690 align:middle line:84%
States, where we go into a much
deeper aspect of the story.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.359 align:middle line:90%
And with recognizable players.

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:48.150 align:middle line:84%
Some people, if they
weren't history buffs,

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.760 align:middle line:84%
in the last conversation
had to keep pausing

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.340 align:middle line:84%
and go to Wikipedia
at least to figure out

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.424 align:middle line:90%
who we were talking about.

00:00:54.424 --> 00:00:55.590 align:middle line:90%
>>CORT LINDAHL: That's true.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.050 align:middle line:90%
I have to do that sometimes too.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.120 align:middle line:84%
I did too when I was
researching this.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.590 align:middle line:84%
So OK, first of all, I
want to backtrack a little.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.769 align:middle line:84%
We ended up talking
about the women weavers.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.160 align:middle line:84%
The Mera-- meravinginian-- I
always trip up on that word.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: Merovingians.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Merovingians.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And then the
knowledge then passed

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.160 align:middle line:90%
through to Theodora, Sophia.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And now we're going to
take the story further

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.020 align:middle line:84%
of the women, of the lineage
of women in these practices,

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.230 align:middle line:84%
to a little more modern time
and go to Mary Queen of Scots

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.610 align:middle line:84%
and her mother, who
is lesser known to us.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.640 align:middle line:84%
But first, you
say we need to lay

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.530 align:middle line:90%
the foundation with Frederick--

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: Frederick II, right.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.520 align:middle line:10%
The holy Roman emperor.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.320 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.819 align:middle line:10%
>>LINDAHL: He was
an amazing person.

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:45.350 align:middle line:10%
He was a very intelligent man
who was aware of astronomy.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.150 align:middle line:10%
And he was schooled in all of
the liberal arts of the time.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.030 align:middle line:84%
His magi was none other than
Michael Scott, who many people

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.410 align:middle line:90%
associate with Merlin.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And Michael Scott wrote a
book about spherical geometry

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.960 align:middle line:90%
in the 13th century.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.780 align:middle line:84%
So to assume that people
during that era weren't

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.300 align:middle line:84%
able to do what I'm
saying is just crazy

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.490 align:middle line:90%
given these kinds of gs.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.700 align:middle line:84%
So Frederick the Great was
descendant of Charlemagne.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And he was initiated into
the mysteries of Charlemagne.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And he was one of the
Roman emperors, Holy Roman

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.420 align:middle line:84%
Emperors that opened
Charlemagne's vault for reasons

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.220 align:middle line:90%
unknown.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.090 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that Charlemagne
left a mystery behind

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.170 align:middle line:90%
that he responded to.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.100 align:middle line:84%
And he even built the
golden sarcophagus

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.660 align:middle line:84%
that Charlemagne's stone
sarcophagus is inside of now.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.340 align:middle line:84%
So him, and previously
Frederick Barbarossa,

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.530 align:middle line:84%
both quested for whatever
Charlemagne left behind.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that was knocked
on from Constantine and on.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And again, all of them contained
an ancient understanding

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.140 align:middle line:84%
of geometry that laid
claim and defined

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.590 align:middle line:84%
land, that worked with the
cosmos, we shall assume.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And brought also
greater mysteries

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.150 align:middle line:84%
of understanding with
it in the esoteric

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.870 align:middle line:84%
sciences that were
passed on, right?

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:08.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: Certainly.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So here
we come to him.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: Sure, later I termed
that Templars using templates

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.090 align:middle line:84%
to create templum to
control the temporal fabric.

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.765 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: So that's
exactly what the earlier

00:03:16.765 --> 00:03:18.400 align:middle line:90%
people were doing as well.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.450 align:middle line:84%
And Frederick II was no
exception to the rule.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is it assumed
he was a Templar as well?

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: No, actually, he
had an adversarial relationship

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:29.750 align:middle line:90%
with the Knights Templar.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:30.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.174 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about that just for
a sec before going to the women.

00:03:33.174 --> 00:03:34.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: Sure.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.340 align:middle line:84%
He was the leader of one of
the invasions of Jerusalem.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And he displeased the Templars
because he, via diplomacy,

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.980 align:middle line:84%
was able to get Jerusalem back,
rather than by military force.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.180 align:middle line:84%
So the Templars were
dissatisfied with him

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.500 align:middle line:84%
because of that, and
other things he did.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.640 align:middle line:84%
He operated beyond the
bounds of the church.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.500 align:middle line:84%
The Pope called him
the anti-christ.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And he was excommunicated and
reaccepted into the church

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.296 align:middle line:90%
several times.

00:04:06.296 --> 00:04:10.520 align:middle line:84%
So he was a really intelligent
person who surrounded himself

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.740 align:middle line:84%
with intelligent people,
like Michael Scott, as I

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.720 align:middle line:90%
was referring to before him.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.730 align:middle line:84%
He built two
octagonal structures.

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.460 align:middle line:84%
One of them is the tower at
Monte Sant'Angelo, which is

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.400 align:middle line:84%
basically a shrine to the
cult of Saint Michael.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
is located where?

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: In
Southern West Italy.

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:30.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.106 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: Kind
of Southern Italy.

00:04:32.106 --> 00:04:35.190 align:middle line:84%
Frederick II was the King
of Naples and Sicily.

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.360 align:middle line:84%
So basically, that's the
southern part of Italy

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.800 align:middle line:84%
that the Vatican or the Lombards
or any of the other families

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.220 align:middle line:90%
didn't control at that time.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.960 align:middle line:84%
So he had his own
domain in Sicily.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.090 align:middle line:90%
Here's another one.

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.410 align:middle line:90%
He emulated Charlemagne.

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:55.850 align:middle line:84%
All of his-- he had a harem,
which is a Muslim attribute.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.430 align:middle line:84%
He valued the knowledge
and the geometry

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.529 align:middle line:84%
and mathematics, astronomy,
astrology, and all that.

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:02.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of the Eastern world.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: And that's why
had Michael Scott with him,

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.970 align:middle line:90%
and others too.

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.750 align:middle line:84%
Michael Scott
wasn't the only one.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.710 align:middle line:84%
But I believe Michael Scott
assisted him in these two

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:17.720 align:middle line:84%
octagons that he built-- Monte
Sant'Angelo, and then Castel

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.810 align:middle line:84%
del Monte, which is a really
interesting and elaborate

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.000 align:middle line:84%
octagonal structure, where
each corner of it has another

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.860 align:middle line:90%
octagonal turret on each corner.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:28.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Powerful.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: Yes, and that
points to Oak Island.

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And the other tower he built
at the Shrine of Saint Michael

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.680 align:middle line:84%
points to the
International Peace Garden.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.710 align:middle line:84%
So I think what he's doing
is showing his knowledge

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.880 align:middle line:84%
all the way back to
Vespasian and Titus

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.060 align:middle line:90%
that Charlemagne also knew.

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And also the Tower of Monte
Sant'Angelo points directly

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.545 align:middle line:84%
to the Tower of the
Winds in Athens,

00:05:52.545 --> 00:05:54.870 align:middle line:90%
the octagonal shape of it.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.520 align:middle line:84%
So in some of these, he's
covering more than one spot,

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.972 align:middle line:90%
or a couple of spots.

00:05:59.972 --> 00:06:02.340 align:middle line:84%
So what this leads
me to believe,

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.000 align:middle line:84%
and not just the
fact that he built

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.860 align:middle line:84%
the towers, but other things
he did during his reign,

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.410 align:middle line:84%
that he may have been the first
one to come to North America.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.710 align:middle line:84%
Not personally, but I
think he sent people

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:21.120 align:middle line:84%
to claim based on the earlier
legends of like Saint Brendan,

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.180 align:middle line:84%
or other explore--
or Viking explorers.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we know at
L'Anse aux Meadows

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.802 align:middle line:84%
in Newfoundland was
there at 1,000 AD.

00:06:28.802 --> 00:06:30.910 align:middle line:84%
So after that, the
doors opened really.

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:34.290 align:middle line:84%
Even though people still have
trouble believing that people

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:36.310 align:middle line:90%
came before Columbus.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:37.770 align:middle line:90%
We know they were here.

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:42.270 align:middle line:84%
So this information could have
easily got to Frederick II

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.840 align:middle line:84%
because he was of
Norman descent.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.910 align:middle line:84%
And we know the Viking culture
had a huge influence on that,

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:49.490 align:middle line:90%
as well as Charlemagne.

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.250 align:middle line:84%
So he's related to
both these cultures

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.890 align:middle line:84%
that value the directional
attributes of buildings

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:56.870 align:middle line:84%
in this manner, and
the family groups.

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:58.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
he contributed--

00:06:58.380 --> 00:06:58.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: Certainly.

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:00.105 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --to his own
structures to this.

00:07:00.105 --> 00:07:00.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: And
really, we're going

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:02.860 align:middle line:84%
to see his family
members even claim

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.020 align:middle line:84%
these areas later
in North America

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.220 align:middle line:90%
under the auspices of England.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:11.300 align:middle line:84%
Because we know the Hanoverian
English Royalty was German.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And they all had a direct
line back to Frederick.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the things that

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:18.740 align:middle line:84%
compels me to believe
that he made an effort

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.940 align:middle line:90%
to claim North America.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And that he possibly did it
from these places of mystery

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.600 align:middle line:84%
that we all know about
on the East Coast.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so we'll pick
it up from Frederick II,

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:33.580 align:middle line:84%
because I would like to run
the woman's side of the story

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:36.130 align:middle line:84%
alongside this story that
we've already opened.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:36.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: OK.

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:38.346 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
we're going to go

00:07:38.346 --> 00:07:42.710 align:middle line:84%
back from Frederick II to the
mother of Mary Queen of Scots,

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:43.510 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:47.910 align:middle line:84%
And her name was Marie de
Guise, or Marie of Guise,

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:49.260 align:middle line:90%
as you like to say.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.040 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk
about who she was,

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.080 align:middle line:84%
what her unique contribution
was on the planet, and then

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.180 align:middle line:90%
go into her daughter.

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:59.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: Well, these two
were descendant of Frederick II

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:01.310 align:middle line:90%
also.

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:07.390 align:middle line:84%
This is the 16th century by now,
so it's about 350 years later.

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:09.010 align:middle line:90%
But they have Stuart.

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And Frederick II was also
married to Eleanor of England.

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:15.660 align:middle line:90%
So his wife was even English.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.950 align:middle line:84%
So there's lots of connections
there, traditionally,

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:21.820 align:middle line:84%
between these German
factions and the English.

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And we get to this point
in the mid-16th century

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:30.120 align:middle line:84%
where Marie of Guise is trained
at the Saint Clare Monastery

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.295 align:middle line:90%
in weaving.

00:08:31.295 --> 00:08:33.669 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Saint Clair is a
critical name in all this too.

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:33.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: Right.

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:36.419 align:middle line:84%
And that could definitely
relate, or actually does

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:39.100 align:middle line:84%
relate, to the
real Saint Clares.

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:44.650 align:middle line:84%
And she trains her daughter,
Mary Queen of Scots,

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:46.640 align:middle line:90%
in the same arts.

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And there's actually a
really interesting tapestry

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:51.320 align:middle line:84%
by Mary Queen of
Scots that has lots

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.060 align:middle line:84%
of esoteric and
hidden things in it.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:58.290 align:middle line:84%
But most of all, there's an
octagon with a sun face in it

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:01.220 align:middle line:84%
very similar to the
Cross of Hendaye.

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And it has a smaller
octagon with the AVM

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:08.240 align:middle line:84%
auspice of Maria
symbol, but including

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:12.550 align:middle line:84%
the hook on the X portion of it
like we see on the Kensington

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:14.760 align:middle line:84%
Runestone that most
people would know

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.780 align:middle line:84%
about that through the
work of Scott Wolter.

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:23.180 align:middle line:84%
So everything that
Mary Queen of Scots did

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:26.710 align:middle line:84%
can inform one that she
knew of the mysteries

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:30.170 align:middle line:84%
and she was aware of
what Theodora had done,

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:33.170 align:middle line:84%
and that the-- I hate to
use the word cult-- but cult

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:35.960 align:middle line:84%
of Mary Magdalene, culture
of Mary Magdalene, that

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:36.790 align:middle line:90%
had been hidden.

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:38.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So these
were the learned women

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:40.630 align:middle line:84%
to complement the
learned men that we've

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:43.585 align:middle line:84%
been speaking about with
the same knowledge base.

00:09:43.585 --> 00:09:44.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: Certainly.

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:44.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:47.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: And this even came
through the Cathars, I believe.

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:50.920 align:middle line:84%
Because they're known as
weavers also and share-- as well

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:55.430 align:middle line:84%
as the Arians did, a lot of
these gnostic alternative

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:58.680 align:middle line:84%
Christian concepts to what
the Latin church believes.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.840 align:middle line:84%
So in response to that,
I mean, you see this

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:04.750 align:middle line:84%
all through history, alternative
Christian sects forming mystery

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:06.890 align:middle line:90%
schools in order to survive.

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:08.100 align:middle line:90%
To keep it secret.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And I believe some
of the embroidery

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:13.060 align:middle line:84%
and weaving was used
to do precisely that.

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:15.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you know, I
have thought about this.

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:19.877 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps not just to keep it
secret, but to keep it intact.

00:10:19.877 --> 00:10:20.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: Certainly, yes.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you take
information and then start just

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.430 align:middle line:84%
distributing it every
which way, so it

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:27.730 align:middle line:84%
grows looking this way
here and that way there,

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:31.050 align:middle line:84%
you don't have any actual
pure knowledge anymore.

00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:32.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: I agree.

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:35.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so that,
again, can be misconstrued

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:39.740 align:middle line:84%
to using it in a secretive
manner for control

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:41.600 align:middle line:90%
over those who don't know.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.960 align:middle line:84%
Or you can look at it as a
lineage of knowledge, which

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:47.190 align:middle line:84%
is to keep it as pure as it
can be so it can continue to be

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:49.025 align:middle line:90%
passed on and not misinterpret.

00:10:49.025 --> 00:10:51.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: Certainly, and
with regard to that, too,

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:54.450 align:middle line:84%
you see kind of a
course of initiation--

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:55.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:57.416 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: --that these
individuals are brought for.

00:10:57.416 --> 00:10:59.030 align:middle line:84%
I see that in Thomas
Jefferson, who

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:02.500 align:middle line:84%
we're going to talk about later
going through a similar thing.

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.480 align:middle line:84%
Benjamin Franklin, some of
the other first families

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.920 align:middle line:90%
of America.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, we see
this with Mary Queen

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:15.450 align:middle line:84%
of Scots being sent to learn
at the nunnery how to weave

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:17.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:22.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: It just seems awful
coincidental that Theodora

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:25.120 align:middle line:84%
started these groups of
nuns that were weavers,

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.620 align:middle line:84%
and then we see these powerful
people later hiding things,

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.170 align:middle line:90%
doing the same kind of activity.

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:30.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:31.770 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:34.350 align:middle line:90%
I just wanted to get that out.

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:37.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, because again, this
is a very hard story

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:41.430 align:middle line:84%
to put chronologically, or
even in a linear context,

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:43.810 align:middle line:84%
because it's going back and
forth in time and space.

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:46.120 align:middle line:84%
But would this be
an appropriate time

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.000 align:middle line:84%
to bring up Saint James
and the Jacobites,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.375 align:middle line:84%
or should we bring
that in later?

00:11:50.375 --> 00:11:51.175 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: Yeah.

00:11:51.175 --> 00:11:53.650 align:middle line:84%
Let me-- just another comment
about Mary Queen of Scots,

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:59.780 align:middle line:84%
that she is kind of the basis
of the Jacobite movement

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:01.070 align:middle line:90%
in a big way.

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:03.120 align:middle line:84%
We know, eventually,
she was beheaded.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:03.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:07.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: And her liaison
between Queen Elizabeth

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:11.460 align:middle line:84%
and herself before that was
a man named Robert Beale.

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
same Beale family

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:15.875 align:middle line:84%
that I suspect later is involved
with the Beale treasure.

00:12:15.875 --> 00:12:17.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
we're going to have

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:19.370 align:middle line:84%
you explain that in a
moment, the Beale treasure.

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:21.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: And all of the other
mysteries of North America

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:24.530 align:middle line:84%
that all seem to reference
these man in the mountain myths,

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:27.380 align:middle line:84%
like the Charlemagne
vault legend.

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:29.030 align:middle line:90%
So she is instrumental in that.

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And she was an object
of adoration and value

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:35.080 align:middle line:84%
by what would later
be termed Jacobites,

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:39.490 align:middle line:84%
because she was beheaded, almost
sacrificed for their cause.

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And after this, we see a huge
political turmoil in England

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:47.120 align:middle line:84%
where from ruler to ruler, they
would change back and forth.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.070 align:middle line:90%
You know, Catholicism is OK now.

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:50.120 align:middle line:90%
Now it's not OK.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.285 align:middle line:90%
Now it is.

00:12:51.285 --> 00:12:54.780 align:middle line:84%
So they created the mystery
school in order to survive,

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:55.630 align:middle line:90%
I believe.

00:12:55.630 --> 00:13:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And this led to some of
the ethos and philosophy

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:04.350 align:middle line:84%
of the Jacobites, who
also valued Saint James

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:06.287 align:middle line:90%
and the Camino de Santiago.

00:13:06.287 --> 00:13:08.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's where
we wanted to go next.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.911 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: And I believe
part of that value

00:13:09.911 --> 00:13:13.290 align:middle line:84%
comes from the
Queen Scota legend.

00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:15.360 align:middle line:84%
Because this is the
same region of Spain

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:18.830 align:middle line:84%
where Queen Scota sited
Ireland from the tower

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:22.150 align:middle line:84%
in Acaronia, which is
an actual tower there

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:24.355 align:middle line:84%
that's suspected to be
a Phoenician lighthouse.

00:13:24.355 --> 00:13:27.160 align:middle line:90%


00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:32.270 align:middle line:84%
That she seeded the population
of Ireland and Scotland.

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:35.380 align:middle line:84%
So we know this is highly
valued by Scots nobility.

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:38.900 align:middle line:84%
Even Robert Bruce and all
of the other Scottish rulers

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:41.530 align:middle line:84%
of his era signed
the Declaration

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:44.380 align:middle line:84%
of Arbroath, which stated
they were all descended

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:47.150 align:middle line:90%
of Scythian and Egyptian kings.

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:48.360 align:middle line:90%
So they're telling you.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.420 align:middle line:84%
They aren't even--
this isn't speculation.

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:50.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:52.324 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: And they
even believed this.

00:13:52.324 --> 00:13:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of the things
they did throughout their lives

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:58.560 align:middle line:84%
in history reflects
that they actually

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.840 align:middle line:90%
believed this to be true.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.980 align:middle line:84%
Including Mary Queen
of Scots and Marie

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:04.370 align:middle line:90%
of Guise and everybody else.

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:07.510 align:middle line:84%
So she became a
huge symbol to kind

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:13.470 align:middle line:84%
of this hidden Catholic
ethic that, I believe, even

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:16.570 align:middle line:84%
in a very major way, created
the United States of America.

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:17.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:18.840 align:middle line:84%
That's where I
wanted to go next.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.070 align:middle line:84%
Right here, there's a
comment in your book.

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:24.000 align:middle line:84%
It said, the Americas might
have been a Jacobite plan

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.240 align:middle line:90%
from the beginning.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: And you can see that
in the early colonial times.

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:31.690 align:middle line:84%
For years, there's
been speculation

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:36.120 align:middle line:84%
there were Jesuit and Christian
spies or interests infiltrating

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:39.980 align:middle line:84%
Jamestown, which was
there since 1607,

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:44.690 align:middle line:84%
about 20 years-- significantly
earlier than Plymouth Rock.

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And we see that-- Captain
Gabriel Archer, was recently--

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:50.250 align:middle line:90%
his body was dug up.

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:53.590 align:middle line:84%
And he had a reliquary
that had bones in it.

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And a few fragments
of a pewter finial

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.400 align:middle line:84%
that may have
designated that he was

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:02.660 align:middle line:84%
a standard bearer in
the Order of the Bath,

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.177 align:middle line:84%
or Order of the
Garter, possibly.

00:15:04.177 --> 00:15:06.800 align:middle line:90%


00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.880 align:middle line:84%
So that indicates
he was Catholic.

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:12.200 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting
is he had one cousin that

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:17.020 align:middle line:84%
was a priest at Santiago de
Compostela during the same era.

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:20.580 align:middle line:84%
And another one of
his Croft relatives

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:23.370 align:middle line:84%
headed the Jesuit College
in London at that time

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:27.220 align:middle line:84%
under King James I,
who, after a while

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:29.940 align:middle line:84%
became more lenient
towards the Catholics.

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:32.460 align:middle line:84%
His mother was Mary
Queen of Scots.

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:36.790 align:middle line:84%
Although he was raised to
be Church of England and not

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:37.720 align:middle line:90%
Catholic.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.400 align:middle line:84%
I think it's even possible
that King James was

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:43.680 align:middle line:84%
a Catholic sympathizer,
or possibly

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.380 align:middle line:84%
even a secret Catholic,
because he seemed

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:50.120 align:middle line:84%
to favor a lot of people who
later, it became obvious,

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:53.450 align:middle line:84%
were Jesuit or
Catholic oriented.

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:57.860 align:middle line:84%
And you kind of see the secret
society moving to the colonies,

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:02.740 align:middle line:84%
even before the trend of
the Tower of the Winds

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:06.250 align:middle line:84%
becomes popular in
England, we see the Newport

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:09.270 align:middle line:84%
Tower and the octagonal
powder magazine

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:14.350 align:middle line:84%
in Williamsburg being built.
That was built in 1714.

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And then later, in
the mid-18th century,

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:20.420 align:middle line:84%
we see Admiral Anson at
Shugborough Hall, Sir Francis

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:23.260 align:middle line:84%
Dashwood in the
Hellfire Club, having

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:27.679 align:middle line:84%
these geometric structures,
follies, on their estates.

00:16:27.679 --> 00:16:29.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'd like to go
see the Shugborough one.

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.640 align:middle line:90%
That sounds fascinating.

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:32.223 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: I would
like to see it too.

00:16:32.223 --> 00:16:33.140 align:middle line:90%
It would be awesome.

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:33.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In England.

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:34.030 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:36.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: The Tower of
the Winds at Shugborough,

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:40.200 align:middle line:84%
the southern orientation points
to Avebury and Stonehenge

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.125 align:middle line:84%
in a single arc, and right
through the center of them.

00:16:43.125 --> 00:16:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So these arcs
are headed over to America,

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:47.250 align:middle line:84%
and they're laying claim
to these lands as well.

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:48.049 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: Sure.

00:16:48.049 --> 00:16:50.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the blood
lines seem to indicate that

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.912 align:middle line:90%
there's a follow-through from--

00:16:52.912 --> 00:16:54.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: Previous
traditions too.

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:55.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: From
previous traditions.

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:56.090 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:58.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's just kind
of hopscotch back.

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:01.550 align:middle line:84%
How to Francis Bacon and
John Dee figure into this?

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:02.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: OK.

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:05.930 align:middle line:84%
That's just from the
era before Admiral Anson

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:08.710 align:middle line:84%
and the establishment of all
of this in the United States.

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:10.599 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, we know
Sir Francis Bacon

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:14.443 align:middle line:84%
invested in the Jamestown
colony and the Cupids colony

00:17:14.443 --> 00:17:15.243 align:middle line:90%
in Newfoundland.

00:17:15.243 --> 00:17:17.970 align:middle line:90%


00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:20.470 align:middle line:84%
He was also involved in
intelligence gathering.

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:21.430 align:middle line:90%
And that's obvious.

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:25.060 align:middle line:90%
He was with 007, John Dee.

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:29.980 align:middle line:84%
Later, spymaster Walter
Montagu, Francis Walsingham,

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:32.680 align:middle line:84%
the whole group of
people during that era

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:37.260 align:middle line:84%
that you see being spies
or collecting intelligence.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:42.580 align:middle line:84%
John Dee traveled the courts
of Europe doing astrology

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:43.480 align:middle line:90%
on the surface.

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.620 align:middle line:84%
But I believe he was trying
to influence the Holy Roman

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:51.080 align:middle line:84%
Emperor, for instance, by using
these concepts as some sort

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:53.430 align:middle line:90%
of psychological operation.

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:56.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do he also-- did
I understand it correctly,

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:58.564 align:middle line:84%
he also had an understanding
of the arts of navigation--

00:17:58.564 --> 00:17:59.438 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: Certainly.

00:17:59.438 --> 00:18:01.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --to a
very refined extent?

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:04.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: He even taught
navigation to the Royal Navy.

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:05.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.787 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: So here's a person
that would definitely--

00:18:07.787 --> 00:18:09.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Highly
educated and skilled.

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:11.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: Yes, have
a grasp of easily how

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.790 align:middle line:90%
to do something like this.

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:15.880 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting,
because during this era,

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:18.630 align:middle line:84%
you see the construction--
this is during Elizabeth---

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:22.460 align:middle line:84%
of Star Castle on
the Isles of Scilly,

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.830 align:middle line:84%
which is also on the
famous Michael line,

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:27.690 align:middle line:84%
a famous lay line in England
that people talk about,

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:31.180 align:middle line:90%
Avebury being oriented on.

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:34.910 align:middle line:84%
I think Avebury's the axis
of-- Avebury, excuse me.

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:35.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: "Avebry".

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:38.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: I've been corrected
a lot on how I pronounce that.

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:42.380 align:middle line:84%
But I think that's the axis of
the Michael line, personally.

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:44.580 align:middle line:84%
Could be it points
directly to Glastonbury

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:48.600 align:middle line:84%
and all the other sites
that are included.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.910 align:middle line:84%
So here we have Star
Castle built by Elizabeth,

00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:55.200 align:middle line:90%
essentially, and her minions.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.430 align:middle line:84%
It points directly
to the Newport Tower.

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:00.950 align:middle line:84%
And this is getting back
to our sites of claim

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:03.570 align:middle line:84%
and our legal
descriptions of property.

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:06.370 align:middle line:10%
Because not only that,
on the same azimuth

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:10.130 align:middle line:10%
is the point in Provincetown
Harbor at Cape Cod, where

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:12.880 align:middle line:10%
the Mayflower Compact
was later signed

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:16.470 align:middle line:10%
in this same geographic context.

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:20.150 align:middle line:84%
Earlier, Captain Archer,
before he passed away,

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:23.050 align:middle line:84%
and Captains
Gosnold-- and he was

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:26.300 align:middle line:84%
dug up with the finial
of a standard bearer

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:30.620 align:middle line:84%
as well-- visited
the same harbor

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:34.050 align:middle line:90%
and claimed from the same point.

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:36.670 align:middle line:84%
So what they did was
build the Newport Tower

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:41.100 align:middle line:84%
as a physical stone
testament to it being

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.860 align:middle line:90%
pointed to by Star Castle.

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:44.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Was it octagonal?

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:44.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: Yes.

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:46.930 align:middle line:90%
Star Castle's octagonal as well.

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:48.420 align:middle line:90%
And that was added later.

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:50.180 align:middle line:84%
At first, during
this time, it wasn't.

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:52.480 align:middle line:90%
It was just some buildings.

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.800 align:middle line:84%
But over time, somebody
who knew-- we often

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.500 align:middle line:84%
see that, the original
point of claim

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:01.370 align:middle line:84%
is just marked by a stone
cairn or something like that.

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:04.220 align:middle line:84%
They collect an ephemeris
or star chart there,

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:07.122 align:middle line:84%
do their claiming
ceremony and go.

00:20:07.122 --> 00:20:08.580 align:middle line:84%
And now they knew
how the get back,

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:11.220 align:middle line:84%
because they have
something to compare it to.

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:14.720 align:middle line:84%
So Star Castle may have even
been constructed and formed

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:17.744 align:middle line:84%
the way it is specifically
just to point there.

00:20:17.744 --> 00:20:18.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:21.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: And
record their claim

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:26.510 align:middle line:84%
to New England, which is also
a descendant of Frederick II.

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:27.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:28.680 align:middle line:84%
I know, it's like
[MOTIONS] --this goes here.

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: A lot of people
doing the claiming, yes.

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:33.613 align:middle line:84%
And this ties, again, back
to Halifax, Nova Scotia,

00:20:33.613 --> 00:20:36.240 align:middle line:84%
and relates to the
Oak Island treasure.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:39.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's where
we're going to go now.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.040 align:middle line:84%
And also, the temple
treasure from Jerusalem,

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.310 align:middle line:90%
how that could be overlaying.

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about what the
Oak Island treasure is.

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And there is conspiracy, lots
of conspiracy theory around it.

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:54.490 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the Oak
Island treasure conspiracy.

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:55.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: OK.

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:58.660 align:middle line:84%
Well maybe, really, the story
that we've all been told

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:01.400 align:middle line:84%
and we see on TV all the
time may be just there

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:04.649 align:middle line:90%
to waylay you from the truth.

00:21:04.649 --> 00:21:06.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what's the
story you're speaking of?

00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:08.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: The standard
story is a story

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:11.880 align:middle line:84%
of three young men seeing
strange lights on the island

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:15.160 align:middle line:84%
and rowing out there,
and finding a depression

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:19.960 align:middle line:84%
in the ground that had a pulley
suspended from a tree above it.

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:22.180 align:middle line:90%
So they dug down into the pit.

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:26.030 align:middle line:10%
And about every 10 feet, they
found layers, or platforms,

00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:29.800 align:middle line:10%
of oak and logs, and coconut
fibers, some of the sources

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:30.790 align:middle line:10%
say.

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:32.900 align:middle line:84%
After they got down
to 90 feet, they

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:37.140 align:middle line:84%
found a strange inscribed stone
with a code that was encoded.

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:39.190 align:middle line:90%
It was just symbols.

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:41.100 align:middle line:84%
Some people decoded
this to mean there's

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:43.690 align:middle line:90%
a treasure 40 feet below.

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And others no, that
means different things.

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:50.270 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the big points
of debate in the Oak Island

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:51.600 align:middle line:90%
community.

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:57.870 align:middle line:84%
So this later extends even,
and ties into, I think,

00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:01.700 align:middle line:84%
Joseph Des Barres, the
descendant of the Knights

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:04.900 align:middle line:84%
Templar who was the
cartographer later, kind of

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:07.580 align:middle line:84%
helped to perpetuate
this legend.

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:11.160 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
speculate, of course,

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:14.030 align:middle line:84%
that the Knights Templar
found the Ark of the Covenant

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:15.570 align:middle line:90%
on the Temple Mount.

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:17.770 align:middle line:90%
I've said my theory before.

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:21.670 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of that leads people
to believe that they either

00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:24.950 align:middle line:84%
brought the Ark of the Covenant,
or that the missing Templar

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:28.950 align:middle line:84%
fleet, after the
Templars' persecution,

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:31.730 align:middle line:84%
escaped and took treasure
Oak Island, the treasure that

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:33.770 align:middle line:90%
was at the commandery in Paris.

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:37.680 align:middle line:84%
So that's a tempting
story as well.

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:40.040 align:middle line:84%
And other people will also
relate them to pirates.

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:44.310 align:middle line:84%
But that's how they relate
to Oak Island, I believe.

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:47.380 align:middle line:84%
So this could be an element
of folklore, I think,

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:50.630 align:middle line:84%
that was produced to
kind of tip people

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:55.730 align:middle line:84%
off that somebody had claimed
something from this point.

00:22:55.730 --> 00:23:00.200 align:middle line:84%
Every other time I see this kind
of folklore-- not every time,

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:03.140 align:middle line:84%
but many times, they'll
apply a treasure myth,

00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:06.040 align:middle line:84%
or some outrageous--
at Mount Shasta later,

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.870 align:middle line:84%
we even see the
same thing happening

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:10.300 align:middle line:84%
in modern times, where
the people living

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:13.740 align:middle line:84%
beneath the mountain, et
cetera, that are part of that.

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:15.530 align:middle line:84%
So I believe this
is a valued point,

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:17.990 align:middle line:84%
because it was a point
of claim with all

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:21.050 align:middle line:84%
of the associated spiritual
and practical overtones

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:24.010 align:middle line:84%
that all of the
other places had.

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:28.210 align:middle line:84%
This extends to Williamsburg,
Charleston, South Carolina.

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And I believe also Frederick
II sent people and claimed

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:36.021 align:middle line:90%
the International Peace Garden.

00:23:36.021 --> 00:23:38.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which we spoke
about in the last show.

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:39.478 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: And
that's even situated

00:23:39.478 --> 00:23:42.830 align:middle line:84%
on a hill in the middle of
just nothing but flat prairie,

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:45.940 align:middle line:84%
where it's a good
place to measure from.

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:49.120 align:middle line:84%
It's exactly on
the 49th parallel.

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:52.930 align:middle line:84%
And we know 4 plus 9
equals 13 on a base

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:55.480 align:middle line:90%
interpretation of numerology.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:58.060 align:middle line:84%
Things like that are
present all the time.

00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:00.280 align:middle line:84%
You see you also a
lot of these axes

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:05.610 align:middle line:84%
are often established on
even lines of latitude.

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:07.430 align:middle line:84%
We have the Great
Pyramid almost being

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:12.105 align:middle line:84%
precisely on the 30th,
Baalbek's on the 34th,

00:24:12.105 --> 00:24:15.180 align:middle line:84%
the Tower of the
Winds is on the 38th.

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:16.530 align:middle line:90%
Monticello is on the 38th.

00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:17.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 38th, right.

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:20.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: Constantinople,
the royal district's right

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:22.460 align:middle line:90%
on the 41st, and so on.

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:25.830 align:middle line:84%
So there's one of their
calculations done right away,

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:30.520 align:middle line:84%
because they needed some sort
of timekeeping or astronomical

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:34.010 align:middle line:84%
observations to
determine longitude,

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:37.724 align:middle line:84%
which is a little more
difficult to do quickly.

00:24:37.724 --> 00:24:39.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now, you've
written more recently

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:42.150 align:middle line:90%
about the Oak Island treasure.

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:44.130 align:middle line:84%
So let's take the
Oak Island treasure.

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:45.610 align:middle line:84%
Let's explain
whatever else we need

00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:48.350 align:middle line:84%
to know about that, what
you feel the treasure is.

00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:49.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: OK.

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:52.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the families
and ties involved.

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:52.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: OK.

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:58.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, I feel, to me, there
likely is no tangible treasure.

00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:03.100 align:middle line:84%
Some of the hints you get may
indicate something was there

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:05.330 align:middle line:84%
and it was later moved to
the International Peace

00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:08.130 align:middle line:84%
Garden, or even
Williamsburg, because there's

00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:10.970 align:middle line:84%
a legend of Sir
Francis Bacon having

00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:14.270 align:middle line:90%
left a vault of information.

00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
speculate that there

00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:19.560 align:middle line:84%
is a vault at Oak Island
that has the same overtones.

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:21.540 align:middle line:84%
No one's found a
vault in Virginia yet.

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:22.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:23.210 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:26.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: So no one's found
one in Nova Scotia either.

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:29.890 align:middle line:84%
But what we do see in all
of these other schemes

00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:34.640 align:middle line:84%
and treasure legends, I
found an octagonal structure,

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:38.320 align:middle line:84%
a tower, if it wasn't
an octagonal tower,

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:39.820 align:middle line:84%
they would have
different structures

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:42.410 align:middle line:84%
that referenced older
structures at this period.

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:47.090 align:middle line:84%
Now we're up to the
18th century, the 1700s.

00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:48.900 align:middle line:84%
The young men
discovered the money pit

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:53.960 align:middle line:84%
right at about the turn of
the century to the 1800s.

00:25:53.960 --> 00:26:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And we have Prince Edward
living in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:05.200 align:middle line:84%
This is the father
of Queen Victoria.

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:09.330 align:middle line:84%
In association, there's a
very famous cartographer

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:11.360 align:middle line:90%
named Joseph Des Barres.

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:13.890 align:middle line:84%
And we see cartographers
throughout this whole story.

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:19.550 align:middle line:84%
Thomas Jefferson and, the de
Bades, James Bruce, et cetera.

00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:22.770 align:middle line:84%
So he was directly
descendant of Everard Des

00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:24.960 align:middle line:84%
Barres, the grand
commander of the Knights

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.180 align:middle line:90%
Templar at one point.

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:30.710 align:middle line:10%
And so he's buried
in the Halifax Round

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:35.200 align:middle line:10%
Church, which is a copy of
the Temple Church in London.

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.390 align:middle line:10%
And so naturally I see a
copy of the Temple Church,

00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:41.700 align:middle line:10%
I measured to see, using
an octagonal scheme,

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:43.650 align:middle line:10%
which ways it would point.

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:46.790 align:middle line:84%
The building itself was
oriented at 45 degrees,

00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:50.470 align:middle line:90%
an octagonal division of 360.

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:54.240 align:middle line:84%
So it did point to
some amazing places,

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:56.950 align:middle line:90%
including the Magdalen Islands.

00:26:56.950 --> 00:27:03.240 align:middle line:84%
It pointed to Scone, where
the Stone of Scone is from,

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:06.220 align:middle line:84%
and the tale of how Scottish
monarchs are crowned.

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:08.870 align:middle line:90%
And that's the Stone of Destiny.

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of sources even
say that's from the temple

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:12.940 align:middle line:90%
treasure.

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:15.006 align:middle line:90%
So it's all temple treasure.

00:27:15.006 --> 00:27:16.380 align:middle line:84%
In a lot of these
quests, you see

00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:19.890 align:middle line:84%
nothing but questing
for the Holy Rood,

00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:21.710 align:middle line:84%
questing for the
Spear of Destiny.

00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:22.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:23.968 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: The Ark
of the Covenant,

00:27:23.968 --> 00:27:26.170 align:middle line:84%
or the menorah from
the temple treasure.

00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:28.470 align:middle line:84%
So there's always
an item like that

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:29.810 align:middle line:90%
that's part of what's going on.

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:30.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A sacred artifact.

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:31.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: Exactly.

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:33.920 align:middle line:84%
In this case, a lot of
thing, and other authors

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:36.800 align:middle line:84%
like Petter Amundsen
speculate that it's

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:40.560 align:middle line:84%
the Ark of the Covenant
that was hidden there.

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:44.280 align:middle line:84%
So the structures in
Halifax indicate this too.

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:49.110 align:middle line:84%
Prince Edward also built what
is known of as a Martello tower,

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:51.410 align:middle line:90%
which is a defensive structure.

00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:55.770 align:middle line:84%
But it's round and it had
even divisions of architecture

00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:57.160 align:middle line:90%
you can see from plan view.

00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:00.360 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to
measure that as well.

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:03.029 align:middle line:84%
And this pointed to
Lalibela, Ethiopia.

00:28:03.029 --> 00:28:05.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's where I
was going to actually go

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:06.560 align:middle line:90%
next in the conversation.

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:09.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: And that's how
tall the famous rock hewn

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:11.500 align:middle line:84%
church, and the
Ark of the Covenant

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:13.620 align:middle line:90%
once rested in Lalibela.

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And is supposed to still
be in Ethiopia, according

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.210 align:middle line:90%
to the Old Testament.

00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:21.120 align:middle line:84%
So that's an interesting
association using

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:23.860 align:middle line:84%
the same octagonal
division, the Martello tower

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:28.910 align:middle line:84%
points to the Saint George
Round Church in Halifax.

00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:31.450 align:middle line:84%
So it points to the Saint
George Round Church--

00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:32.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The Church of Halifax?

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:37.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: It's the Saint
George Round Church of Halifax.

00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:38.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And what does that have to
do with the cartographer?

00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:43.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: Well he was--

00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:45.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Atlantic
Neptune, right.

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:46.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: Right.

00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:48.900 align:middle line:84%
He's likely the one who
planned this entire scheme

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:51.160 align:middle line:90%
for Prince Edward.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.880 align:middle line:84%
Because he had the
capacity to do so.

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:53.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:56.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: Prince Edward may
have been able to do that.

00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:58.180 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure he was
privy to what was

00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:00.020 align:middle line:90%
going on given his background.

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:02.550 align:middle line:84%
He's directly descendant
of Frederick II, Holy Roman

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:03.350 align:middle line:90%
Emperor.

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:05.154 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so now
we're seeing how--

00:29:05.154 --> 00:29:06.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: The lineage goes.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:09.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --these family
trees branch out considerably.

00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:10.250 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:14.520 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned Ethiopia,
and I wanted to get there.

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:17.700 align:middle line:84%
How the Coptic and Ethiopian
settlers came into play.

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:21.460 align:middle line:84%
Also, James Bruce, who
brought back the Book of Enoch

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:22.340 align:middle line:90%
from Africa.

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:23.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: And that's going
to, believe it or not,

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:25.100 align:middle line:90%
bring us back to Halifax again.

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:25.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:26.220 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:27.840 align:middle line:84%
So I just had to
get those pieces in.

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:29.070 align:middle line:90%
So bring us back full circle.

00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:29.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: Right.

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:31.870 align:middle line:10%
Well, in Ethiopia,
in Lalibela, they

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:33.430 align:middle line:10%
have the rock hewn churches.

00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And we know in Aksum is where
the real Ark of the Covenant

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:40.490 align:middle line:84%
is said to be by the
Ethiopian Orthodox Church.

00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:41.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:43.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: I meant to stress
too that the Martello tower that

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:47.170 align:middle line:84%
points to the Saint
George Church in Halifax

00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:50.790 align:middle line:84%
also points to the Saint
George Church in Lalibela.

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:54.020 align:middle line:84%
It even points to a
church with the same name.

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:55.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting, OK.

00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:57.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: So what
I believe, these

00:29:57.260 --> 00:30:03.010 align:middle line:84%
are the clues being left
behind by Joseph Des Barres.

00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:07.360 align:middle line:84%
Maybe under the auspices
of Prince Edward,

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:09.470 align:middle line:90%
who is the descendant as well.

00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:13.590 align:middle line:84%
So it's interesting that none
of those point to Oak Island.

00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:17.330 align:middle line:84%
But we do have is Des Barres'
plan, the street plans,

00:30:17.330 --> 00:30:20.050 align:middle line:90%
of several towns in Nova Scotia.

00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:22.440 align:middle line:84%
And if you go to the
nearest town to Oak Island,

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:23.550 align:middle line:90%
it's called Lulenburg.

00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:28.100 align:middle line:84%
This is named after one of the
German titles of Prince Edward.

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And that was composed of
all German settlers as well.

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:36.080 align:middle line:84%
So that's another possible,
just hearkening us

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:40.090 align:middle line:84%
back to Frederick and Prince
Rupert of the Rhine as well.

00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:42.950 align:middle line:84%
Because he was also a
descendant of Frederick II,

00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:46.510 align:middle line:84%
and he was the first governor of
the Hudson's Bay Company, which

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:48.100 align:middle line:84%
is the property
that I believe was

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:50.730 align:middle line:84%
claimed from the
International Peace Garden.

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:52.660 align:middle line:84%
So these are some
of the rationales.

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:55.640 align:middle line:84%
I just see all of these
places being controlled

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:59.430 align:middle line:84%
by the descendants of Frederick,
even though they're English.

00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:02.170 align:middle line:84%
Because of the
Hanoverian-- I mean,

00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:06.390 align:middle line:84%
Prince Edward was schooled
and his primary language

00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:08.850 align:middle line:90%
was German.

00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:13.670 align:middle line:84%
George I and II both didn't
even speak English very well.

00:31:13.670 --> 00:31:16.550 align:middle line:90%
So they were Germans.

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:18.780 align:middle line:84%
They cared for England
and represented England

00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:22.530 align:middle line:84%
as monarchs, but they still
had this heritage and tradition

00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:23.330 align:middle line:90%
involved.

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:27.660 align:middle line:84%
And we go to the Heidelberg
estate of Prince Rupert,

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:30.170 align:middle line:84%
and he has an octagon that
points to the International

00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:31.730 align:middle line:90%
Peace Garden.

00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And he was the governor of
the Hudson's Bay Company,

00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:36.450 align:middle line:90%
the first governor.

00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:39.090 align:middle line:84%
Then even later, you
see the Douglas family

00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:41.500 align:middle line:84%
take over the Hudson's Bay
Company and control it.

00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:42.340 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:46.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's go back
to the Coptic and Ethiopian

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:46.840 align:middle line:90%
settlers.

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:47.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: OK.

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:48.790 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's kind of the root.

00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And this links us in
with Theodora again.

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:58.500 align:middle line:84%
Even the Ethiopian
ruler refers to himself

00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:01.470 align:middle line:84%
as the keeper of the
bounds of Alexandria,

00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:04.340 align:middle line:90%
the boundaries of Alexandria.

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:07.670 align:middle line:84%
So he's telling you
he is like the pope

00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:12.280 align:middle line:84%
of the entire Coptic church, of
the Orthodox Church in Egypt,

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:16.090 align:middle line:84%
which is known to have some
more mystical overtones,

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:19.530 align:middle line:84%
a little bit more Gnosticism
involved than the Orthodox

00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:20.720 align:middle line:90%
Church.

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:22.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
too, because you even

00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:26.597 align:middle line:84%
see some of these concepts
surfacing in Rastafari.

00:32:26.597 --> 00:32:27.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:28.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: Yes.

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:29.930 align:middle line:84%
Their value of
the Star of David,

00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:33.360 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of the concepts--
certain sects of Rastafari,

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:34.660 align:middle line:90%
not all of them.

00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:37.760 align:middle line:84%
But they do reference
Haile Selassie

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:42.200 align:middle line:84%
being descendant of King Solomon
in the story of the ark coming

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.810 align:middle line:90%
to Ethiopia.

00:32:43.810 --> 00:32:47.170 align:middle line:84%
Moloch, the son of King
Solomon and the Queen of Sheba,

00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:51.190 align:middle line:90%
brought the ark to Ethiopia.

00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:53.580 align:middle line:90%
So this links back again.

00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:58.460 align:middle line:84%
We have Lord Halifax,
the namesake of Halifax,

00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:01.820 align:middle line:84%
Nova Scotia, was good
friends with a man

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:04.530 align:middle line:84%
named James Bruce, who was
the descendant of Robert

00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:08.670 align:middle line:84%
the Bruce, the first
King of Scotland.

00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:11.990 align:middle line:84%
He is most famous
for going to Ethiopia

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:16.450 align:middle line:84%
and bringing back ancient
copies of the Book of Enoch.

00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:19.070 align:middle line:84%
And studying in
Alexandria and finding

00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:21.410 align:middle line:84%
documents that
would become what's

00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:24.020 align:middle line:84%
known as the Pistis
Sophia later.

00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And this is referring to
Sophia, the niece of Theodora,

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:31.040 align:middle line:84%
who was wearing the Coptic
tunic patches in the--

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:31.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: So it's all
coming full circle.

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:38.160 align:middle line:84%
But what's amazing is James
Bruce's book about Ethiopia

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:42.140 align:middle line:84%
was mostly composed of
letters the Lord Halifax.

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:44.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, this was
the rage in Masonic circles,

00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:45.980 align:middle line:90%
as you write about in your book.

00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:46.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: Sure.

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:46.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:49.100 align:middle line:84%
So let's just keep laying the
foundation so we understand.

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:49.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: Right.

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:52.250 align:middle line:84%
The Enochian thing-- they later
went to a more Solomonic kind

00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:54.470 align:middle line:84%
of-- Freemasons have
told me this even,

00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:58.686 align:middle line:84%
that earlier, that
some of the ceremony

00:33:58.686 --> 00:34:01.720 align:middle line:84%
revolved around
Enochian concepts more,

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:05.750 align:middle line:84%
with the nine layer chamber, and
the Pillars of Boaz and Jachin,

00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:07.120 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:09.989 align:middle line:84%
But later went to a more
Solomonic representation

00:34:09.989 --> 00:34:12.790 align:middle line:84%
that valued the Ark
of the Covenant.

00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:16.040 align:middle line:84%
So this could even tie to
Oak Island with the pit,

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:17.100 align:middle line:90%
with the chambers.

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:20.650 align:middle line:84%
It's just like the Book
of Enoch in metaphor

00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:22.529 align:middle line:84%
that we're seeing
in a lot of ways.

00:34:22.529 --> 00:34:23.820 align:middle line:90%
And this is one of the things--

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:26.195 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So who did he bring
these back-- who would have

00:34:26.195 --> 00:34:27.590 align:middle line:90%
been his compadres of the day.

00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:28.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: James Bruce?

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:29.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:32.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: Well, he gave one of
the copies to Louis the 16th.

00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:35.130 align:middle line:84%
So that will tell you
something right there.

00:34:35.130 --> 00:34:38.449 align:middle line:84%
There's the value of Mary
Queen of Scots, because

00:34:38.449 --> 00:34:40.810 align:middle line:84%
of her French connections
and French education

00:34:40.810 --> 00:34:42.210 align:middle line:90%
and French mother.

00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:45.320 align:middle line:84%
And you always see through
history a huge connection

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:47.409 align:middle line:90%
between Scotland and France.

00:34:47.409 --> 00:34:49.800 align:middle line:84%
There's even the Fleur de
lis on the Scottish arms

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:50.600 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:51.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:53.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: So the James Douglas,
even, the Black Douglas,

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:57.760 align:middle line:84%
was educated in France just
like Sir Francis Bacon was.

00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:01.180 align:middle line:84%
So there's always the
French connection,

00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:03.590 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, in all of
this, even in Scotland,

00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:06.680 align:middle line:84%
where a lot of people wouldn't
think that would be true.

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:09.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So can we hop
this over to the Americas,

00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:15.310 align:middle line:84%
and who would have been the
primary people of interest

00:35:15.310 --> 00:35:18.200 align:middle line:84%
having to do with Oak Island,
and then moving further south?

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:19.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: Right.

00:35:19.090 --> 00:35:21.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have Lord
Halifax, whose real name

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:24.190 align:middle line:90%
is Lord Montagu-Dunk.

00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And he only accepted
the Dunk part

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:28.750 align:middle line:84%
because his wife's
father demanded

00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:31.060 align:middle line:84%
that he put the hyphen
there and add that name.

00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:32.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:34.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: Otherwise his
name would have been Montagu.

00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And they have a
very interesting--

00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:40.000 align:middle line:90%
another Frederick II story.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.540 align:middle line:84%
At his wedding to
Eleanor, at the time,

00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:47.300 align:middle line:84%
the grand commanders
of the Knights

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:53.030 align:middle line:84%
of Malta and the Knights Templar
were both named Pedro Montagu.

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:54.560 align:middle line:90%
They both had the same name.

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting, yeah.

00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:58.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: They both
refused to be seen together

00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:00.800 align:middle line:90%
at Frederick II's wedding.

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:01.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Uh-huh.

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:03.040 align:middle line:90%
Go figure.

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:04.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: Are they
the same person or not?

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:04.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are they the
same person, right.

00:36:04.610 --> 00:36:05.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: But could be.

00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:08.840 align:middle line:84%
That would be a scam,
or royal scam, big time

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.280 align:middle line:90%
there if that were true.

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:12.560 align:middle line:84%
But that's the degree
of family we're

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:15.700 align:middle line:90%
talking about with Lord Halifax.

00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:17.600 align:middle line:84%
So the fact that
he was associated

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:20.340 align:middle line:84%
with Bruce and these
Enochian concepts,

00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:23.730 align:middle line:84%
and was even a sponsor
of James Bruce.

00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:26.890 align:middle line:10%
And one interesting story
about James Bruce, in Ethiopia,

00:36:26.890 --> 00:36:29.880 align:middle line:10%
he examined the
Kebra Nagast, which

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:32.850 align:middle line:10%
is the Ethiopian Book of Kings.

00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:36.070 align:middle line:10%
And he found a King born
97 years before Christ

00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:38.230 align:middle line:10%
with the name Bruce.

00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:42.310 align:middle line:84%
Spelled in the Scots
way even, Brus.

00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:45.270 align:middle line:84%
So here's the
Declaration of Arbroath

00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:49.150 align:middle line:84%
becoming real to James
Bruce in may ways.

00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:51.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:51.310 --> 00:36:55.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: My brother's named
Bruce, so I call him that too.

00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:56.610 align:middle line:90%
But it's interesting.

00:36:56.610 --> 00:36:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And all the connections always
go back to Frederick II.

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:02.710 align:middle line:84%
There is some lineage between
Montagu, for instance,

00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:06.550 align:middle line:84%
with these two grand
commanders that go to that.

00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:10.440 align:middle line:84%
You go south to Williamsburg,
and the Montagu family

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:13.260 align:middle line:84%
was among the first
families of Virginia.

00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:15.620 align:middle line:84%
They're another one of
these factions of families

00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:18.730 align:middle line:84%
that are considered to
be clandestine Catholics,

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:20.280 align:middle line:84%
because at first,
Catholics weren't

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:23.400 align:middle line:90%
allowed to go to Virginia.

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:25.330 align:middle line:84%
But later, they
came to dominate it

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:30.130 align:middle line:84%
under what's known as Cavalier
culture of Charles I and II.

00:37:30.130 --> 00:37:32.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
Captain Archer and all

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:35.230 align:middle line:84%
of the legend of
Bacon's vault develops

00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:40.810 align:middle line:84%
during this time, which is
based on Nathaniel Bacon leading

00:37:40.810 --> 00:37:44.750 align:middle line:84%
the revolution or a
revolt against what

00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:47.070 align:middle line:84%
would be considered
the newer, more

00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:49.700 align:middle line:90%
Catholic oriented settlers.

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:51.060 align:middle line:90%
That's my interpretation.

00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:53.330 align:middle line:84%
That's not the historical
interpretation.

00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:55.270 align:middle line:84%
There's other
reasons, but to me,

00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:57.400 align:middle line:84%
if you look at the people
on either side, that's

00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:01.330 align:middle line:84%
kind of-- you almost have
Rosicrucians fighting

00:38:01.330 --> 00:38:05.430 align:middle line:84%
against people they knew who
were related to the Jesuits

00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:07.400 align:middle line:90%
and Catholic interests.

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:10.630 align:middle line:84%
And so past that
point, the legend

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:15.910 align:middle line:84%
develops where he deposited a
vault of Sir Francis Bacon's

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:20.970 align:middle line:84%
papers under the
church in Jamestown.

00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And so the first churches where
Gabriel Archer was buried,

00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:28.710 align:middle line:84%
and the reliquary was
even dug up recently.

00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And one of the locations
where Bacon's was supposed

00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:34.560 align:middle line:90%
to be, this was dug up.

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:36.670 align:middle line:84%
So it would be really
interesting to know

00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:39.050 align:middle line:84%
if we could somehow
find out whose

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:40.540 align:middle line:90%
bones were in that reliquary.

00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:41.784 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:38:41.784 --> 00:38:43.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: Because I
would like to think

00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:46.630 align:middle line:84%
it was Saint James, because his
cousin was a priest in Santiago

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:47.430 align:middle line:90%
de Compostela.

00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:48.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:53.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: That's and outrageous
view, but it could be true.

00:38:53.850 --> 00:38:56.850 align:middle line:84%
But it would be interesting
to see what that means.

00:38:56.850 --> 00:38:58.600 align:middle line:84%
And even currently,
this summer, they're

00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:01.310 align:middle line:84%
going to dig up the
second church that

00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:04.680 align:middle line:84%
was built in 1617,
which the vault-- it's

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:08.420 align:middle line:84%
another potential vault location
that archeologists at Jamestown

00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:11.700 align:middle line:84%
are actually going to excavate
the interior of the church.

00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:12.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:13.130 align:middle line:90%
In Jamestown?

00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:13.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: This summer.

00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:14.130 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:39:14.130 --> 00:39:15.046 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:39:15.046 --> 00:39:16.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, we'll have to
check in with you

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:18.370 align:middle line:84%
after all these things
happen, because I know

00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:18.880 align:middle line:90%
you're writing another book.

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:21.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: They may be even
reacting to the legends.

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:25.090 align:middle line:84%
So everywhere lately
they've been digging,

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:27.140 align:middle line:84%
they've been looking
at places that

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:31.500 align:middle line:84%
even have all the folklore of
Bacon's vault, which is later.

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:33.790 align:middle line:84%
Again, here's even
another story.

00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:35.340 align:middle line:84%
It was moved to
the Bruton Parish

00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:39.170 align:middle line:84%
Church in the colonial
array there, right

00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:40.877 align:middle line:90%
near the powder magazine.

00:39:40.877 --> 00:39:42.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us about
the powder magazine.

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:43.585 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: Certainly.

00:39:43.585 --> 00:39:47.190 align:middle line:84%
In Williamsburg, you have
the first linear park

00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:49.160 align:middle line:90%
in North America.

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:50.390 align:middle line:90%
Just like the National Mall--

00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:50.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: National Mall in DC.

00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:52.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: --or the
International Peace Garden

00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:52.890 align:middle line:90%
later.

00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:53.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:55.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: And the Wren
Building of William and Mary

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:58.130 align:middle line:84%
comprises the western
end of it, which

00:39:58.130 --> 00:40:00.630 align:middle line:84%
is one of the oldest college
buildings in the United States.

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:01.671 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, beautiful.

00:40:01.671 --> 00:40:03.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: And then the
Bruton Parish Church

00:40:03.590 --> 00:40:05.640 align:middle line:90%
is part of the alignment.

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:09.150 align:middle line:84%
The octagonal powder magazine,
the colonial governor's

00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:11.090 align:middle line:84%
mansion, and the
colonial capitol,

00:40:11.090 --> 00:40:13.040 align:middle line:90%
the House of Burgesses.

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:17.620 align:middle line:84%
So this is the archetype of
almost every state capitol

00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:18.670 align:middle line:90%
that we see today.

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:20.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:40:20.830 --> 00:40:22.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: And it
also repeats again.

00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:25.790 align:middle line:84%
The octagon's there,
the linear array.

00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:29.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean this is a copy of what's
at Stirling Castle, what they

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:31.180 align:middle line:90%
did in Williamsburg, basically.

00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:33.310 align:middle line:84%
They have the Kings
Knot at Stirling.

00:40:33.310 --> 00:40:36.290 align:middle line:84%
Other architecture
that relates to a hint

00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:38.160 align:middle line:84%
that they're telling
you some mystery there.

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:41.080 align:middle line:90%


00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:43.110 align:middle line:84%
Bacon's vault is so
interesting, because it even

00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:45.050 align:middle line:90%
involves Manly Hall.

00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:47.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Manly P.-- OK, how?

00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:50.654 align:middle line:84%
And we haven't even gotten
to some of the big boys, some

00:40:50.654 --> 00:40:51.820 align:middle line:90%
of the founding fathers yet.

00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:53.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: Well, we
can come back to them.

00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:54.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We will, but
let's talk about how

00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:55.260 align:middle line:90%
Manly P. Hall is involved.

00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:56.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: Well,
his wife supposed

00:40:56.700 --> 00:41:00.110 align:middle line:84%
that-- the legend of the
vault's always been there,

00:41:00.110 --> 00:41:03.090 align:middle line:84%
but she supposed that it was
actually at the Bruton Parish

00:41:03.090 --> 00:41:08.220 align:middle line:84%
Church based on designs
in a book of emblems

00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:09.970 align:middle line:90%
that were very popular.

00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And she supposed that
Sir Francis Bacon

00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:15.620 align:middle line:90%
had produced this book.

00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:18.000 align:middle line:84%
And so there's designs
on the headstones there

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.310 align:middle line:84%
that tell the story of
the Ark of the Covenant

00:41:20.310 --> 00:41:22.270 align:middle line:90%
when compared to this book.

00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:26.420 align:middle line:84%
Because the book also includes
poetry with each design.

00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:29.110 align:middle line:10%
And as I looked into
that, I was amazed

00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:34.700 align:middle line:10%
to find the remains of Truxton
Beale interred in the Bruton

00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:36.810 align:middle line:10%
Parish churchyard.

00:41:36.810 --> 00:41:39.750 align:middle line:10%
And he was from the
early 20th century

00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:43.270 align:middle line:10%
and was born in San Francisco.

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:45.030 align:middle line:84%
So he's telling you
something there.

00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:48.790 align:middle line:84%
He's directly descendant of
Thomas Beale on the brass

00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:52.060 align:middle line:84%
plaque inside the church, who
was the first Sheriff of York

00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:53.430 align:middle line:90%
County.

00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:57.070 align:middle line:84%
This is the origins and
genesis of the Beale treasure

00:41:57.070 --> 00:42:00.160 align:middle line:84%
legend using the same
template that they

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:02.710 align:middle line:84%
knew from the Legend
of Bacon's Vault

00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:07.630 align:middle line:84%
in this array of architecture
that was in Williamsburg.

00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
powder magazine

00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:11.910 align:middle line:90%
has pointing attributes.

00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:14.210 align:middle line:84%
And it points to the
International Peace Garden

00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:16.520 align:middle line:84%
to a masonic compass
and square shaped

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:19.890 align:middle line:90%
building that points back.

00:42:19.890 --> 00:42:22.200 align:middle line:84%
Just like the Vatican
and the Dome of the Rock.

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:23.910 align:middle line:84%
These two structures
were oriented

00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:25.090 align:middle line:90%
to point to each other.

00:42:25.090 --> 00:42:26.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Each other, yes.

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:28.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: So they're
telling you clues there too.

00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:31.520 align:middle line:84%
So it is confusing,
but what I'm telling

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:33.070 align:middle line:84%
you is all of these
treasure myths

00:42:33.070 --> 00:42:34.390 align:middle line:90%
are just the same template.

00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And there's probably
not a real treasure.

00:42:36.250 --> 00:42:38.125 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they're
pointing to each other.

00:42:38.125 --> 00:42:42.950 align:middle line:84%
And I want to go to the
larger, overarching story.

00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:45.170 align:middle line:84%
But first, let's get
to Thomas Jefferson

00:42:45.170 --> 00:42:46.530 align:middle line:90%
and how he factors in.

00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:48.000 align:middle line:90%
Also, Benjamin Franklin.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:48.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: OK.

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:52.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, I believe Thomas
Jefferson was initiated

00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:56.980 align:middle line:84%
into this knowledge because he
possessed the correct family

00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:58.210 align:middle line:90%
lineage.

00:42:58.210 --> 00:43:00.360 align:middle line:84%
I found he was related
to the people who

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:04.580 align:middle line:84%
likely built the Newport
Tower, the Easton family.

00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:07.350 align:middle line:90%
And this is evidenced later.

00:43:07.350 --> 00:43:09.280 align:middle line:84%
You can see right in
genealogy that this

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:11.700 align:middle line:90%
is part of his mother's family.

00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:15.270 align:middle line:84%
But then he named one of
his Hemings sons Eston,

00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:18.200 align:middle line:84%
after the de Eston family,
where the name Easton came from.

00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:19.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.166 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: And those were
two of the first governors

00:43:21.166 --> 00:43:26.130 align:middle line:84%
of Rhode Island that hired a
windmill maker named Stafford

00:43:26.130 --> 00:43:28.000 align:middle line:90%
that worked for them.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And if you go to
Western Massachusetts,

00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:33.070 align:middle line:84%
there's a reproduction of
the Newport Tower dedicated

00:43:33.070 --> 00:43:35.510 align:middle line:90%
to Thomas Stafford.

00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:40.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And Stafford is
where the other artifact is,

00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:41.750 align:middle line:90%
the Shuborough--

00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:43.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: The Shugborough Hall.

00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:45.952 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Shugborough
Hall, yes, is in Stafford.

00:43:45.952 --> 00:43:47.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: And all the names.

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:48.410 align:middle line:90%
No, that's the way they do it.

00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:50.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know, but this
is-- that's why my mind was

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:53.120 align:middle line:84%
just so overwhelmed
researching this, trying

00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:55.960 align:middle line:90%
to see how these all connected.

00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:59.160 align:middle line:90%
Not as orderly as a spider web.

00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:01.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: An
erratic spider web.

00:44:01.350 --> 00:44:04.920 align:middle line:84%
But to me, the fact that the
reproduction of the Newport

00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:08.900 align:middle line:84%
Tower was named after the
same man who built windmills

00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:13.020 align:middle line:84%
in Newport, Rhode Island during
the era when it was supposed

00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:14.920 align:middle line:84%
to have been built. I
mean, standard history

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:19.596 align:middle line:84%
tells us Benedict Arnold
Senior built the Newport Tower.

00:44:19.596 --> 00:44:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And all of this supposition
about Vikings or earlier people

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.190 align:middle line:84%
may relate to what
I was saying before,

00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:29.030 align:middle line:84%
the fact that this may
have been a point of claim

00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:32.410 align:middle line:84%
from Frederick II,
whose men probably just

00:44:32.410 --> 00:44:36.260 align:middle line:84%
left a Cairn of stones
there that were later used

00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:39.030 align:middle line:90%
to partially build the tower.

00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:43.190 align:middle line:84%
That it was a memorial to this
claiming that it happened.

00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of this
that confuses everybody,

00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:49.380 align:middle line:84%
because they all say, no,
they built that later.

00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:50.410 align:middle line:90%
That can't mean that.

00:44:50.410 --> 00:44:52.240 align:middle line:84%
But I'm like, their
descendants built it.

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:54.080 align:middle line:90%
You can see the same people.

00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:55.291 align:middle line:90%
So it infers that.

00:44:55.291 --> 00:44:57.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So even if we can't
remember the names, the dates,

00:44:57.790 --> 00:45:00.410 align:middle line:84%
and the locations, we
get the general picture

00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:02.170 align:middle line:90%
of the bloodlines.

00:45:02.170 --> 00:45:02.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: Right.

00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:07.440 align:middle line:84%
So Thomas Jefferson took
this tradition, or somebody

00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:10.040 align:middle line:84%
recognized this in
him and initiated him

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:12.900 align:middle line:84%
into the mysteries of
the powder magazine.

00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:15.520 align:middle line:90%
This is my theory.

00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:17.820 align:middle line:84%
So eventually, of
course, he goes on

00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:20.390 align:middle line:84%
to build three other
octagonal structures--

00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:25.190 align:middle line:84%
Poplar Forest, Monticello,
and the Barboursville Mansion.

00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:27.600 align:middle line:84%
And the Barboursville
Mansion is so interesting,

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:31.950 align:middle line:84%
because it points
to Avebury Circle

00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:35.980 align:middle line:84%
and the hexagon of Baalbek
in one arc on the globe.

00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:36.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:38.196 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: And
this is a structure

00:45:38.196 --> 00:45:40.530 align:middle line:84%
that he designed for
his friend Barbour, who

00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:42.660 align:middle line:90%
was the governor of Virginia.

00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's in ruins now,
but the octagonal portion

00:45:45.150 --> 00:45:46.540 align:middle line:90%
is still there.

00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And you can see Monticello
and both Poplar Forest point

00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:51.160 align:middle line:90%
very close to it.

00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:54.930 align:middle line:84%
So he even aligned the octagons
that he built, I believe,

00:45:54.930 --> 00:45:57.070 align:middle line:90%
roughly.

00:45:57.070 --> 00:46:03.110 align:middle line:84%
Even James Madison's
Montpelier points to Monticello

00:46:03.110 --> 00:46:04.150 align:middle line:90%
if you draw an arc.

00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:07.545 align:middle line:84%
So there was even an
octagon recently found

00:46:07.545 --> 00:46:09.755 align:middle line:84%
at Montpelier, which
is, of course--

00:46:09.755 --> 00:46:10.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Another initiate.

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:12.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: --named for the
capital of the Languedoc--

00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:13.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:14.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: --Montpellier.

00:46:14.450 --> 00:46:15.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:46:15.250 --> 00:46:17.340 align:middle line:84%
And so the Ansons,
Admiral Anson--

00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:18.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: Right.

00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:20.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, that's, again,
the Shugborough follies

00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:23.220 align:middle line:90%
in Stafford, England.

00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:26.520 align:middle line:84%
How is he related then to
Charleston, South Carolina?

00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:27.890 align:middle line:90%
How does that play together?

00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:28.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: OK.

00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:32.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, Admiral Anson
was an amazing person.

00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:35.760 align:middle line:84%
Another one of these people
that you never hear of.

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:39.120 align:middle line:84%
He was the third Englishman
to circumnavigate.

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:43.630 align:middle line:84%
In so doing, he lost
five ships and 700 men.

00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:50.930 align:middle line:84%
He managed to attack and capture
the Manila treasure galleon

00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:53.440 align:middle line:84%
from the Spanish and
returned to England,

00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:59.080 align:middle line:84%
after circling the world, a
hero, and now very wealthy.

00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And he was awarded High
Admiral eventually.

00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:07.260 align:middle line:84%
And he built the follies
at Shugborough hall.

00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:09.620 align:middle line:84%
He changed the design
of the building

00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:12.270 align:middle line:84%
to a popular palladium
form of architecture

00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:15.640 align:middle line:84%
that Thomas Jefferson
also later used.

00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:19.590 align:middle line:84%
He built the Tower of the Winds
and the Shepherd's Monument.

00:47:19.590 --> 00:47:21.280 align:middle line:84%
Incidentally, the
Shepherd's Monument

00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:23.430 align:middle line:84%
points to the International
Peace Garden--

00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:23.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:47:23.770 --> 00:47:24.570 align:middle line:90%
Again, here we go.

00:47:24.570 --> 00:47:26.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: --and Anson's
grave in the other direction.

00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:30.415 align:middle line:84%
So there's our
funerary overlay that

00:47:30.415 --> 00:47:32.550 align:middle line:90%
is one of the factors involved.

00:47:32.550 --> 00:47:34.745 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And how does he
fit in with Charleston?

00:47:34.745 --> 00:47:36.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: Well, he
used to live there.

00:47:36.370 --> 00:47:38.500 align:middle line:84%
Earlier in his career
when he was a captain,

00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:41.780 align:middle line:84%
he was stationed in
Charleston, South Carolina.

00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:44.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what are the
kind of mystical properties

00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:45.800 align:middle line:90%
present in Charleston?

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:47.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: Well,
they have-- my friend

00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:54.110 align:middle line:84%
John Kerr wrote a book about
the star map of Charleston.

00:47:54.110 --> 00:47:56.010 align:middle line:84%
And he sees an
Orion pattern there

00:47:56.010 --> 00:47:59.680 align:middle line:84%
like Gary David talks
about a lot as well.

00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:05.110 align:middle line:84%
But what I saw there were a part
of town was named after Admiral

00:48:05.110 --> 00:48:07.650 align:middle line:84%
Anson, called Ansonborough,
that he won in a card

00:48:07.650 --> 00:48:09.090 align:middle line:90%
game, which is a funny story.

00:48:09.090 --> 00:48:13.530 align:middle line:10%
Because supposedly, he played
cards in the Tower of the Winds

00:48:13.530 --> 00:48:14.330 align:middle line:10%
at his estate.

00:48:14.330 --> 00:48:17.260 align:middle line:90%
That's what he built it for.

00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:19.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Maybe it
brought him good luck.

00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:20.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: Exactly.

00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:23.160 align:middle line:84%
So it's funny that part of
Charleston is named for him,

00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:25.120 align:middle line:84%
but really, the big
connection in Charleston

00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:27.750 align:middle line:90%
are the Montagus again.

00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:31.730 align:middle line:84%
You have another Montagu who
was the last English governor

00:48:31.730 --> 00:48:33.650 align:middle line:90%
before the Revolution.

00:48:33.650 --> 00:48:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And then a direct
relationship of him

00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:41.640 align:middle line:84%
named Drayton was the
first American governor.

00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And the Draytons are
from the de Vere family.

00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:47.470 align:middle line:90%
And they are de Veres.

00:48:47.470 --> 00:48:49.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:51.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: The de
Veer estate in England

00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:53.700 align:middle line:90%
is called Drayton House.

00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:55.620 align:middle line:84%
So when they came to
America, they just

00:48:55.620 --> 00:48:58.940 align:middle line:84%
adopted the name
Drayton as that.

00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:02.020 align:middle line:84%
And they built Drayton
Hall in Charleston.

00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:06.220 align:middle line:84%
And Drayton Hall points to
Oak Island, Nova Scotia.

00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:07.910 align:middle line:84%
So later in
Charleston, they built

00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:12.480 align:middle line:84%
an octagonal City Plaza
called Washington Square that

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:14.157 align:middle line:90%
points to Oak Island.

00:49:14.157 --> 00:49:14.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All right.

00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:15.280 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:17.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: And it also
points-- we may see this later

00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:20.690 align:middle line:84%
if we get to it-- in
my hometown of Chico,

00:49:20.690 --> 00:49:24.630 align:middle line:84%
the City Plaza points to
a Cistercian monastery.

00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:26.520 align:middle line:84%
The City Plaza in
Charleston also

00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:28.590 align:middle line:84%
points to a
Cistercian monastery.

00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:31.240 align:middle line:84%
And we all know that the
Knights Templar sprang

00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:33.570 align:middle line:90%
from the Cistercian order.

00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:34.749 align:middle line:90%
So at least in name and--

00:49:34.749 --> 00:49:37.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But who would have
thought Chico, California?

00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:38.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: Right.

00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:41.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Hearst
family and the legacy

00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:46.180 align:middle line:84%
of what's going on there kind
of solidify the talismanic value

00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:47.240 align:middle line:90%
of what's going on there.

00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:48.710 align:middle line:84%
But we'll get to
that if we have time.

00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:49.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:50.080 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:52.454 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's so much more
to cover and so little time.

00:49:52.454 --> 00:49:55.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go
past some of this.

00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:57.350 align:middle line:84%
I want to-- because
one of the areas that

00:49:57.350 --> 00:50:00.140 align:middle line:84%
intrigued me was the
connection between the Dome

00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:03.520 align:middle line:84%
of the Rock, Coral Castle,
and the Georgia Guidestones.

00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:06.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, our viewers certainly
know about these areas.

00:50:06.660 --> 00:50:08.560 align:middle line:84%
How do they relate
to one another?

00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:09.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: OK.

00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:12.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, earlier I discussed
how the Dome of the Rock

00:50:12.570 --> 00:50:14.060 align:middle line:90%
points to the Solomon Islands.

00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:14.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:16.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: And it may have even
been named that way because--

00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:18.076 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, King Solomon.

00:50:18.076 --> 00:50:21.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: --I saw of claim
by the Portuguese and Spanish

00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:23.440 align:middle line:84%
pilots that they
would try to align it

00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:26.090 align:middle line:84%
with the Dome of the
Rock, the Vatican,

00:50:26.090 --> 00:50:28.360 align:middle line:84%
and in one case, even
Baalbek, I believe,

00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:31.020 align:middle line:84%
because they couldn't access
an azimuth from either one

00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:32.590 align:middle line:90%
of the other ones.

00:50:32.590 --> 00:50:36.030 align:middle line:84%
So the sites of claim in the
Philippines match this theory.

00:50:36.030 --> 00:50:38.950 align:middle line:84%
The one in the Solomon
Islands does also.

00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:43.470 align:middle line:84%
But this brings
us to Mexico now.

00:50:43.470 --> 00:50:46.580 align:middle line:84%
The Dome of the Rock
points to the Vatican.

00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:48.100 align:middle line:90%
And the Vatican points back.

00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:51.030 align:middle line:84%
But in the complete opposite
direction from the Vatican,

00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:52.800 align:middle line:84%
we'll follow this
arc on the globe

00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:56.150 align:middle line:84%
out that goes to Southern
Florida to a place called

00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:58.220 align:middle line:90%
Coral Castle.

00:50:58.220 --> 00:51:00.850 align:middle line:84%
And now when I found this,
what is the connection here?

00:51:00.850 --> 00:51:02.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: One of the
great mysteries, yes.

00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:03.725 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: What's going on?

00:51:03.725 --> 00:51:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's a mystery place
of its own to start with.

00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And it has all of
the millennial values

00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:11.870 align:middle line:90%
that all these other places do.

00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:16.610 align:middle line:84%
It gives you a way to sight
the Pole Star, the equinoxes,

00:51:16.610 --> 00:51:20.020 align:middle line:90%
and other celestial events.

00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:22.760 align:middle line:84%
So that's interesting that he
had that included there too.

00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:26.190 align:middle line:84%
But I found if I extended
this-- so at this point,

00:51:26.190 --> 00:51:29.160 align:middle line:84%
we have the Dome of the Rock and
the Vatican pointing to Coral

00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:31.530 align:middle line:90%
Castle all in one line.

00:51:31.530 --> 00:51:33.780 align:middle line:84%
It's not even both of
them pointing separately.

00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:37.170 align:middle line:84%
It's all one points to
the other and so on.

00:51:37.170 --> 00:51:40.040 align:middle line:84%
So if I extended this
azimuth or arc on the globe,

00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:44.110 align:middle line:84%
it reaches Cozumel Island
at the point where Mexico

00:51:44.110 --> 00:51:46.900 align:middle line:90%
was claimed by the Spanish.

00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:49.460 align:middle line:84%
So it fits the whole pattern
of the legal description

00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:50.810 align:middle line:90%
of property.

00:51:50.810 --> 00:51:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And also the manipulation
and use of this,

00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:57.040 align:middle line:84%
like in an intelligence
gathering capacity,

00:51:57.040 --> 00:51:59.460 align:middle line:90%
or framework, as part of it.

00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:04.210 align:middle line:84%
As a framework for
mythology and folklore

00:52:04.210 --> 00:52:08.040 align:middle line:84%
that can be used to influence
people to some degree.

00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And some of it's their
beliefs, but some of it

00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:14.930 align:middle line:84%
can be spun into control, if you
can get other people to believe

00:52:14.930 --> 00:52:16.580 align:middle line:90%
in what you're doing.

00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:19.230 align:middle line:84%
Just the fact that other people
believe that this was the way

00:52:19.230 --> 00:52:21.700 align:middle line:84%
to claim property right
there is an acknowledgement

00:52:21.700 --> 00:52:23.350 align:middle line:90%
of what they're doing.

00:52:23.350 --> 00:52:26.210 align:middle line:84%
So it's really interesting
when you look at it that way.

00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:28.870 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: How'd the Georgia
Guidestones play in?

00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:30.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: Well, I
feel like they're

00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:33.020 align:middle line:90%
connected to Thomas Jefferson.

00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:34.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, explain that.

00:52:34.690 --> 00:52:36.660 align:middle line:84%
You and I were
both-- I was a freak

00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:39.180 align:middle line:90%
for Thomas Jefferson in my 20s.

00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:40.790 align:middle line:84%
Read everything I
could on the man.

00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:43.220 align:middle line:84%
I think I was in love
with this person.

00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:45.860 align:middle line:84%
But you were having
the same experience.

00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:48.560 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't get enough
of Thomas Jefferson.

00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:51.310 align:middle line:84%
So when you say this, you've
studied his life a great deal,

00:52:51.310 --> 00:52:53.504 align:middle line:84%
how is he connected with
the Georgia Guidestones?

00:52:53.504 --> 00:52:54.420 align:middle line:90%
I've never heard this.

00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:58.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: Well, if you examine
the, quote, commandments

00:52:58.150 --> 00:52:59.950 align:middle line:84%
that are on the
Georgia Guidestones,

00:52:59.950 --> 00:53:03.010 align:middle line:84%
they have a lot of
Jeffersonian overtones.

00:53:03.010 --> 00:53:04.830 align:middle line:84%
The way he practically
looked at things.

00:53:04.830 --> 00:53:07.790 align:middle line:84%
Even though it scares
people about the population

00:53:07.790 --> 00:53:08.730 align:middle line:90%
control issue.

00:53:08.730 --> 00:53:09.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:53:09.010 --> 00:53:10.770 align:middle line:84%
We have to calm down,
though, about that.

00:53:10.770 --> 00:53:13.770 align:middle line:84%
There are so many different ways
that it needs to be looked at.

00:53:13.770 --> 00:53:14.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: I agree.

00:53:14.790 --> 00:53:18.250 align:middle line:84%
I think it's been taken
by conservative people

00:53:18.250 --> 00:53:20.730 align:middle line:84%
and twisted out
of what it meant,

00:53:20.730 --> 00:53:22.560 align:middle line:90%
what it was meant to mean.

00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:24.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with that.

00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:26.240 align:middle line:90%
It can be many things.

00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And some of the tenets you
look at outside of that one,

00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:31.900 align:middle line:84%
you say, well of course,
that makes sense.

00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:33.300 align:middle line:90%
It's a cleaner way to live.

00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:35.550 align:middle line:90%
But go ahead.

00:53:35.550 --> 00:53:37.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: Well, the
story, or mystery,

00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:38.822 align:middle line:90%
of the Georgia Guidestones is--

00:53:38.822 --> 00:53:40.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
so controversial.

00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:41.946 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: --nobody
knows who built them

00:53:41.946 --> 00:53:43.490 align:middle line:90%
or who financed their building.

00:53:43.490 --> 00:53:47.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, we know that the granite
company in Elberton, Georgia,

00:53:47.020 --> 00:53:50.500 align:middle line:84%
were the ones who fabricated
them and directed them

00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:51.840 align:middle line:90%
on the spot.

00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:53.910 align:middle line:10%
Again, the Georgia
Guidestones gives you

00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:56.400 align:middle line:10%
a way to cite the
Pole Star and figure

00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:59.320 align:middle line:10%
the time of day using the
aperture in the roof when

00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:03.370 align:middle line:10%
the sun shines through
at noon on the equinox.

00:54:03.370 --> 00:54:06.600 align:middle line:84%
So it's just like Coral
Castle in a lot of ways.

00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:08.900 align:middle line:90%
So I looked into this.

00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:11.580 align:middle line:84%
And at first, I
found that Monticello

00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:16.090 align:middle line:84%
pointed to Elberton, not to
the Georgia Guidestones, which

00:54:16.090 --> 00:54:17.970 align:middle line:84%
are about 11 miles
north of Elberton.

00:54:17.970 --> 00:54:19.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:54:19.140 --> 00:54:21.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: But I
found that it pointed

00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:24.820 align:middle line:84%
right to the largest
freestanding granite obelisk

00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:26.500 align:middle line:90%
in existence.

00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And right in front of the
Elberton granite company

00:54:29.710 --> 00:54:32.400 align:middle line:84%
that built the
Georgia Guidestones.

00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And a part of the lore of
the Georgia Guidestones

00:54:36.610 --> 00:54:39.940 align:middle line:84%
involves RC
Christian having been

00:54:39.940 --> 00:54:43.480 align:middle line:84%
the person, or his pseudonym,
that paid for these.

00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at some of
the information about him,

00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:48.730 align:middle line:84%
a couple of the
people believe he was

00:54:48.730 --> 00:54:51.610 align:middle line:90%
from North Dakota or Minnesota.

00:54:51.610 --> 00:54:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And this is the region
of the Kensington

00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:56.970 align:middle line:84%
Runestone and the
International Peace Garden,

00:54:56.970 --> 00:54:57.950 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:54:57.950 --> 00:55:00.010 align:middle line:10%
And the International
Peace Garden

00:55:00.010 --> 00:55:02.740 align:middle line:10%
points very close to
the Georgia Guidestones,

00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:04.230 align:middle line:10%
but not directly to it.

00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:05.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:06.529 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: And we'll
see that later.

00:55:06.529 --> 00:55:08.120 align:middle line:84%
The International
Peace Garden points

00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:11.080 align:middle line:84%
to these places of
lore, other places

00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:13.390 align:middle line:84%
where there's Ark
of Covenant legends,

00:55:13.390 --> 00:55:16.440 align:middle line:84%
and the Spear of Destiny,
and things like that.

00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:18.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
things which-- we're

00:55:18.090 --> 00:55:22.071 align:middle line:84%
almost out of time-- we won't
even touch on until next time.

00:55:22.071 --> 00:55:24.070 align:middle line:84%
Because I know you have
another book coming out.

00:55:24.070 --> 00:55:25.820 align:middle line:84%
But again, the
overarching story,

00:55:25.820 --> 00:55:31.360 align:middle line:84%
it has to do with what you refer
to as the sons of Heliopolis.

00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:32.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: Yes.

00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:34.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about the sons of-- I

00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:38.200 align:middle line:84%
mean, I have some other
perceptions similar to this.

00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:40.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: Well, I'd like to
thank Jay Widener for exposing

00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:42.920 align:middle line:84%
me to the great
Cross of Hendaye,

00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:47.030 align:middle line:84%
or I never would have really
looked into it any further.

00:55:47.030 --> 00:55:49.370 align:middle line:84%
And I found as I
read Fulcanelli,

00:55:49.370 --> 00:55:53.670 align:middle line:84%
the Mystery of the Cathedrals,
that to me, as a navigator,

00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:57.970 align:middle line:84%
it spoke to me, telling you
of the value of the Pole Star.

00:55:57.970 --> 00:56:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And in veiled
metaphors, that this is

00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:02.610 align:middle line:90%
what you were supposed to do.

00:56:02.610 --> 00:56:05.740 align:middle line:84%
All the structures discussed
in Mystery of the Cathedrals

00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:10.245 align:middle line:84%
have pointing attributes, like
Amiens Cathedral and the Palace

00:56:10.245 --> 00:56:13.480 align:middle line:84%
of Jacques-Couer has a
hexagonal tower that points

00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:15.690 align:middle line:90%
to Santiago de Compostela.

00:56:15.690 --> 00:56:17.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, the entire
building's festooned

00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:22.270 align:middle line:84%
with imagery of St. James
and the Camino de Santiago.

00:56:22.270 --> 00:56:27.090 align:middle line:84%
So that's a good way they show
their talismans by doing that.

00:56:27.090 --> 00:56:31.150 align:middle line:90%


00:56:31.150 --> 00:56:34.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's some kind
of ancient society of belief

00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:36.020 align:middle line:90%
that bridges all of this.

00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:37.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: Yeah.

00:56:37.770 --> 00:56:41.175 align:middle line:84%
Thomas Jefferson, I think,
was part of this group.

00:56:41.175 --> 00:56:42.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I think so.

00:56:42.050 --> 00:56:45.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: At least a
later manifestation of it.

00:56:45.410 --> 00:56:47.970 align:middle line:84%
Because Antoine de
Bade was directly

00:56:47.970 --> 00:56:51.010 align:middle line:84%
associated with the Cassini
family who ran the Paris

00:56:51.010 --> 00:56:54.320 align:middle line:90%
Observatory for generations.

00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:57.170 align:middle line:84%
Two of them were even born
there, right on the Paris

00:56:57.170 --> 00:57:00.280 align:middle line:90%
meridian, things like that.

00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:02.920 align:middle line:84%
He was directly associated
with Francoise Arago,

00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:07.340 align:middle line:84%
who placed the brass medallions
on the Rose line in Paris.

00:57:07.340 --> 00:57:09.670 align:middle line:84%
Thomas Jefferson was
directly associated

00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:12.970 align:middle line:84%
with the Cassinis and other
directors of the Paris

00:57:12.970 --> 00:57:13.900 align:middle line:90%
Observatory.

00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And I even have correspondence
between Jefferson and Dominique

00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:21.660 align:middle line:84%
Cassini where Jefferson
is quizzing him on how

00:57:21.660 --> 00:57:23.740 align:middle line:90%
to establish a prime meridian.

00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:24.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:57:24.540 --> 00:57:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: So there's
lots of evidence--

00:57:26.110 --> 00:57:27.568 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he
is certainly noted

00:57:27.568 --> 00:57:32.480 align:middle line:84%
as one of the premier, maybe
the most often quoted founding

00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:34.700 align:middle line:90%
father of this country.

00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:35.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: I agree.

00:57:35.740 --> 00:57:39.610 align:middle line:84%
And he obviously spent two
different long periods of time

00:57:39.610 --> 00:57:41.596 align:middle line:84%
in France, where he would
associate with this--

00:57:41.596 --> 00:57:42.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:45.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAHL: --during this same
period as most of these people.

00:57:45.350 --> 00:57:47.550 align:middle line:84%
The de Bades were
a little later,

00:57:47.550 --> 00:57:49.520 align:middle line:84%
but they associated
with all the people

00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:51.597 align:middle line:84%
that Thomas Jefferson had
associated with before.

00:57:51.597 --> 00:57:53.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And people
are going to have

00:57:53.180 --> 00:57:55.270 align:middle line:84%
to look-- they're going
to have to buy your book,

00:57:55.270 --> 00:57:58.860 align:middle line:84%
because as you said, it took
you eight years to research it.

00:57:58.860 --> 00:58:01.550 align:middle line:10%
I would say, fairly, it
would take eight years

00:58:01.550 --> 00:58:03.870 align:middle line:10%
to read it if
you're to reference

00:58:03.870 --> 00:58:07.540 align:middle line:10%
each thing, in that it
can take you on such

00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:09.650 align:middle line:10%
a complex but amazing journey.

00:58:09.650 --> 00:58:13.130 align:middle line:84%
I know for me, I had a
number of epiphanies,

00:58:13.130 --> 00:58:15.930 align:middle line:84%
even on a very personal level
with certain-- our family's

00:58:15.930 --> 00:58:17.730 align:middle line:90%
from the Stuart bloodline.

00:58:17.730 --> 00:58:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And in addition,
the entry to my home

00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:22.890 align:middle line:84%
is an octagon that
was-- it's very special.

00:58:22.890 --> 00:58:23.830 align:middle line:90%
It's a little temple.

00:58:23.830 --> 00:58:25.100 align:middle line:90%
And it goes on and on and on.

00:58:25.100 --> 00:58:26.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: It's your own axis.

00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:27.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's my own axis.

00:58:27.300 --> 00:58:27.680 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:28.846 align:middle line:90%
Who knows what it points to.

00:58:28.846 --> 00:58:30.480 align:middle line:90%
I'll have to check that out.

00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:34.000 align:middle line:84%
But it just starts bringing
up in each one of us

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:37.790 align:middle line:84%
maybe a part of the tapestry
that our own families

00:58:37.790 --> 00:58:42.090 align:middle line:84%
or beliefs or places
we've visited tap into.

00:58:42.090 --> 00:58:43.700 align:middle line:10%
>>LINDAHL: That's
entirely possible.

00:58:43.700 --> 00:58:45.990 align:middle line:10%
I've been forced to
grapple with that one

00:58:45.990 --> 00:58:48.830 align:middle line:10%
by examining my own genealogy.

00:58:48.830 --> 00:58:51.780 align:middle line:10%
And I'm such a stoic--

00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:53.000 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Scientist.

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:53.932 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: -denier.

00:58:53.932 --> 00:58:55.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're a scientist.

00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And I go into reincarnation
like that, looking at bloodlines

00:58:59.030 --> 00:59:00.970 align:middle line:84%
and who may have occupied
these bodies that

00:59:00.970 --> 00:59:02.040 align:middle line:90%
are throughout history.

00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:03.990 align:middle line:84%
And what knowledge
they bring forward.

00:59:03.990 --> 00:59:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And so if you put your lovely
scientific background together

00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:10.710 align:middle line:84%
with maybe a little
intelligent esoterica,

00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:14.590 align:middle line:84%
we can see an amazing portrait
emerge out of this book.

00:59:14.590 --> 00:59:16.080 align:middle line:84%
I just want to
thank you so much.

00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:16.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: Thank you.

00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:18.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We'll talk again
when the next one comes out.

00:59:18.990 --> 00:59:19.922 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAHL: Fantastic.

00:59:19.922 --> 00:59:20.990 align:middle line:90%
I've enjoyed it.

00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:21.790 align:middle line:90%
Appreciate it.

00:59:21.790 --> 00:59:23.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I hope you've
enjoyed this journey with Cort.

00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:25.470 align:middle line:84%
It certainly gives
new possibility

00:59:25.470 --> 00:59:27.870 align:middle line:84%
to the bloodline ties
of our planet's history

00:59:27.870 --> 00:59:30.390 align:middle line:84%
and the revered
philosophies and sciences.

00:59:30.390 --> 00:59:33.170 align:middle line:10%
To go much deeper, you can
purchase a copy of The Sacred

00:59:33.170 --> 00:59:35.090 align:middle line:10%
Towers of the Axis Mundi.

00:59:35.090 --> 00:59:38.190 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Open Minds.
