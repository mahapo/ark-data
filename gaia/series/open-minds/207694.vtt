The constituency

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.857 align:middle line:84%

>>REGINA MEREDITH: It
has no bearings, yeah.

>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: It's the
wealthiest in the world.

00:00:16.773 --> 00:00:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And so that is what's really
calling the shots now.

for the generations to come
while you're serving yourself.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.610 align:middle line:84%
We have to be able to get
beyond that mentality,

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.270 align:middle line:84%
but for the most part, if we
have a decent relationship,

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.370 align:middle line:84%
we like it when
somebody is helping us,

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.440 align:middle line:84%
and we like to
help somebody else.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.120 align:middle line:84%
We have an economy that's
doing the opposite.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.000 align:middle line:84%
We can't buy into
that programming

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.200 align:middle line:90%
at the metaphysical level.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.930 align:middle line:84%
We have to make our
stand, and that's

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.040 align:middle line:90%
what we need to focus on.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.780 align:middle line:84%
How can we bring that
pragmatism together

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.230 align:middle line:84%
with that much more fulfilling

everything?

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And then pull our energy
away from that very low level

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.900 align:middle line:84%
global sort of elite
big everything.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.570 align:middle line:90%
And we do it through the local.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.070 align:middle line:90%
We do it through relationships.

>>REGINA: In Zeus
Yiamouyiannis's 2013 book

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.780 align:middle line:10%
"Transforming
Economy" he said we

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.970 align:middle line:10%
were entering a
time of lawlessness

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.470 align:middle line:10%
in our economic structures.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.210 align:middle line:10%
This means that the
fundamentals we'd

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.660 align:middle line:10%
been investing by for decades
would no longer apply.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.110 align:middle line:90%
Well, this has come to pass.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.190 align:middle line:84%
So what does apply
in today's post-COVID

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.650 align:middle line:84%
and some would say
ravaged economy?

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.660 align:middle line:84%
You look at some
mainstream outlets,

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.010 align:middle line:90%
oh, everything's looking good.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.885 align:middle line:10%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
Well, let's look

00:02:21.885 --> 00:02:24.140 align:middle line:10%
at what did happen from
the last interview on Gaia.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.410 align:middle line:10%
We showed a chart where
literally the assets,

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.480 align:middle line:10%
the revenues were tanking, and
the market was going way up.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.900 align:middle line:84%
As drastically as
revenues were going down,

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.482 align:middle line:84%
the market itself was
going up, and that can--

00:02:38.482 --> 00:02:39.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's wrong.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.370 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: That was wrong.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.320 align:middle line:84%
We knew that something
was wrong there.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.450 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk a little bit
about with gold and dollars

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.320 align:middle line:90%
as well with regard to that.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.860 align:middle line:84%
But what ended up
happening was that

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.430 align:middle line:84%
because an overwhelming
amount of those stocks

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.040 align:middle line:84%
is owned by the very wealthy,
the money that was lent out

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.600 align:middle line:84%
to address COVID all went
into hedge funds and Wall

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.307 align:middle line:90%
Street and not Main Street.

00:03:04.307 --> 00:03:06.140 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk a
little bit about that.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, we are.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.320 align:middle line:90%
That's important.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.445 align:middle line:90%
That's where that bailout--

00:03:08.445 --> 00:03:09.680 align:middle line:90%
if anybody is paying--

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.180 align:middle line:84%
was paying attention when those
first bailouts came in 2020,

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.570 align:middle line:84%
the first $1.4 trillion
went to Wall Street.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.695 align:middle line:84%
Not to the people, not
for any social services,

00:03:19.695 --> 00:03:20.495 align:middle line:90%
not for medical.

>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Corporations in
Wall Street, big corporations.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.998 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: And now
they can leverage that

00:03:24.998 --> 00:03:27.260 align:middle line:84%
to a factor of four or
five, so you basically

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.710 align:middle line:84%
gave them an infusion of
liquidity amounting to anywhere

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.600 align:middle line:90%
from $4 to $7 trillion.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, this has shown
in how much their wealth has

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.040 align:middle line:84%
grown over the last
year and a half.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.082 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Exactly.

00:03:38.082 --> 00:03:41.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Skyrocketing while
everyone else is tanking.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.250 align:middle line:84%
Not everyone, but a
lot of the top sectors.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.750 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
Billionaires alone,

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.330 align:middle line:84%
we're talking a handful
of people, 400 families,

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.590 align:middle line:84%
billionaires, were making
trillions during the biggest

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:52.820 align:middle line:90%
downturn--

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:53.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Since the
Great Depression.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:54.890 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: --since
the Great Depression.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.807 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, let me
ask you something, Zeus.

00:03:56.807 --> 00:03:59.210 align:middle line:84%
Did that mirror the
Great Depression?

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.652 align:middle line:84%
Was there extreme
wealth that was

00:04:01.652 --> 00:04:03.485 align:middle line:84%
being leveraged during
the Great Depression?

00:04:03.485 --> 00:04:03.980 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: No.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It wasn't the same.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.940 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
No, the reason why

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.400 align:middle line:84%
you had so many people
committing suicides

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.510 align:middle line:84%
off their Wall Street
buildings back then.

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because they weren't
being bailed out, yeah.

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.128 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
They were tanking.

00:04:12.128 --> 00:04:15.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, much of the
monetary policy we had now

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.120 align:middle line:84%
was ostensibly sold to prevent
the kinds of huge swings.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.210 align:middle line:90%
The central reserve was only--

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.650 align:middle line:90%
it was in 1907--

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.860 align:middle line:90%
something in that order, 1907--

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.070 align:middle line:90%
I think it started in 1913.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.870 align:middle line:90%
I think--

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:30.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: '13,
Federal Reserve, yeah.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.628 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: --was
officially formed,

00:04:32.628 --> 00:04:35.240 align:middle line:84%
but you know, the Jekyll Island,
and the behind the scenes

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.350 align:middle line:84%
happened a few
years before that.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.570 align:middle line:84%
But what that turned
into was a guarantor,

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.070 align:middle line:84%
and it was formed
by the very elite

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.230 align:middle line:90%
in society for their wealth.

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.908 align:middle line:84%
They were not going to be caught
with their pants down again,

00:04:48.908 --> 00:04:51.200 align:middle line:84%
even if they're-- because
they're the ones owning a lot

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.140 align:middle line:84%
of this stuff, what they were
going to do is create a system

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.570 align:middle line:84%
that could, quote,
"stabilize the economy."

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:57.950 align:middle line:90%
But who did it end up helping?

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, we know that,
as that has evolved

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.110 align:middle line:90%
to this post-COVID economy.

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.320 align:middle line:84%
Literally trillions just got
siphoned out of Main Street,

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.090 align:middle line:84%
went to Wall Street
and to corporations.

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.632 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And as you said, what
happened with that money that

00:05:10.632 --> 00:05:12.980 align:middle line:84%
was supposed to be used to
pump up the infrastructure,

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.220 align:middle line:84%
help retain jobs for those
who were on the margin.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.350 align:middle line:84%
Even within those
corporations, a lot of it

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.610 align:middle line:84%
went back into buying
back their own stocks

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.080 align:middle line:84%
to give an illusion of
the company's growth.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.205 align:middle line:90%
But it was all an illusion.

00:05:28.205 --> 00:05:29.163 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:05:29.163 --> 00:05:30.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But let
me ask you this.

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:31.770 align:middle line:90%
It was an illusion.

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.890 align:middle line:84%
They were buying back
their own stocks,

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.570 align:middle line:84%
but since A, a lot of
people weren't aware of it,

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.950 align:middle line:84%
so if you have people investors,
which compared to algorithm

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:45.560 align:middle line:84%
investment, how does that work
with algorithms when it appears

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.230 align:middle line:84%
a company has just raised
their value because all

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.942 align:middle line:84%
of these stocks trades
and its in-house trading?

00:05:50.942 --> 00:05:52.400 align:middle line:84%
How does that work
with algorithms?

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.730 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Well, the
market only responds to demand.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:00.440 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't ask for what
the quality of that demand,

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.990 align:middle line:84%
or whether or not
it's funny money,

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.700 align:middle line:84%
or if it's real money saved from
real people, retail investors.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the algorithms
are buy, buy, buy.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.230 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Well, a
lot of these algorithms,

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:11.710 align:middle line:84%
including high
frequency trading,

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.810 align:middle line:84%
are built to
purposely manipulate

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:16.180 align:middle line:84%
the market by
either selling a lot

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.430 align:middle line:84%
or selling shorts where
you don't even have it,

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.560 align:middle line:84%
but you create a signal to the
market that it's being sold,

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.157 align:middle line:84%
so you depress it so that
you can win a bet going down.

00:06:25.157 --> 00:06:26.740 align:middle line:84%
They're doing the
same thing going up.

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.130 align:middle line:84%
I call it naked long buying
instead of naked short selling,

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:35.350 align:middle line:84%
where you literally get zero
interest money, infinite money

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.480 align:middle line:84%
almost, to buy up
your own stocks

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.010 align:middle line:90%
and other stocks in the market.

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And the Fed has
even sent a signal

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.710 align:middle line:84%
that they're willing to
buy up stocks themselves

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.960 align:middle line:84%
in order to keep the
stock market afloat,

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.677 align:middle line:90%
regardless of what value it has.

00:06:48.677 --> 00:06:49.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's not fair.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.052 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: It's not fair.

00:06:51.052 --> 00:06:52.120 align:middle line:90%
It's not fair at all.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.710 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have any
fundamentals to it.

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.490 align:middle line:84%
But if you pump money,
whether it's funny money,

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:59.860 align:middle line:84%
whether it's printed
money or it's real money,

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.890 align:middle line:90%
the market responds the same.

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:02.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The same.

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.560 align:middle line:84%
So you said also that
for the first time

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.830 align:middle line:84%
in its 107-year
history, they began

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:12.875 align:middle line:84%
buying up non-investment-grade
junk bonds.

00:07:12.875 --> 00:07:13.750 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yep.

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they weren't
even buying real--

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:17.567 align:middle line:90%
I mean, valuable assets at all.

00:07:17.567 --> 00:07:18.400 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: No.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.710 align:middle line:84%
The whole point of
a market, and we'll

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:23.740 align:middle line:84%
talk about other ways in which
the traditional market has

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.560 align:middle line:84%
completely fallen,
has become a joke,

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.100 align:middle line:90%
is that you have risk, OK?

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.280 align:middle line:84%
People talk about moral hazard,
like if you don't punish people

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.620 align:middle line:84%
that have invested unwisely,
then they'll go ahead

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:38.080 align:middle line:84%
and they'll take
advantage more and more

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.630 align:middle line:84%
and use kind of a crooked
or unbalanced system.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:44.590 align:middle line:84%
But that's an example of exactly
how the market is broken.

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:48.570 align:middle line:84%
A market is supposed
to reward risk,

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:51.300 align:middle line:84%
and you're supposed to have
your own money behind it.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.400 align:middle line:84%
Just like an entrepreneur,
if you win, you win,

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.490 align:middle line:90%
you lose you lose.

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:56.940 align:middle line:84%
You learn, you move on,
and you get better at it

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:58.380 align:middle line:90%
and you go back.

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:02.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, there is basically a
policy over the government

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.920 align:middle line:84%
and the Fed, and this is not
just true in the United States,

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.350 align:middle line:84%
but the whole world
over, to never allow

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:09.450 align:middle line:90%
a bear market again.

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:11.550 align:middle line:84%
So literally, we will
lower interest rates

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:13.020 align:middle line:90%
to 0% for 12 years.

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.330 align:middle line:84%
We will pump money
in, whatever it takes.

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:18.570 align:middle line:84%
We'll buy up
non-investment-grade junk

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:21.510 align:middle line:84%
bonds, the very thing
that you invest in

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:24.600 align:middle line:84%
because they're high risk, high
return, and the very thing you

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.250 align:middle line:84%
should never have
a guarantee on.

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:31.080 align:middle line:84%
They're now guaranteeing it,
because their constituency

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.320 align:middle line:84%
is no longer the market
itself or any fundamentals.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.520 align:middle line:90%
It has no bearings, yeah.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.440 align:middle line:84%
It's the wealthiest
in the world.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.140 align:middle line:84%
And the wealthiest
in the world aren't

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:42.720 align:middle line:84%
loyal to a particular
country anymore.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.190 align:middle line:84%
They're loyal to
their pocketbook.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:46.565 align:middle line:84%
They're loyal to, in some
sense, each other, though there

00:08:46.565 --> 00:08:48.390 align:middle line:90%
are some rivalries.

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:51.660 align:middle line:84%
And so that is what's really
calling the shots now.

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:55.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so this
allows the wealthy not only

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:57.870 align:middle line:84%
to have these incredible
gains in their portfolios

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:00.210 align:middle line:84%
and have all that
wealth siphoned upward

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:04.020 align:middle line:84%
or downward to them,
and at the same time,

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.780 align:middle line:84%
when they need to make a
purchase, they use debt.

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.130 align:middle line:90%
They don't use their own money.

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:08.430 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yep.

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:10.013 align:middle line:84%
That's another way
in which the market

00:09:10.013 --> 00:09:13.080 align:middle line:84%
has become corrupted
and so distorted as

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.420 align:middle line:90%
to not be a market anymore.

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:18.330 align:middle line:84%
Now what we have, because
of 0% interest rate money--

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:21.860 align:middle line:84%
and it's been going
on for 12 years now--

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:27.680 align:middle line:84%
stealing trillions from
Mom, Pop American, OK,

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.840 align:middle line:90%
and around the world.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:33.320 align:middle line:84%
12 years at 0% interest
rate stealing trillions,

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.530 align:middle line:84%
but it allows them to go
ahead and not only buy up

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:40.940 align:middle line:84%
their own stocks, and stocks
in other companies unlimited,

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:44.120 align:middle line:84%
but also to get
into massive debt,

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:49.210 align:middle line:84%
because they don't have to pay
any money on that debt, right?

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:52.090 align:middle line:84%
So now they can--
literally, this

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:54.220 align:middle line:84%
is why Jeff Bezos
and these guys don't

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:56.150 align:middle line:90%
pay any income taxes, right?

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:56.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:58.090 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
They allow the assets

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:00.048 align:middle line:84%
of the companies they
own, like Amazon for Jeff

00:10:00.048 --> 00:10:04.120 align:middle line:84%
Bezos, et cetera, to continue
to raise in value because it's

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:08.080 align:middle line:84%
being inflated by funny money
being thrown into there,

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.510 align:middle line:84%
and trillions of dollars
flowing into the market, which

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:12.010 align:middle line:90%
will only make it go up.

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And then they take debt at
0% interest rate, or near 0%

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:19.000 align:middle line:84%
interest rate, to buy
up, pay for things,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.080 align:middle line:84%
and then they can take
that off their taxes

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.720 align:middle line:90%
so they don't pay any taxes.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When people
listen to this initially,

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:26.560 align:middle line:84%
when we'll get around
to the part that

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.090 align:middle line:84%
will become our responsibility
as human beings.

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:32.215 align:middle line:84%
But it's very depressing,
because the game is so rigged.

00:10:32.215 --> 00:10:33.820 align:middle line:84%
There's literally--
I mean, now there

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:35.710 align:middle line:84%
are some people watching
right now that say yeah,

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:37.420 align:middle line:84%
but you know, I stayed
in the stock market

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:38.680 align:middle line:84%
and I'm doing pretty
well right now.

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:38.980 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:40.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that
for some people

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:42.403 align:middle line:90%
is like, it's working for me.

00:10:42.403 --> 00:10:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: And I would
challenge those people.

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:47.470 align:middle line:84%
The retirement generation, what
I would call the retirement

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:49.480 align:middle line:84%
generation, and those
could be young people who

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.890 align:middle line:90%
made out pretty well--

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:55.390 align:middle line:84%
look at the integrity
of what you're doing.

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:57.680 align:middle line:84%
They say, OK, well,
somebody's got to do it,

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.290 align:middle line:90%
and the market's going.

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:02.870 align:middle line:84%
And if it's a rigged game, then
we should all pile into it.

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And even cyber currency
is falling under this.

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting,
what's happening right now,

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:09.790 align:middle line:90%
is that gold is going up.

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:11.170 align:middle line:90%
The dollar is going up.

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:12.500 align:middle line:90%
Stocks are going up.

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.710 align:middle line:84%
Bonds are going up and
cyber currency is going up.

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:17.190 align:middle line:84%
These are all supposed to go
opposite in a real market.

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:18.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, and
you go on the street,

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:21.850 align:middle line:84%
and you see all these strip
malls with "for lease,"

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:24.520 align:middle line:84%
shuttered up, boarded up,
"for lease" signs on them,

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:25.740 align:middle line:90%
"for rent" signs on them.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:29.230 align:middle line:84%
You see the products in the
stores, the inventory shrinking

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:33.320 align:middle line:84%
and across the board in almost
every kind of retail outlet

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.120 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.930 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Exactly, and
there's a phony wealth effect.

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:40.660 align:middle line:84%
What the marginal
investors, let's say

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:43.810 align:middle line:84%
upper-middle-class Americans
are seeing, especially

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:46.600 align:middle line:84%
nearing retirement, my
stocks are looking great.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.150 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't look like
they can ever fail.

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:49.150 align:middle line:90%
They take a look around.

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:50.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is there
truth in that, though?

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:52.077 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: There
is truth in that,

00:11:52.077 --> 00:11:55.270 align:middle line:84%
because when the Fed says,
we'll even buy up stocks,

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:59.950 align:middle line:84%
and they've brought up junk
bonds, which are outrageous

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:01.810 align:middle line:84%
and a complete
violation of any kind

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:06.320 align:middle line:84%
of self-regulating economy,
then the fix is in.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.245 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: And so
people who have some money,

00:12:09.245 --> 00:12:10.960 align:middle line:84%
they're saying, well,
if the fix is in,

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get my
chunk of the pie.

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:13.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:14.680 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: If they're
going to buy up stocks and make

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.240 align:middle line:84%
sure that this never
goes down, then why

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.470 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't I just buy up stocks?

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:17.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why wouldn't they?

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:18.640 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: And
cybercurrency and gold

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:19.270 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:20.270 align:middle line:90%
It's all going to go up.

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:20.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why wouldn't they?

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:21.250 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:22.510 align:middle line:84%
When you can print
trillions and just

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:23.950 align:middle line:84%
flow it into all
of those markets,

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:25.660 align:middle line:84%
and the ones that used
to counter each other,

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:27.490 align:middle line:84%
now they're all going
the same direction.

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:28.330 align:middle line:90%
Hey, hey, hey.

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:32.140 align:middle line:84%
But again, I see it a lot
like a fisherman who says,

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:34.600 align:middle line:84%
all the fish are being
depleted in this ocean.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.150 align:middle line:84%
I better go out and
get mine real quick

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:38.600 align:middle line:90%
so I can feed my family.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:40.180 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: And
what you're doing

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:42.950 align:middle line:84%
is you're destroying the
entire ecosystem of the ocean.

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:46.090 align:middle line:84%
So there's a problem with
integrity and viability

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:50.080 align:middle line:84%
for the generations to come
while you're serving yourself.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.630 align:middle line:84%
We have to be able to get
beyond that mentality.

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:53.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're
going to spend

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:55.360 align:middle line:84%
the last part of this
show talking about what

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.920 align:middle line:84%
we can do to get
past that mentality,

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.960 align:middle line:84%
because it's very
tempting when you're

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:02.553 align:middle line:84%
feeling kind of the wheels
come off all around you.

00:13:02.553 --> 00:13:03.470 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Sure.

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:06.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Maybe you've even
been forced to retire early

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:08.560 align:middle line:84%
or lost your job, but
hey, those markets

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:09.790 align:middle line:90%
are still working for you.

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:11.950 align:middle line:84%
Why would anyone say,
I'm going to pull out.

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:12.280 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:13.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They wouldn't.

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:13.480 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In this world today,
there's so much insecurity,

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:18.610 align:middle line:84%
but you're saying,
pause and think about it

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:20.022 align:middle line:90%
and plan for the next stage.

00:13:20.022 --> 00:13:20.980 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:23.710 align:middle line:84%
And as we're going to
focus on this, where we're

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:27.760 align:middle line:84%
we going to move with
integrity going forward,

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.310 align:middle line:84%
we're going to lay out a lot
of the lack of integrity.

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:33.550 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk a little
bit about how integrity has

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:34.850 align:middle line:90%
been dishonored and sacrificed.

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:36.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, let's do that.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:36.880 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: In those areas.

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Those
three myths, yes.

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And then I want to get into,
because you've already said,

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:41.590 align:middle line:90%
everything's going up.

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:43.420 align:middle line:84%
Those were like checks
and balances before.

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:43.720 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The market
went down, gold went up.

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:48.700 align:middle line:84%
You know, it was very
predictable until what,

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:49.905 align:middle line:90%
five, 10 years ago.

00:13:49.905 --> 00:13:50.240 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yep.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Something happened
and it's like, wait a minute.

00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:52.840 align:middle line:90%
How do yo even--

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:53.830 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Even just
in the last few years.

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:55.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In the last
few years, even more so.

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:55.840 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yeah.

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:57.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
let's go into that,

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.640 align:middle line:84%
because I want to talk about a
little business in Sacramento

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:01.690 align:middle line:90%
and what happened.

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:02.200 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yes.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.158 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As a result of
this whole COVID thing

00:14:04.158 --> 00:14:06.428 align:middle line:84%
that is just heartbreaking
to everybody.

00:14:06.428 --> 00:14:07.345 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yeah.

00:14:07.345 --> 00:14:08.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
go into the three--

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:10.090 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Well, he's
a good example of this, OK.

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:12.070 align:middle line:84%
You'll talk a little bit
more about the business,

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:13.630 align:middle line:84%
but the three things
that had always

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:16.130 align:middle line:84%
worked for people, that worked
for him, that worked for Main

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:19.420 align:middle line:84%
Street small businesses, and
what we've always been preached

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:22.360 align:middle line:84%
for hundreds of years,
right, since the founding

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.280 align:middle line:84%
of this country, was
there's three things that

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:28.120 align:middle line:84%
will advance you economically,
hard work, education

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:29.320 align:middle line:90%
and savings.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.810 align:middle line:84%
Those have always
been the standards

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:34.148 align:middle line:84%
of a successful,
responsible citizen.

00:14:34.148 --> 00:14:36.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And many people
watching this right now

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:38.380 align:middle line:84%
are saving money to
make sure their kids can

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.660 align:middle line:84%
go to a decent college,
so they can come out

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:43.480 align:middle line:90%
and get an expected decent job.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.920 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:45.920 align:middle line:90%
And here's what we have.

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:50.220 align:middle line:84%
The reality is this with
regard to working hard.

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:54.280 align:middle line:84%
We now have a minimum wage that
hasn't been raised in 12 years.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:55.740 align:middle line:90%
Some states are--

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:57.782 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: More than
double what it is now,

00:14:57.782 --> 00:15:00.290 align:middle line:84%
and it still wouldn't have kept
up with the cost of living.

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:01.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:04.960 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Still $7.25,
or maybe raised to $7.85,

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:05.760 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:09.290 align:middle line:84%
But it's under $8,
way, way below.

00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And we have downsizing
corporations

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:14.690 align:middle line:84%
who reward their, quote, "hard
workers" and "good workers"

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:18.260 align:middle line:84%
with getting the workload of
the person they just downsized

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:19.730 align:middle line:90%
dumped on them.

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:21.338 align:middle line:84%
So they get to
work twice as hard

00:15:21.338 --> 00:15:22.880 align:middle line:84%
for the same amount
of money in order

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.255 align:middle line:84%
to make that corporation and
their stockholders that much

00:15:25.255 --> 00:15:26.540 align:middle line:90%
more money.

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:30.230 align:middle line:84%
The productivity since
the 1970s has leveled off.

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:32.180 align:middle line:84%
It used to go,
you would get paid

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:33.830 align:middle line:84%
and compensation with
your productivity

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:35.430 align:middle line:90%
marched lockstep for decades.

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:36.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:39.320 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: And then
right around the '70s and '80s,

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.300 align:middle line:84%
late '70s and early '80s,
they started to part,

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:43.550 align:middle line:84%
and now they've
just gone like this.

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:45.290 align:middle line:84%
Your productivity
has skyrocketed.

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:46.940 align:middle line:90%
Your compensation has flatlined.

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:48.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, and
I think most people

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:49.695 align:middle line:90%
can appreciate that.

00:15:49.695 --> 00:15:50.570 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yes.

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:51.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because they're
seeing this in their own lives

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:53.397 align:middle line:84%
or with their
families or friends.

00:15:53.397 --> 00:15:55.730 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right, and
the education part of it

00:15:55.730 --> 00:16:00.390 align:middle line:84%
is, now education is one
of the most inflated prices

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:02.340 align:middle line:84%
ever, something like
1,110% or 1,200%

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:03.678 align:middle line:90%
back when I wrote that book.

00:16:03.678 --> 00:16:05.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
eight years ago now.

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:07.920 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yeah,
it had increased so much,

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:10.630 align:middle line:84%
and student debt
was so overwhelming.

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:13.265 align:middle line:84%
That's why people are talking
about forgiving student debt.

00:16:13.265 --> 00:16:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And they're not
getting the jobs.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:15.990 align:middle line:90%
They're getting barista jobs.

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:17.070 align:middle line:84%
You're doing better
as a plumber,

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:18.070 align:middle line:90%
far better as a plumber.

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:19.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely
and the trades.

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:20.495 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yes.

00:16:20.495 --> 00:16:23.850 align:middle line:84%
So you are educating
yourself into massive debt,

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:29.087 align:middle line:84%
not into that forecasted
future of this great earnings,

00:16:29.087 --> 00:16:30.420 align:middle line:90%
because those jobs aren't there.

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:32.650 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them are outsourced,
downsized and so forth.

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:35.430 align:middle line:84%
And finally,
savings, 0% interest

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:37.380 align:middle line:84%
on your savings for
the last 12 years,

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:41.010 align:middle line:84%
trillions of dollars
of non-growth

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:44.820 align:middle line:84%
that's just been used to
inflate the stock market

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:46.590 align:middle line:90%
and to subsidize billionaires.

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:48.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:51.500 align:middle line:84%
OK, and then just to get
us even more riled up--

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.720 align:middle line:90%
[laughter]

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:57.200 align:middle line:84%
There's a beloved cafe in
Sacramento, California,

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.340 align:middle line:90%
and I mean beloved.

00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:00.740 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when it
closed during COVID,

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:03.510 align:middle line:84%
people were, everyone was
talking about, oh my god, they

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:04.310 align:middle line:90%
have to--

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:07.609 align:middle line:84%
Tower Cafe, and they
have to open back up.

00:17:07.609 --> 00:17:09.319 align:middle line:84%
That's the heartbeat
of this city,

00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:12.950 align:middle line:84%
and I think many, many people
in the city of Sacramento

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:16.650 align:middle line:84%
would argue, this is the
heartbeat of Sacramento.

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:18.800 align:middle line:84%
So they got through that
first period of time.

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:22.430 align:middle line:84%
They had to close for a
while, and Jim, the owner,

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:24.263 align:middle line:84%
started working with,
what's it called, PP--

00:17:24.263 --> 00:17:26.305 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: The
Paycheck Protection Program.

00:17:26.305 --> 00:17:28.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Protection
Program, PPP.

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:31.460 align:middle line:84%
He was working with them,
had all his financials out.

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And this is a large cafe,
does a lot of business.

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And he was OKed
by the government

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:42.260 align:middle line:84%
to get the PPP loan
of up to $2 million

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.717 align:middle line:84%
to pump back in for
all the lost wages.

00:17:45.717 --> 00:17:47.300 align:middle line:84%
The people that own
the building never

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.650 align:middle line:84%
stopped charging maximum
rent the whole time,

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:50.880 align:middle line:90%
even though he was closed.

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.380 align:middle line:90%
So it was all good to go.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And then the bank
had a little foul-up,

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:58.370 align:middle line:90%
and he couldn't get the money.

00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, isn't there
a way to correct it, I mean,

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:01.940 align:middle line:90%
if the bank made a mistake.

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:03.410 align:middle line:90%
He said, no.

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:05.090 align:middle line:90%
He said, I'm sitting here.

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:07.130 align:middle line:84%
The only value this
business has is

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:09.490 align:middle line:84%
that these people are
sitting here in the garden

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:11.240 align:middle line:84%
and I can appreciate
the fact that they're

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:12.230 align:middle line:90%
enjoying their time.

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:14.690 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how long I can
keep the doors open for them.

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:15.120 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:16.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm doing
everything I can,

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:19.040 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't give
me the PPP money.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And that went to corporations
that were getting $50 million,

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:25.032 align:middle line:90%
they were being given, even.

00:18:25.032 --> 00:18:26.240 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Hedge funds.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.157 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hedge funds.

00:18:27.157 --> 00:18:29.270 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: With
less than 50 employees,

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:32.180 align:middle line:84%
but had billions and billions
of in assets and income

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:34.340 align:middle line:84%
that was stratospheric,
were the first in line.

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:37.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Exactly, so you
have this really important,

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:39.223 align:middle line:84%
heart-centered
business that everyone

00:18:39.223 --> 00:18:40.640 align:middle line:84%
was waiting to go
back to work to,

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:43.430 align:middle line:90%
because he treated them so well.

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And the customers are like
waiting with bated breath

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:48.470 align:middle line:84%
for the days their
doors open again,

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:51.560 align:middle line:84%
and he can't see how he's
going to be able, no matter how

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:53.630 align:middle line:84%
hard he works and
his employees work,

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:55.053 align:middle line:90%
to really get through this now.

00:18:55.053 --> 00:18:55.970 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yeah.

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:58.233 align:middle line:84%
The compact is
irretrievably broken.

00:18:58.233 --> 00:18:59.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's broken.

00:18:59.150 --> 00:18:59.390 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yes.

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:01.057 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I mean,
it hurts everyone.

00:19:01.057 --> 00:19:03.350 align:middle line:84%
And all of us are thinking,
God, can we do a GoFundMe.

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:05.690 align:middle line:84%
What can we do to help
the cafes stay open?

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:07.923 align:middle line:90%
What can you do?

00:19:07.923 --> 00:19:08.840 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what do we do?

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.240 align:middle line:84%
This is a good case
in point to talk

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.690 align:middle line:84%
about what can be done for
businesses like this that

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:17.540 align:middle line:84%
do it right, did it right,
and got screwed where

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:18.860 align:middle line:90%
the money went to the top.

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:19.730 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Well,
in the short term,

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:20.605 align:middle line:90%
I think you're right.

00:19:20.605 --> 00:19:23.510 align:middle line:84%
There's going to have to be
a concerted community, effort

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:26.960 align:middle line:84%
and that's always been the
gold standard of any economy.

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.390 align:middle line:84%
During the Great
Depression, what worked?

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:32.090 align:middle line:84%
When people were starving,
when people couldn't

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:35.240 align:middle line:84%
feed their kids,
they got together

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:39.390 align:middle line:84%
and they shared what little they
had to make sure that nobody,

00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:42.080 align:middle line:84%
as much as they could-- plenty
of people went hungry, right,

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.220 align:middle line:90%
but people didn't starve.

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:44.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:45.530 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: You know, and
that we could get through it,

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:48.110 align:middle line:84%
and that was also the time when
we had so-called government

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:50.450 align:middle line:90%
programs started.

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:52.250 align:middle line:84%
Soon after that,
Social Security.

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:53.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:55.250 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Soon after
that, from those abuses

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:57.680 align:middle line:84%
and those starvations,
especially among elderly people

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:00.975 align:middle line:84%
among working families, that
created guarantees around that.

00:20:00.975 --> 00:20:02.600 align:middle line:84%
That's where Social
Security came from.

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:05.250 align:middle line:84%
Medicare and Medicaid kind
of stemmed from that as well.

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:08.510 align:middle line:84%
So we began to realize that
we cannot have a functioning

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:11.420 align:middle line:84%
economy if we don't pay
attention to the people that

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:14.220 align:middle line:84%
create the real value, and
that's a person on the street.

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:15.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:16.310 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
We've lost that again.

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:16.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We have lost it again.

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:18.050 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: And we have
to get back to it again.

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:20.300 align:middle line:84%
In your case, I would
say, yes, have a community

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:22.290 align:middle line:90%
rally around this place.

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:23.588 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tower Cafe, yeah.

00:20:23.588 --> 00:20:25.130 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
And do a fundraiser,

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:26.850 align:middle line:84%
and let's get that
money if we have to.

00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:27.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:30.230 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: But let's
begin to put our money

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:32.840 align:middle line:84%
in our local economies
and not think

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:36.530 align:middle line:84%
about just making the next
big break in the cybercurrency

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:37.520 align:middle line:90%
or the stock market.

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:37.775 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No kidding.

00:20:37.775 --> 00:20:39.400 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, you're
talking about people.

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.460 align:middle line:90%
OK, so you have COVID.

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:42.680 align:middle line:84%
So you have these subsidy
payments that are going on,

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:45.330 align:middle line:84%
this extra unemployment and
these additional payments,

00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:46.130 align:middle line:90%
right.

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:48.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you're
working out a crap job

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:50.300 align:middle line:90%
that pays that amount of money.

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:50.720 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:53.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Who isn't going to
ride it out to the last minute?

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:53.330 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:55.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're making
more money on subsidy

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:56.420 align:middle line:90%
than at that job.

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:57.378 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:20:57.378 --> 00:21:00.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it doesn't have
to be that harsh and that ugly.

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:00.978 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:21:00.978 --> 00:21:04.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And Jim, the owner of
Tower, he pays his people well,

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:05.840 align:middle line:90%
and they're all back.

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:07.040 align:middle line:90%
They're happy to be back.

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:07.370 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Sure.

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:09.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's
not how most of them do.

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:10.208 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:21:10.208 --> 00:21:13.015 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now we were
looking at the numbers.

00:21:13.015 --> 00:21:15.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, those benefits are
running out state by state.

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:17.270 align:middle line:84%
They're just about
gone as we record this.

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:20.450 align:middle line:84%
So right now, there
are 11.7 job openings

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:23.242 align:middle line:84%
with 12.1 million people
claiming unemployment.

00:21:23.242 --> 00:21:24.200 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's interesting.

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:26.328 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:21:26.328 --> 00:21:28.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's many
jobs open as people looking

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:29.930 align:middle line:90%
for unemployment benefits.

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:30.050 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:31.967 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about this phenomenon.

00:21:31.967 --> 00:21:32.990 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Sure.

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:36.440 align:middle line:84%
When you break the compact
as badly as it's been broken,

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:40.580 align:middle line:84%
when people are literally
punished for working harder,

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:43.640 align:middle line:84%
given more work to
do and not more pay,

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.710 align:middle line:84%
where they're not given
their productivity,

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:47.670 align:middle line:90%
they go on a kind of strike.

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:48.690 align:middle line:90%
They get burnt out.

00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:50.490 align:middle line:84%
In America, you don't
even go on vacation.

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:54.180 align:middle line:84%
You've given two weeks versus
five to six weeks in Europe.

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:56.415 align:middle line:84%
You're not even given
health insurance.

00:21:56.415 --> 00:21:57.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:58.740 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Not
real health insurance.

00:21:58.740 --> 00:21:59.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:01.570 align:middle line:84%
We don't have, quote,
"socialized medicine."

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:04.170 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: So
you're getting paid crap.

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:06.930 align:middle line:84%
The major expenses
are not being covered.

00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:11.190 align:middle line:84%
You are not allowed to take a
break for the most part, right.

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:14.310 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
you're expected to just want

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:16.150 align:middle line:90%
to jump back into work.

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:16.950 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:18.810 align:middle line:84%
At a certain point, there's
been a rebellion there.

00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:19.690 align:middle line:90%
It's a strike.

00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:22.930 align:middle line:84%
It's a general strike of about
12 million people saying,

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:24.820 align:middle line:84%
I don't want or
need this anymore.

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:25.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I don't want to
live like that anymore.

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:26.890 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: I don't
want to live like that.

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:29.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to simply
be pumping out more

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:32.018 align:middle line:84%
for faceless corporations
and equity firms

00:22:32.018 --> 00:22:34.560 align:middle line:84%
and so forth that are buying up
more and more real businesses

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:37.170 align:middle line:84%
in assets, and trying to wring
even more money out of people.

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:38.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
those kinds of wages

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:41.462 align:middle line:84%
don't give you a chance at
any kind of dignified life.

00:22:41.462 --> 00:22:43.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you and I have
talked about this.

00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:46.750 align:middle line:84%
When I was a young kid, a
teenager, and in my early 20s,

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:48.930 align:middle line:84%
I could afford my own
apartment in San Francisco

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:52.112 align:middle line:84%
on a very average, little job,
not much above minimum wage.

00:22:52.112 --> 00:22:53.070 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:55.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it was a nice
little studio apartment.

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:57.030 align:middle line:90%
I could still go to the store.

00:22:57.030 --> 00:22:59.822 align:middle line:84%
I could get my cable car
tickets and even buy a dress.

00:22:59.822 --> 00:23:00.780 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:04.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's not even
remotely possible now.

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:06.810 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: We figured
that same apartment now in San

00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:10.715 align:middle line:84%
Francisco would require
about $170,000 salary,

00:23:10.715 --> 00:23:12.840 align:middle line:84%
and you're not going to
get that as a receptionist.

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.048 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to get that
working at a hair salon.

00:23:15.048 --> 00:23:17.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I worked at a
very famous hair salon, in fact,

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.328 align:middle line:84%
the one that was featured
in that recent movie

00:23:20.328 --> 00:23:21.870 align:middle line:84%
about Hollywood--
what was it called?

00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:23.250 align:middle line:90%
With Brad Pitt.

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:24.150 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Oh,
I can't remember.

00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:25.530 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I remember the
one it was about--

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:28.072 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That won the Academy
Award about the Manson Family.

00:23:28.072 --> 00:23:30.870 align:middle line:84%
I was sadly working for one
of the people Manson killed

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:33.400 align:middle line:84%
at that time, but it was
a very high-end salon

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.310 align:middle line:84%
and I had a very
lowly job there.

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:36.720 align:middle line:90%
And it paid all my bills.

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:37.890 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Sure.

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:41.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know, and that
kind of simple, dignified life

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:44.190 align:middle line:84%
where you can just put your
40 hours a week in and have

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:47.100 align:middle line:84%
a nice life, that's not really
possible now unless you're

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:49.050 align:middle line:84%
in a much higher
category of income.

00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:50.425 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
Or you've jumped

00:23:50.425 --> 00:23:51.532 align:middle line:90%
on that corrupt bandwagon.

00:23:51.532 --> 00:23:53.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you can
jump on that bandwagon,

00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:56.100 align:middle line:84%
but for the most part, if
you're a normal working

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:58.170 align:middle line:84%
person like I was,
you've got to live

00:23:58.170 --> 00:23:59.970 align:middle line:84%
three or four people
in that house now

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:01.320 align:middle line:90%
in order to make that rent.

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:02.237 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Sure.

00:24:02.237 --> 00:24:03.903 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: With those
jobs, similar jobs,

00:24:03.903 --> 00:24:05.370 align:middle line:90%
kind of like artist collectives.

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:08.520 align:middle line:84%
You know, everybody's living
like that now, or moving back

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:09.890 align:middle line:90%
with their parents and families.

00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:10.656 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: And
that's one of the promises

00:24:10.656 --> 00:24:12.450 align:middle line:84%
that may be open, and
some of the opportunities.

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:13.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:15.060 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
If we are forced,

00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:17.430 align:middle line:84%
because the individualistic
way that we've approached

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:18.960 align:middle line:84%
it and the guarantees
that we have

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.460 align:middle line:84%
toward our individualistic and
more nuclear family lifestyle

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:24.142 align:middle line:84%
are broken, we may be forced
into communal structures

00:24:24.142 --> 00:24:26.100 align:middle line:84%
to be able to share
housing, to share expenses.

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:27.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
I'm all for that,

00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk about
that, because I

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.592 align:middle line:84%
think that's a good
thing, not a bad thing.

00:24:30.592 --> 00:24:31.680 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yes.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:34.263 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because we were living
in our little silos, everyone

00:24:34.263 --> 00:24:36.060 align:middle line:90%
in their own condo, you know.

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:37.710 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's talk
about another thing

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:39.690 align:middle line:90%
before we go further into that.

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:41.408 align:middle line:84%
And people are looking
around and saying,

00:24:41.408 --> 00:24:42.450 align:middle line:90%
oh my god, this is weird.

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:44.370 align:middle line:84%
I can't even buy
the toaster I like.

00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:45.270 align:middle line:90%
They don't have any.

00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:48.180 align:middle line:84%
I can't buy-- I have to wait
six months for a refrigerator.

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:50.340 align:middle line:84%
I talked to my
chiropractor recently,

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:52.260 align:middle line:84%
who moved to a new home
and redid the kitchen.

00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:56.190 align:middle line:84%
He and his wife decided to do
a Subzero suite with the range

00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:57.360 align:middle line:90%
and the refrigerator.

00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:00.720 align:middle line:84%
May of 2020, they
ordered their stuff.

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:03.450 align:middle line:84%
They still haven't gotten it
nearly a year and a half later.

00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:03.930 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:06.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We know what's
happening in the auto industry.

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:09.060 align:middle line:84%
Used cars are way up
in value because you

00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:10.770 align:middle line:90%
can't get certain makes.

00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:11.790 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:16.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Toyota is cutting back
production 40% in 2022, I read.

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:19.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, people say,
what's COVID have

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:21.992 align:middle line:84%
to do with a shortage
of virtually everything.

00:25:21.992 --> 00:25:22.950 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:24.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So can you
tell us what happened?

00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:26.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of them is the
computer chip shortage,

00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:29.250 align:middle line:84%
but why did that even
happen all of a sudden?

00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:30.870 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
Well, the problem

00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:35.280 align:middle line:84%
is that all of these things
rely on timing and links.

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:37.572 align:middle line:84%
They are called the
supply line for a reason.

00:25:37.572 --> 00:25:38.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Supply chain, yeah.

00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:40.405 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
Yeah, or supply chain,

00:25:40.405 --> 00:25:42.900 align:middle line:84%
and if one of the chinks
in the chain gets broken,

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:44.225 align:middle line:90%
then you have a problem.

00:25:44.225 --> 00:25:46.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But why'd they
suddenly run out of chips?

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:47.560 align:middle line:90%
How'd that happen.

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:50.520 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Well, again, it
could be something very small,

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:55.150 align:middle line:84%
like the mining company
that digs it up,

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:57.150 align:middle line:84%
or there was some kind
of close-quarters contact

00:25:57.150 --> 00:25:59.190 align:middle line:84%
where they couldn't,
because of COVID, or who

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:01.080 align:middle line:90%
knows what the reason is.

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:02.790 align:middle line:84%
But if there's
anything that impinges

00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:05.850 align:middle line:84%
upon the ability to
not only manifest that,

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:08.950 align:middle line:84%
the raw materials for that, and
then people working together

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:11.200 align:middle line:84%
in those factories or whatever
putting them together--

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.210 align:middle line:84%
some of them are made by
computers and so forth,

00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:14.430 align:middle line:90%
but it doesn't matter.

00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:19.177 align:middle line:84%
Any little fragility within
that system that gets disrupted

00:26:19.177 --> 00:26:20.760 align:middle line:84%
creates problems for
the entire thing.

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:23.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so with
COVID, many of these systems

00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:24.480 align:middle line:90%
were disrupted.

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.105 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: They
were, not only in

00:26:26.105 --> 00:26:28.550 align:middle line:84%
terms of just the production,
but the consumption.

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:28.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:29.960 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: People
were staying at home.

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:30.960 align:middle line:90%
They were not shopping.

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:31.760 align:middle line:90%
They were not buying.

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:32.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:35.395 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: It didn't
make any sense to produce then.

00:26:35.395 --> 00:26:37.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So then when the
money starts cranking back up,

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:40.350 align:middle line:84%
it takes a while for the
supply chain to crank back up.

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:41.333 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yeah.

00:26:41.333 --> 00:26:43.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you think
that's happening?

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.370 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm seeing
inventory shrink everywhere.

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:46.537 align:middle line:90%
I keep an eye on the ground.

00:26:46.537 --> 00:26:49.150 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: I think
we're going to see supply line

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:52.840 align:middle line:84%
interruptions for as long as the
eye can see, because it's been

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:55.720 align:middle line:84%
so disrupted and we're
still kind of skating

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:58.630 align:middle line:84%
on thin ice in terms of
any kind of sustainability

00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:01.840 align:middle line:84%
or viability of the
economy, despite all

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.490 align:middle line:84%
of the great fanfare
of, everything's

00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:05.530 align:middle line:84%
back up and going
again, that we're

00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:07.840 align:middle line:90%
going to see issues with that.

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:11.050 align:middle line:84%
We have a vulnerability
that's been exposed.

00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:13.570 align:middle line:84%
The vulnerability is
that we need each other,

00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:16.510 align:middle line:84%
and we ran economies
almost automatedly,

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:19.870 align:middle line:84%
as if we didn't need each
other, and as if the lowest

00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:21.103 align:middle line:90%
worker was dispensable.

00:27:21.103 --> 00:27:23.020 align:middle line:84%
We just kicked them out,
especially if they're

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:25.930 align:middle line:84%
in a Third-World or
a developing country,

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:27.640 align:middle line:84%
where they can paint
crap and we'll just

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:29.532 align:middle line:90%
move our factories over there.

00:27:29.532 --> 00:27:30.490 align:middle line:90%
We saw that with China.

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:32.290 align:middle line:84%
We moved a lot of
over there, and then

00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:34.180 align:middle line:84%
if we needed personal
protective equipment

00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:36.430 align:middle line:84%
because we didn't have any
ability to produce it here,

00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:39.560 align:middle line:84%
it created a real
shortage, a real problem.

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:40.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:42.277 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: So now
we have an opportunity

00:27:42.277 --> 00:27:45.790 align:middle line:84%
through this, if we do it
right, to start to reincorporate

00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:48.160 align:middle line:84%
some manufacturing,
reincorporate work, makes

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:51.430 align:middle line:84%
supply lines more
local and national

00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:53.007 align:middle line:84%
rather than always
international.

00:27:53.007 --> 00:27:54.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that
seems inevitable,

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:56.507 align:middle line:84%
and one person that kind
of stayed ahead of it

00:27:56.507 --> 00:27:58.210 align:middle line:84%
in the auto industry,
for example,

00:27:58.210 --> 00:28:00.522 align:middle line:84%
was Elon Musk, because he
saw the chip thing coming.

00:28:00.522 --> 00:28:01.480 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:03.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he
diversified where

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:05.410 align:middle line:84%
chips were being made,
and doing alliances

00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:06.910 align:middle line:84%
with other people
that weren't going

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:08.230 align:middle line:90%
to be-- other chip makers.

00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:08.620 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Exactly.

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:11.078 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So he only missed
like, I think, three production

00:28:11.078 --> 00:28:12.880 align:middle line:84%
days is what I read
in one article,

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.820 align:middle line:84%
whereas others are
literally having to cut back

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:17.440 align:middle line:90%
to the extent even of 40%.

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:20.650 align:middle line:10%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: An analogy for
this would be hybridized corn.

00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:22.660 align:middle line:10%
What happened was
they wanted to always

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:24.710 align:middle line:10%
pump up bigger and
bigger ears of corn

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:26.620 align:middle line:10%
to have more and
more yields per acre.

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:29.590 align:middle line:84%
What they did was hybridize
it for that production,

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:31.900 align:middle line:84%
and then you have a
disease that comes along,

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:35.265 align:middle line:84%
and that hybridized corn,
OK, doesn't have the gene

00:28:35.265 --> 00:28:36.640 align:middle line:84%
to fight off that
disease, and it

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:38.680 align:middle line:90%
starts wiping out whole crops.

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.810 align:middle line:84%
The same thing is happening
with supply lines.

00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:43.030 align:middle line:84%
They're putting
all of their eggs

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:46.180 align:middle line:84%
into one basket,
and all of a sudden,

00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:47.742 align:middle line:84%
there's a problem
with that basket.

00:28:47.742 --> 00:28:48.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:50.367 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: And
you look at nature,

00:28:50.367 --> 00:28:53.020 align:middle line:84%
and all the best environments,
the ones that buffer easily,

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:54.400 align:middle line:90%
have diversity like crazy.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
and they balance.

00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:57.220 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: They
balance each other.

00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:58.390 align:middle line:90%
They buffer each other.

00:28:58.390 --> 00:29:01.810 align:middle line:84%
A diversified portfolio in
your stock market, same idea.

00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:04.027 align:middle line:90%
One stock goes down, OK.

00:29:04.027 --> 00:29:05.860 align:middle line:84%
It's not that much a
hit for the other ones.

00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:08.770 align:middle line:84%
The other ones can kind of
pick up and compensate for it.

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:09.940 align:middle line:90%
We don't really have that.

00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:11.920 align:middle line:84%
The economy has gone
for maximum profit,

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:17.620 align:middle line:84%
which has created this very
narrow and kind of tenuous

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:19.113 align:middle line:90%
situation.

00:29:19.113 --> 00:29:20.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Speaking
of, we're going

00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:22.540 align:middle line:84%
to go one step further on
this tenuous situation,

00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:24.123 align:middle line:84%
and then we're going
to get to looking

00:29:24.123 --> 00:29:26.470 align:middle line:84%
at what we can do, from
millennials all the way

00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:28.720 align:middle line:84%
through boomers, what
we can start doing now.

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:31.095 align:middle line:84%
And it's really a much more
beautiful way to live anyway,

00:29:31.095 --> 00:29:31.895 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:31.895 --> 00:29:33.670 align:middle line:84%
So you say we're
entering a period of what

00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:37.895 align:middle line:84%
you call, and is called,
stagflation, but on steroids.

00:29:37.895 --> 00:29:38.770 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yes.

00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:40.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What do
you mean by that?

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:41.657 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
Hyper-stagflation

00:29:41.657 --> 00:29:42.820 align:middle line:90%
is where I see us going.

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:47.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, stagflation, we know the
term from the 1970s, right,

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:48.640 align:middle line:84%
where they had to
kind of counter it

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:50.890 align:middle line:84%
with these really, really
high interest rates, which

00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:53.590 align:middle line:84%
was great for savers but
not so great for trying

00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:55.660 align:middle line:84%
to buy a home and
these sorts of things.

00:29:55.660 --> 00:30:01.180 align:middle line:84%
Stagflation means low
growth, high inflation, OK.

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:03.640 align:middle line:84%
Our real growth,
that's productivity

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:05.560 align:middle line:84%
of our businesses that
are being shuttered,

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:10.790 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, et cetera, is
actually down significantly,

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:11.590 align:middle line:90%
the Main Street.

00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:13.215 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right. but the price
of products is skyrocketing.

00:30:13.215 --> 00:30:15.830 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: The price of
products is skyrocketing, OK.

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:17.830 align:middle line:84%
They're flooding a lot
of money into the system,

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:19.900 align:middle line:84%
even with these unemployment
checks and so forth

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:21.070 align:middle line:84%
that's putting money
into the system.

00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:22.930 align:middle line:84%
People are using it to
buy up cybercurrency.

00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:25.660 align:middle line:84%
They're using it to buy up
products that aren't scarce

00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:28.370 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, but that's not
a recipe for going forward.

00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:29.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:30.545 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
You can't simply

00:30:30.545 --> 00:30:32.170 align:middle line:84%
have real growth,
not this funny money

00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:37.545 align:middle line:84%
growth, this hyperinflated, kind
of testosterone-driven growth.

00:30:37.545 --> 00:30:39.670 align:middle line:84%
You can take steroids and
you get muscles that way.

00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:42.310 align:middle line:84%
That's not the good way to get
muscles, and that's what our--

00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:43.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's a
price to pay later.

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:44.030 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: There
is a price to pay,

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:45.580 align:middle line:84%
and that's what we're
doing with our economy.

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:46.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:48.290 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: So
I see that continue

00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:51.430 align:middle line:84%
to happen because there's
no champion for Main Street.

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:52.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:53.550 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: There's
nobody saying, let's

00:30:53.550 --> 00:30:55.090 align:middle line:90%
flood all the money for them.

00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:57.640 align:middle line:84%
Even the newest so-called
infrastructure bill

00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:00.070 align:middle line:84%
was all really tilted
toward corporations.

00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:02.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's been a
real effort by some

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:04.960 align:middle line:84%
of the progressives in Congress
to really move it toward family

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:08.080 align:middle line:84%
and move it toward Main Street,
but both parties are mostly

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:11.770 align:middle line:84%
captured by the upper
elite, and for some reason,

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:13.840 align:middle line:84%
they keep talking about
helping the little guy,

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:14.950 align:middle line:90%
but they're not.

00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:16.180 align:middle line:90%
And that can't go on forever.

00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:18.700 align:middle line:84%
You can't just have
the Main Street

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:20.170 align:middle line:84%
collapsing in terms
of their growth

00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:23.150 align:middle line:84%
and then being asked to pay
higher and higher prices,

00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:26.020 align:middle line:84%
and then having to borrow
more and more money.

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:28.840 align:middle line:84%
That's just a
recipe for disaster,

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:31.900 align:middle line:84%
but I believe that's going
to happen in the near term.

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:33.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And this is global.

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:36.040 align:middle line:84%
There's an event that
happened recently

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:39.010 align:middle line:84%
that affected the
markets, a company,

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:42.810 align:middle line:84%
I guess a massive corporation
called Evergrande in China.

00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:45.572 align:middle line:84%
Same thing is happening in
China, concentration of wealth

00:31:45.572 --> 00:31:48.030 align:middle line:84%
to the wealthiest, and they
are the wealthiest in the world

00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:51.390 align:middle line:84%
now individually, and then
the rest of the people

00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:53.180 align:middle line:90%
who are struggling themselves.

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:53.520 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Exactly.

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:55.478 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is happening
all over the globe.

00:31:55.478 --> 00:31:58.043 align:middle line:84%
This is not restricted to the
West or the US by any means.

00:31:58.043 --> 00:31:59.460 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
And this is where

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:01.110 align:middle line:84%
we need to have solidarity,
because they often

00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:02.640 align:middle line:84%
tend to talk about
China or Russia

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:04.270 align:middle line:84%
as those Russians
or those Chinese.

00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:05.070 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:05.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We're all people.

00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:06.390 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Those people--

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:06.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Are like us.

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:09.300 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: At bottom
are like us, and their elite--

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:10.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are the same
as the elite everywhere.

00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:13.050 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Everywhere, and
they are abusing their people

00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:13.850 align:middle line:90%
just as much.

00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:16.060 align:middle line:84%
This one company,
Evergrande, just

00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:17.560 align:middle line:84%
recently in the
last couple of days,

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:18.930 align:middle line:84%
and it's sending ripples
through the market,

00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:20.760 align:middle line:84%
crashing cyber currencies
and other things

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:25.590 align:middle line:84%
is $305 billion-- billion
dollars-- in debt.

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:29.600 align:middle line:84%
That's nearly a 1/3 of a
trillion dollars, one company.

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:30.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, in debt.

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:31.350 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Second largest.

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:32.640 align:middle line:84%
It's only the second
largest developer in China.

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:34.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is a real
estate developing company

00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:38.710 align:middle line:84%
that had their fingers
all over the country,

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:41.640 align:middle line:84%
including a lot of those ghost
communities and developments

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:43.350 align:middle line:84%
where no people
ever lived, which

00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:45.230 align:middle line:84%
is hard to get our
minds around anyway.

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:45.390 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:32:45.390 --> 00:32:46.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
were telling me

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:49.890 align:middle line:84%
that they had a practice
in recent times of taking

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:53.790 align:middle line:84%
50% of your purchase money up
front before your house is ever

00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:55.650 align:middle line:84%
built. So they were
taking in quite

00:32:55.650 --> 00:32:58.380 align:middle line:84%
a lot of hard-earned earnings,
because the Chinese know

00:32:58.380 --> 00:32:59.850 align:middle line:90%
how to save, in cash.

00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:03.330 align:middle line:84%
How'd they end up 305
and growing in debt,

00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:05.160 align:middle line:84%
and looking like they're
going to default?

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:07.380 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: The example
I use is Bernie Madoff.

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:10.750 align:middle line:84%
Bernie Madoff as one
person took in $50 billion.

00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:11.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:13.342 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: And
he used a Ponzi scheme

00:33:13.342 --> 00:33:15.210 align:middle line:84%
while skimming the
money out to pay out

00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:16.680 align:middle line:90%
some of the early investors.

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:17.787 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:33:17.787 --> 00:33:20.370 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: I'm not going
to make any statements as to it

00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:22.620 align:middle line:84%
because I don't
have any evidence,

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:26.760 align:middle line:84%
but let's just say what happened
was that they were playing

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:28.350 align:middle line:84%
fast and loose with
financial rules,

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:30.120 align:middle line:84%
and the Chinese
government got wind

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:34.420 align:middle line:84%
that this could create
catastrophic downfall.

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:36.900 align:middle line:84%
So they started to place
more capital reserves

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:39.312 align:middle line:84%
on them, saying, there are
certain things you can't do.

00:33:39.312 --> 00:33:40.770 align:middle line:84%
You need a certain
amount of money.

00:33:40.770 --> 00:33:42.187 align:middle line:84%
You can't just
continue to expand.

00:33:42.187 --> 00:33:44.820 align:middle line:84%
As soon as they imposed
that, it exposed the flaws

00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:46.177 align:middle line:90%
in their flaws in their system.

00:33:46.177 --> 00:33:47.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Practices.

00:33:47.010 --> 00:33:48.927 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Because
anyone can make money

00:33:48.927 --> 00:33:50.170 align:middle line:90%
when it's always going up.

00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:50.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:52.860 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: The
fundamental companies

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:55.110 align:middle line:84%
will make it when it's
going down because they

00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:56.490 align:middle line:90%
have a sound business plan.

00:33:56.490 --> 00:33:59.640 align:middle line:84%
The ones that are just
looking for maximum profit

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:01.158 align:middle line:84%
end up collapsing
and defaulting.

00:34:01.158 --> 00:34:02.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
that's where we are.

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:04.020 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Or
being too big to fail.

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:05.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Too big to
fail, failing upward

00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:08.142 align:middle line:84%
for the big guys, failing
downward for the little guys,

00:34:08.142 --> 00:34:10.980 align:middle line:84%
the average person on the
planet, and this is planetary.

00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:16.230 align:middle line:84%
So now, we're talking about what
you like to term unplugging,

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:18.690 align:middle line:84%
as much as we have
the capability,

00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:22.562 align:middle line:84%
from big everything, and
plugging into small everything.

00:34:22.562 --> 00:34:23.520 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:25.187 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Explain
what you mean by that,

00:34:25.187 --> 00:34:28.491 align:middle line:84%
and let's look at the unique
opportunity for the millennials

00:34:28.491 --> 00:34:30.449 align:middle line:84%
right now, who are just
getting a start in life

00:34:30.449 --> 00:34:32.880 align:middle line:84%
and are saying, we
can never own a house,

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:37.050 align:middle line:84%
not in our state, right,
and also boomers who

00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:40.261 align:middle line:84%
never had a big portfolio and
are working at Walmart, even.

00:34:40.261 --> 00:34:41.219 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:34:41.219 --> 00:34:42.636 align:middle line:84%
The first thing I
want to say here

00:34:42.636 --> 00:34:44.719 align:middle line:84%
and really encourage our
audience, because they're

00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:46.590 align:middle line:84%
a more metaphysical
audience to begin with,

00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:50.680 align:middle line:84%
the really big, big everything
is the cosmic, the cosmos.

00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:51.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:53.820 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: So I want to
plug into that big everything.

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:54.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The really big.

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:55.739 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: The
really big everything.

00:34:55.739 --> 00:34:57.072 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The next level of big.

00:34:57.072 --> 00:35:04.070 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: The planetary
reptilians or overlordy,

00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:06.680 align:middle line:84%
power-mongering
type of people that

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:09.050 align:middle line:84%
can't seem to really care
for others and only care

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:10.987 align:middle line:84%
about power, money,
and so forth, that's

00:35:10.987 --> 00:35:12.070 align:middle line:90%
not who I'm talking about.

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:16.530 align:middle line:84%
We need to withdraw their energy
source, their monetary source.

00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:18.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We need to withdraw
from it and not feed it?

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:18.880 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yes.

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:21.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, like Khloe
Kardashian, a billionaire.

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:22.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: For what?

00:35:22.610 --> 00:35:25.430 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: She's not
forcing anyone to buy her stuff

00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:28.850 align:middle line:84%
or to watch her,
but enough have done

00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:30.620 align:middle line:84%
that to get her a
billion dollars.

00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:32.660 align:middle line:84%
So that's the kind of
unplugging I'm talking

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:34.970 align:middle line:90%
about on a very basic level.

00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:36.230 align:middle line:90%
That's superficial.

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:39.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and also even on
a level that's more pragmatic,

00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:41.300 align:middle line:84%
even in the banking
industry, you

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:44.960 align:middle line:84%
can continue with
Chase, Morgan or Chase,

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:47.570 align:middle line:84%
or you can go with your
local savings union

00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:50.303 align:middle line:84%
in your town, your savings and
thrift, they used to be called.

00:35:50.303 --> 00:35:52.970 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: In my book, the
whole last third of my book are

00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:54.290 align:middle line:90%
all the things you can do--

00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:55.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they're
all beautiful.

00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:57.560 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
To unplug, and also

00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:59.420 align:middle line:90%
to plug into small everything.

00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:02.180 align:middle line:84%
You can unplug from your banks
and bring it to a credit union.

00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:02.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:04.790 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: You can do
all these kinds of things.

00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:07.280 align:middle line:84%
You can begin to
do local currency,

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:10.370 align:middle line:84%
and time sharing, and debt
forgiveness for family members,

00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:15.050 align:middle line:84%
to do peer lending from person
to person at this small level.

00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:16.760 align:middle line:84%
Again, that's
within the framework

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:19.430 align:middle line:84%
of this large big
everything, this cosmic,

00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:20.750 align:middle line:90%
which has integrity.

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:23.730 align:middle line:84%
It has care, it has courage,
compassion, and creativity

00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:24.530 align:middle line:90%
at the heart.

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:26.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it starts
at the grassroots level.

00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:28.545 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: It starts
at the grassroots level.

00:36:28.545 --> 00:36:30.680 align:middle line:84%
I ask everyone, I
said, listen, how good

00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:32.720 align:middle line:84%
do you feel when
you help a neighbor.

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:34.220 align:middle line:84%
And how good do you
feel when you're

00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:35.360 align:middle line:90%
being helped by a neighbor?

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:38.300 align:middle line:84%
Every one of them-- it doesn't
matter what religion they are,

00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:42.050 align:middle line:84%
what political party they
follow, what ethnic group--

00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:43.340 align:middle line:90%
all say the same thing.

00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:44.493 align:middle line:90%
They love it.

00:36:44.493 --> 00:36:46.160 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're a
little bit suspicious,

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:47.827 align:middle line:84%
and some are a little
bit transactional,

00:36:47.827 --> 00:36:48.950 align:middle line:90%
like, I have to do this.

00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:52.580 align:middle line:84%
But for the most part, if we
have a decent relationship,

00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:54.740 align:middle line:84%
we like it when
somebody is helping us

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:56.780 align:middle line:84%
and we like to
help somebody else.

00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:59.850 align:middle line:84%
We have an economy that's
doing the opposite.

00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:01.580 align:middle line:84%
We're having an
economy that's teaching

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:04.160 align:middle line:84%
each and every one of us, and
rewarding us and training us

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:07.700 align:middle line:84%
to, do the opposite, to
have predatory instincts

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:08.670 align:middle line:90%
toward other people.

00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:09.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:11.137 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: And
to fear and suspect

00:37:11.137 --> 00:37:13.590 align:middle line:90%
that everyone's coming after us.

00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:15.410 align:middle line:84%
We can't buy into
that programming

00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:16.610 align:middle line:90%
at the metaphysical level.

00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:17.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not anymore.

00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:18.758 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Not anymore.

00:37:18.758 --> 00:37:24.450 align:middle line:84%
We have to make our stand, and
we have courage, creativity,

00:37:24.450 --> 00:37:26.490 align:middle line:90%
compassion, community.

00:37:26.490 --> 00:37:27.868 align:middle line:84%
Bringing that
together, and there

00:37:27.868 --> 00:37:29.910 align:middle line:84%
are technologies that we
can develop around that,

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:33.240 align:middle line:84%
like I said, pure
lending, time sharing,

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:36.630 align:middle line:84%
to break down those barriers
and still have your own space.

00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:38.230 align:middle line:84%
If you're an introvert
like yourself--

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:40.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I like my room.

00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:41.010 align:middle line:90%
I like my space.

00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:43.385 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: You like your
room, you like your space,

00:37:43.385 --> 00:37:46.290 align:middle line:84%
but for these millennials,
it's a great idea

00:37:46.290 --> 00:37:48.010 align:middle line:90%
to move in together.

00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:52.230 align:middle line:84%
It's a great idea to manage
and buy things in bulk.

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:53.063 align:middle line:90%
You're saving money.

00:37:53.063 --> 00:37:54.522 align:middle line:84%
It's a great idea
because you won't

00:37:54.522 --> 00:37:55.650 align:middle line:90%
have to pay for childcare.

00:37:55.650 --> 00:37:57.960 align:middle line:84%
The parents of some
children can take care of,

00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:59.820 align:middle line:84%
and the kids can
play together when

00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:02.320 align:middle line:84%
the other parents are going out
on their dates and so forth.

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:04.260 align:middle line:90%
We have the imagination.

00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:07.950 align:middle line:84%
We have the really tangible
benefits of, quote,

00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:09.370 align:middle line:90%
being downsized together.

00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:11.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's to needing
each other once again.

00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:12.720 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Needing
each other once again.

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:14.310 align:middle line:84%
We won't be in
the same situation

00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:17.130 align:middle line:84%
that we were in the Depression,
because we have managed

00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:19.980 align:middle line:84%
a certain amount of
prosperity, automation

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:21.900 align:middle line:90%
and certain safeguards.

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:24.180 align:middle line:84%
But let's take advantage
of it proactively.

00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:25.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And one
of the things I

00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:27.150 align:middle line:84%
was asking about a
moment ago, which

00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:31.620 align:middle line:84%
is the Boomers and the Great
Generation before, some of whom

00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:34.942 align:middle line:84%
are still alive,
like my father, one

00:38:34.942 --> 00:38:36.900 align:middle line:84%
of the interesting things
in an interview I did

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:40.998 align:middle line:84%
with a man named Andrea
Villa a few years ago, was we

00:38:40.998 --> 00:38:43.290 align:middle line:84%
were talking about-- he was
saying, what is it with you

00:38:43.290 --> 00:38:44.710 align:middle line:90%
people in America.

00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:46.480 align:middle line:90%
He said in Italy--

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:47.910 align:middle line:90%
he was raised near Venice--

00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:52.080 align:middle line:84%
he said in Italy, in
our towns, the village,

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.820 align:middle line:90%
the whole town raises your son.

00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:57.660 align:middle line:84%
Your uncles raise your son, your
friends, uncles raise your son.

00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:01.620 align:middle line:84%
Everybody raises a child, and
he said here, what's with you.

00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:04.950 align:middle line:84%
The grandparents are like going
on cruises and playing golf.

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:07.170 align:middle line:84%
They're not spending time
with their own grandkids.

00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:08.128 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:39:08.128 --> 00:39:10.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there is
something truthful in that when

00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:12.270 align:middle line:84%
we're looking at the
American culture,

00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:17.310 align:middle line:84%
is the Boomer generation,
which Leo astrologically,

00:39:17.310 --> 00:39:19.710 align:middle line:90%
which is also the me, me, me--

00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:21.815 align:middle line:84%
I'm part of it-- the me,
me, me generation, which

00:39:21.815 --> 00:39:23.190 align:middle line:84%
is I'm going to
get mine, and I'm

00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:24.120 align:middle line:90%
going to make this thing good.

00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:24.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to rock it.

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:26.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to look
good when I'm old.

00:39:26.250 --> 00:39:29.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to play golf well
when I'm old, all these things

00:39:29.490 --> 00:39:31.200 align:middle line:90%
that people want for themselves.

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:32.158 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:39:32.158 --> 00:39:34.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There was a decline
in family participation

00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:36.233 align:middle line:84%
on a multigenerational
level, I think.

00:39:36.233 --> 00:39:37.108 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yes.

00:39:37.108 --> 00:39:39.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And even to an
extent in my dad's generation.

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:40.457 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yeah.

00:39:40.457 --> 00:39:42.780 align:middle line:84%
Sociological books
like "Bowling Alone"

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:44.670 align:middle line:84%
many decades ago
have already begun

00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:47.282 align:middle line:90%
to show that trend, right.

00:39:47.282 --> 00:39:49.740 align:middle line:84%
He looked at-- that was just,
they called the book "Bowling

00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:52.610 align:middle line:84%
Alone" because they noticed it
going from leagues to people--

00:39:52.610 --> 00:39:53.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Bowling alone.

00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:54.570 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
Beginning to bowl alone.

00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:55.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:56.575 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
And I also think

00:39:56.575 --> 00:39:58.830 align:middle line:84%
that the meaning of
life, and achievement,

00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:02.160 align:middle line:84%
and success and worth,
has changed to much more

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:03.540 align:middle line:90%
hyper individualistic.

00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:03.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:05.530 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: It
isn't based in care.

00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:07.860 align:middle line:84%
It's based in getting that
promotion at your work,

00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:09.570 align:middle line:84%
or being on the
cover of a magazine.

00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:09.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:11.440 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Everybody's
got to be a celebrity,

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:13.530 align:middle line:84%
and that's only been
accentuated by social media.

00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:13.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:14.730 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Where
literally everyone is just

00:40:14.730 --> 00:40:16.647 align:middle line:84%
taking pictures of
themselves and their meals.

00:40:16.647 --> 00:40:17.850 align:middle line:90%
Who gives a crap?

00:40:17.850 --> 00:40:19.650 align:middle line:90%
Does that add any real value?

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:21.720 align:middle line:84%
Does it actually create
deep fulfillment?

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:25.650 align:middle line:84%
Or is it more this ersatz,
surface-level, sensation-driven

00:40:25.650 --> 00:40:28.420 align:middle line:84%
notion of worth that if you
just take a half a step back go,

00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:29.220 align:middle line:90%
wait a minute.

00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:31.710 align:middle line:84%
That's not actually that
important to me or the world.

00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:34.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you've said
before that with all of this

00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:36.480 align:middle line:84%
coming down now,
and coming unglued,

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:38.040 align:middle line:84%
there has never
been a better time

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:39.290 align:middle line:90%
to be creative or be yourself.

00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:40.020 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Absolutely.

00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:41.937 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I couldn't
agree with that more.

00:40:41.937 --> 00:40:43.805 align:middle line:84%
If all of the systems
and institutions

00:40:43.805 --> 00:40:45.180 align:middle line:84%
aren't offering
you what was once

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:46.840 align:middle line:90%
promised a generation ago--

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:47.130 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:47.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, then good.

00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:48.990 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to do it.

00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:50.032 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Exactly.

00:40:50.032 --> 00:40:52.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it used to be the
pragmatist went ahead and did

00:40:52.890 --> 00:40:55.560 align:middle line:84%
the working hard, did the
saving, did all this and that,

00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:56.972 align:middle line:90%
had their own little house.

00:40:56.972 --> 00:40:58.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The good
husband and good wife.

00:40:58.680 --> 00:40:59.820 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
Yeah, suburban, you

00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:01.920 align:middle line:84%
know, McMansion, whatever
it happened to be,

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:05.370 align:middle line:84%
and would get the wages
for following the rules

00:41:05.370 --> 00:41:06.540 align:middle line:90%
and toeing the line.

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:10.230 align:middle line:84%
It was boring, and you might
be working in a cubicle.

00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:11.640 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's all gone.

00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:14.790 align:middle line:84%
You're freed from that,
because they've gone ahead

00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:17.333 align:middle line:84%
and blew away all
those promises.

00:41:17.333 --> 00:41:18.750 align:middle line:84%
They're not going
to be giving you

00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:21.420 align:middle line:84%
all those things for
the sacrifice of giving

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:23.220 align:middle line:90%
in to the man, as it were.

00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:26.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's never been a
better time to be who you are.

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.650 align:middle line:84%
Never been a better time,
because now that creativity,

00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:30.780 align:middle line:84%
compassion,
togetherness, community

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:32.880 align:middle line:84%
is required for you
to have a good life,

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:36.207 align:middle line:84%
because all the promises have
been broken on the bad life

00:41:36.207 --> 00:41:38.040 align:middle line:84%
that you were going to
sacrifice yourself to

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:39.180 align:middle line:90%
in order to get your goodies.

00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:39.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:41.073 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: You know?

00:41:41.073 --> 00:41:42.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, that's very true.

00:41:42.450 --> 00:41:44.100 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: So there
isn't-- the pragmatist now is

00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:45.190 align:middle line:90%
the idealist.

00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:45.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:47.670 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: And that's
what we need to focus on,

00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:49.410 align:middle line:84%
how can we bring that
pragmatism together

00:41:49.410 --> 00:41:52.680 align:middle line:84%
with that much more
fulfilling, cosmically oriented

00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:54.990 align:middle line:84%
big everything, and then
pull our energy away

00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:59.560 align:middle line:84%
from that very low-level, global
sort of elite big everything.

00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:01.170 align:middle line:90%
And we do it through the local.

00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:03.150 align:middle line:90%
We do it through relationships.

00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:06.420 align:middle line:84%
We do it through experiences
over possessions.

00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:09.720 align:middle line:84%
We do it by beginning
to honor, care.

00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:12.360 align:middle line:84%
Without care, forget about
it, caring about what we do,

00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:14.910 align:middle line:84%
caring about the effect on the
planet, caring for each other.

00:42:14.910 --> 00:42:17.367 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I agree with that,
and I did a show recently

00:42:17.367 --> 00:42:19.200 align:middle line:84%
with Jan Engels-Smith,
where we were talking

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:21.520 align:middle line:84%
about the changes that are
happening in the cosmos

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:23.940 align:middle line:84%
and on our Earth, the actual
shifting of the frequencies

00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:24.740 align:middle line:90%
of Earth itself.

00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:26.970 align:middle line:84%
Everything changes
frequencies over time,

00:42:26.970 --> 00:42:29.010 align:middle line:84%
and the Earth is going
in an upward trajectory

00:42:29.010 --> 00:42:32.430 align:middle line:84%
in its frequencies, meaning
that the old ways of doing

00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:33.270 align:middle line:90%
and being--

00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:34.080 align:middle line:90%
She's our host.

00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:36.210 align:middle line:84%
We have to keep up
or we're not here.

00:42:36.210 --> 00:42:37.168 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:42:37.168 --> 00:42:39.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And to do that,
we have to refine ourselves.

00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:42.990 align:middle line:84%
We have to start questioning why
we're doing what we're doing.

00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:43.200 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:45.533 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We have to start
caring and opening our hearts

00:42:45.533 --> 00:42:47.700 align:middle line:84%
again to keep up with
the frequencies of Earth.

00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:51.840 align:middle line:84%
So isn't it absolutely
essential that the economy

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:55.230 align:middle line:84%
as we've known it, now
to become so artificial,

00:42:55.230 --> 00:42:58.110 align:middle line:84%
has to drop away as we
knew it to give birth

00:42:58.110 --> 00:42:58.910 align:middle line:90%
to something else?

00:42:58.910 --> 00:42:59.200 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:01.158 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so I want
to add one more thought

00:43:01.158 --> 00:43:02.850 align:middle line:90%
and then have you take it away.

00:43:02.850 --> 00:43:04.650 align:middle line:84%
For years, I've been
saying to people,

00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:07.950 align:middle line:84%
we have to look around and
see where our real assets are.

00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:09.820 align:middle line:90%
Like, what do I have?

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:12.150 align:middle line:84%
What skills do I have to
offer as a human being

00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:13.230 align:middle line:90%
to another person?

00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:15.810 align:middle line:84%
If, say, I'm letting
go of that horrible job

00:43:15.810 --> 00:43:17.970 align:middle line:84%
or they won't have
me back, and now I've

00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:21.120 align:middle line:84%
got to move out of my
house or sell it, and maybe

00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:23.552 align:middle line:84%
move in with a family member,
what do I have to offer?

00:43:23.552 --> 00:43:24.510 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:26.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And who do you love?

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:29.760 align:middle line:84%
Who loves you when it comes
down to it in hard times?

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:31.230 align:middle line:90%
That's the biggest question.

00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:31.370 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Sure.

00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:33.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It really
comes down to who

00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:34.470 align:middle line:90%
loves me enough to help me.

00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:36.000 align:middle line:90%
Who do I love enough to help?

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.860 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
Exactly, exactly.

00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:39.450 align:middle line:90%
And there's a humility to that.

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:39.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:41.100 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Instead
of that kind of almost

00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:43.680 align:middle line:84%
testosterone-driven, I'm
better than everyone else,

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:45.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to rise
above it all now

00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:47.940 align:middle line:84%
you're saying, not that
you're humble and lowly.

00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:50.850 align:middle line:84%
You're saying I've got a unique,
divine genius that I have

00:43:50.850 --> 00:43:53.320 align:middle line:84%
to offer the world,
and it can be

00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:58.000 align:middle line:84%
done in very, very sensitive
and wonderful and fulfilling and

00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:58.820 align:middle line:90%
healthy ways.

00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:01.375 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't have to be on
the front page of a magazine.

00:44:01.375 --> 00:44:01.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:03.960 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: I trust
the experience and flow

00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:08.260 align:middle line:84%
of energy and spirit
more than that lack

00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:12.100 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual confidence
I had by selling my soul

00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:16.790 align:middle line:84%
to a system that has only the
worst intentions for everyone.

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:21.520 align:middle line:84%
I am now dedicating my soul and
my spirit to creating a system,

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:24.595 align:middle line:84%
and getting up every morning
and dedicating myself

00:44:24.595 --> 00:44:26.470 align:middle line:84%
to that system that's
going to make the world

00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:29.290 align:middle line:84%
a better place that more
caring, more compassionate, more

00:44:29.290 --> 00:44:31.420 align:middle line:90%
creative and more courageous.

00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:33.950 align:middle line:84%
So that's the choice we
have to make right there.

00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:34.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:44:34.750 --> 00:44:35.740 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
It's been laid bare.

00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:37.448 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It has been
laid bare, and this

00:44:37.448 --> 00:44:39.760 align:middle line:84%
is very different than
the New Age axiom.

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:42.640 align:middle line:84%
Money is nothing but
energy made manifest.

00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:43.600 align:middle line:90%
This is different now.

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:44.680 align:middle line:90%
We're moving beyond that.

00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:45.970 align:middle line:90%
We're leaving that behind.

00:44:45.970 --> 00:44:48.550 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
what is made manifest

00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:51.010 align:middle line:84%
through true energy and
love, and it may not

00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:52.780 align:middle line:90%
be money, per se, OK.

00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:55.570 align:middle line:84%
But it's something that has
even truer value than that

00:44:55.570 --> 00:44:59.140 align:middle line:84%
to grow with the Earth into this
more sustainable, going back

00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:02.140 align:middle line:84%
to the harmonies and remembrance
of why the Earth was so

00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:04.210 align:middle line:84%
healing for us, always
has been, and why

00:45:04.210 --> 00:45:05.902 align:middle line:90%
we turned our back on her.

00:45:05.902 --> 00:45:07.360 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
Exactly, and to go

00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:10.270 align:middle line:84%
to what you've said many
times, and many of your guests

00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:16.990 align:middle line:84%
have said, that heart-based
feeling, right, is

00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:18.490 align:middle line:90%
what is important.

00:45:18.490 --> 00:45:20.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:23.820 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: That, being
able to understand that rather

00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:27.570 align:middle line:84%
than that notion, oftentimes,
in these more materially

00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:31.320 align:middle line:84%
driven so-called spiritual
things, right, which

00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:32.740 align:middle line:90%
are a wolf in sheep's clothing.

00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:33.930 align:middle line:90%
Let's face it.

00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:34.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Some of them, yeah.

00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:36.215 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Some
of them were, OK,

00:45:36.215 --> 00:45:37.620 align:middle line:90%
or they were a little bit naive.

00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:40.170 align:middle line:84%
Now we're moving, like you
said, into the next phase.

00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:40.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:42.810 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: We've gone
through that growing phase

00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:45.220 align:middle line:84%
to be without
judgment, all right,

00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:47.590 align:middle line:84%
and this next phase
doesn't have to do

00:45:47.590 --> 00:45:50.680 align:middle line:84%
with our individual,
spiritual enlightenment.

00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:53.790 align:middle line:84%
Or our personal,
I guess you'd say,

00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:55.830 align:middle line:84%
promotion into the
good life is not

00:45:55.830 --> 00:45:59.595 align:middle line:84%
based upon exterior
approval, positioning

00:45:59.595 --> 00:46:00.470 align:middle line:90%
and all those things.

00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:01.780 align:middle line:90%
It's based on the relationship.

00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:04.120 align:middle line:84%
It's based on our spirit
doing what it's here to do.

00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:04.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:46:04.450 --> 00:46:06.100 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
So based sharing.

00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:06.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:46:06.490 --> 00:46:07.290 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:46:07.290 --> 00:46:09.730 align:middle line:84%
Comes down to it, that's
where we have to go,

00:46:09.730 --> 00:46:11.560 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to have
a lot of iterations

00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:13.480 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to be
painful for some people.

00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:15.760 align:middle line:84%
No doubt about it, we're
going through a shift,

00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:17.980 align:middle line:84%
and shifts are painful
because it means letting

00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:19.755 align:middle line:90%
go of our familiar moorings.

00:46:19.755 --> 00:46:21.130 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
But if we do it,

00:46:21.130 --> 00:46:22.780 align:middle line:84%
we're going to
find it actually--

00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:23.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So much more--

00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:25.660 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: At first,
we're going to be panicked.

00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:28.090 align:middle line:84%
First, we're going to be fearful
and be like, oh, I'm going out

00:46:28.090 --> 00:46:29.132 align:middle line:90%
on my own with my family.

00:46:29.132 --> 00:46:29.960 align:middle line:90%
Who's going to do--

00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:32.720 align:middle line:84%
but as we move into it,
we're going to be, ah.

00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:33.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:34.978 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
All these burdens,

00:46:34.978 --> 00:46:37.630 align:middle line:84%
all these expectations,
all this struggle

00:46:37.630 --> 00:46:40.210 align:middle line:84%
in which I wasn't going to be
rewarded, in which my work was

00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:42.460 align:middle line:84%
going to be taken advantage
of, now I actually

00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:43.475 align:middle line:90%
can build on something.

00:46:43.475 --> 00:46:44.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:46:44.350 --> 00:46:46.935 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: In community
with others, with my family

00:46:46.935 --> 00:46:48.310 align:middle line:84%
and other families,
in community.

00:46:48.310 --> 00:46:50.435 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And families will
be back together again.

00:46:50.435 --> 00:46:52.700 align:middle line:84%
I think just one
example, my sister,

00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:54.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when my sister
and I had our children,

00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:56.410 align:middle line:84%
we were in our own house
having to figure out

00:46:56.410 --> 00:46:58.493 align:middle line:84%
how to pay the mortgage
and not miss too much work

00:46:58.493 --> 00:47:02.260 align:middle line:84%
and keep the kids healthy,
cared for and going.

00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:06.160 align:middle line:84%
New moms with jobs and
heads of household and such,

00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:08.373 align:middle line:90%
and that's very stressful.

00:47:08.373 --> 00:47:10.540 align:middle line:84%
Very stressful when you're
trying to nurture a baby.

00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:13.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, her son is
married and they're

00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:15.700 align:middle line:84%
getting ready to have
a baby, and my sister

00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:19.120 align:middle line:84%
has this little build-up above
a garage, little apartment.

00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:21.010 align:middle line:84%
They moved into the
little apartment.

00:47:21.010 --> 00:47:22.660 align:middle line:84%
They're going to have
their baby there.

00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:25.270 align:middle line:84%
The whole family is there
now to take care of the baby.

00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:28.030 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to stress
it over high rents,

00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:31.340 align:middle line:84%
so they can work as they can,
continue their education.

00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's just like this
beautiful little wonderland

00:47:34.690 --> 00:47:37.960 align:middle line:84%
over there of extended
multigenerational family

00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:40.770 align:middle line:84%
coming together to now bring
this new life into the world.

00:47:40.770 --> 00:47:42.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's how it
always should have been.

00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:43.300 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: It
should have been.

00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:44.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We shouldn't have
been stressed out thinking,

00:47:44.810 --> 00:47:46.360 align:middle line:84%
oh, I can only
take six weeks off

00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:47.782 align:middle line:84%
and who's going
to watch the baby.

00:47:47.782 --> 00:47:48.740 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:49.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's not right.

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:50.740 align:middle line:10%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right,
and as we do that

00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:52.240 align:middle line:10%
and we get a taste
for it, we're not

00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:53.950 align:middle line:10%
going to put up with
the abuse anymore.

00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:54.400 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:55.060 align:middle line:10%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: We're
not going to put up

00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:56.440 align:middle line:10%
with the predatory behavior.

00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:59.122 align:middle line:10%
We're going to elect politicians
and community leaders,

00:47:59.122 --> 00:48:01.330 align:middle line:10%
and we ourselves are going
to run for these positions

00:48:01.330 --> 00:48:02.380 align:middle line:10%
and advocate for them.

00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:04.700 align:middle line:10%
That supports exactly
what you just said.

00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:05.725 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:05.725 --> 00:48:08.680 align:middle line:84%
We're in 100% agreement,
and support all

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:10.795 align:middle line:84%
your little small, local
mom-and-pop businesses

00:48:10.795 --> 00:48:11.920 align:middle line:90%
that made it through COVID.

00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:13.360 align:middle line:90%
I think that's a big one too.

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:13.720 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:15.345 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Support
your small businesses

00:48:15.345 --> 00:48:16.580 align:middle line:90%
and support each other.

00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:17.200 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
That's an investment

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:18.310 align:middle line:90%
in the future of the world.

00:48:18.310 --> 00:48:20.140 align:middle line:84%
It's an investment in
the future of your heart

00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:21.250 align:middle line:90%
and the heart of your community.

00:48:21.250 --> 00:48:22.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:22.050 --> 00:48:23.170 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Zeus.

00:48:23.170 --> 00:48:25.780 align:middle line:84%
I met you here 5 and 1/2
years ago exactly, almost

00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:28.720 align:middle line:84%
exactly 5 and 1/2 years
ago, on this story,

00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:31.318 align:middle line:84%
and this is where
it's landed today.

00:48:31.318 --> 00:48:32.860 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
We're a good example

00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:36.900 align:middle line:84%
of what can come out if
we just let go and just

00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:37.700 align:middle line:90%
proceed forward.

00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:40.242 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely, and that's
what I first interviewed you

00:48:40.242 --> 00:48:42.700 align:middle line:84%
on, was transforming
economy back then.

00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:44.042 align:middle line:90%
And now it's just coming true.

00:48:44.042 --> 00:48:45.230 align:middle line:90%
So thank you.

00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:47.560 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for being
here and in my life.

00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:50.560 align:middle line:10%
