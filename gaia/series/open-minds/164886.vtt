00:00:29.145 --> 00:00:30.770 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
We pick up our story

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.980 align:middle line:10%
of occult America with the
return of the secret teachings.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.990 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps one of the
greatest mystical minds

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.960 align:middle line:84%
walking the reading halls of
the New York Public Library

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.420 align:middle line:84%
was a young man
named Manly P. Hall.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.480 align:middle line:84%
We're going to pick up our
story there after we go back

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.680 align:middle line:84%
and take a look at the
Afro-American mystical roots,

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.240 align:middle line:84%
because that's a
part of the story.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.530 align:middle line:90%
We got cut off last time.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:52.470 align:middle line:90%
And it's so important.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.780 align:middle line:90%
We need to bring this back in.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.040 align:middle line:90%
Then we'll go to Manly.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.960 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
start with a man--

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:57.760 align:middle line:90%
and welcome back.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MITCH HOROWITZ: Thank you.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --named Frederick
Douglass and his master, Covey,

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.610 align:middle line:84%
and what happened to this
man, how he broke free,

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.119 align:middle line:84%
and what he was able to
teach his people of the day.

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.160 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Now, this is
an extraordinary chapter

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.180 align:middle line:10%
in American history.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.470 align:middle line:10%
And it's another of these places
where the resources are there.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.440 align:middle line:10%
The documentation can be
found, but it requires

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.660 align:middle line:10%
us to reorient our perspective.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.060 align:middle line:84%
Because we don't often
associate the history,

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.422 align:middle line:90%
say, of abolitionism--

00:01:27.422 --> 00:01:28.880 align:middle line:84%
and Frederick
Douglass was probably

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.750 align:middle line:84%
the greatest abolitionist
figure in our nation's history--

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.920 align:middle line:84%
with the occult. But the
two overlap one another

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.100 align:middle line:84%
as the occult does with so
many things in American life.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.840 align:middle line:10%
And the episode can be found, if
one knows how to understand it,

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.480 align:middle line:10%
directly in Frederick
Douglass's memoirs.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.640 align:middle line:90%
He wrote three memoirs.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.470 align:middle line:90%
They were substantially similar.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.980 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes he would add
some additional information,

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.710 align:middle line:84%
or emphasize, or
de-emphasize something.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.280 align:middle line:84%
In each of Douglass's
three memoirs,

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.070 align:middle line:84%
he tells the extraordinary
story, the turning point

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.820 align:middle line:84%
of his life, where, at age
15, as you were referencing,

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.070 align:middle line:84%
he fights back against Covey,
this very vicious, sadistic

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.680 align:middle line:90%
slave master.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.170 align:middle line:10%
And Douglass, at that
point in his life,

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.990 align:middle line:10%
says that fighting back against
this tyrannical, horrible

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.710 align:middle line:10%
figure gave him a sense
of his own inner worth,

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.340 align:middle line:10%
and that he was, at that point,
spiritually free, so to speak,

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.500 align:middle line:10%
and that he vowed--

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.740 align:middle line:10%
he vowed-- that it would
only be a matter of time

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.430 align:middle line:10%
until he was physically free,
and that this was the turning

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.510 align:middle line:10%
point of his life.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.580 align:middle line:90%
It gave him a sense of selfhood.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, right there within all
three of Douglass's memoirs,

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.190 align:middle line:84%
he writes about meeting
an old African medicine

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.890 align:middle line:90%
man named Sandy Jenkins.

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.490 align:middle line:84%
And Sandy Jenkins
gives him a root,

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.250 align:middle line:84%
which he says will give
him strength and confidence

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.860 align:middle line:84%
to fight back against
this slave master.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, as I write about
in "Occult America,"

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.590 align:middle line:84%
if you understand the
African-American tradition

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.303 align:middle line:90%
of magic called Hoodoo--

00:03:11.303 --> 00:03:14.900 align:middle line:84%
Hoodoo, with an H, not Voodoo,
with which it's often confused.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.210 align:middle line:10%
But Hoodoo is a home-grown
African-American religion that

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:26.340 align:middle line:10%
consists of spellwork and a
variety of occult techniques,

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.140 align:middle line:10%
some of which--

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.390 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Including roots,
and herbs, and so forth, yeah.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.431 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Roots, and
herbs, and herbal healing,

00:03:31.431 --> 00:03:32.330 align:middle line:90%
and so forth--

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.280 align:middle line:84%
some of these
things are probably

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.040 align:middle line:84%
retentions from
ancient African faith.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.030 align:middle line:10%
And some are ideas that
people came to on their own

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.770 align:middle line:10%
or borrowed from
other faiths that they

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.030 align:middle line:10%
encountered in the New World
while they were enslaved here.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.920 align:middle line:10%
And Sandy Jenkins, this
African medicine man,

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.540 align:middle line:10%
as Frederick Douglass refers
to him with veneration,

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.940 align:middle line:10%
gave him this root,
which is probably

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.110 align:middle line:10%
Jalap root or something that
was known as John the Conqueror,

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.610 align:middle line:10%
John the Conqueror
root, which is

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.090 align:middle line:10%
sort of like a
hard, bulbous root

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.000 align:middle line:10%
that-- you couldn't even
crush it if you squeezed it

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.350 align:middle line:10%
with all your might.

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.740 align:middle line:10%
And people would keep it, and
still do, in their pockets

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.920 align:middle line:10%
for virility,
strength, confidence.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.040 align:middle line:10%
And Douglass writes
that this root gave him

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.110 align:middle line:10%
some sense of confidence.

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.570 align:middle line:10%
And he said he
wondered-- he wondered--

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.960 align:middle line:10%
if the root, maybe, had
influenced him in some way,

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.770 align:middle line:10%
psychological or in
some larger unseen way,

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.160 align:middle line:10%
if maybe Sandy's belief
systems, which Douglas himself

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.470 align:middle line:10%
didn't particularly
subscribe to--

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.180 align:middle line:10%
he was somebody who
sort of got worried

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.855 align:middle line:10%
about people getting
into folk religion.

00:04:42.855 --> 00:04:46.340 align:middle line:10%
And he wanted to be educated
along different lines.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.500 align:middle line:10%
But he said, I had to concede--

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.270 align:middle line:10%
I had to concede--

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.790 align:middle line:10%
that maybe a ray
of Sandy's beliefs,

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:57.440 align:middle line:10%
and maybe something more,
cast itself upon me,

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.140 align:middle line:10%
and that this root gave me
the confidence to do what

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.530 align:middle line:10%
I needed to do.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, people read this,
historians, biographers

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.600 align:middle line:90%
read this.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.492 align:middle line:84%
They don't know how
to contextualize it.

00:05:07.492 --> 00:05:08.950 align:middle line:84%
They just think,
oh, you know, it's

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:10.370 align:middle line:90%
just some superstitious thing.

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And some local guy
gave him a root.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.740 align:middle line:84%
It comes from a very
finely-worked-out

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.500 align:middle line:84%
religious tradition
called Hoodoo,

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.910 align:middle line:84%
which was an African retentive
faith that was practiced,

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.270 align:middle line:84%
first, among slaves,
and today, is still

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.010 align:middle line:90%
practiced all over America.

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.450 align:middle line:90%
It's a form of ceremonial magic.

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.760 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
is so fundamental

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.280 align:middle line:84%
a part of American
life that we can almost

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.310 align:middle line:84%
lose sight of the
root work that it

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:39.970 align:middle line:90%
created throughout our nation.

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.270 align:middle line:84%
It's right there, this
episode straight out

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.350 align:middle line:84%
of the history of Hoodoo, in
Frederick Douglass's memoirs.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.960 align:middle line:84%
One just needs to know
how to look for it.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.670 align:middle line:10%
And he wrote about
it with veneration.

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.310 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So after he used
the root, what happened?

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.830 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: He was able to
fight back against Covey.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.100 align:middle line:84%
Covey was not able to physically
get the better of him.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.110 align:middle line:84%
The two men struggled
for two hours.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.340 align:middle line:90%
I shouldn't say men.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:02.730 align:middle line:90%
Covey was--

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:03.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Was a boy.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.873 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: --biologically a
man, but Frederick Douglass

00:06:05.873 --> 00:06:07.080 align:middle line:10%
was age 15.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And Covey was very
embarrassed at not

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.650 align:middle line:84%
being able to sort of
get the better of him.

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And it was-- as
I was mentioning,

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.050 align:middle line:84%
it was an inner
revolution for Douglass.

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.350 align:middle line:84%
Because for the first
time, he had stood up

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:20.670 align:middle line:90%
with a sense of selfhood.

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.340 align:middle line:84%
And he knew that as he
was, at that moment,

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.852 align:middle line:84%
spiritually emancipated,
at some point,

00:06:25.852 --> 00:06:27.310 align:middle line:84%
he would be physically
emancipated.

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But didn't
Covey back off after that?

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:29.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:29.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He left him alone?

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:30.713 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: He backed off.

00:06:30.713 --> 00:06:32.130 align:middle line:10%
It was an extraordinary episode.

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:37.280 align:middle line:10%
You know, as soon as Douglass
had asserted his selfhood,

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.180 align:middle line:10%
Covey was completely
disoriented.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.260 align:middle line:10%
He didn't know how
to deal with him.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.500 align:middle line:10%
So there's a quality
to the episode--

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.360 align:middle line:10%
and Douglass writes
this himself.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.950 align:middle line:10%
There's a quality that is
so outside the ordinary.

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:51.780 align:middle line:10%
There's a spiritual
quality to it.

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He did ultimately
become a freed man, right?

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.810 align:middle line:84%
And he went on to become a
huge voice in the abolitionist

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:58.610 align:middle line:90%
movement.

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.410 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: He was the
conscience, and the intellect,

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:02.760 align:middle line:90%
and the voice of abolition--

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:03.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A brilliant man.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: --in
America, a brilliant man,

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.250 align:middle line:84%
absolutely formative
to our history--

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.020 align:middle line:90%
formative to our history.

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.170 align:middle line:84%
And again, you know, we think
of the occult or the paranormal

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:15.090 align:middle line:84%
as being something that
belongs to the fringes

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:16.590 align:middle line:90%
of American culture.

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:19.420 align:middle line:84%
It's part of the roots
of American culture.

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:22.740 align:middle line:10%
You find its intersection in
the lives of so many figures

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:26.070 align:middle line:10%
whose names are
household names today.

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:28.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now we go to the
poor man's psychologist.

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:29.070 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:30.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about him.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Professor
Black Herman.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.398 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Black Herman.

00:07:32.398 --> 00:07:34.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Black
Herman was a magician

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.590 align:middle line:84%
named Benjamin Rucker who
lived and worked in Harlem

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:40.620 align:middle line:84%
during what was called the
Harlem Renaissance of writing,

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.650 align:middle line:84%
and culture, and the
arts, and jazz in New York

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:46.050 align:middle line:90%
City in the 1920s, '30s.

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:48.464 align:middle line:84%
And he took the stage
name of Black Herman.

00:07:48.464 --> 00:07:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And he was an unusual
figure, because he

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:54.180 align:middle line:84%
was one of the few stage
magicians who also designated

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:55.800 align:middle line:90%
himself as an occultist.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And he was a
practitioner of Hoodoo.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because usually, they
try to keep those two separate.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:00.660 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.090 align:middle line:10%
Nowadays the stage
magician considers

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:04.747 align:middle line:10%
himself a practitioner--

00:08:04.747 --> 00:08:05.955 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: A great technician.

00:08:05.955 --> 00:08:09.180 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: --of a craft,
a technician, a performer,

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:11.880 align:middle line:10%
and wouldn't, in any way,
want it to be associated with

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.970 align:middle line:10%
a belief system, much less the
occult. But Benjamin Rucker,

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:17.440 align:middle line:10%
who called himself Black
Herman, Professor Black Herman--

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.240 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.160 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: --was a
Hoodoo practitioner who

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.580 align:middle line:10%
would see people and give
them roots, and formulas,

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:26.400 align:middle line:10%
and give them
advice, advise them

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.800 align:middle line:10%
on candle burning
and devotional acts,

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.080 align:middle line:10%
and he was also a
stage performer.

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.600 align:middle line:10%
There is an
anti-fortunetelling law

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.140 align:middle line:10%
on the books in New York state
and in other states as well.

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.929 align:middle line:10%
And Black Herman
was set up as kind

00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:44.910 align:middle line:10%
of part of a sting
operation in the late 1920s

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:48.750 align:middle line:10%
and was arrested under
this law for a very--

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:50.370 align:middle line:10%
what would have been
considered, even

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:53.935 align:middle line:10%
by the strictures of this
law, a very-- minor offense.

00:08:53.935 --> 00:08:55.560 align:middle line:10%
And a reporter from
"The Village Voice"

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.050 align:middle line:10%
called me recently
and was wondering--

00:08:58.050 --> 00:08:59.490 align:middle line:10%
I think, quite astutely--

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:02.040 align:middle line:10%
whether there was a
racial aspect to this,

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.160 align:middle line:10%
whether this law was
being used to take down

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.050 align:middle line:10%
a popular figure in
the Harlem Renaissance.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:07.860 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: A fair question.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:08.660 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Yeah.

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:11.130 align:middle line:10%
And he would play to
integrated audiences.

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.590 align:middle line:10%
He was popular as a
magician, but he was also

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:15.090 align:middle line:10%
a practicing occultist.

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:18.000 align:middle line:10%
And so this law, which really
was supposed to protect people

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.650 align:middle line:10%
against con artistry,
against people

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:22.830 align:middle line:10%
who were charging ruinous
sums and promising things

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:24.330 align:middle line:10%
that could never be delivered--

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.820 align:middle line:10%
Black Herman didn't
charge ruinous sums.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:30.430 align:middle line:84%
As you alluded, he was known
as the poor man's psychology.

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:32.850 align:middle line:84%
You know, I mean, he would
see people for pennies.

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:36.420 align:middle line:84%
His clientele was a poor
clientele in many respects.

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:39.090 align:middle line:10%
And the only reason he was
targeted under this law,

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:42.180 align:middle line:10%
I think, was probably because
of some sort of racial animus.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:45.840 align:middle line:10%
It was a sting operation to take
down a popular cultural figure.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:49.200 align:middle line:84%
And that moves us
on to Marcus Garvey,

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.549 align:middle line:84%
kind of the first
African pride leader.

00:09:51.549 --> 00:09:52.590 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: That's right.

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:55.380 align:middle line:10%
Marcus Garvey, again, just
an extraordinary figure.

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:57.720 align:middle line:84%
He was a pioneering
black nationalist

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:01.560 align:middle line:84%
he was a pioneering voice for
black dignity, liberation,

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.310 align:middle line:90%
emancipation.

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:05.760 align:middle line:84%
He was popular in the
United States and Europe

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.770 align:middle line:84%
in the early decades
of the 20th century.

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:12.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, Garvey was deeply
attached to and interested

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.340 align:middle line:84%
in the philosophy
of New Thought,

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.950 align:middle line:84%
or, again, what we,
today, might call

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:20.280 align:middle line:84%
law of attraction, the secret,
the power of positive thinking.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:23.400 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is one of these
cases where occult history is

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.900 align:middle line:90%
hidden in plain sight.

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.210 align:middle line:90%
It's hidden in plain sight.

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:30.990 align:middle line:10%
Marcus Garvey's speeches
are filled with phraseology

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:33.300 align:middle line:10%
from New Thought, like
"as a man thinketh,

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.800 align:middle line:10%
so shall he should
be-- so shall he be."

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:36.600 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.766 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: "Day by day,
in every way, the black man

00:10:38.766 --> 00:10:40.800 align:middle line:10%
is getting stronger
and stronger."

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.590 align:middle line:10%
You know, he would use all
these phrases from New Thought

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:46.290 align:middle line:10%
tradition, but
reappropriate themself

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:48.377 align:middle line:10%
to the struggle for
black emancipation

00:10:48.377 --> 00:10:49.210 align:middle line:10%
in the 20th century.

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:50.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did he have
a strong following?

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:52.366 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh, he
had a huge following.

00:10:52.366 --> 00:10:54.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he could address
literally tens of thousands

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.510 align:middle line:90%
of people at street rallies.

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And he was a very
popular figure.

00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And he had numerous newspapers,
and businesses, and so forth.

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:05.160 align:middle line:84%
He too was brought down in a
very, very questionable sting

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.240 align:middle line:90%
operation.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.920 align:middle line:10%
Now, people think
of Marcus Garvey

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:11.410 align:middle line:10%
as being this ardently political
figure, as being an activist.

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:13.080 align:middle line:90%
He was also a spiritual figure.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And he would tell
people at rallies,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.860 align:middle line:84%
what you've got to
do is use your mind,

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:19.920 align:middle line:84%
use your thoughts
in a scientific way.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:24.510 align:middle line:10%
Through your thoughts, you can
uplift your station in life.

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:26.230 align:middle line:84%
He would use the
term "science"--

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:27.030 align:middle line:90%
science.

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And what many observers--
many white observers-- didn't

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:33.990 align:middle line:84%
understand is, where
he grew up in Jamaica,

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:36.000 align:middle line:84%
and in the Caribbean
in general, science

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.360 align:middle line:84%
was sometimes a term that
was used for the occult.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:42.680 align:middle line:84%
Science was a slang
term for the occult.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:43.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.188 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: And so
when Garvey would say,

00:11:45.188 --> 00:11:46.950 align:middle line:10%
you've got to make
a use of science,

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:49.710 align:middle line:10%
you've got to use
your mind in a way

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:52.621 align:middle line:10%
that you can uplift your
life, uplift your finances,

00:11:52.621 --> 00:11:54.870 align:middle line:10%
people might wonder, well,
what does he mean, science.

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:56.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was more kind of
the magical elements of life.

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:57.690 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Precisely.

00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:59.470 align:middle line:84%
And he was an ardent
believer in this.

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:01.880 align:middle line:10%
And again and again-- and I
walk through this in "Occult

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:04.460 align:middle line:10%
America"-- you'll
find the telltale--

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:07.114 align:middle line:10%
the phraseology, the
slogans, the ideas

00:12:07.114 --> 00:12:08.280 align:middle line:10%
of the New Thought movement.

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:10.446 align:middle line:84%
He would quote people from
the New Thought movement,

00:12:10.446 --> 00:12:12.810 align:middle line:84%
including Elbert Hubbard,
who was sort of a New Thought

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:14.860 align:middle line:90%
hero in the early 20th century.

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:20.100 align:middle line:84%
And he would include bits
of New Thought aphorisms,

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:22.820 align:middle line:84%
and poetry, and
maxims always in his--

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:23.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To make it a--

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:24.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: --lectures
and articles.

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:25.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --cultural message.

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:25.530 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: That's right.

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:26.330 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.920 align:middle line:84%
He firmly believed,
as many of the figures

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:32.160 align:middle line:84%
did who we're talking
about, that you could marry

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.090 align:middle line:84%
social progress to
the inner search,

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:37.650 align:middle line:84%
and that, in fact, the
two had to be married.

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:40.695 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then, the
beginning of the understanding

00:12:40.695 --> 00:12:42.180 align:middle line:90%
of-- or the introduction of--

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:45.150 align:middle line:84%
Islam back to the
African-American population

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:46.240 align:middle line:90%
with Noble Drew Ali.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.740 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Noble Drew Ali-- a
form of Islam-- a form, yeah.

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:49.823 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A form of Islam.

00:12:49.823 --> 00:12:53.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Noble Drew Ali was
sort of an independent, almost

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.440 align:middle line:90%
renegade Freemasonic figure.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.195 align:middle line:84%
He didn't belong to
any traditional lodge

00:12:57.195 --> 00:12:58.770 align:middle line:90%
or organization.

00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:03.330 align:middle line:10%
But he adapted kind of the
chivalry, and the aesthetic,

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:07.500 align:middle line:10%
and the images of Freemasonry,
and, as you were alluding,

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.650 align:middle line:10%
aspects of Islam
such as the fez,

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:15.840 align:middle line:10%
and other cultural stylings,
and aesthetics that the public

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.490 align:middle line:10%
associated with Islam.

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And he preached an
independent faith which

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:23.190 align:middle line:90%
he called Moorish Science--

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:24.690 align:middle line:90%
Moorish Science.

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:27.540 align:middle line:10%
And Moorish Science
was basically

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:32.220 align:middle line:10%
a New Thought occult
faith that used aspects

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:34.530 align:middle line:10%
of religious universality.

00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:38.940 align:middle line:84%
He taught that all
religions were equal.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.626 align:middle line:84%
All religions, as
Madame Blavatsky--

00:13:40.626 --> 00:13:42.042 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Madame
Blavatsky, right.

00:13:42.042 --> 00:13:45.000 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: --taught, all came
from this primeval theology

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.430 align:middle line:10%
that modern people
had forgotten about,

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:49.830 align:middle line:10%
and that if you
study any religion,

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:53.790 align:middle line:10%
and you understand how
to decode that religion,

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:56.670 align:middle line:10%
you'll come in contact with
this primeval theology.

00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:01.410 align:middle line:10%
Now, Noble Drew Ali had
a supposedly secret book

00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:03.780 align:middle line:10%
that he would sell or give
to his followers, which was

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:05.900 align:middle line:10%
called the "Circle 7 Koran"--

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:07.740 align:middle line:10%
the "Circle 7 Koran."

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:11.790 align:middle line:84%
What the "Circle 7
Koran" was, in actuality,

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:16.920 align:middle line:84%
was kind of a rearticulation
of a book called "The Aquarian

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.440 align:middle line:84%
Gospel of Jesus
the Christ," which

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:22.470 align:middle line:84%
was written by a man
named Levi Dowling in Los

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:24.420 align:middle line:84%
Angeles in the early
20th century, who

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:27.000 align:middle line:84%
said that he had
basically channeled

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.280 align:middle line:90%
a new gospel of Christ.

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.560 align:middle line:10%
And the essential
message of that book,

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:34.950 align:middle line:10%
which is at the heart of New Age
spirituality, is Universalism--

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:38.070 align:middle line:10%
Universalism, the idea
that all faiths converge.

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:40.170 align:middle line:84%
So that was what
was in the "Circle 7

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:42.900 align:middle line:84%
Koran," which, for many, many
years, was a secret book.

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.420 align:middle line:90%
But that was its message.

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And "The Aquarian Gospel
of Jesus the Christ"

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:50.550 align:middle line:84%
was the text that
it was based upon.

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:54.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And how did all this
somehow hark back to Akhenaten?

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:57.060 align:middle line:84%
There was a connection
between his work--

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:57.860 align:middle line:90%
or am I mistaken?

00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:59.317 align:middle line:90%
Did I read that incorrectly?

00:14:59.317 --> 00:15:00.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Harken back to what?

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:03.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Akhenaten, in
the Egyptian dynasties.

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:04.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh, right, yes.

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:07.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, these men, many
of them thought--

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.580 align:middle line:84%
and certainly, Noble
Drew Ali believed--

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:13.700 align:middle line:84%
that they were dealing
with retentions

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:16.520 align:middle line:84%
of authentic
Egyptian philosophy.

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.710 align:middle line:10%
And to some extent,
that was true in so far

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:21.890 align:middle line:10%
as you have Hermetic
ideas that came back

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:25.100 align:middle line:10%
into Western circulation
during the Renaissance.

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:30.680 align:middle line:10%
Hermetic ideas were a marriage
of Greek oral tradition and--

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.420 align:middle line:10%
I'm sorry, Egyptian
oral tradition--

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:35.390 align:middle line:10%
and Greek literary
writing tradition.

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And they did retain some
ancient Egyptian oral tradition.

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:42.380 align:middle line:84%
They did inform the
occult flowering that went

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:44.180 align:middle line:84%
on in Europe during
the Renaissance,

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:45.770 align:middle line:90%
that travelled to America.

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:49.245 align:middle line:84%
So ideas that you'll
find within New Thought,

00:15:49.245 --> 00:15:53.060 align:middle line:84%
within texts like "The Aquarian
Gospel," within certain aspects

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:55.970 align:middle line:84%
of Freemasonic
thought, these things

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:59.360 align:middle line:84%
are echoes of Hermeticism,
which are echoes

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.100 align:middle line:90%
of ancient Egyptian philosophy.

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:06.170 align:middle line:10%
So I've often said that there
is a very tender thread that's

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:10.940 align:middle line:10%
frayed and broken at some points
that, nonetheless, attaches

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:14.570 align:middle line:10%
the contemporary mystical
alternative spiritual culture

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:16.160 align:middle line:10%
to ancient Egypt.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.300 align:middle line:90%
It's not fantasy.

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:19.260 align:middle line:90%
It's a very thin thread.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:20.060 align:middle line:90%
It's been frayed.

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.080 align:middle line:90%
It's been interrupted.

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.074 align:middle line:90%
But it is there.

00:16:22.074 --> 00:16:23.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that brings
us to Manly P. Hall.

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:24.260 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:24.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Finally, we start.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:25.430 align:middle line:90%
Because--

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:26.638 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: One of my heroes.

00:16:26.638 --> 00:16:27.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, I know.

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:32.020 align:middle line:84%
And again, also had
deep Hermetic knowledge.

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:32.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:36.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
Hermeticists, even of today,

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:40.980 align:middle line:84%
essentially date back--
the knowledge strands

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:45.090 align:middle line:84%
date back to the 18th dynasty of
Egypt, but also prior to that.

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And once you go
deeper into it, it all

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:51.960 align:middle line:84%
dates back to Atlantis and
the cosmology before Atlantis.

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And Manly P. Hall
was a student of all

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:56.790 align:middle line:90%
of this, and a great mind.

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:57.590 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And it really comprises
this primeval theology--

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:01.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:02.888 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: --that
Madame Blavatsky

00:17:02.888 --> 00:17:06.000 align:middle line:84%
said ran through our lives
like an underground river.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.970 align:middle line:10%
And all of our religious
ideas, our esoteric ideas,

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:12.660 align:middle line:10%
our spiritual techniques can
ultimately be traced back

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:14.550 align:middle line:10%
to this primeval theology.

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:16.530 align:middle line:10%
And that was certainly
Manly Hall's belief.

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And he enshrined this
principle in a book

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.109 align:middle line:84%
that he published at
just the age of 27

00:17:25.109 --> 00:17:28.480 align:middle line:84%
in the year 1928 called "The
Secret Teachings of All Ages."

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:29.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's a beautiful book.

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:31.170 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: It's one of the
seminal books of my life--

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:31.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely--

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:31.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: --one of the--

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:32.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: --seminal
books of my life.

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:37.650 align:middle line:84%
It's almost impossible
to summarize

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:39.860 align:middle line:84%
the extraordinary
nature of this book--

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:40.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:41.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: --and
the circumstances--

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:42.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's so alive.

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:43.830 align:middle line:90%
It's so richly-illustrated.

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:44.640 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:45.931 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: It's extraordinary.

00:17:45.931 --> 00:17:46.980 align:middle line:90%
It's so vast.

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:48.670 align:middle line:90%
It's so epic.

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:52.305 align:middle line:10%
It's so varied and
diverse in its ideas,

00:17:52.305 --> 00:17:54.390 align:middle line:10%
you know, ranging
from the mystery

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:58.400 align:middle line:10%
symbols of ancient Egypt,
to Pythagorean mathematics,

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.176 align:middle line:10%
to the myths that
the Native Americans.

00:18:00.176 --> 00:18:01.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Kind of
classically Hermetic.

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:05.730 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Classically
Hermetic and vast in its scale.

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:08.200 align:middle line:84%
To call it a landscape
doesn't do it justice.

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.870 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like a sun,
you know, around which--

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:12.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He was on a mission.

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:13.661 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: --so
much is circulating.

00:18:13.661 --> 00:18:15.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He was going
to save the ancient--

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:16.110 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: That's right.

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:17.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --esoteric teachings.

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:18.291 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: That's right.

00:18:18.291 --> 00:18:21.000 align:middle line:10%
And what an unlikely
birth he had

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.880 align:middle line:10%
for somebody who became
the savior of esotericism

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.080 align:middle line:10%
in a certain sense.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:29.100 align:middle line:10%
He was born in rural
Canada in 1901,

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:30.660 align:middle line:10%
had no particular schooling.

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.660 align:middle line:84%
His parents divorced
just before he was born.

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:35.160 align:middle line:84%
His mother was an
interesting woman.

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:39.270 align:middle line:84%
She was a chiropractor, an
early female chiropractor.

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:40.860 align:middle line:90%
She played violin.

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And I have an early
picture of her.

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:44.730 align:middle line:84%
She's wearing a
wristwatch, you know, much

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:47.280 align:middle line:84%
like the contemporary
wristwatches we wear today,

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:48.879 align:middle line:84%
in this kind of
late-Victorian dress.

00:18:48.879 --> 00:18:49.920 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't something--

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:50.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:50.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: --you saw among--

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:51.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You don't
see that, yeah.

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:51.610 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: --many women.

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:51.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:53.310 align:middle line:90%
She was an interesting figure.

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:56.700 align:middle line:84%
But since Manly's
parents divorced,

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:58.410 align:middle line:84%
he was actually
taken into the care

00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:01.290 align:middle line:84%
of one of his grandmothers,
who raised him

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:03.750 align:middle line:84%
in Canada and in
the American West.

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:05.940 align:middle line:84%
He had very little
conventional schooling.

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:08.430 align:middle line:84%
They sort of bopped around
in the American West

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:10.050 align:middle line:90%
where they had relatives.

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And finally, when
Manley was 15 years old,

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:16.110 align:middle line:84%
she sent him to New
York City to be enrolled

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:18.210 align:middle line:84%
in a military academy,
feeling that he

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:20.460 align:middle line:90%
needed some formal education.

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:22.950 align:middle line:84%
And from that point on, he
was pretty much on his own.

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:25.500 align:middle line:84%
He left the military academy
after a couple of years,

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:30.030 align:middle line:84%
and he got a job as a clerk
at a Wall Street banking firm.

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And still a very
self-educated young man.

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:34.800 align:middle line:84%
But it was just at
the time when some

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:38.050 align:middle line:84%
of the great public libraries
were opening to public use,

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:39.990 align:middle line:84%
including the New
York Public Library.

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And he would read over
volume after volume

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:46.930 align:middle line:84%
of esoteric literature as it
was available at that time.

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And he had a spark of
brilliance about him,

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:54.360 align:middle line:84%
a self-educated
capacity, probably

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:58.080 align:middle line:84%
something that we might
call a photographic memory.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:02.040 align:middle line:84%
He had this gift for retaining,
and proportionalizing,

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:05.160 align:middle line:84%
and cataloging huge
amounts of information.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And in the 1920s, as
he entered his 20s,

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:12.750 align:middle line:84%
he grew fearful that
the age of banking,

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:15.150 align:middle line:84%
and jazz, and rum-running
was going to spell

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:17.156 align:middle line:90%
the end of the esoteric wisdom.

00:20:17.156 --> 00:20:18.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He did not
believe that greed

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:20.730 align:middle line:84%
had a place in the
development of life.

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:21.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: That's right.

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:22.140 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:24.750 align:middle line:84%
And he also looked upon
academia with despair,

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:29.220 align:middle line:84%
because he saw that the study of
primeval religions in academia

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:32.460 align:middle line:84%
often treated these religions
as just ancient systems

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:34.950 align:middle line:84%
of superstition that
could hold nothing

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:38.010 align:middle line:84%
for the contemporary person,
for the serious person

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:39.580 align:middle line:90%
in the 1920s.

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:41.430 align:middle line:84%
So he made it his
mission that he

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:45.840 align:middle line:84%
was going to catalog and save
all this esoteric wisdom,

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:49.050 align:middle line:84%
from the mystery schools
of ancient Greece,

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:52.140 align:middle line:84%
to the meanings of
the Egyptian pyramids,

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:55.890 align:middle line:84%
to the doctrines of
the Rosicrucians,

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:58.860 align:middle line:84%
the Freemasons, the
Illuminati, the hidden meaning

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:02.880 align:middle line:84%
of the tarot, the esotericism
of the Shakespearean dramas.

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:04.620 align:middle line:84%
There's almost no
subject that you

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:07.950 align:middle line:84%
can mention that doesn't find a
place in "The Secret Teachings

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:08.880 align:middle line:90%
of all Ages."

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:12.870 align:middle line:84%
And he began his mission sitting
at one of the huge oak tables

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:14.610 align:middle line:90%
in the New York Public Library.

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And he would walk
in every day and ask

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:19.200 align:middle line:84%
for books that were
always available,

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.720 align:middle line:84%
because nobody else was
asking to look for them.

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And he began to attract
some benefactors.

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:26.040 align:middle line:90%
He started to travel.

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:28.080 align:middle line:10%
He got money from
various benefactors

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:33.030 align:middle line:10%
to travel to India, to Japan,
back to the West coast.

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:35.070 align:middle line:10%
There was some self-styled
Rosicrucian groups

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:36.300 align:middle line:10%
that he fell into.

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:38.630 align:middle line:10%
He later questioned
their authenticity.

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:40.180 align:middle line:90%
He questioned their antiquity.

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And he kind of moved
away from them.

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:46.000 align:middle line:10%
And he began to develop
this idea for what

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.640 align:middle line:10%
he called the great
book, which we now

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.770 align:middle line:10%
call "The Secret
Teachings of all Ages."

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:52.580 align:middle line:90%
He published this vast book--

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:56.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, its dimensions are
the size of a small table--

00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:58.600 align:middle line:90%
when he was age 27--

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:00.460 align:middle line:90%
27.

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:02.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The dedication
and pure obsession

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:03.852 align:middle line:90%
it took to do that by that age.

00:22:03.852 --> 00:22:04.651 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yeah.

00:22:04.651 --> 00:22:06.250 align:middle line:84%
If you were to
look at that book,

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:09.760 align:middle line:84%
you would say it would be the
product of a worthy lifetime

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.080 align:middle line:90%
or several worthy lifetimes.

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:12.038 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, exactly.

00:22:12.038 --> 00:22:13.540 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: 27 years old.

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And I tell you, I republished
an edition of that book

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:19.060 align:middle line:84%
called the reader's
edition in 2003,

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:22.190 align:middle line:84%
which is an unabridged
resetting of the text

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:26.520 align:middle line:84%
so you can read it as one
simple, standard-sized book.

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:30.010 align:middle line:84%
It stands up with just
extraordinary power.

00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:33.580 align:middle line:84%
To call the work prodigious
is an understatement.

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:35.770 align:middle line:84%
There was something beyond
the ordinary about this.

00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:38.260 align:middle line:84%
There was simply something
beyond the ordinary.

00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:42.820 align:middle line:84%
At the age of 27, to
encapsulated this much wisdom--

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:45.220 align:middle line:90%
and I speak only of the text.

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:47.320 align:middle line:10%
I mean, the illustrations
and the charts--

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:50.230 align:middle line:10%
and you know, you open
the original book up,

00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:51.981 align:middle line:10%
it looks like a page
of Babylonian Talmud.

00:22:51.981 --> 00:22:52.780 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: It does.

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:54.490 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: There's
so much happening.

00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:58.210 align:middle line:10%
And that he accomplished
this at the age of 27

00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:00.910 align:middle line:10%
with resources
that were available

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:03.790 align:middle line:10%
not only in a pre-digital
era, but in an era

00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:05.230 align:middle line:10%
where libraries
were limited-- you

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:07.750 align:middle line:10%
couldn't just walk into
Columbia University

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:09.160 align:middle line:10%
and ask for this or that.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.560 align:middle line:84%
You know, it was very
difficult to lay your hands

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.260 align:middle line:84%
on some of these things, or
some of these translations.

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:16.120 align:middle line:90%
He was extraordinary, he was.

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:19.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he had a great
admiration for Francis Bacon.

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:20.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:22.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And like Bacon--

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:24.870 align:middle line:84%
as with Bacon, he also
believed Shakespeare--

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:26.020 align:middle line:90%
that Bacon was the--

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:27.061 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: That's right.

00:23:27.061 --> 00:23:29.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --author of the
works of "Shakespeare."

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:30.820 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Right.

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:34.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He also-- let's
get into the popular portion

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:35.050 align:middle line:90%
of his life.

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:37.300 align:middle line:84%
He was also a
friend of Burl Ives.

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:38.950 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
that a little bit.

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:39.730 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Well,
it was interesting.

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:42.160 align:middle line:84%
You know, Hall lived most
of his life in Los Angeles.

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:47.980 align:middle line:10%
Although it's funny, he didn't
hobnob with many celebrities.

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:50.290 align:middle line:10%
I mean, god love Burl
Ives, but you know,

00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:53.400 align:middle line:10%
it wasn't like you were
hanging around with Cary Grant,

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:54.200 align:middle line:10%
you know?

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was-- he had a
modest circle of friends.

00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:58.870 align:middle line:90%
His friends included Burl Ives.

00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:02.710 align:middle line:84%
They included Bela Lugosi,
who was a great fan of opera.

00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:04.420 align:middle line:84%
They would listen
to opera together.

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:07.690 align:middle line:84%
He only got involved
very tangentially

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:09.190 align:middle line:90%
with the movie business.

00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:12.750 align:middle line:84%
He didn't tend to
glom onto celebrities.

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:14.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But weren't
they Freemasons too?

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:16.570 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh yes,
yes, they were indeed.

00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:18.906 align:middle line:84%
And Manly became a
Freemason in the 1950s.

00:24:18.906 --> 00:24:21.639 align:middle line:84%
Now, he wrote about Masonry
when he was younger.

00:24:21.639 --> 00:24:23.680 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people thought
Manly was a Freemason

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:27.220 align:middle line:84%
all his life, or the Freemasons
had funded him, or some such.

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:31.870 align:middle line:84%
You know, Manly was not a
Freemason until the 1950s,

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:34.060 align:middle line:84%
until he was well
into middle age.

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:34.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a--

00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:36.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What is it
that-- go ahead, sorry.

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:36.850 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: I'm not a Freemason.

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:38.860 align:middle line:84%
You know, I talk about
Masonry a great deal.

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And people sometimes
think I'm a Freemason.

00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:42.370 align:middle line:90%
I go to Freemasonic events.

00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:45.207 align:middle line:84%
I have no aversion whatsoever
to joining Freemasonry,

00:24:45.207 --> 00:24:47.290 align:middle line:84%
but I've always been a
kind of independent person.

00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:48.580 align:middle line:90%
So I'm not a Freemason myself.

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:50.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, but what
drove him that direction?

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:51.550 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh, he
had friendships.

00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And he came to feel that within
Masonic rites and rituals,

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:58.020 align:middle line:84%
there existed a retention
of certain, at least,

00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:02.340 align:middle line:84%
remnants and threads of
ancient Hebraic rituals

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:05.360 align:middle line:84%
and initiatory customs,
mystery school customs.

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:08.400 align:middle line:84%
So he came to feel it was a
furtherance of his education.

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know,
and the thing about him

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:13.420 align:middle line:84%
is, like with a lot
of these characters,

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:15.680 align:middle line:84%
there is a certain
type of naivete to him.

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:16.480 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:17.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He was
steeped in the thing

00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:18.850 align:middle line:90%
that he was passionate for.

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:19.891 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: That's right.

00:25:19.891 --> 00:25:21.472 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
ultimately, he got--

00:25:21.472 --> 00:25:22.930 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about
his private life--

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:24.199 align:middle line:90%
taken in by shadowy forces.

00:25:24.199 --> 00:25:25.240 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: That's right.

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:26.700 align:middle line:90%
That is such a wonderful point.

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:29.740 align:middle line:84%
And the word you chose, that
there was this naivete, that

00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:31.210 align:middle line:90%
is the perfect word.

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:33.160 align:middle line:84%
Because Manly was
really a scholar.

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:39.130 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't tend to
glom onto powerful people.

00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:42.040 align:middle line:10%
He didn't hobnob with
very many celebrities

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:45.036 align:middle line:10%
or get involved with
the movie business,

00:25:45.036 --> 00:25:46.660 align:middle line:10%
even though it was
there all around him

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:49.510 align:middle line:10%
in Hollywood, where his
headquarters, the Philosophical

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:53.440 align:middle line:10%
Research Society, still stands
today in the Griffith Park

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:54.550 align:middle line:10%
neighborhood.

00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:58.390 align:middle line:84%
He was read by Elvis Presley,
who was a big fan of his.

00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:01.030 align:middle line:84%
He could have had all
kinds of friendships.

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And you would imagine
today, in the 21st century--

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:05.106 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You'd exploit
them all on Instagram.

00:26:05.106 --> 00:26:06.070 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Precisely.

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:06.940 align:middle line:90%
Precisely.

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:09.290 align:middle line:84%
But Manly was cut from
a different cloth.

00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:10.330 align:middle line:10%
It was a good cloth.

00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:14.200 align:middle line:10%
And it was a cloth of
character and decency.

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.850 align:middle line:90%
And there was a naivete.

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:19.330 align:middle line:84%
And towards the end of his
life in the late 1980s,

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:22.300 align:middle line:84%
he was taken advantage of
by a couple of characters

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:26.350 align:middle line:84%
who told him that they
could broadcast and sell

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:29.080 align:middle line:84%
his material all over
the world, and put it out

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.960 align:middle line:84%
through satellite television,
and so forth and so on.

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.640 align:middle line:84%
And manly, toward
the end of his life,

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:37.900 align:middle line:84%
was worried about whether his
legacy would be preserved.

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And he signed his will,
and his belongings,

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:43.450 align:middle line:84%
and his collection
of antiquities

00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:44.680 align:middle line:90%
over to these figures.

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:48.689 align:middle line:84%
And it resulted in a mass of
legal battles after his death.

00:26:48.689 --> 00:26:50.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, he signed it
six days before his death.

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:52.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Six days
before his death.

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:53.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He signed it over.

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:55.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: And there
was some suspicion

00:26:55.150 --> 00:26:56.620 align:middle line:90%
that his death was a homicide.

00:26:56.620 --> 00:27:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And it was, in fact, being
investigated as a homicide

00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:01.960 align:middle line:90%
by the LAPD.

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, that file has
since been closed.

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:07.720 align:middle line:84%
But for several years,
his death was open,

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:09.790 align:middle line:84%
and it was under
investigation, and there were

00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:12.160 align:middle line:90%
some suspicious circumstances.

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:16.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, I do not ultimately
believe that Manly was murdered.

00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:18.340 align:middle line:84%
But there's no
question that he was--

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:18.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He was hoodwinked.

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:19.834 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: --taken
advantage of.

00:27:19.834 --> 00:27:21.790 align:middle line:84%
He was hoodwinked
at the very least.

00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And the signing
over of his will--

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:24.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:26.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: --to one of these
con artists six days before his

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:27.520 align:middle line:90%
death, it doesn't pass--

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:30.920 align:middle line:84%
as one judge put it, it doesn't
pass any reasonable person's

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:31.720 align:middle line:90%
sniff test.

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:34.640 align:middle line:84%
He was taken advantage
of, and he was defrauded.

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.580 align:middle line:84%
And there were
lawsuits that went

00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:41.080 align:middle line:84%
on between his family, and these
guys, and the Philosophical

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:43.170 align:middle line:84%
Research Society
after his death.

00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:45.430 align:middle line:84%
It just gutted the
place financially.

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:47.920 align:middle line:84%
There were millions of
dollars in legal bills.

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:53.920 align:middle line:84%
Part of Manly's collection of
esoteric books, objects, stamps

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:56.530 align:middle line:84%
had to be sold off to the
Getty Museum in Los Angeles

00:27:56.530 --> 00:27:58.000 align:middle line:90%
to pay legal bills.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.570 align:middle line:90%
It was just an absolute shame.

00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:02.590 align:middle line:84%
But the irony is--
the irony is this--

00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:04.510 align:middle line:84%
Manly was worried, toward
the end of his life,

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:06.820 align:middle line:90%
that his legacy would be lost.

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:09.070 align:middle line:84%
I've republished this edition
of "The Secret Teachings

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:11.650 align:middle line:90%
of All Ages" in 2003.

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:16.087 align:middle line:84%
At this point, gosh, I mean,
it's sold over 100,000 copies.

00:28:16.087 --> 00:28:18.670 align:middle line:84%
There's more people reading "The
Secret Teachings of All Ages"

00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:20.400 align:middle line:84%
today than during
Manly's lifetime.

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:23.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are you going to
do that coffee table version?

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:23.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Well,
that's still being done.

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:24.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, not the book--

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:25.510 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: My friends at PRS--

00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:26.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --the coffee table.

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:27.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: --with
whom I work frequently,

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:29.360 align:middle line:90%
are still doing that edition.

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:31.190 align:middle line:84%
So you can get that
coffee table addition.

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:33.080 align:middle line:84%
You can get the
reader's edition.

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:35.100 align:middle line:10%
There's other of
Manly's books out there.

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:38.500 align:middle line:10%
The fact is his readership
is broader today than it

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:39.866 align:middle line:10%
was during his lifetime.

00:28:39.866 --> 00:28:41.740 align:middle line:84%
And, as I've written
about in "The Washington

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:45.610 align:middle line:84%
Post" and elsewhere, he had
one very influential fan,

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:49.390 align:middle line:84%
an actor named Ronald Reagan,
who went on to big things.

00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:52.720 align:middle line:84%
I found that in
Reagan's speeches,

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:55.300 align:middle line:84%
starting in the 1950s up
through the first term

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:59.110 align:middle line:84%
of his presidency, he was
quoting from and using stories

00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:02.470 align:middle line:84%
from a book that
Manley wrote in 1944

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:05.705 align:middle line:84%
called "The Secret
Destiny of America."

00:29:05.705 --> 00:29:10.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, can you imagine Reagan, as
an actor who is transitioning

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:13.420 align:middle line:84%
to a political career, finds
this book, which was not

00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:17.740 align:middle line:84%
a book that was easy
to find in the 1940s,

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:21.100 align:middle line:84%
is so taken with it that
he starts to quote from it

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:22.900 align:middle line:84%
and adopt phrasing
and ideas from it

00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:24.205 align:middle line:90%
in his speeches in the 1950s?

00:29:24.205 --> 00:29:25.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It became
part of his ideology.

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:27.400 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Became
part of his ideology.

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:30.100 align:middle line:10%
And it was the same ideology
that Madame Blavatsky

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:32.650 align:middle line:10%
said motivated her to
come to America, which

00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:36.010 align:middle line:10%
was this notion that
America was, so to speak,

00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:39.970 align:middle line:10%
a holy grail among nations
that had some sort of a mission

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:45.400 align:middle line:10%
to fulfill an ancient experiment
in self-governance and

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:47.920 align:middle line:10%
religious liberty
that Manly felt

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:52.810 align:middle line:10%
was launched, in its earliest
beginnings, in primeval Egypt.

00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And Madame Blavatsky
was sent to America

00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:57.100 align:middle line:84%
because she said she
was on this mission

00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:00.220 align:middle line:84%
to sort of fulfill
America's "secret destiny,"

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:01.330 align:middle line:90%
as Manly put it.

00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And you can find
some of the phrasing

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.744 align:middle line:84%
that Manly used in
Reagan's own speeches.

00:30:06.744 --> 00:30:08.660 align:middle line:84%
I wrote about it in my
book "One Simple Idea."

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:11.350 align:middle line:84%
I write about it in "Salon,"
"The Washington Post."

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:12.850 align:middle line:90%
The phrasing is there.

00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:14.955 align:middle line:84%
You just need to
know to look for it.

00:30:14.955 --> 00:30:15.955 align:middle line:90%
You need to understand--

00:30:15.955 --> 00:30:16.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely
fascinating.

00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:17.551 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: --the way in.

00:30:17.551 --> 00:30:19.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now,
anybody that wants

00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:20.590 align:middle line:84%
to pick up a copy
of the reader's

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:22.860 align:middle line:84%
edition of "The Secret
Teaching of All Times,"

00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:24.610 align:middle line:84%
you can get it through
Amazon or anywhere?

00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:25.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Amazon or
anywhere you buy books--

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:28.060 align:middle line:84%
"The Secret Teachings of
All Ages" reader's edition,

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:29.800 align:middle line:84%
I personally put
that book together.

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:31.390 align:middle line:10%
The text is unabridged.

00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:32.770 align:middle line:10%
The illustrations are abridged.

00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:35.500 align:middle line:10%
But I made a decision that
every illustration that

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:38.020 align:middle line:10%
was necessary to
the understanding

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:39.280 align:middle line:10%
and deciphering of the text--

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:39.670 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Is in there.

00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:40.010 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: --would be kept.

00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:42.490 align:middle line:84%
So it really is a very
complete experience.

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:43.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very good.

00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:45.741 align:middle line:84%
OK, now we're going to, in
a way, go back to Blavatsky.

00:30:45.741 --> 00:30:47.190 align:middle line:90%
She always figures large--

00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:48.565 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: She's
always with us.

00:30:48.565 --> 00:30:51.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She was everywhere,
you know-- and Truman Capote.

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:53.230 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Absolutely wild.

00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:56.470 align:middle line:10%
This is a story that, you know,
you literally cannot make these

00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:57.430 align:middle line:10%
things up.

00:30:57.430 --> 00:31:00.670 align:middle line:84%
It's so strange that the
lives of these figures

00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:03.470 align:middle line:84%
would converge,
sometimes posthumously,

00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:06.190 align:middle line:90%
that it's hard to believe.

00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:10.300 align:middle line:84%
After the assassination
of Bobby Kennedy,

00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:13.690 align:middle line:84%
Truman Capote was on Johnny
Carson's "Tonight Show"

00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:15.650 align:middle line:90%
in 1968.

00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And this was a few years
after Truman Capote had

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:22.510 align:middle line:84%
published his great work
of true crime nonfiction,

00:31:22.510 --> 00:31:23.350 align:middle line:90%
"In Cold Blood."

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:26.590 align:middle line:10%
And he was considered an
expert on criminology.

00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:28.220 align:middle line:10%
He was considered
an expert on crime.

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:31.840 align:middle line:84%
So he was often asked questions
about crime, and mass murders,

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:33.110 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:37.240 align:middle line:84%
So Truman Capote is on with
Johnny Carson in New York City

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.650 align:middle line:90%
on "The Tonight Show" in 1968.

00:31:39.650 --> 00:31:43.610 align:middle line:10%
And he puts out this
theory on the air,

00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:49.450 align:middle line:10%
completely self-generated, that
Madame Blavatsky's great occult

00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:52.320 align:middle line:10%
encyclopedia, "The
Secret Doctrine," which

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:56.270 align:middle line:10%
she had published shortly
before her death in 1888,

00:31:56.270 --> 00:32:01.190 align:middle line:10%
had within it a
manual for revolution,

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:06.410 align:middle line:10%
a manual for overthrowing
governments that involved

00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:11.870 align:middle line:10%
the assassination of key figures
in society to destabilize

00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:13.280 align:middle line:10%
the society.

00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And Capote put out the
theory that this manual

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:20.330 align:middle line:84%
for revolution,
this occult manual,

00:32:20.330 --> 00:32:26.710 align:middle line:84%
was being used by revolutionary
esoteric guerrillas who

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:27.510 align:middle line:90%
were trying to de--

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:28.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Is that the nature?

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:29.370 align:middle line:90%
Is there such a doctrine?

00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:30.160 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Nothing whatsoever.

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:31.326 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I never read that.

00:32:31.326 --> 00:32:33.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: You
can comb that book,

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:35.220 align:middle line:90%
which is not easy to read--

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:36.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:37.769 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: --from
beginning to end-- it's

00:32:37.769 --> 00:32:39.180 align:middle line:90%
two complete volumes.

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:41.940 align:middle line:84%
You will find nothing whatsoever
about political violence.

00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:44.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what was his
motivation for essentially

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:44.885 align:middle line:90%
making that up--

00:32:44.885 --> 00:32:45.400 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: I have--

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:46.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --out of whole cloth?

00:32:46.050 --> 00:32:48.770 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: I can only
imagine that Capote picked it

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:52.250 align:middle line:10%
up from rumors, things
that he had heard,

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:55.310 align:middle line:10%
something that he had picked
up, and just sheer imagination--

00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:57.500 align:middle line:10%
just sheer imagination.

00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:00.230 align:middle line:84%
So he makes the case-- and
this gets reported on in "Time"

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:01.760 align:middle line:90%
magazine of all places--

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:06.650 align:middle line:84%
that the assassinations of
Martin Luther King, Malcolm X,

00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:11.240 align:middle line:84%
and Bobby Kennedy were a leaf
taken from Madame Blavatsky's

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:14.570 align:middle line:84%
"Secret doctrine" as a
manual for revolution,

00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:17.750 align:middle line:84%
as a way to destabilize a
society by assassinating

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:18.930 align:middle line:90%
key figures.

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:22.190 align:middle line:10%
So the right-wing
John Birch Society

00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:25.100 align:middle line:10%
picks up on Truman
Capote's theory.

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:26.600 align:middle line:10%
And as I point out
in the book, this

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:30.590 align:middle line:10%
must be the one and only
time that this chic New York

00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:32.960 align:middle line:10%
writer had some
kind of common cause

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:34.850 align:middle line:10%
with the John Birch Society.

00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:37.250 align:middle line:84%
And they start taking out
advertisements in newspapers

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:39.560 align:middle line:84%
in California and
elsewhere saying

00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:42.350 align:middle line:84%
that America is
being destabilized

00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:44.690 align:middle line:84%
by this occult
Russian philosophy

00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:48.140 align:middle line:84%
promulgated by this occultist,
you know, who, at that point,

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:50.700 align:middle line:84%
had been dead for
almost a century.

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:53.150 align:middle line:84%
Madame Blavatsky never
stops being remade

00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:55.460 align:middle line:90%
in people's imaginations.

00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things that Capote

00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:59.964 align:middle line:84%
pointed to as evidence for his
theory was that Sirhan Sirhan--

00:33:59.964 --> 00:34:02.421 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, that's where
I was going to go next, yeah.

00:34:02.421 --> 00:34:04.790 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: --the assassin
of Bobby Kennedy, when

00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:08.730 align:middle line:84%
he was in jail, had requested
copies of her books,

00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:10.310 align:middle line:90%
including "The Secret Doctrine."

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:13.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, the fact is, Sirhan
Sirhan did request

00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:15.500 align:middle line:84%
certain philosophical
books, including

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:19.670 align:middle line:84%
books that were composed
of lectures that were

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:21.170 align:middle line:90%
given by a young Krishnamurti.

00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:21.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:34:21.970 --> 00:34:23.969 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: He was also
a member of the Order

00:34:23.969 --> 00:34:24.844 align:middle line:90%
of the Rosicrucians--

00:34:24.844 --> 00:34:25.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:27.905 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: --who later dropped
him from their membership rolls

00:34:27.905 --> 00:34:31.280 align:middle line:84%
because he didn't pay some
sort of a $2 book-borrowing fee

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:35.810 align:middle line:84%
before he turned to
a life of homicide.

00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:39.139 align:middle line:10%
The fact is, you can
take these puzzle pieces,

00:34:39.139 --> 00:34:40.730 align:middle line:10%
and you can throw
them onto the table

00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:42.600 align:middle line:10%
and say, look, I
think I see this.

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:43.790 align:middle line:10%
I think I see that.

00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:45.679 align:middle line:10%
And that's what
Capote was doing.

00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:46.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:47.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: There
was no such call

00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:49.764 align:middle line:84%
to political violence in
Blavatsky's work, none

00:34:49.764 --> 00:34:50.564 align:middle line:90%
whatsoever.

00:34:50.564 --> 00:34:52.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
I didn't think so.

00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:54.409 align:middle line:84%
And Sirhan Sirhan,
I mean, it just--

00:34:54.409 --> 00:34:57.840 align:middle line:84%
that still seems like such
a conflicted and sad story.

00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:02.000 align:middle line:84%
When you listen to the existing
interrogation of him that still

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.770 align:middle line:84%
exists, in his language,
and word, and demeanor,

00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:07.920 align:middle line:90%
something doesn't line up--

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:08.720 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yeah.

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:10.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --with the
person that supposedly

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:12.080 align:middle line:90%
became this assassin.

00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:12.880 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yeah.

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:13.340 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:14.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:17.900 align:middle line:84%
That was one of Capote's
pieces of evidence.

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:21.300 align:middle line:10%
He felt-- or you know, he sort
of imagined that Sirhan was one

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:22.100 align:middle line:10%
of--

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:22.940 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So he had
a bone to pick--

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:23.300 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: --Blavatsky's--

00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:24.620 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: --with this
occultist movement?

00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:25.440 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: --agents.

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:27.410 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and I think he thought
it made a good story to tell

00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:28.750 align:middle line:90%
late-night to Johnny Carson.

00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And it got picked up in
"Time" magazine and elsewhere.

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:32.359 align:middle line:90%
It was complete fantasy.

00:35:32.359 --> 00:35:34.400 align:middle line:84%
I go through the whole
thing in "Occult America."

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:38.480 align:middle line:84%
But it's amazing how every
generation sort of recreates

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:40.479 align:middle line:90%
Blavatsky in their own image.

00:35:40.479 --> 00:35:41.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:43.186 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Do they
see her as a threat?

00:35:43.186 --> 00:35:44.353 align:middle line:90%
Do they see her as a savior?

00:35:44.353 --> 00:35:46.227 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, mostly,
in more recent times,

00:35:46.227 --> 00:35:47.090 align:middle line:90%
she's more vilified.

00:35:47.090 --> 00:35:49.730 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: She's very
often vilified, even today.

00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:51.620 align:middle line:84%
My friend Gary
Lachman, the historian,

00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:53.870 align:middle line:84%
wrote a very good biography
of Madame Blavatsky.

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:57.410 align:middle line:84%
It was reviewed in "Harper's"
and the "Paris Review."

00:35:57.410 --> 00:36:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And "Harper's" wrote this
long, protracted review

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:03.080 align:middle line:84%
sort of attacking
Blavatsky's memory.

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And I thought to myself,
why, in the 21st century,

00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:09.040 align:middle line:84%
is this woman such
a source of vitriol?

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:09.840 align:middle line:90%
Why does she--

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:10.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:11.693 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: --such
a threat to people?

00:36:11.693 --> 00:36:13.880 align:middle line:84%
But every generation
sort of sees her

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:15.710 align:middle line:90%
as a kind of Rorschach.

00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:16.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very true.

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:19.706 align:middle line:84%
Now we'll move on to FDR
and Henry A. Wallace.

00:36:19.706 --> 00:36:20.506 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:36:20.506 --> 00:36:22.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I love the
story of Henry A. Wallace.

00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:25.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Henry Wallace
is a really lost chapter

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:29.240 align:middle line:84%
in occult history, even
though, again, the facts

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:31.400 align:middle line:84%
can present themselves
if one just peels back

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:33.030 align:middle line:90%
the onion a little bit.

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:38.820 align:middle line:84%
Wallace was a Republican who was
named secretary of agriculture

00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:40.230 align:middle line:90%
by FDR.

00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:45.300 align:middle line:10%
And after a period of time, he
became FDR's vice president.

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:48.150 align:middle line:10%
He was FDR's second
vice president.

00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And he was later replaced by
the man who history remembers,

00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:52.530 align:middle line:90%
Harry Truman.

00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:56.710 align:middle line:90%
And so Wallace was a Freemason.

00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:58.730 align:middle line:90%
FDR was as well.

00:36:58.730 --> 00:37:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And they both had a taste for
portentous, dramatic imagery.

00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:06.070 align:middle line:10%
And Henry Wallace, one
day, came across the fact

00:37:06.070 --> 00:37:10.340 align:middle line:10%
that the reverse of the
Great Seal of America,

00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:12.970 align:middle line:10%
which is the familiar eagle
holding the olive branches

00:37:12.970 --> 00:37:17.290 align:middle line:10%
and arrows and its claws, is the
alluring eye and pyramid that

00:37:17.290 --> 00:37:20.470 align:middle line:10%
appears on the back of
our dollar bill surrounded

00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:23.380 align:middle line:10%
by the Latin slogan
"Annuit Coeptis Novus Ordo

00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:26.320 align:middle line:10%
Seclorum," which,
roughly translated,

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:29.590 align:middle line:10%
means "God smiles on our
new order of the ages."

00:37:29.590 --> 00:37:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And he thought that
this image, in addition

00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:34.390 align:middle line:84%
to being alluring
and magical, was

00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:39.070 align:middle line:84%
sort of a call to return
America to its earliest ideals.

00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:41.860 align:middle line:84%
And Wallace felt it
could summon people

00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:45.250 align:middle line:84%
to a sense of higher morale
and purpose during the Great

00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:46.120 align:middle line:90%
Depression.

00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:50.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, people have these negative
or conspiratorial associations

00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:52.610 align:middle line:84%
with the phrase "new
order of the ages."

00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:54.670 align:middle line:10%
The Founding Fathers,
enshrining that

00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:57.130 align:middle line:10%
on the reverse of
our Great Seal,

00:37:57.130 --> 00:37:59.050 align:middle line:10%
were really identifying
the nation--

00:37:59.050 --> 00:38:00.190 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: More in
Francis Bacon's meaning--

00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:00.430 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:00.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --of it.

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:01.960 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Exactly.

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:04.420 align:middle line:84%
They saw America, they
saw the early republic

00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:06.190 align:middle line:84%
as a chain of
great civilizations

00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:10.510 align:middle line:84%
extending back to ancient Egypt,
ancient Greece, ancient Rome.

00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:13.260 align:middle line:10%
They saw America as a place
where the individual's

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:16.360 align:middle line:10%
spiritual search could
be protected, where

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:20.320 align:middle line:10%
the search for meaning
was considered sacred,

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:23.080 align:middle line:10%
and something that was legally
enshrined into our founding

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:24.130 align:middle line:10%
documents.

00:38:24.130 --> 00:38:27.430 align:middle line:84%
So Wallace thought, what we
need is a new deal of the ages.

00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:31.130 align:middle line:84%
We need to renew a sense of
connection to our most august

00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:31.930 align:middle line:90%
roots.

00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:35.920 align:middle line:84%
So he brings FDR the idea
of maybe minting a coin

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:38.080 align:middle line:84%
or somehow using this
eye and pyramid as part

00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:39.250 align:middle line:90%
of our currency.

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:41.170 align:middle line:84%
And FDR does him one
better and decides,

00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:42.670 align:middle line:84%
we're going to place
this, actually,

00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:44.200 align:middle line:90%
on the back of the dollar bill.

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:46.990 align:middle line:84%
This was only as
recently as 1935.

00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:48.730 align:middle line:84%
That's when this image
started to appear.

00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:49.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're talking about
the pyramid with the all-seeing

00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:50.095 align:middle line:90%
eye--

00:38:50.095 --> 00:38:50.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Yeah,
the all-seeing eye--

00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:51.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --capstone?

00:38:51.330 --> 00:38:53.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: --as well as
the more familiar eagle.

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:57.640 align:middle line:10%
And FDR-- you can actually
find these records

00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:00.850 align:middle line:10%
in the Department of
Treasury archives,

00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:03.270 align:middle line:10%
and they also are
searchable online.

00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:06.460 align:middle line:84%
FDR personally
supervised the placement

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:08.590 align:middle line:84%
of the eye and pyramid
and the American eagle

00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:10.210 align:middle line:90%
on the back of the dollar bill.

00:39:10.210 --> 00:39:12.730 align:middle line:10%
And he reversed
the original order

00:39:12.730 --> 00:39:16.330 align:middle line:10%
so that when you're reading,
as we do, from left to right,

00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:19.360 align:middle line:10%
you see first-- you encounter
first-- the eye and pyramid.

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:21.880 align:middle line:84%
And gave it the greater
position of primacy.

00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:23.560 align:middle line:84%
The two were
originally reversed,

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:25.120 align:middle line:90%
and he penciled in a change.

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:28.450 align:middle line:84%
Because he felt this image
had such portent and meaning

00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:29.590 align:middle line:90%
for the nation.

00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:32.310 align:middle line:84%
That's how the eye and pyramid
got on the back of our dollar

00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:33.110 align:middle line:90%
bill--

00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:37.990 align:middle line:84%
two Freemasons, Vice President
Henry Wallace and President

00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:39.550 align:middle line:90%
Franklin Roosevelt,

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:42.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well let's talk
about the end of his career.

00:39:42.850 --> 00:39:45.715 align:middle line:84%
Because FDR was always forced
in the position of kind

00:39:45.715 --> 00:39:50.980 align:middle line:84%
of explaining who Henry Wallace
was, what he was really about.

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
what happened to him.

00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:55.104 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Wallace was, for
a period of time, a disciple

00:39:55.104 --> 00:39:58.420 align:middle line:84%
to a Theosophist and artist
named Nicholas Roerich, who

00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:01.810 align:middle line:84%
was a brilliant man and also
a very controversial man, who

00:40:01.810 --> 00:40:04.480 align:middle line:84%
had all these
different machinations

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:06.490 align:middle line:84%
and plans going on
that, sometimes,

00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:09.160 align:middle line:84%
his own benefactors didn't
understand and didn't know

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:10.150 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:12.160 align:middle line:10%
And there was a period
of several years

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:16.450 align:middle line:10%
where Wallace had learned
things from him, exchanged sort

00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:18.820 align:middle line:10%
of adoring letters with him.

00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:22.750 align:middle line:84%
He gave Wallace his own
initiatory name of Galahad.

00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:24.850 align:middle line:84%
And they would-- and
he wrote these letters

00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:27.940 align:middle line:84%
to Nicholas Roerich
addressing him as "Dear Guru."

00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:31.000 align:middle line:84%
At the time, Americans didn't
know what the term "guru" was.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.545 align:middle line:84%
You know, it all
sounded very exotic.

00:40:32.545 --> 00:40:34.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You didn't want it
coming from your vice president

00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:34.600 align:middle line:90%
though.

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:35.400 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Right.

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:37.360 align:middle line:84%
And these letters were
eventually-- right.

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:39.610 align:middle line:84%
These letters were eventually
leaked to the press.

00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And they caused--
in the long run,

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:44.110 align:middle line:84%
they caused Wallace
tremendous embarrassment.

00:40:44.110 --> 00:40:49.270 align:middle line:84%
And he ran an independent
campaign for the presidency

00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:51.160 align:middle line:90%
in 1948.

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:52.810 align:middle line:84%
And it was thought
that Wallace could

00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:56.110 align:middle line:84%
become a really
significant third force

00:40:56.110 --> 00:40:57.310 align:middle line:90%
in American politics.

00:40:57.310 --> 00:40:59.680 align:middle line:84%
His party was called
the Progressive Party.

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:01.900 align:middle line:84%
But a variety of
things happened.

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:04.730 align:middle line:84%
The letters he wrote to Roerich,
which had been leaked earlier,

00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:05.530 align:middle line:90%
resurfaced.

00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And it was very
embarrassing to him.

00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, it ended
his political career.

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And he lived out the rest
of his life very quietly.

00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:17.830 align:middle line:84%
Died in the early 1960s
on a farm in Westchester

00:41:17.830 --> 00:41:19.274 align:middle line:90%
County in New York.

00:41:19.274 --> 00:41:21.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But FDR said--
and it was on record.

00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:22.610 align:middle line:90%
He said, he's a philosopher.

00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:23.470 align:middle line:90%
He's got ideas.

00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:24.330 align:middle line:90%
He thinks right.

00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:24.670 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: That's right.

00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:25.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He'll
help people think.

00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:26.410 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: That's right.

00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:26.830 align:middle line:90%
He said that--

00:41:26.830 --> 00:41:28.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
what's lacking,

00:41:28.330 --> 00:41:31.060 align:middle line:84%
and always has been lacking,
with maybe a couple exceptions,

00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:31.990 align:middle line:90%
in our leadership--

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:32.690 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: That's
right, and it's--

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:33.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --someone
who knows how to think.

00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:33.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: --perfectly put.

00:41:33.790 --> 00:41:34.590 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:37.840 align:middle line:10%
He said he-- he was told
by political advisors,

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:39.400 align:middle line:10%
you know, this guy's a mystic.

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:40.220 align:middle line:90%
He's weird.

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:41.020 align:middle line:90%
He's an occultist.

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:43.330 align:middle line:84%
He's a Theosophist-- and
he was a Theosophist--

00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:46.030 align:middle line:84%
you can't put him on
the presidential ticket.

00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And he said just that, he's
not a mystic, he's a thinker.

00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:50.590 align:middle line:90%
He's a digger.

00:41:50.590 --> 00:41:51.550 align:middle line:90%
He knows how to think.

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:53.560 align:middle line:90%
He'll help the people think.

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:58.030 align:middle line:10%
Can you imagine an executive
saying that today, he'll

00:41:58.030 --> 00:41:58.947 align:middle line:10%
help the people think?

00:41:58.947 --> 00:42:00.738 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, no, nope,
can't imagine that.

00:42:00.738 --> 00:42:02.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: So he was
a remarkable figure.

00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I use terms like
"occultist" with veneration.

00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:09.810 align:middle line:84%
I use terms like "New
Age" with veneration.

00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:11.700 align:middle line:84%
These are terms I
would apply to myself.

00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:14.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't use terms to
describe another person

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:19.720 align:middle line:84%
that I wouldn't be willing to be
called or labeled with myself.

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:21.870 align:middle line:84%
So when I say Henry
Wallace was an occultist,

00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:23.130 align:middle line:90%
that's an accurate statement.

00:42:23.130 --> 00:42:24.780 align:middle line:84%
He was deeply interested
in the esoteric.

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:26.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It simply means
the study of the hidden.

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:27.840 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: The
hidden, precisely.

00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:28.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's it.

00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:29.035 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: And he
was a Theosophist,

00:42:29.035 --> 00:42:30.810 align:middle line:84%
and he was interested
in astrology.

00:42:30.810 --> 00:42:33.350 align:middle line:84%
He was interested in
Tibetan Buddhism at a time

00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:35.340 align:middle line:84%
when most Americans
had not heard of it.

00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:38.250 align:middle line:84%
He was a great
political adventurer,

00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:39.720 align:middle line:90%
a great spiritual adventurer.

00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:41.730 align:middle line:84%
And he had difficulty--
you mentioned

00:42:41.730 --> 00:42:43.710 align:middle line:90%
Manly P. Hall being naive.

00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:45.480 align:middle line:84%
There was a streak
of that in Wallace.

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:47.850 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't understand
that other people would not

00:42:47.850 --> 00:42:51.201 align:middle line:84%
take his search as
seriously as he did.

00:42:51.201 --> 00:42:52.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, because
it was ultimately

00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:54.130 align:middle line:90%
for truth, higher truths.

00:42:54.130 --> 00:42:54.930 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:42:54.930 --> 00:42:56.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, I
know we were talking

00:42:56.430 --> 00:42:57.884 align:middle line:90%
about politics and occultism.

00:42:57.884 --> 00:42:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And you write about
Hitler in this book.

00:42:59.550 --> 00:43:00.350 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes

00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:02.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
say the fascination--

00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:04.560 align:middle line:84%
or in the conspiracy
community in particular--

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:07.530 align:middle line:84%
that Hitler was an
occultist, you say, mm-mm.

00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:09.120 align:middle line:10%
You don't believe
he was an occultist?

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:09.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: No, he wasn't.

00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:10.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:12.211 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: What he was
was an ultimate cynic who

00:43:12.211 --> 00:43:16.350 align:middle line:84%
was willing to adopt
symbols and insignias

00:43:16.350 --> 00:43:19.740 align:middle line:84%
from occult organizations
and occult tradition, use

00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:22.950 align:middle line:84%
them, and then discard the
people and the movements

00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:25.305 align:middle line:84%
behind them as brutally
and as quickly as possible.

00:43:25.305 --> 00:43:25.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Didn't you say--

00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:26.995 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in your
book, I think you

00:43:26.995 --> 00:43:30.010 align:middle line:84%
said the members of secret
lodges in his country

00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:30.810 align:middle line:90%
were murdered.

00:43:30.810 --> 00:43:31.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: They were murdered.

00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:31.970 align:middle line:90%
They were murdered.

00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:33.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He was not--

00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:34.592 align:middle line:84%
he did not support
occult activity.

00:43:34.592 --> 00:43:35.550 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Absolutely.

00:43:35.550 --> 00:43:36.750 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:43:36.750 --> 00:43:39.120 align:middle line:10%
There was a man named Karl
Ernst Krafft who was rumored

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:41.160 align:middle line:10%
to be Hitler's astrologer.

00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:42.960 align:middle line:10%
He died in a concentration camp.

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:44.760 align:middle line:84%
There was a man
Karl Germer who was

00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:47.670 align:middle line:84%
an associate of the occultist
Aleister Crowley's who

00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:51.450 align:middle line:84%
was also sent to a concentration
camp on charges of Freemasonry.

00:43:51.450 --> 00:43:54.570 align:middle line:84%
Freemasons,
astrologers, psychics,

00:43:54.570 --> 00:43:56.910 align:middle line:84%
mediums, they were
often rounded up

00:43:56.910 --> 00:44:00.630 align:middle line:84%
and murdered like any other
undesirables in Nazi Germany.

00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:02.700 align:middle line:84%
It's very important to
remember that history.

00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:03.180 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:05.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because they're trying
to tie fascism to occultism.

00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:06.440 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And the idea of any
countervailing philosophy

00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:15.390 align:middle line:84%
in Nazi Germany was considered
an act of subversion.

00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:20.670 align:middle line:84%
If you were practicing
astrology, or Buddhism,

00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:23.970 align:middle line:84%
or any kind of psychical
art, the very presence

00:44:23.970 --> 00:44:28.470 align:middle line:84%
of any kind of allegiance
outside of that to the fuhrer

00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:30.570 align:middle line:90%
was considered subversive.

00:44:30.570 --> 00:44:33.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm not making a comparison, but
the same thing is true in China

00:44:33.490 --> 00:44:34.290 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:37.350 align:middle line:84%
My book "One Simple Idea,"
which is a history and analysis

00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:40.500 align:middle line:84%
of New Thought, was published
in China and censored.

00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:43.620 align:middle line:84%
Because I wrote about
New Thought's popularity

00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:46.050 align:middle line:84%
among various political figures,
including Ronald Reagan,

00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:47.190 align:middle line:90%
including Henry Wallace.

00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:47.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:47.750 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:49.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: And the
Chinese government

00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:53.310 align:middle line:84%
likewise perceives
any counter philosophy

00:44:53.310 --> 00:44:55.830 align:middle line:84%
to what's promulgated
by its central party

00:44:55.830 --> 00:44:58.350 align:middle line:90%
as being potentially subversive.

00:44:58.350 --> 00:45:00.060 align:middle line:84%
In Nazi Germany,
of course, this was

00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:03.030 align:middle line:84%
taken to the ultimate and
most nightmarish degree.

00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:04.200 align:middle line:90%
Now, it is true--

00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:06.480 align:middle line:84%
it is true-- there were
some members of Hitler's

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:09.389 align:middle line:84%
inner circle, such as
Himmler and others,

00:45:09.389 --> 00:45:10.430 align:middle line:90%
who had occult interests.

00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:12.310 align:middle line:90%
That is a fact.

00:45:12.310 --> 00:45:15.780 align:middle line:84%
But Hitler himself had very
little patience for this.

00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:18.330 align:middle line:84%
He was interested in the
mythology of the Wagnerian

00:45:18.330 --> 00:45:19.260 align:middle line:90%
operas.

00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:21.630 align:middle line:84%
He would scold people
and push people away

00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:24.060 align:middle line:84%
if they tried to talk
about occult theory to him.

00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:26.039 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He was interested
in social agendas

00:45:26.039 --> 00:45:27.330 align:middle line:90%
and that sort of thing as well.

00:45:27.330 --> 00:45:28.130 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yeah.

00:45:28.130 --> 00:45:31.210 align:middle line:10%
He was all too willing to take
an image like the swastika,

00:45:31.210 --> 00:45:34.350 align:middle line:10%
was an ancient Vedic
symbol that the Nazis--

00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:36.720 align:middle line:10%
or the proto-Nazis--
probably first encountered

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:38.460 align:middle line:10%
in Blavatsky's
"Secret Doctrine,"

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:42.120 align:middle line:10%
use it as a unifying
symbol, as an electrifying,

00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:43.230 align:middle line:10%
magnetic symbol--

00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:46.830 align:middle line:10%
and it is magnetic, as many
such ancient symbols are--

00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:50.220 align:middle line:10%
and discard the people and
the organizations behind it--

00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:51.870 align:middle line:10%
not only discard
them, but murder them

00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:53.250 align:middle line:10%
if they were at hand.

00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:55.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So who was
his primary influence

00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:56.554 align:middle line:90%
to at least adopt some of that?

00:45:56.554 --> 00:45:58.470 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: You know,
there were early members

00:45:58.470 --> 00:46:01.530 align:middle line:10%
of the Nazi party, many of whom
were killed when the SA was

00:46:01.530 --> 00:46:05.029 align:middle line:10%
suppressed, who had interests
in occult philosophy,

00:46:05.029 --> 00:46:06.320 align:middle line:10%
as did many figures in Germany.

00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:07.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So he took the
power symbols, power--

00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:09.960 align:middle line:84%
little one-liners,
philosophy [INAUDIBLE],,

00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:12.069 align:middle line:84%
and then simply pasted
it over the movement.

00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:13.860 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: He would
cut them out, paste it

00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:16.950 align:middle line:84%
over the movement,
discard or kill

00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:20.340 align:middle line:84%
the figures, or organizations,
or publishing houses

00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:22.350 align:middle line:90%
from which those things came.

00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:26.490 align:middle line:84%
These were acts of ultimate
cynicism, not occultism,

00:46:26.490 --> 00:46:28.630 align:middle line:90%
as pertaining to Hitler.

00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:32.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, we have another
European, Rudolf Steiner, who

00:46:32.590 --> 00:46:33.857 align:middle line:90%
I have very great respect for.

00:46:33.857 --> 00:46:34.940 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh, of course.

00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:36.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he
enters into this story

00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:38.520 align:middle line:84%
and figures fairly
largely, even though he's

00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:40.186 align:middle line:84%
lesser-known than a
lot of these people.

00:46:40.186 --> 00:46:42.420 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about--
and I'm a fan.

00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:44.970 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, I sent my
son through the Waldorf school

00:46:44.970 --> 00:46:45.120 align:middle line:90%
system--

00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:45.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh, how wonderful.

00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:46.380 align:middle line:90%
How wonderful.

00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:47.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --his whole life.

00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:47.840 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:50.040 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Now, speaking
of occultism and Nazism,

00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:51.930 align:middle line:10%
Steiner is a perfect
example of somebody

00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:56.300 align:middle line:10%
with deep democratic impulses,
deep humanitarian impulses

00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:59.960 align:middle line:10%
who was steeped in occultism
during the period of time

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:02.210 align:middle line:10%
in which the Nazis
were making their rise.

00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:05.160 align:middle line:90%
He was hated by the early Nazis.

00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:08.450 align:middle line:84%
He was a scourge
to the early Nazis.

00:47:08.450 --> 00:47:10.160 align:middle line:84%
People have to
understand that Europe,

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:13.490 align:middle line:84%
in the early 20th
century, was a hothouse

00:47:13.490 --> 00:47:16.550 align:middle line:84%
of different political
and spiritual ideologies.

00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:21.620 align:middle line:84%
Democracy, fascism, socialism,
communism, occultism,

00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:24.530 align:middle line:84%
various forms of Eastern
and mystical spirituality,

00:47:24.530 --> 00:47:26.810 align:middle line:90%
these things all mixed together.

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:28.370 align:middle line:10%
And people of
different backgrounds

00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:31.880 align:middle line:10%
and political persuasions would
adopt or immerse themselves

00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:33.560 align:middle line:10%
in these things from
different angles--

00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:34.130 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Combined with--

00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:34.310 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: --in different ways.

00:47:34.310 --> 00:47:35.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --hard
times economically.

00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:36.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Combined with
hard times economically--

00:47:36.610 --> 00:47:36.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, which--

00:47:36.890 --> 00:47:37.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: --and various--

00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:37.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --does feed into this.

00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:39.860 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: --social
crises, absolutely.

00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:43.972 align:middle line:10%
There was no innate affinity
between fascism and the occult.

00:47:43.972 --> 00:47:46.430 align:middle line:10%
And I walk through that very
carefully in "Occult America."

00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:49.280 align:middle line:10%
Because that's an
idea that blinds us

00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:51.050 align:middle line:10%
to our own history
in a certain sense.

00:47:51.050 --> 00:47:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And Rudolph Steiner is
a perfect case in point.

00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:58.430 align:middle line:84%
Here was a mystic, a scholar,
an esoteric figure of the finest

00:47:58.430 --> 00:48:02.300 align:middle line:84%
quality, with deep democratic
and humanitarian impulses,

00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:05.000 align:middle line:84%
who was steeped in the occult,
and who the early Nazis

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.280 align:middle line:90%
hated and saw as a threat.

00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:11.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of Steiner's really
wonderful, wonderful legacies

00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:14.090 align:middle line:84%
in this country, in addition
to the Waldorf schools,

00:48:14.090 --> 00:48:17.150 align:middle line:84%
are Camphill Villages, which
are living-learning communities

00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:18.950 align:middle line:90%
for mentally-challenged adults.

00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:21.710 align:middle line:84%
One of these villages exists
in upstate New York near where

00:48:21.710 --> 00:48:23.510 align:middle line:90%
my family has a house.

00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:26.810 align:middle line:10%
Steiner was an
extraordinary educator

00:48:26.810 --> 00:48:30.320 align:middle line:10%
who understood how to
educate the whole person,

00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:34.800 align:middle line:10%
how to cultivate education
physically, mentally,

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:35.720 align:middle line:10%
emotionally.

00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:36.630 align:middle line:90%
He was one of the greatest--

00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:38.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everything--
Anthroposophical agriculture,

00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:39.493 align:middle line:90%
medicine, all of it.

00:48:39.493 --> 00:48:42.440 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: He foresaw
organic farming

00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:44.750 align:middle line:10%
through what he called
biodynamic farming.

00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:48.800 align:middle line:10%
He was one of the greatest
humanitarians and educators

00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:52.370 align:middle line:10%
of the 20th century, wholly
steeped in the occult.

00:48:52.370 --> 00:48:53.990 align:middle line:10%
And got his start,
as a young man,

00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:56.180 align:middle line:10%
in Madame Blavatsky's
Theosophical Society.

00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:57.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:48:57.230 --> 00:48:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And so at least that
continues on today

00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:01.940 align:middle line:84%
and grows as more schools
around the country,

00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:05.210 align:middle line:84%
and America in particular, are
now doing Waldorf-based charter

00:49:05.210 --> 00:49:07.640 align:middle line:84%
schools to start
taking these higher

00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:10.580 align:middle line:84%
thoughts into the public
school system, which

00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:14.330 align:middle line:84%
is really interesting to
see anything of these roots

00:49:14.330 --> 00:49:16.580 align:middle line:84%
we've talked about
actually making

00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:17.759 align:middle line:90%
its way into the mainstream.

00:49:17.759 --> 00:49:18.800 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: That's right.

00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:20.925 align:middle line:84%
You know, the Steiner
schools, the Waldorf schools,

00:49:20.925 --> 00:49:23.811 align:middle line:84%
are the most popular alternative
form of education in America.

00:49:23.811 --> 00:49:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And soon we're going
to stop calling

00:49:25.310 --> 00:49:27.680 align:middle line:84%
them alternative, because they
are making tremendous inroads.

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:28.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:30.270 align:middle line:84%
My nephew worked in one
of those adult communities

00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:31.070 align:middle line:90%
for two years.

00:49:31.070 --> 00:49:31.600 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: How remarkable.

00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:32.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All of our
kids in our family

00:49:32.750 --> 00:49:33.970 align:middle line:84%
were raised in the
Waldorf system.

00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:34.460 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: That's wonderful.

00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:36.169 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it was
just a magnificent--

00:49:36.169 --> 00:49:37.084 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Wonderful.

00:49:37.084 --> 00:49:38.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --experience.

00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:41.150 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I'm just kind of
giving thumbs up on that.

00:49:41.150 --> 00:49:45.470 align:middle line:84%
OK, now how do we get from
there to Aleister Crowley?

00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:46.460 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh, wow.

00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:48.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because then, we've
got to get to Edgar Cayce,

00:49:48.050 --> 00:49:49.430 align:middle line:90%
and we have 15 minutes.

00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:50.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yeah.

00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:52.130 align:middle line:10%
Well, look, you know,
Aleister Crowley

00:49:52.130 --> 00:49:53.360 align:middle line:10%
was an extraordinary figure.

00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:55.620 align:middle line:90%
He was a great artist.

00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:57.620 align:middle line:84%
I think, in many ways,
he was a great intellect.

00:49:57.620 --> 00:50:00.320 align:middle line:84%
In many ways, he was a truly
great explorer into the occult.

00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:02.330 align:middle line:90%
He operated without a map.

00:50:02.330 --> 00:50:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And he did many,
many things that

00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:06.830 align:middle line:90%
were intellectually intrepid.

00:50:06.830 --> 00:50:09.770 align:middle line:84%
I think he also was very
ethically-challenged.

00:50:09.770 --> 00:50:12.890 align:middle line:84%
He did not have a strong
internal ethical or moral

00:50:12.890 --> 00:50:13.850 align:middle line:90%
barometer.

00:50:13.850 --> 00:50:16.400 align:middle line:84%
A lot of his students, a
lot of people around him

00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:19.910 align:middle line:84%
got hurt, suffered his
abuse, were cast aside

00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:22.820 align:middle line:84%
when he no longer needed
them, either financially

00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:24.800 align:middle line:90%
or otherwise.

00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:28.820 align:middle line:84%
I think he was a figure
who, if I was alive,

00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:33.830 align:middle line:84%
I would not have sought
his company or to be

00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:34.910 align:middle line:90%
a pupil of his.

00:50:34.910 --> 00:50:36.710 align:middle line:84%
Because while I
respect him, I think

00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:40.352 align:middle line:84%
he was a person whose
ethics were poorly skewed.

00:50:40.352 --> 00:50:41.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
and he was directly

00:50:41.810 --> 00:50:44.760 align:middle line:84%
trying to marry magic
and sex, for example.

00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:45.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:47.780 align:middle line:10%
And look, you know,
there are many aspects

00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:51.024 align:middle line:10%
of chaos magic,
ceremonial magic, Thelema,

00:50:51.024 --> 00:50:52.190 align:middle line:10%
that I respect tremendously.

00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:55.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But we're talking
more darkly-intentioned.

00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:55.980 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:50:55.980 --> 00:50:56.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's the difference.

00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: The problem
with Crowley's philosophy

00:50:58.970 --> 00:51:04.370 align:middle line:84%
as I see it is that it
lent itself to narcissism.

00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:06.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying it was
steeped in narcissism,

00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:09.460 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not saying that
narcissism was implicit in it.

00:51:09.460 --> 00:51:14.210 align:middle line:84%
But he didn't provide the
ethical guardrails in his life,

00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:17.150 align:middle line:84%
in his works, or in the
lives of his students,

00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:19.730 align:middle line:84%
that would help
them not get sucked

00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:22.670 align:middle line:84%
into a kind of
magical narcissism.

00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:26.000 align:middle line:84%
I understand that when he
talked of the true self,

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:27.620 align:middle line:84%
he was speaking
of the true self,

00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:30.140 align:middle line:84%
perhaps, as Ralph
Waldo Emerson spoke

00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:35.120 align:middle line:84%
of it, as the human at his most
exquisite, at his most free.

00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:36.380 align:middle line:90%
I understand that.

00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:40.130 align:middle line:84%
But a figure like Ralph Waldo
Emerson, unlike Crowley, was

00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:42.740 align:middle line:90%
also steeped in gospel ethics.

00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:45.770 align:middle line:84%
New Thought is steeped
in gospel ethics.

00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:48.560 align:middle line:10%
And I often counsel people
that when you go down

00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:51.980 align:middle line:10%
the path of magic, you have
to have a great ethical work

00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:53.100 align:middle line:10%
at your back.

00:51:53.100 --> 00:51:55.440 align:middle line:10%
Whether it's the Gospels,
or the Bhagavad Gita,

00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:57.810 align:middle line:10%
or the Talmud, or
the Tao Te Ching,

00:51:57.810 --> 00:52:00.240 align:middle line:10%
you need something that's
going to ground you ethically.

00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:02.265 align:middle line:84%
Or you can just
float off to a place

00:52:02.265 --> 00:52:03.390 align:middle line:90%
where you don't want to be.

00:52:03.390 --> 00:52:04.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely,
you just hit it.

00:52:04.450 --> 00:52:06.866 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: And for me, that's
the flaw in Crowley's work.

00:52:06.866 --> 00:52:09.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Magic without ethics
is not servicing the planet

00:52:09.310 --> 00:52:10.110 align:middle line:90%
and humanity.

00:52:10.110 --> 00:52:12.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: It's a recipe
for great personal danger

00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:14.550 align:middle line:84%
and danger to other
people around you.

00:52:14.550 --> 00:52:16.301 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I
part ways with Crowley.

00:52:16.301 --> 00:52:17.966 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's so
many other people--

00:52:17.966 --> 00:52:20.410 align:middle line:84%
Baird Spalding, Annie
Besant, so many to go into.

00:52:20.410 --> 00:52:23.009 align:middle line:84%
But let's get to Edgar
Cayce, because he's--

00:52:23.009 --> 00:52:24.800 align:middle line:84%
well, because he's
Edgar Cayce, am I right?

00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:27.133 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Well, again, one
of my true personal heroes.

00:52:27.133 --> 00:52:31.150 align:middle line:10%
Edgar Cayce grew up as a devout
Christian in rural Kentucky

00:52:31.150 --> 00:52:34.540 align:middle line:10%
in the late 19th century
just after the Civil War.

00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:37.380 align:middle line:10%
And as a young man he--
like Andrew Jackson Davis,

00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:39.490 align:middle line:10%
who we discussed
earlier, he found

00:52:39.490 --> 00:52:41.230 align:middle line:10%
that he could go into
these trance states

00:52:41.230 --> 00:52:44.860 align:middle line:10%
and receive information about
how to diagnose and prescribe

00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:47.740 align:middle line:10%
cures for diseases, often
for people he had never

00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:51.160 align:middle line:10%
met who might live
or be asking him

00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:54.190 align:middle line:10%
for a reading from a distance
of many, many hundreds of miles

00:52:54.190 --> 00:52:55.030 align:middle line:10%
away.

00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And there are records of
Cayce giving thousands

00:52:57.820 --> 00:53:00.160 align:middle line:90%
of these medical readings.

00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And later, he expanded into past
life readings and other things.

00:53:03.850 --> 00:53:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And Cayce developed
a reputation,

00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:08.470 align:middle line:84%
in the first half
of the 20th century,

00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:11.350 align:middle line:84%
as this extraordinary
medical clairvoyant

00:53:11.350 --> 00:53:13.450 align:middle line:84%
who, from these
trance states, could

00:53:13.450 --> 00:53:16.900 align:middle line:84%
look into the lives,
the biology, the bodies,

00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:19.060 align:middle line:84%
the past recurrences
of people who

00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:21.910 align:middle line:84%
came to him for psychological
and physical help

00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:23.440 align:middle line:90%
and prescribe cures.

00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:25.840 align:middle line:84%
Cayce, in many ways,
was the polar opposite

00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:26.770 align:middle line:90%
of Aleister Crowley.

00:53:26.770 --> 00:53:30.160 align:middle line:84%
Because he was an occultist
who, in his personal life,

00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:32.240 align:middle line:84%
was deeply grounded
in scripture.

00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:35.330 align:middle line:10%
He read through the King
James Bible once a year

00:53:35.330 --> 00:53:37.480 align:middle line:10%
every year of his adult life.

00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:39.634 align:middle line:10%
And he struggled,
as a Christian,

00:53:39.634 --> 00:53:41.050 align:middle line:10%
with some of the
material that was

00:53:41.050 --> 00:53:42.490 align:middle line:10%
coming through his readings.

00:53:42.490 --> 00:53:47.020 align:middle line:84%
His readings talked about
astrology, numerology, karma,

00:53:47.020 --> 00:53:48.160 align:middle line:90%
reincarnation.

00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And he struggled, I
think with a great deal

00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:53.680 align:middle line:84%
of intellectual integrity, to
marry these things to scripture

00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:54.520 align:middle line:90%
and to the Gospels.

00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And I go through this
in "Occult America."

00:53:56.500 --> 00:54:01.180 align:middle line:84%
I think he made a really
heroic and integral effort

00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:04.210 align:middle line:84%
to take some of this
material and demonstrate

00:54:04.210 --> 00:54:06.040 align:middle line:84%
how it could jibe
with scripture,

00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:08.154 align:middle line:84%
because that was very
personally important to him.

00:54:08.154 --> 00:54:10.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet he was also,
like anybody else, a rather

00:54:10.570 --> 00:54:11.780 align:middle line:90%
conflicted human being.

00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:13.690 align:middle line:84%
He would say bigoted
things one minute,

00:54:13.690 --> 00:54:16.220 align:middle line:84%
do a pristine reading the
next, and then do this--

00:54:16.220 --> 00:54:17.020 align:middle line:90%
I don't have it.

00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:19.006 align:middle line:90%
It's on page 244 of your book.

00:54:19.006 --> 00:54:21.670 align:middle line:84%
There's a beautiful little
rendering on homosexuality,

00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:21.990 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:23.125 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Extraordinary.

00:54:23.125 --> 00:54:26.440 align:middle line:84%
He wrote, to a cousin
of his, in the 1930s,

00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:29.026 align:middle line:84%
such a sensitive, decent,
reassuring letter.

00:54:29.026 --> 00:54:30.400 align:middle line:84%
Because this man
was telling him,

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:33.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm a homosexual, and
using the language

00:54:33.370 --> 00:54:34.680 align:middle line:90%
that was used back then.

00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:36.790 align:middle line:10%
And here was Cayce, a
guy who had grown up

00:54:36.790 --> 00:54:40.030 align:middle line:10%
in the rural Bible Belt.
Where was this coming from?

00:54:40.030 --> 00:54:41.740 align:middle line:84%
Where it was this
ability to counsel,

00:54:41.740 --> 00:54:44.170 align:middle line:84%
even in a waking
state, coming from?

00:54:44.170 --> 00:54:45.160 align:middle line:90%
He was a good man.

00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:48.850 align:middle line:84%
He was a conflicted man,
as I am, as many of us are.

00:54:48.850 --> 00:54:50.650 align:middle line:90%
There was a realness about him.

00:54:50.650 --> 00:54:52.855 align:middle line:90%
And he's one of my true heroes.

00:54:52.855 --> 00:54:54.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We only have
a couple minutes left,

00:54:54.730 --> 00:54:57.140 align:middle line:84%
and I want to find out what
your newest project is.

00:54:57.140 --> 00:54:58.180 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: OK.

00:54:58.180 --> 00:54:59.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Some of these
people I mentioned--

00:54:59.350 --> 00:55:01.720 align:middle line:84%
you know, we get into
Elizabeth Clare Prophet, Jeane

00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:04.970 align:middle line:84%
Dixon, Sydney Omarr, a
whole bunch of people

00:55:04.970 --> 00:55:07.550 align:middle line:84%
we couldn't even get
to in the conversation.

00:55:07.550 --> 00:55:09.480 align:middle line:84%
Do any one of them
pop out that we just

00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:13.385 align:middle line:84%
need to incorporate into
this story, including

00:55:13.385 --> 00:55:14.185 align:middle line:90%
Baird Spalding?

00:55:14.185 --> 00:55:16.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh, Baird T.
Spalding was a remarkable man.

00:55:16.540 --> 00:55:18.456 align:middle line:84%
He wrote a book called
"The Life and Teachings

00:55:18.456 --> 00:55:21.250 align:middle line:84%
of the Masters of the Far East,"
which remains popular today.

00:55:21.250 --> 00:55:23.170 align:middle line:84%
Baird Spalding basically
took a leaf out

00:55:23.170 --> 00:55:25.180 align:middle line:90%
of Madame Blavatsky's Theosophy.

00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:28.120 align:middle line:10%
And he told this narrative,
which some people question

00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:30.260 align:middle line:10%
the veracity of-- but
it has great beauty--

00:55:30.260 --> 00:55:33.980 align:middle line:10%
in which he traveled to and was
tutored by mysterious adepts

00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:35.050 align:middle line:10%
from the East.

00:55:35.050 --> 00:55:36.890 align:middle line:84%
And as I always
point out to people--

00:55:36.890 --> 00:55:38.440 align:middle line:90%
and as I go into in the book--

00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:41.050 align:middle line:84%
whether or not Baird
Spalding saw, heard,

00:55:41.050 --> 00:55:43.510 align:middle line:84%
or did all the things he
claimed to, what you'll find

00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:46.240 align:middle line:84%
is a beautiful theology
coming out of his ideas,

00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:50.380 align:middle line:84%
a theology of universality,
a theology of, again,

00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:53.830 align:middle line:84%
this kind of primeval
uniting doctrine at the heart

00:55:53.830 --> 00:55:55.030 align:middle line:90%
of all great religions.

00:55:55.030 --> 00:55:59.650 align:middle line:84%
That is the central New Age
ideal, that religions do not

00:55:59.650 --> 00:56:01.464 align:middle line:90%
dissipate, religion's converge.

00:56:01.464 --> 00:56:02.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Consolidate.

00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:03.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Right.

00:56:03.250 --> 00:56:05.080 align:middle line:84%
And if we really
understand them--

00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:06.580 align:middle line:90%
if we really understand them--

00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:08.320 align:middle line:84%
rather than get
lost in tribalism,

00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:09.820 align:middle line:90%
they bring us closer together.

00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:11.647 align:middle line:84%
That was Baird
Spalding's message.

00:56:11.647 --> 00:56:12.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting man.

00:56:12.730 --> 00:56:15.427 align:middle line:84%
They said, if he was a phony,
they called him a "real phony."

00:56:15.427 --> 00:56:16.510 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: A real phony--

00:56:16.510 --> 00:56:17.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He was the real deal.

00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:19.105 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: --that's one
of the phrases I love

00:56:19.105 --> 00:56:20.860 align:middle line:10%
and that I use in
"Occult America."

00:56:20.860 --> 00:56:21.850 align:middle line:90%
He was a real phony.

00:56:21.850 --> 00:56:22.990 align:middle line:90%
He had ideals.

00:56:22.990 --> 00:56:24.030 align:middle line:90%
He stood for something.

00:56:24.030 --> 00:56:24.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:56:24.830 --> 00:56:26.950 align:middle line:84%
Lead a-- kind of a humble
ending to his life.

00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:28.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Very humble
ending-- a poor guy,

00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:30.510 align:middle line:84%
didn't profit much
off his books.

00:56:30.510 --> 00:56:32.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Died in a
hotel room or something?

00:56:32.020 --> 00:56:33.728 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Died in
a hotel room, lonely,

00:56:33.728 --> 00:56:34.669 align:middle line:90%
a gold prospector.

00:56:34.669 --> 00:56:35.710 align:middle line:90%
This was a different age.

00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:39.050 align:middle line:84%
These people didn't have social
media platforms and celebrity

00:56:39.050 --> 00:56:39.850 align:middle line:90%
friends.

00:56:39.850 --> 00:56:40.810 align:middle line:84%
They often lead
very solitary lives.

00:56:40.810 --> 00:56:42.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They didn't
have Kickstarter.

00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:43.576 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: They
certainly didn't.

00:56:43.576 --> 00:56:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And they lead, in many
cases, very modest lives.

00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:46.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, indeed.

00:56:46.970 --> 00:56:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And that was true for
almost all of these people

00:56:48.690 --> 00:56:48.910 align:middle line:90%
we've spoken of.

00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:49.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Edgar Cayce as well.

00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:50.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Edgar Cayce as well.

00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:52.643 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: He did not
profit to any great extent.

00:56:52.643 --> 00:56:54.977 align:middle line:84%
Lead most of his life, adult
life, near the poverty line

00:56:54.977 --> 00:56:55.776 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:56:55.776 --> 00:56:56.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:59.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've spent
three hours together.

00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:00.360 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely--

00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:00.960 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: I've enjoyed it.

00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:01.975 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely
fascinating.

00:57:01.975 --> 00:57:02.920 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Thank you.

00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:04.044 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I just love this.

00:57:04.044 --> 00:57:05.260 align:middle line:90%
I will recommend to people.

00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:07.442 align:middle line:84%
Because every time, you
know, I go somewhere,

00:57:07.442 --> 00:57:09.400 align:middle line:84%
I'll run into someone--
oh, I see "Open Minds."

00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:10.630 align:middle line:90%
What would you recommend?

00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:12.946 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say,
these three hours

00:57:12.946 --> 00:57:14.320 align:middle line:84%
are among my very
top favorites--

00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:14.620 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Thank you.

00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:16.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --of the last
14 years of doing this.

00:57:16.810 --> 00:57:17.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: I so
appreciate that.

00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:18.420 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:21.670 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You help us understand
how we got here, how people

00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:23.420 align:middle line:10%
subscribe to Gaia, you know?

00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:25.211 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: It's our
family tree, you know?

00:57:25.211 --> 00:57:26.980 align:middle line:10%
I'd like to see this
as our family tree.

00:57:26.980 --> 00:57:27.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Indeed.

00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:29.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: We are connected,
and we do have a background.

00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:30.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what are
you working on right now?

00:57:30.830 --> 00:57:32.560 align:middle line:84%
So we will talk to you
in the future about that.

00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:33.100 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Thank you.

00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:34.660 align:middle line:10%
I just finished
a new book called

00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:37.960 align:middle line:10%
"The Miracle Club," which is
coming out in fall of 2018.

00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:41.410 align:middle line:10%
And that is my
practical analysis

00:57:41.410 --> 00:57:45.040 align:middle line:10%
of positive mind philosophy,
why it works, how it works,

00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:46.680 align:middle line:10%
what works, and
what doesn't work.

00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:48.567 align:middle line:90%
It's called "The Miracle Club."

00:57:48.567 --> 00:57:49.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very good.

00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:50.550 align:middle line:90%
Can't wait to read it.

00:57:50.550 --> 00:57:52.210 align:middle line:90%
We'll come back when that's out.

00:57:52.210 --> 00:57:52.515 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Pleasure.

00:57:52.515 --> 00:57:53.315 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:57:53.315 --> 00:57:55.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank
you so much, Mitch.

00:57:55.490 --> 00:57:57.350 align:middle line:10%
I hope you've enjoyed
this series with Mitch

00:57:57.350 --> 00:58:00.460 align:middle line:10%
on the history of New Thought
and spirituality in America

00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:01.600 align:middle line:10%
as much as I have.

00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:04.290 align:middle line:10%
Again, the title of the
book is "Occult America."

00:58:04.290 --> 00:58:06.554 align:middle line:84%
And it can be purchased
through major booksellers.

00:58:06.554 --> 00:58:08.470 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:09.820 align:middle line:90%
on "Open Minds."

00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:13.170 align:middle line:90%
