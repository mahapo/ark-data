00:00:19.627 --> 00:00:21.460 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Many
of you have probably

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.530 align:middle line:10%
heard the term
"sheeple," which simply

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.100 align:middle line:10%
means people who are
led around like sheep.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.100 align:middle line:10%
The surprising part is that
this term applies to most of us,

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.339 align:middle line:10%
but we don't know it.

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:31.880 align:middle line:10%
How often have you
wondered why there

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.980 align:middle line:10%
seem to be too few
valid choices when

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.690 align:middle line:10%
it comes to the
things that matter,

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.415 align:middle line:10%
or have had that deflated
feeling of is that all there

00:00:38.415 --> 00:00:39.310 align:middle line:10%
is?

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.300 align:middle line:84%
Investigative
reporter Jon Rappoport

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.860 align:middle line:84%
would tell you
this is by design,

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.700 align:middle line:90%
and it began long, long ago.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.670 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Jon.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.500 align:middle line:84%
>>JON RAPPOPORT:
Nice to be here.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Great work.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.160 align:middle line:84%
This last weekend I
read the earliest one,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.250 align:middle line:84%
which was The Secret Behind
Secret Societies, which is now

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.530 align:middle line:84%
leading into The
Matrix Revealed, which

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.290 align:middle line:84%
is a CD set, which I haven't had
the opportunity to pick up yet.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.480 align:middle line:84%
But there's a reason
you're doing this,

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.120 align:middle line:84%
and it really goes back
long ago to some experiences

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.250 align:middle line:84%
you had when you
were a young man who

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.740 align:middle line:84%
came into the acquaintance
of an extraordinary healer.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And I would like you to just
begin setting yourself up

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.521 align:middle line:84%
so we understand where
you were coming from.

00:01:19.521 --> 00:01:21.270 align:middle line:10%
>>RAPPOPORT: I was 22,
working in New York

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.500 align:middle line:10%
City in a bookstore.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.460 align:middle line:10%
I was beginning to write
when I wasn't working.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.950 align:middle line:10%
A guy came into the store
and asked for a book.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.180 align:middle line:10%
We had a conversation.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.780 align:middle line:10%
The next thing I knew, we sat
down, we had lunch together.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.930 align:middle line:10%
This was 1960, '61
in New York City.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And he tells me
that he's a healer.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.679 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you lived in
1961, nobody said that.

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:50.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, nobody said that.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:51.700 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: And
even if they did,

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.730 align:middle line:84%
you would say, well, I
don't know what you mean,

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.572 align:middle line:90%
or you're crazy, or both.

00:01:56.572 --> 00:01:58.280 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, what
are you talking about?

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.850 align:middle line:84%
So he started talking
to me about all

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.980 align:middle line:84%
sorts of things--
Freud, Wilhelm Reich,

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:07.910 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of what he
would call healers.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.669 align:middle line:84%
But the gist of it was that
in his apartment in Manhattan,

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:13.864 align:middle line:84%
he was working on
diplomats at the UN.

00:02:13.864 --> 00:02:15.530 align:middle line:84%
They were coming to
see him because they

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.630 align:middle line:90%
had physical problems.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.530 align:middle line:84%
And he was curing them
of those problems.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:21.860 align:middle line:90%
That was what I observed.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.620 align:middle line:84%
That's what eventually, through
our friendship, Richard Jenkins

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.680 align:middle line:90%
and I became friends.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.890 align:middle line:90%
We talked a great deal.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.530 align:middle line:84%
He said, come in,
watch what I do.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.720 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.030 align:middle line:84%
So I would sit
there, and I would

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.370 align:middle line:90%
watch him work on these people.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.750 align:middle line:90%


00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.360 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing to
recognize about it.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.590 align:middle line:84%
There was no style where you
would say, ah, yes, well, you

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.120 align:middle line:90%
are of the school of so-and-so.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.100 align:middle line:90%
There was none of that.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.135 align:middle line:84%
And this is part
of the point why

00:02:57.135 --> 00:03:01.800 align:middle line:84%
I started Secret Behind Secret
Societies with this story--

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.420 align:middle line:84%
because people are
bulldozed and fooled

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.520 align:middle line:84%
into accepting
spiritual formula.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.240 align:middle line:90%
This is the world of the spirit.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.680 align:middle line:90%
This is the world of the spirit.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.635 align:middle line:84%
Well, the pedigree of
this author is so-and-so,

00:03:18.635 --> 00:03:20.510 align:middle line:84%
and it comes from a
tradition that goes back,

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.400 align:middle line:84%
and therefore it
must be fantastic.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.520 align:middle line:84%
Or this comes from
this country, which

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.210 align:middle line:90%
we know has had magnificent--

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.730 align:middle line:84%
What's going on
here is that people

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.884 align:middle line:84%
have lost totally
the individual sense

00:03:34.884 --> 00:03:41.900 align:middle line:90%
of what would make me unique.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.920 align:middle line:84%
What would make my
contribution unique?

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.330 align:middle line:84%
What Richard Jenkins was
telling me and showing me

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.820 align:middle line:84%
by his actions
with these people--

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.210 align:middle line:90%
he would move around the table.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.780 align:middle line:84%
He'd have a guy laying out on
a table-- diplomat at the UN.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.480 align:middle line:84%
Maybe he spoke English,
maybe he didn't.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.280 align:middle line:90%
It didn't matter.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.500 align:middle line:84%
Richard would move around the
table, kind of like a dancer,

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.970 align:middle line:84%
but he wasn't
following a pattern.

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.110 align:middle line:90%
He was improvising.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.410 align:middle line:84%
This became clear to me in
about the second session.

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:17.299 align:middle line:84%
This guy's improvising,
which on first blush

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.269 align:middle line:84%
seems to be therefore,
he has absolutely no idea

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:21.500 align:middle line:90%
what he's doing.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that was your
first thought, I would imagine.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.033 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: Yeah, he
has absolutely no idea

00:04:25.033 --> 00:04:26.170 align:middle line:90%
what he's doing.

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:27.770 align:middle line:84%
So why, at the end
of the session,

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.340 align:middle line:90%
does the guy feel better?

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.390 align:middle line:90%
They're not talking.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.100 align:middle line:84%
Richard is not making
any suggestions.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.439 align:middle line:90%
There's no influence here.

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:35.480 align:middle line:84%
The guy's lying on his
back with his eyes closed,

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.050 align:middle line:84%
and Richard is moving
around the table--

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.790 align:middle line:84%
movements of different
kinds-- seems

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.090 align:middle line:84%
to be part of the
time in his own world.

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.880 align:middle line:84%
Occasionally he puts
his hand somewhere

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.700 align:middle line:90%
on the body of this guy.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.420 align:middle line:90%


00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:55.110 align:middle line:84%
I watched sessions
progress on the same person

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.680 align:middle line:90%
week after week after week.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.860 align:middle line:90%
Arthritis begins to dissolve.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Serious organ problems
begin to go away.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.630 align:middle line:84%
All sorts of physical
manifestations

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:12.110 align:middle line:84%
change, and all I can see is
that this guy's improvising.

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:17.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, this not only I found
curious but fantastically

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.660 align:middle line:84%
interesting because that's what
I was trying to do as a writer.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.750 align:middle line:90%
I started to paint then.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.650 align:middle line:84%
That's what I was trying
to do as a painter.

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:27.840 align:middle line:90%
I loved jazz.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.580 align:middle line:84%
That's what jazz was all
about-- improvisation,

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.760 align:middle line:84%
spontaneity, what's
happening now in the moment.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.430 align:middle line:84%
And here, I suddenly
see a guy who

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.810 align:middle line:84%
was a healer-- a category
that I never even imagined

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.240 align:middle line:84%
existed before-- and he
is doing the same thing.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.170 align:middle line:90%
He's improvising.

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.190 align:middle line:84%
Only now I find
it very difficult

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.900 align:middle line:84%
to believe that there could
be any connection between what

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.630 align:middle line:84%
he's doing and
people being healed.

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And so that became the
basis of the conversations

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:54.830 align:middle line:90%
that Richard and I had.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.850 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think what I'm doing,
he would say, has no bearing

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.620 align:middle line:84%
or would have no bearing on
the health of these people?

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.510 align:middle line:84%
I say, you're not
actually doing anything.

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:04.810 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing?

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:09.130 align:middle line:84%
You're not twisting, you're not
pressing, you're not inserting.

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.670 align:middle line:90%
You're not doing anything.

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.460 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
anything means?

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.690 align:middle line:84%
Do you think it's
more efficacious

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:20.660 align:middle line:84%
if I put my hand there on
a person and I concentrate?

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.430 align:middle line:84%
Is that what you're
saying, really?

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.544 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd say, no,
that's not what I'm saying.

00:06:24.544 --> 00:06:25.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, what do you
think I'm doing?

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.620 align:middle line:84%
And this would go on and
on until finally, he said,

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.190 align:middle line:90%
you know what's going on.

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.590 align:middle line:84%
It's why I told you
to come watch this.

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:38.990 align:middle line:84%
He said, I know where you're
coming from-- improvisation,

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.780 align:middle line:90%
spontaneity, life in the moment.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.900 align:middle line:84%
This is what you're
aiming for, right?

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.240 align:middle line:90%
This is what you want, isn't it?

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:46.827 align:middle line:90%
I said, yeah.

00:06:46.827 --> 00:06:48.660 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, this is
what I'm showing you.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:49.890 align:middle line:90%
This is what it is.

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.890 align:middle line:84%
He said, you just
don't understand

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:55.230 align:middle line:84%
the dimensions to
which that can expand

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.960 align:middle line:84%
or the effects that it
can have when you're truly

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.140 align:middle line:90%
acting in the moment right now.

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And this turned around
completely my whole view,

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.500 align:middle line:84%
eventually, of
spirituality, which

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.701 align:middle line:84%
is what I write about in The
Secret Behind Secret Societies.

00:07:07.701 --> 00:07:09.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because spirituality--
even though it sounds

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:14.180 align:middle line:84%
like it might be a conspiracy
book, the reality is it's not.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.540 align:middle line:84%
It's a journey of
consciousness and showing how

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:21.820 align:middle line:84%
our consciousness has been shoe
horned and co-opted to where we

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.410 align:middle line:84%
really do feel as though
we don't have anything

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:27.030 align:middle line:84%
particularly unique
about ourselves,

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:30.990 align:middle line:84%
where we can go to a doctor, and
he can do a one-size-fits-all--

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:34.250 align:middle line:84%
slap some kind of therapy or
slap some kind of drug over

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:38.270 align:middle line:84%
the top of us and it's going to
work, when in fact we're all--

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:41.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I guess if you
could look at the aura,

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.850 align:middle line:84%
we're all in a state of
constant creation and flux.

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:47.970 align:middle line:90%
We're all very highly unique.

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And all of that you
were trying to connect

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:52.527 align:middle line:84%
with through this
healing art of his.

00:07:52.527 --> 00:07:54.360 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: That's
what I was trying to do.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.068 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
whole analogy that you

00:07:56.068 --> 00:07:59.520 align:middle line:84%
used throughout this book of
life being nothing but art,

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.970 align:middle line:90%
I loved.

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:02.730 align:middle line:90%
I can see that.

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:03.660 align:middle line:90%
I relate to it.

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:04.060 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: Me, too.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:04.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
there was one--

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:06.677 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed Don
Miguel Ruiz, and I'm

00:08:06.677 --> 00:08:08.760 align:middle line:84%
going to say this one
thing, because it's a segue.

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:11.380 align:middle line:84%
It fits perfectly
into this part of it.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.890 align:middle line:84%
And he was saying in
his most recent book

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:17.160 align:middle line:90%
that this is your canvas.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.630 align:middle line:84%
Don't let anyone else
throw poo or anything else

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:20.590 align:middle line:90%
on your canvas.

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:23.430 align:middle line:84%
You should have the
right to wake up each day

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:26.960 align:middle line:90%
and create anew on your canvas.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's really the whole
point of what you've done here.

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:35.370 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: Spiritual
life-- people

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:39.049 align:middle line:84%
have so many ideas
about what it is.

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:44.100 align:middle line:84%
Most of those ideas inevitably
wind up in something passive

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:45.920 align:middle line:90%
somehow.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm receiving this.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.140 align:middle line:90%
This is coming in to me.

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:52.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm part of a
collective of something.

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:54.690 align:middle line:90%
It's gooey.

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:56.550 align:middle line:90%
It's gooey.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:01.489 align:middle line:84%
It feels like something's melted
and somebody stuck in there

00:09:01.489 --> 00:09:03.280 align:middle line:84%
and is smiling about
it, saying, well, this

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:05.029 align:middle line:84%
is exactly where I've
always wanted to be,

00:09:05.029 --> 00:09:06.140 align:middle line:90%
in the collective goo.

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:07.590 align:middle line:90%
This is where we're going.

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:09.570 align:middle line:84%
We're going to the
collective goo.

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:11.080 align:middle line:90%
Hop on board.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.587 align:middle line:90%
And it's going to be wonderful.

00:09:12.587 --> 00:09:13.670 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be paradise.

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:16.330 align:middle line:84%
But you won't have to
do anything, really.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:18.640 align:middle line:84%
When you finally arrive
there-- yes, there

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.900 align:middle line:84%
may have been strenuous
moments, but you're now there,

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:22.727 align:middle line:90%
and therefore, you're set.

00:09:22.727 --> 00:09:24.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Isn't this
the great promise

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:26.269 align:middle line:84%
of all of the world's
religions in essence.

00:09:26.269 --> 00:09:27.560 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: Every one of them.

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.480 align:middle line:84%
Every one of them
is based on this.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.315 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: New Age, Old
Age-- it doesn't matter.

00:09:30.315 --> 00:09:31.280 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: Middle
Age-- it doesn't matter.

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.446 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It doesn't matter.

00:09:32.446 --> 00:09:36.500 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: Youth-- they're
all based on the same idea.

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:43.190 align:middle line:84%
It's you're the receiver
getting the transmission.

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:45.430 align:middle line:84%
If you can't get the
right transmission,

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:49.940 align:middle line:84%
you have to clear the airwaves,
and then it will come to you.

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:52.120 align:middle line:90%
This is the big con.

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.880 align:middle line:90%
This is the big scam.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.610 align:middle line:84%
This is the cosmic
rolling of the dice

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:58.140 align:middle line:90%
in exactly the wrong direction.

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.480 align:middle line:84%
This is where people
get eventually.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.010 align:middle line:84%
No matter what part of
the maze they enter into,

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:05.510 align:middle line:84%
eventually they
begin to think, you

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:08.110 align:middle line:84%
know, maybe this is a lot
easier than I thought.

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:12.210 align:middle line:84%
Maybe if I can just adjust my
spine or my consciousness one

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:15.010 align:middle line:84%
degree, an inch to the
right, the transmission

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:17.700 align:middle line:84%
will finally come through, and
then I'll become enlightened.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm saying
here-- it's your art.

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:23.990 align:middle line:90%
How are you going to improvise?

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:25.198 align:middle line:90%
What are you going to create?

00:10:25.198 --> 00:10:27.200 align:middle line:84%
What are you going to
be spontaneous about?

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.120 align:middle line:84%
You have an infinite
variety of choices.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.894 align:middle line:84%
This is what the
spiritual life is.

00:10:30.894 --> 00:10:32.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely,
but let me go back

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.390 align:middle line:84%
over what you just
said a moment ago.

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:39.270 align:middle line:84%
Then you're saying that for us
to be in this passive position

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:42.070 align:middle line:84%
waiting to be told what to
do-- it's not as though sitting

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:43.720 align:middle line:90%
quietly doesn't have its value.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.070 align:middle line:90%
You can actually hear yourself.

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And I just wanted to
make that distinction.

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:47.100 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: Absolutely.

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.766 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Connecting
with your own sense

00:10:48.766 --> 00:10:51.620 align:middle line:84%
of creativity and
inner awareness-- cool.

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.890 align:middle line:84%
But you're talking about
waiting to be given

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:58.440 align:middle line:84%
the word as to the
direction of your life.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.790 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: I'm also
talking also about-- yes,

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:03.930 align:middle line:84%
but if you're sitting
there, and you're

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:07.740 align:middle line:84%
finding your inner serenity,
and peace, and so forth,

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:09.440 align:middle line:84%
and how could that
is-- yes, yes, yes.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.919 align:middle line:84%
But then what are
you going to do?

00:11:11.919 --> 00:11:13.710 align:middle line:84%
Because that's certainly
not the end of it.

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:16.810 align:middle line:84%
It's not as if you can turn
up the dial on the intensity

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:18.840 align:middle line:84%
of that to the point
where a person goes,

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:22.317 align:middle line:84%
I am now so serene and
so self-realized, and so

00:11:22.317 --> 00:11:24.150 align:middle line:84%
enlightened that there's
nothing left to do.

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:27.690 align:middle line:84%
No, because what
I'm saying here is

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:34.340 align:middle line:84%
that the spiritual life comes
from spontaneous expression,

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:39.670 align:middle line:84%
from improvised, imagined--
it comes from creation.

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:40.800 align:middle line:90%
Your creation.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.200 align:middle line:90%
Your imagination.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.800 align:middle line:90%
That's what it originally is.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.180 align:middle line:84%
That's what a spiritual
life originally is.

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And somehow it's been hijacked,
where people are now saying,

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:52.320 align:middle line:90%
that's spiritual life?

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:55.390 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't sound like
anything that I've learned.

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:57.300 align:middle line:84%
No, what I've been
taught is spiritual life

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.370 align:middle line:84%
is something that
ultimately I receive.

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:00.020 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:01.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's very divisive.

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:02.585 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: Very divisive.

00:12:02.585 --> 00:12:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And it cuts out the
uniqueness, too,

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:06.640 align:middle line:84%
because where does
the uniqueness come?

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:10.850 align:middle line:84%
Uniqueness comes from what you
create-- what you spontaneously

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:12.400 align:middle line:90%
create-- what you imagine.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.300 align:middle line:90%
That's you.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:15.480 align:middle line:90%
That's not anybody else.

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.240 align:middle line:84%
That's not the tradition
of one, two, zippity-zoo

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.180 align:middle line:90%
that goes back 5,000 years.

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:21.740 align:middle line:90%
That's you right now.

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And, see, that's
what people have

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:25.280 align:middle line:90%
to begin to come to grips with.

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:28.000 align:middle line:84%
I say to people sometimes, you
want to have an experience?

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.690 align:middle line:90%
You get 50 sheets of paper.

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:30.450 align:middle line:90%
You get a brush.

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:32.580 align:middle line:84%
You get black ink
or black paint.

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:33.500 align:middle line:90%
That's what you do.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:37.310 align:middle line:84%
In fact, let's do
100-- 100 sheets.

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:38.990 align:middle line:84%
Now what you're
going to do is you're

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:43.210 align:middle line:84%
going to execute, quickly,
paintings of any nature.

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:46.400 align:middle line:84%
You're going to take no more
than 30 seconds on each one,

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.830 align:middle line:90%
and then you bring it over here.

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:50.700 align:middle line:90%
And you do 100 of these quickly.

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.040 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get more
out of that experience

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:56.810 align:middle line:84%
than you're going to get
out of reading 500 tomes,

00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:57.640 align:middle line:90%
because that's you.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And years of therapy.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.236 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: And
years of therapy.

00:13:00.236 --> 00:13:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And if 100 doesn't
do it, try 500.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.380 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, you're
going to see something.

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:09.740 align:middle line:84%
Something is going to be
illuminated for you, by you,

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:11.470 align:middle line:90%
from you.

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:13.497 align:middle line:90%
You're the active principle.

00:13:13.497 --> 00:13:14.580 align:middle line:90%
That's what this is about.

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:16.190 align:middle line:84%
You're not the
passive principle.

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:19.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that is not how we
have been raised as a species.

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.630 align:middle line:84%
As I said when I
was introducing you,

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:25.050 align:middle line:84%
this goes a long way back when
we start looking into-- you

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:26.850 align:middle line:84%
don't even have to
call it a conspiracy.

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:29.840 align:middle line:84%
It's simply-- we can
call it "the plan."

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:30.970 align:middle line:90%
I think you use that term.

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:32.670 align:middle line:90%
It's "the plan" in the book.

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:37.880 align:middle line:84%
But when we start looking
back, secret societies,

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:41.530 align:middle line:84%
and perpetrators of plans,
and so forth are not new.

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:44.310 align:middle line:84%
They've always had to have
some kind of key to accessing

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:47.530 align:middle line:84%
our psyche collectively to
be able to manipulate us

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:48.850 align:middle line:90%
through fear or whatever.

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:54.380 align:middle line:84%
And you've done this very clever
little video about even today,

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:58.170 align:middle line:84%
how secrecy exists,
hiding in plain sight.

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:00.410 align:middle line:84%
How data is collected
on us to begin

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:02.560 align:middle line:84%
managing our
impressions of life,

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.130 align:middle line:84%
and I'd like to
go to that video,

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:06.580 align:middle line:84%
if you don't mind,
about the conversation

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:10.170 align:middle line:84%
between Google and the NSA--
National Security Agency.

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:12.518 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at that.

00:14:12.518 --> 00:14:13.800 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.120 align:middle line:90%
>>I'm the boss of Google.

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.750 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm the boss of the
National Security Agency.

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:19.200 align:middle line:90%
>>I'm the boss of Google.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.850 align:middle line:90%
>>I'm the boss of the NSA.

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:22.250 align:middle line:90%
>>I'm the boss of Google.

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:23.900 align:middle line:90%
>>I'm the boss of the NSA.

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:25.900 align:middle line:84%
>>Now that we have
that established,

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:27.310 align:middle line:90%
what is your ultimate goal?

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:30.350 align:middle line:84%
>>We want to know everything
about everybody all the time.

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:31.390 align:middle line:90%
>>So do we.

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:34.380 align:middle line:84%
>>We don't want
you spying on us.

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:34.950 align:middle line:90%
>>Ditto.

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:36.480 align:middle line:90%
>>So let's work together.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.110 align:middle line:84%
>>We'll give you
all the information

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:40.840 align:middle line:84%
we have on everybody
if you'll do the same.

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:43.850 align:middle line:84%
>>Much of our information is
classified and top secret.

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:46.830 align:middle line:84%
>>But we'll only use it
for commercial purposes.

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:50.910 align:middle line:84%
>>You mean, for example, you'll
sell a terrorist a toaster?

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:54.420 align:middle line:84%
>>If his profile indicates he's
in the market for a toaster.

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:57.490 align:middle line:84%
But he might want a course
on how to give a dog a bath.

00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:00.320 align:middle line:84%
>>If we make this deal, then
we might use the information

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:03.470 align:middle line:84%
you give us to turn an
innocent man into a terrorist.

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:06.020 align:middle line:84%
>>What you do with the
information is your business.

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:07.160 align:middle line:90%
>>All right.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.870 align:middle line:84%
Suppose you give us
information on a car salesman

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:11.710 align:middle line:84%
who lives in Peoria
and we make him

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:14.570 align:middle line:84%
into a terrorist-- a
threat to the state.

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:16.560 align:middle line:84%
We'd have our reasons
for doing that.

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.360 align:middle line:84%
>>Then you'll give
us that information,

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:21.750 align:middle line:84%
and we sell this terrorist the
brand of car wax terrorists

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:22.840 align:middle line:90%
tend to favor.

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:25.020 align:middle line:84%
>>Or you could
recommend an attorney.

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:26.400 align:middle line:90%
He'll need an attorney.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.410 align:middle line:84%
>>Then if he does
get an attorney,

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:30.220 align:middle line:90%
we tell you who the attorney is.

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>>Then we investigate
the attorney.

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:34.660 align:middle line:84%
>>You give us the results
of that investigation,

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:37.140 align:middle line:90%
and we see he's an avid golfer.

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:40.790 align:middle line:84%
We show him ads for golf clubs
and video instruction courses

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:42.570 align:middle line:90%
on developing a better swing.

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:46.100 align:middle line:84%
>>This might work
out well-- that is,

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:48.610 align:middle line:84%
if we let an accused
terrorist have an attorney,

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:50.130 align:middle line:90%
which we wouldn't.

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:53.170 align:middle line:84%
>>Over time, as we learn
to trust each other,

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:56.860 align:middle line:84%
we might decide it's beneficial
to merge into one company.

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:58.690 align:middle line:90%
It would save time and money.

00:15:58.690 --> 00:15:59.750 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:02.800 align:middle line:84%
We could make money selling
toasters and car wax and golf

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:03.620 align:middle line:90%
clubs.

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:05.940 align:middle line:84%
>>And we could profile
and investigate people

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:08.200 align:middle line:84%
to see if they're
potential terrorists.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.930 align:middle line:90%
>>It's all just information.

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:11.250 align:middle line:90%
>>And how you use it.

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:13.220 align:middle line:84%
>>But we would never
do anything wrong.

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:14.340 align:middle line:90%
>>Neither would we.

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:16.190 align:middle line:90%
>>Facebook is a threat, though.

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:16.900 align:middle line:90%
>>Why?

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:20.700 align:middle line:84%
>>Because millions of people are
already profiling themselves.

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.410 align:middle line:84%
If this goes too
far, there would

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:24.250 align:middle line:90%
be a reduced need for NSA.

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:27.260 align:middle line:84%
>>So we need to start a
campaign against Facebook.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.840 align:middle line:84%
>>What would be the
substance of that campaign?

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.130 align:middle line:84%
>>We secretly issue
rumors that Facebook

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:34.720 align:middle line:84%
is exposing too many
people to data theft

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.170 align:middle line:84%
and stalking and surveillance
by the government.

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:38.250 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And if it doesn't work,
we start a new operation

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:42.720 align:middle line:90%
called Confessions.

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:45.050 align:middle line:84%
If you can't beat
them, join them.

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:46.690 align:middle line:90%
>>What would Confessions do?

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:49.430 align:middle line:84%
>>Allow people to make
extensive online confessions

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:51.720 align:middle line:84%
of every secret they
have-- confessions

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.200 align:middle line:84%
of their past misdeeds and
their most private and least

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.300 align:middle line:90%
social thoughts.

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:56.545 align:middle line:90%
>>It would be an instant hit.

00:16:56.545 --> 00:16:59.730 align:middle line:90%


00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:01.390 align:middle line:84%
>>Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:02.430 align:middle line:90%
>>I believe so.

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:04.950 align:middle line:84%
>>We have to bring the
Vatican in on this.

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:07.900 align:middle line:84%
They have the biggest confession
database in the world.

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:10.630 align:middle line:90%
>>Excuse me.

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:11.542 align:middle line:90%
>>What?

00:17:11.542 --> 00:17:12.589 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong?

00:17:12.589 --> 00:17:14.880 align:middle line:84%
>>I just received a
signal that somebody

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.280 align:middle line:90%
is taping this meeting.

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:17.200 align:middle line:90%
>>It's not us.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.800 align:middle line:90%
>>It's not us, either.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:22.920 align:middle line:84%
>>You mean somebody else is
out there that's spying on us?

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:24.849 align:middle line:84%
>>Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

00:17:24.849 --> 00:17:25.810 align:middle line:90%
>>God.

00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:27.140 align:middle line:90%
He's recording this.

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:28.795 align:middle line:84%
>>Maybe he needs
some golf clubs.

00:17:28.795 --> 00:17:32.265 align:middle line:90%


00:17:32.265 --> 00:17:34.084 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:17:34.084 --> 00:17:35.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love that.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.022 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I had just
scribbled down here,

00:17:37.022 --> 00:17:38.480 align:middle line:84%
we've got to bring
up Facebook just

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.310 align:middle line:84%
before the little characters
were talking about Facebook.

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:44.270 align:middle line:84%
Because what's important
about this-- people have

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:46.667 align:middle line:84%
their reasons for enjoying
Facebook and all, and some

00:17:46.667 --> 00:17:48.250 align:middle line:84%
of the background
data I've seen on it

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:50.560 align:middle line:84%
is it is nothing
but a data mining.

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:53.020 align:middle line:84%
At its deepest level, it's
a data mining operation.

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:55.640 align:middle line:84%
You're freely giving up
information about yourself

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.640 align:middle line:84%
so that you can be pulled
in with, now I guess,

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:03.480 align:middle line:84%
about a billion others to
be essentially profiled

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:07.410 align:middle line:84%
for not just marketing,
but for intelligence that's

00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:08.930 align:middle line:90%
used a number of ways, right?

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And this is all coming back
to us by way of controls.

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And I want to get
into, to me, one

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:17.750 align:middle line:84%
of the most frightening
aspects of it, which

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:20.951 align:middle line:84%
has to do with the loss
of our health freedom.

00:18:20.951 --> 00:18:21.950 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: Absolutely.

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:24.616 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, we're going to
talk about that a little later.

00:18:24.616 --> 00:18:26.910 align:middle line:84%
However, we also want
to talk about the notion

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:28.800 align:middle line:84%
that this stuff
is going on today.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have in your
book, which I really

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:33.720 align:middle line:84%
enjoyed-- it's not
funny, but going back

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.840 align:middle line:84%
into the notion of
secret societies

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:39.570 align:middle line:90%
and the control over our psyche.

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:41.570 align:middle line:84%
First let's go back
to religions before we

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:43.080 align:middle line:90%
get into the contemporary stuff.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.610 align:middle line:90%
Let's go back to the beginning.

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:46.766 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: OK, so
you mentioned playing

00:18:46.766 --> 00:18:48.390 align:middle line:84%
on the vulnerability
of people in order

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:50.620 align:middle line:84%
to enlist them in the
cause, so to speak.

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:54.060 align:middle line:84%
So a religion can do
that in various ways.

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:57.572 align:middle line:84%
You know, say, first of
all, you're suffering.

00:18:57.572 --> 00:18:58.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:00.130 align:middle line:90%
You have problems.

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:01.560 align:middle line:90%
You're limited.

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:03.330 align:middle line:90%
They slip that one by you.

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:06.230 align:middle line:90%
Like, oh, I guess I am.

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:07.600 align:middle line:90%
Look what we have.

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:10.090 align:middle line:84%
We have something
that we can offer you.

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:14.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of a secret,
because only some of us

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:15.780 align:middle line:90%
are really initiated into it.

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:18.885 align:middle line:84%
Well, this naturally arouses
the curiosity of people.

00:19:18.885 --> 00:19:20.260 align:middle line:84%
There may be
something good here.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:21.170 align:middle line:90%
There's a secret.

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:23.390 align:middle line:84%
Secret behind secret
societies-- part of that

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:28.150 align:middle line:84%
is to have a secret that
you can promote to people.

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:32.510 align:middle line:84%
We have a secret, and we can
help you improve your lives.

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:35.380 align:middle line:84%
But then there is
a sense-- and I

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:38.052 align:middle line:84%
think this is really
at the core of it--

00:19:38.052 --> 00:19:39.510 align:middle line:84%
there's a part of
people that wants

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:40.635 align:middle line:90%
to be treated collectively.

00:19:40.635 --> 00:19:42.980 align:middle line:90%


00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:44.584 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we want to be a collective.

00:19:44.584 --> 00:19:46.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We want to feel
connected with each other,

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:47.060 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:47.270 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: Yes.

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:49.050 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing wrong with that.

00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:51.590 align:middle line:84%
Of course people want to feel
connected with each other.

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:55.180 align:middle line:84%
But now you take it too far,
and now what you have is

00:19:55.180 --> 00:20:00.070 align:middle line:84%
you have humans living in a
beehive, in an ant colony--

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:02.930 align:middle line:90%
that sort of collective notion.

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the things
that religious organizations

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:09.750 align:middle line:84%
have preyed on and used
since the beginning.

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:11.690 align:middle line:90%
We have an organization.

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:17.120 align:middle line:84%
You're part of the organization,
and on the top end is heaven.

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:20.380 align:middle line:84%
Now the only way to get
there is through us.

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:22.770 align:middle line:84%
The only way to get
to understanding

00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:24.820 align:middle line:84%
what you're really all
about is through us.

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And everyone is really
in the same boat.

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:30.220 align:middle line:84%
So come to us, all
of you together,

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:33.620 align:middle line:84%
and you will all
be together as one.

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.090 align:middle line:84%
How many times
have we heard that?

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:37.006 align:middle line:84%
And these people say,
well, that sounds great.

00:20:37.006 --> 00:20:38.180 align:middle line:90%
No, it doesn't.

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:42.967 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't sound great to say
we will all be together as one.

00:20:42.967 --> 00:20:44.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, where
are you in that?

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:46.485 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: Where
did this come from?

00:20:46.485 --> 00:20:49.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But with that is, now,
people listening to this right

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:52.980 align:middle line:84%
now would think, but sure,
that's how it's supposed to be.

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:54.200 align:middle line:90%
We're all one.

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.370 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: That's right.

00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:56.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Most people
listening right now

00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:57.991 align:middle line:90%
are going to be thinking that.

00:20:57.991 --> 00:20:58.740 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: Yeah.

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:02.570 align:middle line:84%
So this is challenging
that straight ahead.

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:04.110 align:middle line:90%
OK, think about that.

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:05.600 align:middle line:90%
Is that really what you want?

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.221 align:middle line:90%
And what does it even mean?

00:21:07.221 --> 00:21:08.970 align:middle line:84%
Does it mean, for
example, that you're all

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:11.670 align:middle line:84%
going to be the
consistency of cappellini?

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:13.100 align:middle line:90%
Is it angel hair one?

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:14.410 align:middle line:90%
Is it melted butter one?

00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:15.870 align:middle line:90%
Is it cheese one?

00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:20.360 align:middle line:84%
Is it going to be, I
don't know, salad bar one?

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.930 align:middle line:84%
What is the oneness that
you're really talking about?

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:28.560 align:middle line:84%
When you really boil it down,
is it the oneness of we're

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:29.620 align:middle line:90%
all sleeping?

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:33.720 align:middle line:90%
We're all in a narcotic state?

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.350 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:37.990 align:middle line:84%
It means that you're
no longer you?

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:39.670 align:middle line:84%
Because that's sort
of the implication.

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:42.380 align:middle line:84%
Oh, no, I'm going to be
me, but we're all one.

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:43.150 align:middle line:90%
Explain that.

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:44.520 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:48.820 align:middle line:84%
People take that-- it's kind
of like you show somebody

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:51.430 align:middle line:84%
a cushion or a pillow,
and you say, try it out.

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:53.620 align:middle line:90%
And they say, I love it.

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:54.335 align:middle line:90%
We are all one.

00:21:54.335 --> 00:21:55.210 align:middle line:90%
How do you like that?

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:56.180 align:middle line:90%
I like it.

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:58.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what it
means, but I like it.

00:21:58.140 --> 00:21:59.720 align:middle line:90%
We are all one.

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:03.570 align:middle line:84%
Religion has found a way to
promote that idea to people.

00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:05.767 align:middle line:84%
It's collectivism on
a spiritual level.

00:22:05.767 --> 00:22:07.100 align:middle line:90%
That's what we're talking about.

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:08.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But
that's specifically

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:12.190 align:middle line:84%
initiated and
managed through fear.

00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:13.665 align:middle line:90%
You got the carrot-- salvation.

00:22:13.665 --> 00:22:14.090 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: To some degree.

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:15.020 align:middle line:90%
Yes, salvation.

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:16.820 align:middle line:84%
And then, here's
hell if you don't.

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:18.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you
don't buy the program,

00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:19.904 align:middle line:90%
and you're going somewhere else.

00:22:19.904 --> 00:22:21.695 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: You're
also going to be alone.

00:22:21.695 --> 00:22:23.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're
going to be alone, right.

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:24.045 align:middle line:90%
Isolation.

00:22:24.045 --> 00:22:25.586 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: This
is big, because "we

00:22:25.586 --> 00:22:29.180 align:middle line:84%
are all one" does-- you're
absolutely right-- imply if you

00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:31.730 align:middle line:84%
don't believe us, then
what's the consequence?

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:33.570 align:middle line:90%
You're going to be left out.

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:38.440 align:middle line:84%
The rest of us will all be
one, only you won't be there.

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.210 align:middle line:84%
So this is another
big technique.

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:44.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, these techniques
of collectivism-- this

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:48.080 align:middle line:84%
is the history, in a
way, of the planet.

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:51.460 align:middle line:84%
Whether you're talking
spirituality, economics,

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:55.740 align:middle line:84%
finances, government,
politics-- on every level,

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:59.200 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about somebody's
version of collectivism.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.702 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Social welfare.

00:23:00.702 --> 00:23:01.410 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: Yes.

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:02.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All of it.

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.038 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: All of it.

00:23:03.038 --> 00:23:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And the idea we're
all in this together,

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:10.000 align:middle line:90%
some politician tells us.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.220 align:middle line:90%
We are all one.

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:12.500 align:middle line:90%
We're all in this together.

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.550 align:middle line:90%
Stop, Mr. Politician.

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:15.790 align:middle line:90%
What does that actually mean?

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:18.570 align:middle line:84%
My understanding was that we had
a Republic in the United States

00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:20.040 align:middle line:84%
with a Constitution,
and that there

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.450 align:middle line:84%
were certain inviolable
individual rights.

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:23.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.875 align:middle line:84%
The individual part
has been left behind.

00:23:24.875 --> 00:23:26.416 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: Yes,
the individual part

00:23:26.416 --> 00:23:29.594 align:middle line:84%
has been deleted and erased
in favor of the collective.

00:23:29.594 --> 00:23:31.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's the same
thing that happened,

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:35.440 align:middle line:84%
only it happened much earlier,
long ago, in religion.

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:39.850 align:middle line:84%
Let's eliminate the I.
Let's say the I is bad.

00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:43.160 align:middle line:84%
Let's convince everybody that
the I really means the ego,

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:46.010 align:middle line:84%
and we all know
that the ego is bad.

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:47.870 align:middle line:84%
So we have to
eliminate that in favor

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:53.626 align:middle line:84%
of the smoothed out,
equalized collective.

00:23:53.626 --> 00:23:57.134 align:middle line:84%
Everybody goes, yeah, the
ego is bad, and so forth.

00:23:57.134 --> 00:23:59.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you know
what's weird about that

00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:01.990 align:middle line:84%
is that almost every
human being I know

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:05.290 align:middle line:84%
has issues around the fact
that they feel isolated already

00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:06.830 align:middle line:90%
because they're not fitting in.

00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:09.690 align:middle line:84%
This is a deep
subconscious thing

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:13.190 align:middle line:84%
that expresses itself--
that they're not fitting in.

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:15.160 align:middle line:84%
They feel different than
the rest of people--

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:16.990 align:middle line:84%
uncomfortable around
others-- because they

00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:18.700 align:middle line:90%
don't feel they fit in.

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:21.994 align:middle line:84%
Well, if that's how the majority
of people are feeling secretly,

00:24:21.994 --> 00:24:23.410 align:middle line:84%
we have to start
getting the clue.

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:24.880 align:middle line:90%
There's a reason for that.

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.550 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we're not supposed to
be fitting in to anything.

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And I want to read this quote
out of your book to you.

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:32.090 align:middle line:90%
Hope you remember it.

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:34.790 align:middle line:84%
You might even
remember who said it.

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:36.800 align:middle line:84%
This is interesting
because it has

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:43.110 align:middle line:84%
to do with a group of elites
that specifically do not

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:45.430 align:middle line:84%
wish that we wake up
to our individuality.

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And here's the quote, "If
individual reality becomes

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:53.130 align:middle line:84%
fluid, then how can we control
huge numbers of people?

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:56.640 align:middle line:84%
The world itself on every
level will stop being singular,

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:59.690 align:middle line:84%
and the obedience we
require will disappear.

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:01.940 align:middle line:84%
We won't be able
to wield forever

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:07.110 align:middle line:84%
authoritative patterns and
their unchanging symbols."

00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:09.410 align:middle line:90%
That's an amazing quote.

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:14.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, it doesn't have to look
like a bleak totalitarian

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:15.610 align:middle line:90%
picture.

00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:17.990 align:middle line:90%
It can look like democracy.

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:20.070 align:middle line:84%
It can look like
life in the USA,

00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:22.310 align:middle line:84%
life in Western
Europe, Disneyland.

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:23.330 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:25.070 align:middle line:84%
It's still being
managed and controlled,

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:26.120 align:middle line:90%
is what you're saying.

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:27.160 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: I am.

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:27.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm saying that.

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And the only real end
to it is the individual,

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:37.690 align:middle line:84%
because if the individual
is basically doomed

00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:39.290 align:middle line:84%
to be in one
collective or another

00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:41.980 align:middle line:84%
because he or she can't
imagine themselves living

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:44.930 align:middle line:84%
their lives in any other
way, then all is lost.

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:48.040 align:middle line:84%
Because it doesn't matter
who runs the collective.

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:51.950 align:middle line:84%
They're going to get her or
him because the person is

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:54.757 align:middle line:90%
right to be part of that.

00:25:54.757 --> 00:25:56.340 align:middle line:84%
So I want to go back
to what you said.

00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:59.110 align:middle line:90%


00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:03.420 align:middle line:84%
People should feel
uncomfortable in the presence

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:06.910 align:middle line:84%
of this sort of unified
collective field

00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:09.750 align:middle line:90%
of melted cheese.

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:11.150 align:middle line:90%
They should feel uncomfortable.

00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:17.150 align:middle line:84%
They should feel, what is this
upon which I am encountering,

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:18.540 align:middle line:90%
sire?

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:22.380 align:middle line:84%
As I ride my horse,
the knight errant,

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:25.220 align:middle line:84%
and I see these
humanoids that all

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:31.440 align:middle line:84%
seem to be fitting into
some system of a collective,

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:32.250 align:middle line:90%
what is this?

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:33.670 align:middle line:90%
How did this happen?

00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:36.060 align:middle line:84%
Where was the
individual eradicated?

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:38.640 align:middle line:84%
How is the individual
taken out of this?

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And if you say--
and I believe you're

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:47.000 align:middle line:84%
right-- the majority of people
actually feel misfitted,

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.730 align:middle line:84%
then it would be a great
idea if the misfits just

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:53.174 align:middle line:90%
started talking to each other.

00:26:53.174 --> 00:26:54.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
that is most people.

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:56.298 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's what
I hear, anyway,

00:26:56.298 --> 00:26:59.870 align:middle line:84%
in private conversations with
most people is at some point,

00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:01.710 align:middle line:84%
they don't feel
comfortable around others,

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:04.520 align:middle line:84%
because they don't feel
like they're fitting in.

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:06.302 align:middle line:84%
The people I know
are not what all

00:27:06.302 --> 00:27:08.080 align:middle line:84%
what would be classically
called misfits.

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:09.164 align:middle line:90%
These are everyday people.

00:27:09.164 --> 00:27:11.038 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: They're
are all sorts of people.

00:27:11.038 --> 00:27:13.090 align:middle line:84%
They're people from
every walk of life.

00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:14.680 align:middle line:90%
I believe you.

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:16.250 align:middle line:90%
I would propose a scale.

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:18.370 align:middle line:90%
It's like a seesaw, okay.

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:19.900 align:middle line:90%
It's a long horizontal.

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:22.120 align:middle line:84%
And you say, here
is this individual.

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:25.410 align:middle line:84%
Now ultimately, this person
who feels they don't fit in,

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:30.460 align:middle line:84%
are they closer to becoming
part of the collective melted

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:33.175 align:middle line:84%
cheese, where-- which the
idea of the individual

00:27:33.175 --> 00:27:35.630 align:middle line:84%
is totally erased and
it's all kind of, oh,

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:36.680 align:middle line:90%
isn't this wonderful?

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.820 align:middle line:84%
Or are they closer to
being the unique individual

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:40.780 align:middle line:90%
that they actually are?

00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:43.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, I would maintain
they're closer to that.

00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:44.880 align:middle line:84%
So let them go in
that direction.

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:47.650 align:middle line:84%
In other words, stop
worrying about fitting in.

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:49.770 align:middle line:84%
Start worrying about
the fact that you're

00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:51.030 align:middle line:90%
kind of caught in the middle.

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:52.180 align:middle line:90%
That's the problem.

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:57.740 align:middle line:84%
The problem is you've got
an inkling and more that you

00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:01.050 align:middle line:84%
are a unique individual, and
that therefore, your role

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:05.490 align:middle line:84%
is to create your reality
to the hilt-- to imagine it,

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:07.760 align:middle line:84%
to invent it, to create
it, to improvise it,

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:11.860 align:middle line:90%
to live spontaneously.

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:14.270 align:middle line:90%
That is your creation.

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:15.924 align:middle line:90%
And it will be unique to you.

00:28:15.924 --> 00:28:17.090 align:middle line:90%
You have an inkling of that.

00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:20.830 align:middle line:84%
You can go in that direction, or
you can go in the direction of,

00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:23.840 align:middle line:84%
I just want to fit
in and be happy.

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:26.507 align:middle line:84%
Do you really think you're going
to be happy at the end of that?

00:28:26.507 --> 00:28:27.548 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Nobody's happy.

00:28:27.548 --> 00:28:28.470 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: Come on.

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:30.470 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to be
happy at the end of that.

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:33.610 align:middle line:84%
Here's where you want to go
because once you get further

00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:37.960 align:middle line:84%
into the uniqueness and
spontaneity of who you are,

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:39.460 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
find all of a sudden

00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:41.400 align:middle line:84%
that you can relate
better to other people.

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:43.580 align:middle line:90%
You're totally free.

00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:46.350 align:middle line:10%
And one of the things that
we were going to get to,

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:49.560 align:middle line:10%
and I think it's time we
dive into it-- if we start

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:52.080 align:middle line:10%
looking at programming and
the plan throughout history,

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:55.390 align:middle line:10%
now we're going to look at it
from a sociopathic political

00:28:55.390 --> 00:28:55.890 align:middle line:10%
level.

00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:56.970 align:middle line:90%
We'll go to Hitler.

00:28:56.970 --> 00:29:00.670 align:middle line:84%
Lots has been written about
him and what he was actually

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:01.540 align:middle line:90%
going for.

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:03.570 align:middle line:84%
He was going for
a plan, all right,

00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:05.910 align:middle line:84%
but the plan actually
had different roots

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:07.340 align:middle line:90%
than most people know.

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And aside from wiping out ethnic
groups as part of his plan,

00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:15.010 align:middle line:84%
he was also wiping
out astrologers,

00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:18.430 align:middle line:84%
psychics, certain
artists, gypsies--

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:20.930 align:middle line:90%
we know that-- living freely.

00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:23.640 align:middle line:84%
What was the real
agenda going on there

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:26.350 align:middle line:90%
from a historical point of view?

00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:28.770 align:middle line:10%
>>RAPPOPORT: Same thing you
find with-- if you go back far

00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:30.980 align:middle line:10%
enough in time--
with the Vatican.

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:32.530 align:middle line:10%
They were doing the same thing.

00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:36.420 align:middle line:10%
You're a healer, a witch,
a this, a that, a whatever.

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:41.230 align:middle line:10%
You're departing
from the doctrine.

00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:43.210 align:middle line:90%
We've got to get rid of you.

00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:45.696 align:middle line:84%
You either renounce
yourself as a heretic

00:29:45.696 --> 00:29:48.070 align:middle line:84%
and join the fold, in which
case we'll keep an eye on you

00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:52.980 align:middle line:84%
and think about provisional
membership in the plan,

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:54.430 align:middle line:90%
or you're out.

00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:57.154 align:middle line:90%
And if you're out, you're gone.

00:29:57.154 --> 00:29:58.070 align:middle line:90%
What was Hitler doing?

00:29:58.070 --> 00:30:01.080 align:middle line:84%
Hitler was trying to monopolize
spiritual life on the planet.

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:05.410 align:middle line:10%
He thought that he had a
clue about the ancient race

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:09.300 align:middle line:10%
of superior man, of which
the Germans were the latest

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:09.950 align:middle line:10%
incarnation.

00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:11.991 align:middle line:84%
He was going to trace it
back, and he sent people

00:30:11.991 --> 00:30:14.640 align:middle line:84%
all over the world to
find confirming evidence.

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:16.790 align:middle line:90%
He sent them to Tibet.

00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:18.722 align:middle line:84%
He accumulated the
evidence the way

00:30:18.722 --> 00:30:21.150 align:middle line:84%
a person does when
they start out

00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:23.240 align:middle line:84%
with a fixed idea that
will never change no matter

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:25.760 align:middle line:84%
what happens, and then they
look around, and everything

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:27.990 align:middle line:84%
they see they
relate to that idea.

00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:29.810 align:middle line:84%
Oh, well, that's just
more confirmation

00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:34.230 align:middle line:84%
that I am the king of the world
and that my plan is the plan.

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:36.300 align:middle line:84%
Oh, we have something
that happened in China

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:37.380 align:middle line:90%
1,500 years ago?

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:41.600 align:middle line:84%
That simply confirms that the
Nazis are, in fact, the leaders

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:44.860 align:middle line:84%
of the Aryan race, and that we
deserve to take over the world.

00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And we must eliminate all
spiritual competition--

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:49.150 align:middle line:90%
all competitors.

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:53.270 align:middle line:84%
Astrologists-- Hitler
would say privately,

00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:54.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm the only astrologer.

00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:57.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, because
he's totally into astrology,

00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:58.450 align:middle line:84%
but he's killing off
the other astrologers.

00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:00.325 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: So you
knock off everybody else.

00:31:00.325 --> 00:31:04.960 align:middle line:84%
He learns a little bit about
visualization, which he did up

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:08.320 align:middle line:84%
in his private retreat, and
he had people working for him.

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:11.277 align:middle line:84%
OK, anybody that teaches
visualization, exile them

00:31:11.277 --> 00:31:13.620 align:middle line:84%
or kill them right
away, because I

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:16.460 align:middle line:84%
am the only one that now knows
anything about the subject.

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:19.150 align:middle line:84%
It's monopolization,
centralization

00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:23.600 align:middle line:84%
of power-- of a doctrine--
that preaches an elite

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:24.980 align:middle line:90%
and then there's everybody else.

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:26.729 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's no
different than, again,

00:31:26.729 --> 00:31:29.350 align:middle line:84%
going back to the Church of
Rome and some of the more

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:31.927 align:middle line:90%
ancient spiritual traditions.

00:31:31.927 --> 00:31:32.760 align:middle line:90%
He was no different.

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:36.830 align:middle line:84%
He was just a particularly
sociopathic, paranoid

00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:38.230 align:middle line:90%
representation of that.

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:42.205 align:middle line:84%
But within that, he
implemented everything.

00:31:42.205 --> 00:31:45.280 align:middle line:84%
He implemented everything
in a negative spectrum

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:46.780 align:middle line:84%
that one would when
you're operating

00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:47.740 align:middle line:90%
from those principles.

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:48.615 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: Exactly.

00:31:48.615 --> 00:31:51.050 align:middle line:84%
And he's more relatable
to the modern person

00:31:51.050 --> 00:31:53.650 align:middle line:84%
because it happened
during vaguely our time.

00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:55.991 align:middle line:84%
You go back to Egypt, for
example-- ancient Egypt--

00:31:55.991 --> 00:31:57.990 align:middle line:84%
and you start talking
about the priesthood there

00:31:57.990 --> 00:32:00.940 align:middle line:84%
and the caste system
there, and people go, yeah,

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:02.310 align:middle line:90%
I sort of know what you mean.

00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And you think, do
you really, though?

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:06.740 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine what
it's like that you

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:08.900 align:middle line:84%
are one of the
chosen few and you've

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:11.200 align:middle line:84%
got everybody else
building pyramids?

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And some volunteering, yes, but
there's some forced labor, too.

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And you've got the only doctrine
that matters in a civilization

00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:20.000 align:middle line:84%
and that you hold
all the secrets,

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.449 align:middle line:84%
and that people will not be
able to find out the secrets

00:32:22.449 --> 00:32:23.490 align:middle line:90%
unless they're initiated.

00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:25.900 align:middle line:84%
Or do you know what it
means to have a real caste

00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:28.210 align:middle line:90%
system in ancient India?

00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:30.490 align:middle line:90%
People say, sort of.

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:33.686 align:middle line:84%
You tell them Hitler, they
generally say, OK, I get it.

00:32:33.686 --> 00:32:35.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's why
he's a wonderful example

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:39.890 align:middle line:84%
to use because of the
extremity of everything there.

00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:42.200 align:middle line:84%
What about-- going
further back-- we'll

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.570 align:middle line:90%
go to the conception.

00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And this can be
indigenous societies that

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:49.250 align:middle line:84%
appear to be living in a
very different kind of way

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:51.960 align:middle line:84%
than the what we now consider
modern organized religion,

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:54.550 align:middle line:84%
but in fact, we're
still harking back

00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:56.670 align:middle line:90%
to these same creation stories.

00:32:56.670 --> 00:32:59.390 align:middle line:84%
Every creation story
has a common theme,

00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:02.600 align:middle line:84%
and that is there
is a superior being

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:05.640 align:middle line:84%
who has created
inferior beings who

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:08.990 align:middle line:84%
can work either over lifetimes
or within a lifetime,

00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:12.030 align:middle line:84%
whatever the belief system is,
to somehow win the good graces

00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:14.350 align:middle line:84%
so you can hang out
somewhere in the company

00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:16.640 align:middle line:90%
of the superior being.

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:18.160 align:middle line:90%
Where is the creator in that?

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:19.360 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: Brilliant.

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:20.462 align:middle line:90%
Nowhere.

00:33:20.462 --> 00:33:21.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Where are we?

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:22.950 align:middle line:84%
Where is the creator--
us-- we are here to create.

00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:24.033 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: Exactly, yes.

00:33:24.033 --> 00:33:25.640 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:26.980 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:32.080 align:middle line:84%
People feel-- because we're now
talking centuries and centuries

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:36.700 align:middle line:84%
of personal cultural social
brainwashing to this myth

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:38.880 align:middle line:90%
that you've just described here.

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:39.770 align:middle line:90%
People feel naked.

00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:40.600 align:middle line:90%
They feel alone.

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:43.906 align:middle line:90%
They say, you mean it's me.

00:33:43.906 --> 00:33:45.030 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you're saying?

00:33:45.030 --> 00:33:46.400 align:middle line:90%
You're saying it's me?

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:48.100 align:middle line:90%
That I'm the creator?

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:52.130 align:middle line:84%
That I create essentially
my own consciousness?

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:54.340 align:middle line:84%
To which-- and I
write in the book,

00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:56.550 align:middle line:90%
and I would say this-- yes.

00:33:56.550 --> 00:33:59.370 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of the
most fundamental things

00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:03.530 align:middle line:84%
about consciousness is
that it wants to and does

00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:06.350 align:middle line:90%
create new consciousness.

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:07.340 align:middle line:90%
Guess what.

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:08.570 align:middle line:90%
It's not static.

00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:13.030 align:middle line:84%
It's not here and then
here, or it's there-- no.

00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And it'll take any means to
accomplish this, you see.

00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:17.860 align:middle line:90%
And so here you are.

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:23.239 align:middle line:84%
You have your consciousness,
which means it's you.

00:34:23.239 --> 00:34:25.570 align:middle line:84%
You want to create
new consciousness.

00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:27.199 align:middle line:90%
You're a creator.

00:34:27.199 --> 00:34:31.139 align:middle line:84%
You are the creator
of your consciousness.

00:34:31.139 --> 00:34:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And now you want to
turn around, and you

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:37.270 align:middle line:84%
want to say that somehow it's
a superior thing, and a more

00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:39.770 align:middle line:84%
holy thing, and a
more wonderful thing,

00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:43.550 align:middle line:84%
and a less selfish thing,
and a more accepting thing,

00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:47.380 align:middle line:84%
and a better societal thing
if you say that up there

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:50.179 align:middle line:90%
is the one who created me?

00:34:50.179 --> 00:34:51.659 align:middle line:90%
You really want to believe that?

00:34:51.659 --> 00:34:55.174 align:middle line:84%
And you want to also believe
that if you don't say that,

00:34:55.174 --> 00:34:58.060 align:middle line:84%
that there's something
deeply the matter with you?

00:34:58.060 --> 00:34:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And that people should
look at you and say,

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.710 align:middle line:90%
there's an outcast.

00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:02.920 align:middle line:90%
There's a heretic.

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:07.260 align:middle line:84%
There is one who is from Satan,
because what does Satan believe

00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:10.590 align:middle line:84%
but that the individual
is ultimately powerful,

00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:12.770 align:middle line:90%
and that God means nothing.

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:15.160 align:middle line:84%
This is the centuries-- now
we're talking about the heavy

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:19.770 align:middle line:84%
stuff-- of propaganda all
leveled at the idea that you

00:35:19.770 --> 00:35:25.960 align:middle line:84%
cannot be the creative power
behind the throne of yourself.

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:27.220 align:middle line:90%
That this is not allowed.

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:28.806 align:middle line:84%
We can't have this
on the planet.

00:35:28.806 --> 00:35:30.180 align:middle line:84%
You want to know
secret societies

00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:31.880 align:middle line:90%
on the planet really accomplish?

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:33.720 align:middle line:84%
This is what they
accomplish, okay.

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:36.100 align:middle line:84%
This is the bottom line
on the whole thing.

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:38.100 align:middle line:84%
This is what they really
accomplish to the point

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:39.680 align:middle line:84%
where people would
say, oh, my god,

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:43.040 align:middle line:90%
I can't say that I'm the one.

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:45.330 align:middle line:84%
That would be like
saying, I am god.

00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:46.075 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not.

00:35:46.075 --> 00:35:47.450 align:middle line:84%
It's not the same
thing as saying

00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:51.060 align:middle line:84%
I am god, because god is part
of the myth of the creature

00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:54.221 align:middle line:84%
to whom you will always
be completely inferior.

00:35:54.221 --> 00:35:55.720 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking
about that at all.

00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:57.302 align:middle line:84%
We're talking
about you being you

00:35:57.302 --> 00:36:00.190 align:middle line:84%
being the power behind
the throne of yourself.

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:01.330 align:middle line:90%
That's you.

00:36:01.330 --> 00:36:03.081 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're the
creator of your life.

00:36:03.081 --> 00:36:04.955 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: You're the
creator of your life,

00:36:04.955 --> 00:36:06.350 align:middle line:84%
your consciousness,
the expansion

00:36:06.350 --> 00:36:09.750 align:middle line:84%
of your consciousness,
the uniqueness of wherever

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:12.610 align:middle line:84%
you want to take that
consciousness-- all

00:36:12.610 --> 00:36:16.220 align:middle line:84%
those directions are open to
you whether you see them or not.

00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:18.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, you think you
can only get there

00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:22.150 align:middle line:84%
by becoming a slave to
some myth that you created?

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:22.650 align:middle line:90%
Good luck.

00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:24.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
antithetical to that.

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:28.070 align:middle line:84%
Every now and then you hear of
probably the most often bandied

00:36:28.070 --> 00:36:31.610 align:middle line:84%
about quotation in the Bible
that is counter to that, which

00:36:31.610 --> 00:36:36.450 align:middle line:84%
is the statement by Jesus in the
Bible that anything I can do,

00:36:36.450 --> 00:36:38.985 align:middle line:84%
you can do and more,
essentially, which is you're

00:36:38.985 --> 00:36:39.910 align:middle line:90%
your own creator.

00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:41.350 align:middle line:90%
If I can do this, so can you.

00:36:41.350 --> 00:36:42.430 align:middle line:90%
What's stopping you?

00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:43.930 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: Now,
you see, my theory

00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:47.390 align:middle line:84%
on that-- just like every
time that this kind of thing

00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:50.540 align:middle line:84%
is enunciated in history-- the
reason that people pass over it

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:53.670 align:middle line:84%
is because if they
stopped right there,

00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:57.320 align:middle line:84%
that would be the end of
whatever they're doing.

00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:59.800 align:middle line:84%
That would be the last
sentence in the Bible

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:02.460 align:middle line:90%
if anybody had any common sense.

00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:03.610 align:middle line:90%
They'd say, hold it.

00:37:03.610 --> 00:37:04.580 align:middle line:90%
Stop right there.

00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:06.960 align:middle line:90%
Did the man say--

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:08.520 align:middle line:84%
This is what I want
to get straight.

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:10.353 align:middle line:84%
It's like we were talking
earlier off camera

00:37:10.353 --> 00:37:10.980 align:middle line:90%
about the news.

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:13.490 align:middle line:84%
When the reporter has got the
story, he's got the witness,

00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:16.980 align:middle line:84%
and just asked the question,
got the explosive answer,

00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:20.470 align:middle line:90%
and then non sequitur.

00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:22.651 align:middle line:84%
So what car are you
driving these days?

00:37:22.651 --> 00:37:23.150 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:24.580 align:middle line:84%
You just blew the
whole thing over.

00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:25.380 align:middle line:90%
You're not going to--

00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:27.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Don't get me
going about the media.

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:28.850 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: So it's
the same thing here.

00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Jesus said, and
you shall do things

00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:34.020 align:middle line:90%
that I've never even imagined.

00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:35.400 align:middle line:90%
OK, hold it.

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:37.290 align:middle line:90%
Did the man say that?

00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:39.890 align:middle line:90%
What did he mean?

00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:42.360 align:middle line:84%
And you get final
confessions out of people.

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:46.130 align:middle line:84%
OK, he said that I would be
able to do more than he did.

00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:47.470 align:middle line:90%
OK, I admit it.

00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:48.370 align:middle line:90%
Everybody admits it.

00:37:48.370 --> 00:37:48.645 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:48.645 --> 00:37:48.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The end.

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:50.460 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: The
end of the Bible.

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:51.200 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:53.040 align:middle line:84%
OK, wrap it up, get
it to the publisher.

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:55.010 align:middle line:84%
This is the last
sentence of the Bible.

00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:57.160 align:middle line:90%
We don't need to go any further.

00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:59.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's a great punchline,
too, when you think about it.

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:01.650 align:middle line:84%
We had all of the
Old Testament and all

00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:04.690 align:middle line:84%
of the New Testament leading
up to this one sentence.

00:38:04.690 --> 00:38:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And now it blows people's
heads away, and they go, wow.

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:12.162 align:middle line:84%
That was worth it to read
the book to get to that.

00:38:12.162 --> 00:38:13.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To get
to that punchline.

00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:14.230 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:16.300 align:middle line:84%
And instead, the
exact opposite has

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:18.080 align:middle line:84%
happened and been
pounded it into us.

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:21.420 align:middle line:84%
And you write in the book about
the fact that at one point,

00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:23.540 align:middle line:84%
the priests were
considered higher

00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:27.330 align:middle line:84%
on the level of hierarchies of
the heavens than God himself.

00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:31.024 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course that was made
true by the church itself.

00:38:31.024 --> 00:38:32.190 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: Church of Rome.

00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:33.898 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and
so it would certainly

00:38:33.898 --> 00:38:36.450 align:middle line:84%
justify the terrible
things that happened

00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:37.867 align:middle line:84%
during certain
eras of the church.

00:38:37.867 --> 00:38:39.908 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not just pounding
on the Catholic church.

00:38:39.908 --> 00:38:40.800 align:middle line:90%
It's all religions.

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:41.910 align:middle line:84%
It's all institutions
that control.

00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:43.909 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: You can go
into primitive cultures,

00:38:43.909 --> 00:38:46.560 align:middle line:84%
for example-- so-called
primitive cultures-- which

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:50.900 align:middle line:84%
have been called-- the
anthropological studies and so

00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:53.870 align:middle line:84%
forth really all
to me an operation

00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:56.222 align:middle line:84%
to convince us yet once
again that collectivism

00:38:56.222 --> 00:38:57.680 align:middle line:84%
is better than the
free individual.

00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:59.096 align:middle line:84%
It would be, look
at this society.

00:38:59.096 --> 00:39:02.450 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's all together
and one and so forth.

00:39:02.450 --> 00:39:04.622 align:middle line:84%
You have a dream in
one of these societies.

00:39:04.622 --> 00:39:06.580 align:middle line:84%
Go to sleep, and you have
a dream, you wake up,

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:07.860 align:middle line:90%
and you go, wow, strange.

00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And you go to the guy-- whoever
the guy is that interprets

00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:13.930 align:middle line:84%
the dreams-- and he's
going to tell you

00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:16.370 align:middle line:84%
that every single thing in
that dream and every symbol

00:39:16.370 --> 00:39:20.750 align:middle line:84%
is somehow magically
illustrative of the doctrine

00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:22.360 align:middle line:90%
of the tribe.

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:25.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's the only thing
you can relate that dream to.

00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:26.470 align:middle line:90%
And you go, thank you.

00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:28.870 align:middle line:90%
Now I understand.

00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:30.840 align:middle line:84%
Is that mind control or
is that mind control?

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:33.720 align:middle line:84%
You think these
societies are free?

00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:34.337 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:39:34.337 --> 00:39:36.170 align:middle line:84%
A person goes all through
their lives having

00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:38.130 align:middle line:84%
these incredible
dreams, and they're all

00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:40.447 align:middle line:84%
interpreted according
to this doctrine.

00:39:40.447 --> 00:39:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so that
brings me to something else.

00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:44.420 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't really thought
about asking you,

00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:49.820 align:middle line:84%
but might this have to do with
the popularity at this point

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:53.290 align:middle line:84%
in time-- not just
popularity-- people are having

00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:57.260 align:middle line:84%
transformative experiences
under psychotropic drugs,

00:39:57.260 --> 00:40:00.960 align:middle line:84%
such as ayahuasca, where--
what happens there?

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:01.720 align:middle line:90%
I haven't done it.

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:03.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I haven't
been to the jungle--

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.410 align:middle line:90%
haven't done psychotropics.

00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:06.130 align:middle line:84%
Is anyone interpreting
anything there,

00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:09.330 align:middle line:84%
or are these your things
to interpret for yourself.

00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:11.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm just tossing that out there.

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:12.820 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: I've
heard it both ways.

00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:14.390 align:middle line:84%
Now Westerners, I
think, some of them

00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:17.340 align:middle line:84%
go there-- they're fairly
independent-minded.

00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:19.070 align:middle line:84%
So somebody tells
them, this is what

00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:21.630 align:middle line:84%
it means-- they're not
going to go for it.

00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:22.684 align:middle line:90%
But others will.

00:40:22.684 --> 00:40:23.600 align:middle line:90%
Because others-- what?

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:24.672 align:middle line:90%
What's going on here?

00:40:24.672 --> 00:40:25.630 align:middle line:90%
And they get the story.

00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:26.847 align:middle line:90%
Here's the story.

00:40:26.847 --> 00:40:28.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was just
wondering if that

00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:30.470 align:middle line:84%
might be a breakaway
in some cases,

00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:32.070 align:middle line:84%
but I want to
continue on and blow

00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:35.430 align:middle line:84%
past that, because just as you
had people-- the priests-- who

00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:39.030 align:middle line:84%
considered themselves above
even their own creator, God,

00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:43.450 align:middle line:84%
in the hierarchy, you
also had Giordano Bruno.

00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:44.790 align:middle line:90%
Can you talk about this man?

00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:46.373 align:middle line:84%
What a beautiful--
he was an ex-priest

00:40:46.373 --> 00:40:49.280 align:middle line:84%
in the 1500s-- beautiful,
beautiful being.

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.329 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: Giordano.

00:40:50.329 --> 00:40:51.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: An illuminated being.

00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:54.670 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about what he was
trying to bring to the table

00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:57.250 align:middle line:84%
and tell the people
and tell the church.

00:40:57.250 --> 00:41:00.380 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: Bruno was
part of the church--

00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:03.530 align:middle line:84%
you know, priest and so forth--
but unfortunately, the man was

00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:05.110 align:middle line:90%
a poet.

00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:07.480 align:middle line:84%
That's basically what
he was-- was a poet.

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:09.430 align:middle line:90%
And he was a philosophical poet.

00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:13.000 align:middle line:84%
So he began to imagine--
and in the book

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.280 align:middle line:84%
I have a number of
quotes from him--

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:18.600 align:middle line:84%
but the idea was that
he began to imagine

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:21.670 align:middle line:90%
unique and individual souls.

00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:26.800 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the person
that you are-- a unique you--

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:32.090 align:middle line:84%
eternal, never really
perishes, never goes away,

00:41:32.090 --> 00:41:34.470 align:middle line:90%
goes on and on into the future.

00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:38.020 align:middle line:90%
Me-- another unique soul.

00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:39.250 align:middle line:90%
And the same thing.

00:41:39.250 --> 00:41:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And he begins to write about
this in some wonderful ways.

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:48.250 align:middle line:84%
The idea of rays
of energy or light

00:41:48.250 --> 00:41:51.770 align:middle line:84%
as indicating your
future and my future.

00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:55.570 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, they never
interfere with each other.

00:41:55.570 --> 00:41:59.180 align:middle line:90%
And yet, we are in touch.

00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:01.870 align:middle line:84%
So you have the
best of both worlds.

00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:04.220 align:middle line:84%
This is not a
collectivism nightmare

00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:08.030 align:middle line:84%
that winds up in the soup,
nor is it so isolated

00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:12.040 align:middle line:84%
that we're like frozen
hamburgers forever

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:14.100 align:middle line:90%
in the Arctic, separate.

00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:18.050 align:middle line:84%
But we are each unique,
meaning we are not the same.

00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:19.800 align:middle line:84%
He recognized
this, and he talked

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:22.750 align:middle line:90%
about eternal individual souls.

00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:25.934 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the church had
to absolutely destroy him.

00:42:25.934 --> 00:42:27.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It didn't go well.

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:29.680 align:middle line:84%
I'll read from your book again.
"For his trouble, his wisdom,

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:31.960 align:middle line:84%
his great spirit,
and his poetry, Bruno

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:33.910 align:middle line:84%
was stripped naked,
tied to a stake,

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:35.920 align:middle line:84%
and taken to the Square
of Flowers in Rome

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:38.930 align:middle line:84%
on Saturday, February
19, 1600, where

00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:41.910 align:middle line:90%
the church burned him alive."

00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:45.160 align:middle line:84%
That's what happens
to individuality--

00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:47.422 align:middle line:90%
pure creative force.

00:42:47.422 --> 00:42:48.880 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: That
was the message--

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:50.210 align:middle line:90%
we will not stand for this.

00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:51.770 align:middle line:90%
That was the church's message.

00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And that is-- The
message, in a way,

00:42:56.310 --> 00:43:00.610 align:middle line:84%
still-- except a lot of water
has gone under the bridge.

00:43:00.610 --> 00:43:04.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have to go back
to Thomas Paine, Declaration

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:07.530 align:middle line:84%
of Independence, Articles
of Confederation,

00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:09.950 align:middle line:84%
The Constitution,
The Bill of Rights--

00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:13.830 align:middle line:84%
there were people who were
conscious in those days.

00:43:13.830 --> 00:43:16.550 align:middle line:84%
John Locke, one of
the great influencers

00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:19.650 align:middle line:84%
of these American founders,
who said, you know what?

00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:21.680 align:middle line:90%
No, wait a minute here.

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:24.240 align:middle line:84%
The individual is
the individual.

00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:26.180 align:middle line:84%
There's something that
we've recognized here

00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:28.990 align:middle line:84%
that's not the same
as it always has been.

00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:33.920 align:middle line:84%
We have emerged from
the "we" into the "I."

00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:38.810 align:middle line:84%
This is legitimate historical
change of consciousness.

00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:42.480 align:middle line:84%
Everything was we,
we, we, we, we, we,

00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:45.966 align:middle line:84%
and now we've recognized
there is an I,

00:43:45.966 --> 00:43:50.560 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to say that
this I has intrinsic freedom

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:53.490 align:middle line:90%
and power of choice.

00:43:53.490 --> 00:43:56.530 align:middle line:84%
Things are now going
to be different.

00:43:56.530 --> 00:44:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And for about 10 minutes
they were, until the powers

00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:03.240 align:middle line:84%
that be began to see
this for the true threat

00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:06.470 align:middle line:84%
that it was to the
collective because they--

00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:09.060 align:middle line:84%
the powers that be in the terms
of various secret societies--

00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:10.630 align:middle line:90%
run these collectives.

00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:12.930 align:middle line:84%
They promote these
collectives as,

00:44:12.930 --> 00:44:17.390 align:middle line:84%
don't you want to
help other people?

00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:19.820 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't you feel
guilty if you didn't?

00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:21.090 align:middle line:90%
And so forth and so on.

00:44:21.090 --> 00:44:25.590 align:middle line:84%
Do you really want to
stand alone and separate?

00:44:25.590 --> 00:44:30.320 align:middle line:84%
But the I emerging
from the we, to me,

00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:33.102 align:middle line:84%
is one of the great, great
things of the last-- let's

00:44:33.102 --> 00:44:35.490 align:middle line:90%
call it 1,000 years of history.

00:44:35.490 --> 00:44:36.660 align:middle line:90%
That struggle.

00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:41.205 align:middle line:84%
And now what we're
seeing is the reversal.

00:44:41.205 --> 00:44:43.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We are totally
seeing the reversal,

00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:47.010 align:middle line:84%
and though they're not burned
at the stake, what we find

00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:47.900 align:middle line:90%
is with the children.

00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:49.800 align:middle line:84%
This is when creativity
is still alive is

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:51.120 align:middle line:90%
the very beginning of our life.

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:54.320 align:middle line:84%
We come in with these
impulses and raw desires

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:57.380 align:middle line:84%
to experience, and
play, and learn, and be,

00:44:57.380 --> 00:45:01.360 align:middle line:84%
which are quickly fashioned
into something else.

00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:04.160 align:middle line:90%
And now we simply drug them.

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:06.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we don't have time to
get in that whole discussion.

00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:09.790 align:middle line:84%
We know about this-- huge
percentages of children

00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:12.020 align:middle line:84%
now on really
mood-altering drugs

00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:14.380 align:middle line:84%
to keep them quiet
and submissive,

00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:17.310 align:middle line:84%
to sit still in class and
go along with the program.

00:45:17.310 --> 00:45:20.050 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about a
new kind of education,

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:23.960 align:middle line:84%
because I know this is something
that's near and dear to you.

00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:25.930 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: It's the
education of imagination

00:45:25.930 --> 00:45:28.170 align:middle line:84%
of the individual--
of the child.

00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:29.590 align:middle line:90%
The child creates.

00:45:29.590 --> 00:45:30.930 align:middle line:90%
The child imagines.

00:45:30.930 --> 00:45:33.600 align:middle line:84%
That's what's happening
when the child plays games

00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:41.280 align:middle line:84%
with other children who have
some degree of civility.

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:44.230 align:middle line:84%
Some degree-- enough
to play a game,

00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:48.870 align:middle line:84%
and change roles, and imagine,
and fantasize, and so forth.

00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:57.260 align:middle line:84%
If the parents don't interfere--
if the parent somehow feels

00:45:57.260 --> 00:46:00.330 align:middle line:84%
a paucity of imagination
in their own life--

00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:01.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which
they all do by now,

00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:03.130 align:middle line:90%
by the time they're that age.

00:46:03.130 --> 00:46:03.450 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: --tough.

00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:04.120 align:middle line:90%
Tough.

00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:06.240 align:middle line:90%
Figure it out on your own.

00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:09.360 align:middle line:84%
Don't put it on the
back of the kid, okay.

00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:14.100 align:middle line:84%
Don't force the kid to remedy
your lack of imagination.

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:15.477 align:middle line:90%
You figure it out on your own.

00:46:15.477 --> 00:46:17.310 align:middle line:84%
There's plenty of ways
an adult can do this,

00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:19.460 align:middle line:84%
but the kid has
his own strategies.

00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:23.387 align:middle line:84%
The book is Summerhill--
that's the book-- A.S.

00:46:23.387 --> 00:46:27.310 align:middle line:84%
Neill-- a school that
he founded in 1920,

00:46:27.310 --> 00:46:30.840 align:middle line:84%
I believe, in London,
with the notion

00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:35.280 align:middle line:84%
that if a child could really
play out all of his fantasies,

00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:39.070 align:middle line:84%
if this were theoretically
possible, in a nonthreatening

00:46:39.070 --> 00:46:43.730 align:middle line:84%
environment, that eventually
he would feel satisfied

00:46:43.730 --> 00:46:46.950 align:middle line:84%
and he would come to
education on his own.

00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:50.619 align:middle line:84%
What a revolutionary
concept that was.

00:46:50.619 --> 00:46:52.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you can
feel the truth in it.

00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:53.130 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: And it worked.

00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:54.850 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it worked fantastically.

00:46:54.850 --> 00:46:57.450 align:middle line:84%
And it proved-- first of
all, the thing that I loved

00:46:57.450 --> 00:47:00.040 align:middle line:84%
about A.S. Neill-- and I was
a teacher for several years,

00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:07.944 align:middle line:84%
enough to know how incredibly
hard that is-- Neil said, look,

00:47:07.944 --> 00:47:09.110 align:middle line:90%
I want people to understand.

00:47:09.110 --> 00:47:11.193 align:middle line:84%
Our school is not any
different than other schools

00:47:11.193 --> 00:47:13.100 align:middle line:84%
once a kid gets
in the classroom.

00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:16.080 align:middle line:84%
We don't try to
seduce the child,

00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:18.920 align:middle line:84%
make things interesting
for the child,

00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:21.990 align:middle line:84%
keep the child's
attention captured,

00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:25.600 align:middle line:84%
put things on the wall and
drop balloons from the ceiling

00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:28.670 align:middle line:84%
and make it all
strangely interesting

00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:31.640 align:middle line:84%
and fabulous so
that we can avoid

00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:34.740 align:middle line:84%
the things that the kids and the
teachers are trying to avoid,

00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:36.530 align:middle line:84%
which is reading,
writing, and arithmetic.

00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:39.780 align:middle line:84%
No, we teach those just like
anybody else would teach them,

00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:43.350 align:middle line:84%
with old-fashioned textbooks,
no flags or anything like that.

00:47:43.350 --> 00:47:45.840 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, though,
if the kid has really

00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:48.580 align:middle line:84%
lived through this
fantasy life prior

00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:50.540 align:middle line:84%
to coming in the
classroom-- what

00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:53.540 align:middle line:84%
we say is, don't come in
here unless you want to stay.

00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:54.930 align:middle line:90%
We don't want the flip-flop.

00:47:54.930 --> 00:47:58.220 align:middle line:84%
When you want to be
here, we're here.

00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:01.990 align:middle line:84%
So the kid could be 8, 9, 11--
he tells a story in Summerhill,

00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:05.820 align:middle line:84%
a kid of 15 shows up
in his office one day.

00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:09.650 align:middle line:84%
The kid has been-- this is a
school that you live and play

00:48:09.650 --> 00:48:11.470 align:middle line:90%
at, and so forth.

00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:13.630 align:middle line:84%
The kid has never
been in school.

00:48:13.630 --> 00:48:15.960 align:middle line:84%
He's been playing
since he's however--

00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:17.640 align:middle line:90%
And he finally comes into Neill.

00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:19.080 align:middle line:90%
And Neill is not a pushover.

00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:21.170 align:middle line:84%
He's not like, oh,
we love everybody.

00:48:21.170 --> 00:48:23.314 align:middle line:84%
Neil is kind of a stern
schoolmaster-type.

00:48:23.314 --> 00:48:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And he says, yes,
what can I do for you?

00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And he says, well, sir
I want to go to school.

00:48:27.590 --> 00:48:28.960 align:middle line:90%
Well, OK.

00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:30.840 align:middle line:84%
You realize, of
course, you're going

00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:32.090 align:middle line:90%
to have a tough road to hoe.

00:48:32.090 --> 00:48:33.730 align:middle line:84%
Yes, well, I want
to be an engineer.

00:48:33.730 --> 00:48:36.992 align:middle line:84%
Well, you're going to have to
finish-- in two or three years,

00:48:36.992 --> 00:48:38.700 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
to finish everything

00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:39.670 align:middle line:84%
all the way up
through high school.

00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:41.086 align:middle line:84%
Yes, sir, I'm
prepared to do that.

00:48:41.086 --> 00:48:42.560 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:43.960 align:middle line:90%
Be off with you.

00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:45.880 align:middle line:90%
Kid goes to school-- bang!

00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:47.355 align:middle line:84%
Does all of the
work from scratch

00:48:47.355 --> 00:48:50.790 align:middle line:84%
to graduating high school
in two or three years.

00:48:50.790 --> 00:48:51.300 align:middle line:90%
Bingo!

00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:54.410 align:middle line:84%
Gets a degree, has a job
in a company in London.

00:48:54.410 --> 00:48:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And one day, he's called into
the office of the boss, who

00:48:57.820 --> 00:49:01.760 align:middle line:84%
says to him, you know
son, or whatever,

00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:04.260 align:middle line:84%
what makes you different
from all the other people who

00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:05.284 align:middle line:90%
work for me?

00:49:05.284 --> 00:49:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And the kid looks
straight at him.

00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:10.230 align:middle line:84%
And he says, I'm
not afraid of you.

00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:11.440 align:middle line:90%
End of story.

00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:14.330 align:middle line:84%
This is the best
kind of kid that

00:49:14.330 --> 00:49:18.790 align:middle line:84%
was turned out by that school,
because the imagination-- it

00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:22.160 align:middle line:84%
wasn't a question of how do we
enlist the child's imagination,

00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:25.150 align:middle line:84%
it was that the child is all
imagination all the time.

00:49:25.150 --> 00:49:27.660 align:middle line:84%
So we just need to provide
a space in which this could

00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:29.580 align:middle line:84%
be acted out with
other children.

00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:31.800 align:middle line:84%
They will produce
roles and stage

00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:35.130 align:middle line:84%
plays of things you would
never understand as an adult,

00:49:35.130 --> 00:49:36.740 align:middle line:84%
and they will go
through all of this,

00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:40.400 align:middle line:84%
and each kid will drop out
when he's ready to come and do

00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:43.650 align:middle line:84%
this other thing we have
called classroom education.

00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:44.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:46.710 align:middle line:84%
In the Waldorf system-- my
son went through Waldorf,

00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:49.080 align:middle line:84%
and it was very similar
in the early stages.

00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:51.850 align:middle line:84%
It still is highly
structured, no doubt about it.

00:49:51.850 --> 00:49:54.240 align:middle line:84%
But it's more of what
you're speaking of in that

00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:57.750 align:middle line:84%
the very early years, especially
kindergarten, which oftentimes

00:49:57.750 --> 00:49:59.860 align:middle line:84%
the kids will do two
years of kindergarten

00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:03.890 align:middle line:84%
in these beautiful,
whimsical, beautiful rooms

00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:05.540 align:middle line:90%
with all sorts of things.

00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:08.470 align:middle line:84%
They can pretend to be a
knight in shining armor,

00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:11.510 align:middle line:84%
they can pretend to cook, and
they have little sandboxes,

00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:14.620 align:middle line:84%
they can be a truck
driver-- but they play,

00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:17.950 align:middle line:84%
and they act in
plays and role model

00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:20.510 align:middle line:84%
for themselves whatever
they like and imagine

00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:22.300 align:middle line:90%
for the first couple years.

00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And then, even after that,
into the next three years

00:50:24.670 --> 00:50:26.620 align:middle line:84%
or so, they're not
really encouraged

00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:28.150 align:middle line:90%
to do a lot of academics.

00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:30.670 align:middle line:84%
It's still learning
through storytelling.

00:50:30.670 --> 00:50:32.894 align:middle line:84%
And they're cutting the
corners off the pages, which

00:50:32.894 --> 00:50:34.310 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people
think, why do they

00:50:34.310 --> 00:50:35.780 align:middle line:90%
cut the corners off the pages?

00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:40.910 align:middle line:84%
Which is to simply
prevent linear thinking

00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:42.240 align:middle line:90%
at too early an age.

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:45.100 align:middle line:84%
So it's rounded off, so
the mind stays very fluid

00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:45.890 align:middle line:90%
and moves around.

00:50:45.890 --> 00:50:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And I always found that
the most beautiful thing.

00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:50.390 align:middle line:84%
But as a parent, even
still, my friends

00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:52.400 align:middle line:90%
had their kids in other schools.

00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:54.650 align:middle line:84%
It could be public school,
charter schools-- whatever

00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:57.290 align:middle line:84%
school they were in, they
were ahead of my son.

00:50:57.290 --> 00:50:59.627 align:middle line:84%
My son didn't learn
to read and do math

00:50:59.627 --> 00:51:01.460 align:middle line:84%
as quickly as their
children, and I thought,

00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:04.557 align:middle line:84%
oh, gosh, he's having a
blast, he's loving it,

00:51:04.557 --> 00:51:05.640 align:middle line:90%
he's resonating with this.

00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:07.960 align:middle line:84%
I hope I'm doing the
right thing for him.

00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And the parents
start getting sucked

00:51:10.070 --> 00:51:12.600 align:middle line:84%
into this, because of
the way we were treated

00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:16.410 align:middle line:84%
in the decisions that
were made on our behalf.

00:51:16.410 --> 00:51:19.300 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: The
parent feels that they

00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:21.520 align:middle line:84%
can't allow somebody
else to be free

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:22.990 align:middle line:90%
because they were not free.

00:51:22.990 --> 00:51:25.750 align:middle line:84%
Neil says this over and
over again in his book.

00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's part of this
whole idea of creative life--

00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:33.560 align:middle line:84%
living the creative
life, imagining

00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:38.000 align:middle line:84%
what it is that you want to
imagine and expressing it.

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.410 align:middle line:84%
What could be more
exciting than this?

00:51:40.410 --> 00:51:42.030 align:middle line:84%
Except people
feel, no I can't do

00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:44.390 align:middle line:84%
that because I don't
want to allow myself

00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:47.340 align:middle line:84%
that kind of freedom, because
it wasn't allowed to me.

00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:51.050 align:middle line:84%
It's the non-freedom passed on
from generation to generation

00:51:51.050 --> 00:51:51.970 align:middle line:90%
down the line.

00:51:51.970 --> 00:51:55.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, at some point,
you have to say, no.

00:51:55.110 --> 00:51:56.740 align:middle line:84%
This is not the way
it's going to be.

00:51:56.740 --> 00:51:59.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
live an unfree life.

00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to have
my kid live an unfree life.

00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:04.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to supervise
this kid to death.

00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:08.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to put so much
on his head, and his time,

00:52:08.070 --> 00:52:10.630 align:middle line:84%
and his effort that he
feels that I'm always

00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:13.170 align:middle line:84%
looking over his shoulder,
protecting him and taking care

00:52:13.170 --> 00:52:15.840 align:middle line:84%
of him all the time, and
scheduling his life out,

00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:17.040 align:middle line:90%
and all of this.

00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:19.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to suck
life out of this child

00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:25.320 align:middle line:84%
just because it would satisfy my
inhibition about freedom to do

00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:26.670 align:middle line:90%
so.

00:52:26.670 --> 00:52:27.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well said.

00:52:27.610 --> 00:52:28.390 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:52:28.390 --> 00:52:30.980 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: I'm not
going to do that.

00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:34.220 align:middle line:84%
I'll never forget a
good friend of mine.

00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:37.600 align:middle line:84%
Her son was born in
1961 in New York.

00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:39.600 align:middle line:84%
He's a good friend
of mine still.

00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:42.440 align:middle line:90%


00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:45.760 align:middle line:84%
And I said to her once, how
did you raise such a great kid?

00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:46.989 align:middle line:90%
She's my age.

00:52:46.989 --> 00:52:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well,
one day we were walking

00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:51.940 align:middle line:84%
on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan,
right next to the park,

00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:55.150 align:middle line:84%
and there was a low wall
there-- a stone wall--

00:52:55.150 --> 00:52:58.420 align:middle line:84%
and he was just three
or whatever-- two.

00:52:58.420 --> 00:53:00.890 align:middle line:90%
He got up on the wall.

00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:02.520 align:middle line:90%
And she said, oh, yi yi.

00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:04.450 align:middle line:90%
And everybody's looking.

00:53:04.450 --> 00:53:07.060 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's looking at
her all of a sudden.

00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:08.020 align:middle line:90%
They're looking.

00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:09.780 align:middle line:90%
The kid is walking on the wall.

00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:11.210 align:middle line:90%
He's 2 and 1/2 years old.

00:53:11.210 --> 00:53:12.260 align:middle line:90%
And everybody's looking.

00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:13.509 align:middle line:90%
What's the mother going to do?

00:53:13.509 --> 00:53:15.500 align:middle line:84%
And she said, it was
the moment of choice.

00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:18.910 align:middle line:84%
She said, I knew this
kid was independent that

00:53:18.910 --> 00:53:20.519 align:middle line:90%
had come into the world.

00:53:20.519 --> 00:53:21.560 align:middle line:90%
So what am I going to do?

00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:23.345 align:middle line:84%
I'm either gonna let
him stay on the wall,

00:53:23.345 --> 00:53:24.553 align:middle line:90%
or I'm going to take him off.

00:53:24.553 --> 00:53:26.120 align:middle line:90%
And she said, screw it.

00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:28.890 align:middle line:90%
He stays on the wall.

00:53:28.890 --> 00:53:30.780 align:middle line:90%
He walked along the wall.

00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:32.770 align:middle line:90%
He didn't fall down.

00:53:32.770 --> 00:53:33.900 align:middle line:90%
People looked at her.

00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:34.692 align:middle line:90%
She looked at them.

00:53:34.692 --> 00:53:36.274 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they're
probably judging

00:53:36.274 --> 00:53:37.664 align:middle line:90%
her-- what a terrible mother.

00:53:37.664 --> 00:53:38.330 align:middle line:90%
Terrible mother.

00:53:38.330 --> 00:53:38.620 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: Are you kidding?

00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:39.980 align:middle line:90%
You bet.

00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:41.870 align:middle line:90%
She payed it no mind.

00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:42.900 align:middle line:90%
They all walked on.

00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:44.150 align:middle line:90%
She walked through the leaves.

00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:45.790 align:middle line:90%
The kid walked on the wall.

00:53:45.790 --> 00:53:47.220 align:middle line:90%
Everything was all right.

00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:50.680 align:middle line:84%
His life turned out to be,
in many respects, fantastic,

00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:54.560 align:middle line:84%
just because his mother
said that's who he is.

00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:56.060 align:middle line:90%
He's free.

00:53:56.060 --> 00:53:57.700 align:middle line:90%
He's free.

00:53:57.700 --> 00:54:01.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We have so
little faith in ourselves

00:54:01.570 --> 00:54:03.170 align:middle line:90%
as a species.

00:54:03.170 --> 00:54:07.027 align:middle line:84%
So little faith that we
have any innate knowledge,

00:54:07.027 --> 00:54:08.110 align:middle line:90%
that we can take care of--

00:54:08.110 --> 00:54:09.651 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: Or
capacity or anything.

00:54:09.651 --> 00:54:11.090 align:middle line:90%
So this is what takes the place.

00:54:11.090 --> 00:54:15.312 align:middle line:84%
All of this religious stuff
that we consider to be,

00:54:15.312 --> 00:54:16.780 align:middle line:90%
oh, it's so sacred.

00:54:16.780 --> 00:54:18.490 align:middle line:84%
This is the substitute
that's rolled in.

00:54:18.490 --> 00:54:21.910 align:middle line:84%
OK, boys, they can't handle
the real stuff, so wheel

00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:25.150 align:middle line:84%
in the stage-- the
facade-- and everything.

00:54:25.150 --> 00:54:27.150 align:middle line:84%
OK, see now, you're
inferior, you're guilty,

00:54:27.150 --> 00:54:27.990 align:middle line:84%
you don't know
what you're doing.

00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:29.448 align:middle line:84%
You're not free,
you never will be.

00:54:29.448 --> 00:54:31.010 align:middle line:90%
You've got so many problems.

00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:33.470 align:middle line:90%
And up here is the answer.

00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:35.220 align:middle line:84%
How do we want to play
the myth this time?

00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:37.094 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do it
this way with the thing.

00:54:37.094 --> 00:54:39.000 align:middle line:84%
Bring the lights
over, tell the story,

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.670 align:middle line:84%
rope them all in, and
then to the collective,

00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:43.546 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to call
it sacred this, that,

00:54:43.546 --> 00:54:44.378 align:middle line:90%
and the other thing.

00:54:44.378 --> 00:54:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And they're going
to have to buy it.

00:54:46.030 --> 00:54:48.280 align:middle line:84%
And anybody that
doesn't buy it, people

00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:50.160 align:middle line:84%
are going to point
fingers at 'em.

00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:52.440 align:middle line:84%
They're going to say,
you son of Satan,

00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:55.850 align:middle line:84%
we knew why we didn't like you--
because you're not Christian,

00:54:55.850 --> 00:54:59.770 align:middle line:84%
or you're not Jewish, or you're
not this, or you're not that.

00:54:59.770 --> 00:55:03.840 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, bring that on, because
we've got to enforce the myth.

00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:05.610 align:middle line:84%
This is the substitute
for what we're

00:55:05.610 --> 00:55:08.650 align:middle line:84%
talking about here, which
is the free, creative life

00:55:08.650 --> 00:55:09.930 align:middle line:90%
of the individual.

00:55:09.930 --> 00:55:12.340 align:middle line:90%
That's what spiritual means.

00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:13.960 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
take that far enough,

00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:17.380 align:middle line:84%
when you're creating intensely
enough, when you're imagining

00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:21.340 align:middle line:84%
your life intensely enough,
when you're spontaneous enough,

00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:23.720 align:middle line:84%
all the spiritual questions
you've ever had in your life

00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:25.410 align:middle line:90%
are spontaneously answered.

00:55:25.410 --> 00:55:26.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:55:26.310 --> 00:55:26.960 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: Right?

00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:28.168 align:middle line:90%
That's when the answers come.

00:55:28.168 --> 00:55:31.040 align:middle line:84%
It's not, oh, let me
read again the text

00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:34.500 align:middle line:90%
of the blah hobby-hobby-knobby.

00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:35.000 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:36.799 align:middle line:84%
I mean, those are
somebody's answers.

00:55:36.799 --> 00:55:37.840 align:middle line:90%
And that's another thing.

00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:41.130 align:middle line:84%
They were somebody's answers
sometime in the past.

00:55:41.130 --> 00:55:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And that person was--
guess what-- an artist.

00:55:43.390 --> 00:55:44.665 align:middle line:90%
That's what he was.

00:55:44.665 --> 00:55:45.540 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't a preacher.

00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:49.020 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't preaching 20
centuries into the future.

00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:51.330 align:middle line:84%
People will remember
my words 20-- No.

00:55:51.330 --> 00:55:52.620 align:middle line:90%
He was creating something.

00:55:52.620 --> 00:55:54.050 align:middle line:90%
This was his art.

00:55:54.050 --> 00:55:56.290 align:middle line:84%
He built a stone and
he inscribed on it

00:55:56.290 --> 00:55:58.640 align:middle line:90%
because that was his art.

00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And he saw reality that way,
and super reality, and so on.

00:56:01.970 --> 00:56:03.170 align:middle line:90%
And that's what he did.

00:56:03.170 --> 00:56:05.490 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, people came
along and said oh, this

00:56:05.490 --> 00:56:08.390 align:middle line:84%
is the oo-blah-dee
of the goo-ba-da.

00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:11.020 align:middle line:84%
This is part of the myth
we've been looking for.

00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:11.860 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:13.460 align:middle line:90%
It has nothing to do with that.

00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:15.680 align:middle line:84%
These people are supposed
to build their own stones

00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:20.590 align:middle line:84%
and inscribe their own things on
the stone-- or build whatever.

00:56:20.590 --> 00:56:21.580 align:middle line:90%
That's the idea.

00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:23.090 align:middle line:90%
That's what's been lost.

00:56:23.090 --> 00:56:25.650 align:middle line:84%
And instead, we get this
half-cocked business.

00:56:25.650 --> 00:56:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And you have people
running around trying

00:56:28.050 --> 00:56:30.220 align:middle line:90%
to police other people.

00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:32.030 align:middle line:84%
The internet is
just rife with it.

00:56:32.030 --> 00:56:35.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, don't read him, because
he's a satanic zappity-zoo.

00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:36.960 align:middle line:90%
You know that, don't you?

00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:37.520 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:39.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, do read him,
because he's a so-and-so.

00:56:39.790 --> 00:56:41.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:56:41.180 --> 00:56:44.030 align:middle line:84%
Classifying, profiling--
talk about profiling.

00:56:44.030 --> 00:56:46.910 align:middle line:84%
People are profiling
each other to death.

00:56:46.910 --> 00:56:48.930 align:middle line:84%
It all comes down to
their own lack of freedom,

00:56:48.930 --> 00:56:52.450 align:middle line:84%
their own lack of creativity,
their own lack of spontaneity--

00:56:52.450 --> 00:56:54.100 align:middle line:84%
what Richard Jenkins
was talking about.

00:56:54.100 --> 00:56:56.005 align:middle line:84%
And the last thing
that happened was I

00:56:56.005 --> 00:56:58.380 align:middle line:84%
saw him heal so many
people that I finally

00:56:58.380 --> 00:56:59.490 align:middle line:90%
said, I get it, Richard.

00:56:59.490 --> 00:57:01.340 align:middle line:90%
I know what you're doing.

00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:04.780 align:middle line:84%
You're just creating what you
want to create in the moment.

00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:06.860 align:middle line:84%
You don't have any fear
about the consequences.

00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:08.170 align:middle line:90%
He said, that's exactly right.

00:57:08.170 --> 00:57:10.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's what
this message is to us.

00:57:10.170 --> 00:57:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
assume-- like I said,

00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:14.190 align:middle line:84%
I haven't gone through
the CD set yet,

00:57:14.190 --> 00:57:16.450 align:middle line:84%
but I assume that's what
The Matrix Revealed is,

00:57:16.450 --> 00:57:19.362 align:middle line:84%
and in spades, I think you take
it to another level with that.

00:57:19.362 --> 00:57:21.320 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPOPORT: Another
level-- the nuts and bolts

00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:25.120 align:middle line:84%
of how this matrix
is put together.

00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:27.674 align:middle line:84%
It's certainly in conjunction
with this book, yes.

00:57:27.674 --> 00:57:29.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: On that note, I
want to thank you so much.

00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:31.640 align:middle line:84%
We're out of time,
and this has just

00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:33.100 align:middle line:90%
been a fascinating conversation.

00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:33.820 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPOPORT: I loved it myself.

00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:34.704 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:57:34.704 --> 00:57:35.370 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:57:35.370 --> 00:57:36.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:38.860 align:middle line:84%
I hope this conversation
has been elucidating

00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:42.149 align:middle line:84%
and has given you just cause
for questioning everything anew.

00:57:42.149 --> 00:57:43.690 align:middle line:84%
As parents, we owe
it to our children

00:57:43.690 --> 00:57:45.820 align:middle line:84%
to give them the
power of creativity.

00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:48.522 align:middle line:84%
In doing so, they will
create a better world.

00:57:48.522 --> 00:57:50.980 align:middle line:84%
