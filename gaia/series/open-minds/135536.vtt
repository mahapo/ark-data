00:00:27.891 --> 00:00:29.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Follow the money.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.509 align:middle line:10%
It's true in nearly every aspect
of life that challenges us

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.200 align:middle line:10%
as a civilization.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.130 align:middle line:84%
The forces that operate from a
place of greed stop at nothing

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.350 align:middle line:84%
to control our fate,
including blanketing

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.579 align:middle line:84%
our skies with noxious
chemicals called chemtrails.

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:44.120 align:middle line:84%
What does that have
to do with money?

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.994 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's find out.

00:00:44.994 --> 00:00:46.610 align:middle line:84%
Scott Stevens is
with us once again

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.920 align:middle line:84%
to look at the hidden
motivations of muddying

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.960 align:middle line:90%
our skies with these chemtrails.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And this is a little
different conversation,

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.790 align:middle line:84%
but people responded so well
to the last one, they said,

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.350 align:middle line:90%
bring him on-- part two.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.640 align:middle line:84%
And so your life has really
been following lately

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.860 align:middle line:90%
the part two of it.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.230 align:middle line:84%
Contending with the
repercussions of what

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.659 align:middle line:90%
has been done.

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:09.200 align:middle line:84%
But before we do
that, can we go back

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.030 align:middle line:84%
for people that haven't seen
part one for just a minute?

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT STEVENS: Yeah.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.200 align:middle line:90%
Anything you'd like.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.760 align:middle line:90%
20 years as a weather man.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.230 align:middle line:84%
You're trying to forecast
the weather, but not possible

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:20.030 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.154 align:middle line:84%
Just tell us what that was
like, because I wondered

00:01:22.154 --> 00:01:23.450 align:middle line:90%
about you guys back then.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.980 align:middle line:84%
How do you do that
with chemtrails?

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.410 align:middle line:10%
>>STEVENS: I wondered
about us then, too.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:28.970 align:middle line:10%
I was really good.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.520 align:middle line:10%
And when you have storm
after storm after storm

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.150 align:middle line:10%
not behaving as the computer
models think they will,

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.150 align:middle line:10%
how the National Weather Service
fails forecast after forecast,

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.040 align:middle line:10%
and us as the last front
before-- I should say,

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.520 align:middle line:10%
the interface between the
station and the people.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.330 align:middle line:90%
We were responsible.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.320 align:middle line:84%
And it was in the
late '90s to all

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.940 align:middle line:84%
of the first part of the
2000s when I was on the air

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.210 align:middle line:84%
that it was very challenging
to forecast a storm.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.690 align:middle line:84%
Even here, where we are
in the Mountain West,

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.550 align:middle line:84%
and through the
summer monsoon, there

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.370 align:middle line:84%
were days where it
should have rained.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just within the
last two or three weeks.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:06.650 align:middle line:90%
And it didn't.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:07.880 align:middle line:90%
Time after time after time--

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.679 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And snow
falling in Miami.

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:10.970 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: What's up with that?

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.219 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's up with that?

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: But it was like
I-- throw your arms up.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.440 align:middle line:90%
I can't do this anymore.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to
be wrong because I

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.030 align:middle line:90%
can't talk about why I'm wrong.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.720 align:middle line:84%
If you are forbidden from
talking about geoengineering

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.250 align:middle line:84%
or weather manipulation,
then the responsibility

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.800 align:middle line:84%
for the failed forecasts
rests on the shoulders

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.057 align:middle line:90%
of the meteorologist.

00:02:32.057 --> 00:02:33.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you knew
about geoengineering.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.120 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: In time I did.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I did.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.080 align:middle line:84%
By 2004 it became very
apparent that there

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.651 align:middle line:84%
was something terribly
wrong with our weather.

00:02:41.651 --> 00:02:43.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did you ever
talk to management?

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.200 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Mm-hm.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.220 align:middle line:90%
Oh, they talked to me.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.890 align:middle line:90%
And so, what was that talk like?

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.430 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Because there was one
day that I kind of went public,

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.560 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, offered
up my credentials saying,

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.350 align:middle line:84%
yeah, what I am saying comes
from a position of knowledge.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.310 align:middle line:84%
A position of wisdom with
this field of science.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And it was that next day that
my general manager called me

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.766 align:middle line:84%
up and said, Scott,
what's going on?

00:03:10.766 --> 00:03:11.770 align:middle line:90%
Something's up.

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, you're very, very
valuable, but something's up.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.270 align:middle line:90%
And so I told them.

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.070 align:middle line:90%
I told them.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.444 align:middle line:84%
I said, this is
what's happening,

00:03:17.444 --> 00:03:21.560 align:middle line:84%
and this is my story, and I
kind of need to be true to this.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And he kind of
patted me on the back

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.730 align:middle line:90%
and said, OK, I'll honor that.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.550 align:middle line:90%
And just do it on your own time.

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:29.732 align:middle line:90%
And I was OK with that.

00:03:29.732 --> 00:03:31.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you
still were giving

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.190 align:middle line:90%
inaccurate forecasts, right?

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.440 align:middle line:84%
Or did you start taking into
account the geoengineering

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.060 align:middle line:84%
and say, OK, I can
make a forecast

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.920 align:middle line:90%
based on what they're spraying.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.150 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: No, not even that.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.733 align:middle line:84%
Because I didn't
know where the trails

00:03:45.733 --> 00:03:47.510 align:middle line:90%
fit into the scheme of things.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:48.720 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you must
have noticed patterns.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.364 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Of course I did.

00:03:51.364 --> 00:03:54.860 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know how they
interfaced with the failed

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.400 align:middle line:90%
forecasts.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.910 align:middle line:90%
That aha moment hadn't come yet.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.640 align:middle line:84%
I knew that there was
residence geometry being

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.430 align:middle line:84%
introduced into the atmosphere
to literally shear storms

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.230 align:middle line:90%
apart.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.040 align:middle line:84%
That HAARP was available to
re-ionize local areas of storms

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.380 align:middle line:84%
and literally take the
life out of a thunderstorm.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.300 align:middle line:84%
So instead of being all
bubbly and cauliflower-looking

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.779 align:middle line:84%
and aggressive, it becomes
this wimpy-looking ghost

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:22.430 align:middle line:90%
of its former self.

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's happened
in the last two decades?

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.280 align:middle line:90%
Three decades?

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And why the West has
had such a drought.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.420 align:middle line:84%
Why Australia has
had such a drought.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.290 align:middle line:84%
So they could use these
antennae, these array,

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.710 align:middle line:84%
these apparatuses that
may be underground,

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.450 align:middle line:84%
circling the Arctic and circling
the Southern Hemisphere,

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:43.250 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.260 align:middle line:84%
So they can from a
distance create action.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And then you dope
up the atmosphere

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.120 align:middle line:84%
with these particles
left over by the planes,

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.540 align:middle line:84%
and then you have grip
on the water molecule.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.790 align:middle line:84%
And so instead of the
cloud getting, yeah,

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.170 align:middle line:84%
let's all get together,
let's create a raindrop.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.910 align:middle line:84%
No, there's too much in the
way of condensation nuclei

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:03.090 align:middle line:90%
in the cloud.

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.160 align:middle line:84%
So we end up with lots
and lots of little drops.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.920 align:middle line:84%
And then if you could add an
electrical charge delivered

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.280 align:middle line:84%
via an aircraft, or from
a HAARP-like apparatus,

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.460 align:middle line:84%
or from a satellite--
all three are possible.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.700 align:middle line:84%
Then you've got three modes
of getting at the storm.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.280 align:middle line:84%
Either enhancing it,
saying, let's get together

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.470 align:middle line:84%
and then it's juiced up
and it becomes a tornado,

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.860 align:middle line:84%
or becomes a flood, or
it becomes a hurricane.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.410 align:middle line:90%
Or the inverse happens.

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:28.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In a drought.

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:29.881 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: And nothing happens.

00:05:29.881 --> 00:05:32.106 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And a lot
of this is detailed,

00:05:32.106 --> 00:05:33.480 align:middle line:84%
and I think it's
done quite well.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.105 align:middle line:84%
And why in the world
are they spraying?

00:05:35.105 --> 00:05:38.749 align:middle line:84%
In terms of looking at how
the spraying happens, where

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:40.290 align:middle line:84%
you start off the
coast of California

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.570 align:middle line:84%
to get an effect a few
days later in the Midwest.

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Or you
start in Japan.

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:44.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or you
start in Japan, right.

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.270 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And engineer
the whole Pacific.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.210 align:middle line:84%
But the point being if they
have the ability-- they do

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.550 align:middle line:84%
have the ability to
simply engineer weather

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.110 align:middle line:90%
wherever they wish now.

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.080 align:middle line:84%
So there are no
excuses for droughts,

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.310 align:middle line:90%
such as what California has had.

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.160 align:middle line:84%
So that starts getting
into some other really

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.100 align:middle line:84%
interesting-- but to me,
some of the most nefarious--

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.090 align:middle line:90%
parts of this agenda.

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:07.734 align:middle line:84%
And I want to say
right up front,

00:06:07.734 --> 00:06:09.900 align:middle line:84%
we are going to be looking
at the solutions in this.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.040 align:middle line:84%
This is not just going
to be ranting on.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.480 align:middle line:84%
But we need to see the
complexity of the issue first.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.210 align:middle line:90%
So, let's go into it.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.830 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: That was the whole
reason why I wanted to do this.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.630 align:middle line:84%
So we could get
public oversight.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:22.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:23.430 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:24.750 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Because if
there's nobody saying,

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:25.830 align:middle line:90%
what's going on here?

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.600 align:middle line:90%
Why are you doing this?

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.415 align:middle line:90%
They get a free pass.

00:06:29.415 --> 00:06:31.680 align:middle line:90%
And that's unacceptable.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They do, and they are.

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.470 align:middle line:84%
Because no one even
knows who "they" are.

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:35.850 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: No.

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:37.530 align:middle line:84%
But the only thing
I can say to that--

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.279 align:middle line:84%
and we'll get to the
solution at the end--

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:42.330 align:middle line:90%
is those who can afford it.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And when you have unlimited
funds at your behest,

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:48.930 align:middle line:84%
then things-- amazing
things-- can happen.

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:50.940 align:middle line:90%
It's just without oversight.

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.460 align:middle line:84%
Things can get rather
dark and rather ugly

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:54.647 align:middle line:90%
and rather nefarious.

00:06:54.647 --> 00:06:56.730 align:middle line:84%
There is another comment,
because you brought up--

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:59.220 align:middle line:84%
why in the world
are they spraying?

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And thank you, Michael,
for doing that work.

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:06.040 align:middle line:84%
But the point of the why
was never really addressed.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:06.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:07.640 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:10.830 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: It was largely--
not completely, but largely--

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.110 align:middle line:84%
a rehash of what's
in this stuff.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:14.700 align:middle line:90%
And its environmental impacts.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:15.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:16.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.440 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And so this is
where my aha moment came in.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.840 align:middle line:84%
Because as I was
on the air, seeing

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.747 align:middle line:84%
that we were dealing
with-- literally,

00:07:23.747 --> 00:07:25.830 align:middle line:84%
on the satellite imagery
you can see the patterns.

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:27.413 align:middle line:84%
You can see the
warming in the clouds.

00:07:27.413 --> 00:07:29.514 align:middle line:84%
You can see the
technology at work.

00:07:29.514 --> 00:07:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that
on-the-air meteorologists

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.930 align:middle line:84%
either are ignorant
of or are ignoring.

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:34.960 align:middle line:90%
It's one or the other.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:39.150 align:middle line:84%
There is really not
much middle ground.

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:41.940 align:middle line:84%
But how do you align
this technology?

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.160 align:middle line:90%
How do you target it?

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
the chemtrails are

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:51.660 align:middle line:84%
an exquisite, exquisite tool
in delivering these energies

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:54.790 align:middle line:84%
into the heart of a thunderstorm
or a line of thunderstorms.

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:57.390 align:middle line:84%
Is that you've got
to mark off and then

00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:01.560 align:middle line:84%
define how much of an impact
this technology has had.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And so you have a trail
which, despite the blue sky,

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:08.580 align:middle line:84%
persists from
horizon to horizon.

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:09.423 align:middle line:90%
Come on now.

00:08:09.423 --> 00:08:10.342 align:middle line:90%
Come on now!

00:08:10.342 --> 00:08:11.550 align:middle line:90%
It shouldn't be there at all.

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:13.620 align:middle line:84%
These engines are
engineered not to leave

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.540 align:middle line:90%
a trail in the first place.

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for that is so
condensation trails are not

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:23.325 align:middle line:84%
mixed up with the fake
trails, which are 99.8% of all

00:08:23.325 --> 00:08:24.410 align:middle line:90%
of the other trails.

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:25.565 align:middle line:90%
They're all fake.

00:08:25.565 --> 00:08:26.892 align:middle line:90%
Even the short ones.

00:08:26.892 --> 00:08:28.350 align:middle line:84%
Because if you look
at them and you

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:30.224 align:middle line:84%
happen to have one cross
in front of the sun,

00:08:30.224 --> 00:08:31.792 align:middle line:90%
you'll see a different color.

00:08:31.792 --> 00:08:33.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The rainbow effect.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.690 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Some are orange, some
are blue, and a few are white.

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:39.059 align:middle line:84%
But they all have different
chemical compositions,

00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:42.780 align:middle line:84%
depending on what
they're up there to do.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:45.210 align:middle line:84%
The size of the
particle left in.

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:48.300 align:middle line:84%
If they're meant to
literally smear out

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.700 align:middle line:84%
so you can see the waves that
are happening in the sky.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:54.540 align:middle line:84%
Because rarely will a
trail remain straight.

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:56.010 align:middle line:90%
It'll break.

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:57.300 align:middle line:90%
It'll twist.

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.912 align:middle line:84%
It'll smear and spread out
while a portion of it remains--

00:08:59.912 --> 00:09:01.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Feather out,
zigzag, all of it.

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:02.190 align:middle line:90%
Zippers.

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:02.367 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Yeah.

00:09:02.367 --> 00:09:02.545 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:02.545 --> 00:09:03.345 align:middle line:90%
Zip.

00:09:03.345 --> 00:09:04.650 align:middle line:90%
This will happen.

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:07.860 align:middle line:84%
All of that is simply there
to make these invisible waves,

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:10.500 align:middle line:84%
these invisible
technologies visible.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.560 align:middle line:84%
So the yahoos doing
it go, oh, yeah.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:13.360 align:middle line:90%
This one's working.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.700 align:middle line:90%
See, look at this.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:19.250 align:middle line:84%
And the most-- the reveal
for me was that once

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:22.770 align:middle line:84%
you see these anomalies or
perturbations showing up

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:25.020 align:middle line:84%
in the trails, and
another plane comes along.

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.470 align:middle line:84%
So, say we've had a trail
come along here and it breaks,

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:28.730 align:middle line:90%
turns off to one side.

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:32.780 align:middle line:84%
Another plane will come along,
hit that spot precisely,

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:36.310 align:middle line:84%
also at the angle that the
other trail is breaking off,

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:37.430 align:middle line:90%
or smearing.

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:38.960 align:middle line:90%
It's exquisite.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And you see this if-- you
know, everybody's phone,

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:43.640 align:middle line:84%
you can download
a time-lapse app.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.610 align:middle line:90%
Cheap. $2, $3 tops.

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:49.310 align:middle line:84%
Set it up on a tripod
on a chemtrail day.

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:51.950 align:middle line:84%
Every five seconds,
take a bloody picture.

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:55.490 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see this happen,
verifying for yourself

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:57.590 align:middle line:84%
that these flights
are not willy-nilly.

00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:59.560 align:middle line:84%
They're not random
scratch marks.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:00.620 align:middle line:90%
There's a precision.

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:02.355 align:middle line:84%
It is an exquisite
ballet in the sky.

00:10:02.355 --> 00:10:04.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I've even
seen them do U-turns.

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:05.410 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Me too.

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:06.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's like--

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:06.990 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: I left my luggage.

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:07.212 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --wait a minute.

00:10:07.212 --> 00:10:08.820 align:middle line:90%
That is not commercial flight.

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:09.890 align:middle line:90%
They don't do U-turns.

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:10.690 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: No.

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:13.540 align:middle line:84%
But then you can go to the
apps, like FlightAware.

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:16.130 align:middle line:90%
Or there are numerous apps.

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:18.530 align:middle line:84%
You can tap on the flight and
you see it there overhead.

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:21.050 align:middle line:84%
Then it tells you
Southwest flight number 595

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:23.180 align:middle line:90%
going from here to here.

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.520 align:middle line:90%
The plane turns around.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.670 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden that plane is
not going from here to there--

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:32.210 align:middle line:84%
it's taken on
another designation.

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:37.270 align:middle line:84%
And so this illusion
is that intense.

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:38.487 align:middle line:90%
It's that complete.

00:10:38.487 --> 00:10:40.070 align:middle line:84%
Because we're kind
of smart down here.

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:40.930 align:middle line:90%
And they're smart too.

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:42.971 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so let's go
back to the money part.

00:10:42.971 --> 00:10:45.220 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's go back to California.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:46.920 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Are you
sure you want to?

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, just
this one aspect of it.

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:53.570 align:middle line:84%
Why in the world would they
starve-- would an agenda

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:56.900 align:middle line:84%
starve California, the
breadbasket of this country,

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:58.510 align:middle line:90%
of water for years on end?

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:01.940 align:middle line:84%
Why would that happen when
the very reverse can also

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:03.230 align:middle line:90%
be affected?

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:08.680 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: What economic
benefit is there to abundance?

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.920 align:middle line:84%
It's only in shortages
is money made.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:15.460 align:middle line:84%
It's only in crises
where money is made.

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:18.790 align:middle line:84%
It's only disasters
where money is made.

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:22.180 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise you have
this flatlined economy.

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:24.370 align:middle line:84%
It's only in the wake
of a Sandy-type event--

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:26.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: One of
stability and abundance.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.470 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Mm-hm, and peace.

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:28.580 align:middle line:90%
And productivity.

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:29.380 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:31.360 align:middle line:84%
It's when the
biosphere, literally

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:37.090 align:middle line:84%
a slab between too hot, too
cold, too wet, and too dry.

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:40.210 align:middle line:84%
And then there's this little
bit of piece in between where

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:42.550 align:middle line:90%
a true productivity has.

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:45.280 align:middle line:90%
And so it's all about money.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And there's a
control thing, too.

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.450 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure there's some
really, really big egos

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:50.960 align:middle line:90%
involved, as well.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.700 align:middle line:84%
Because once they figure out
that they can do it-- why would

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:55.900 align:middle line:90%
we want to stop?

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Why would we want to
give that back up,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.470 align:middle line:84%
that process back
to Mother Nature

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:04.060 align:middle line:84%
when we're doing such a really
good job of owning the weather.

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And in the wake of World
War II, and, you know,

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.200 align:middle line:84%
is it going to be
clear on D-Day?

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.432 align:middle line:84%
Or can we see over
Dresden to bomb, or--

00:12:10.432 --> 00:12:11.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we
can understand why

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:13.681 align:middle line:84%
they would have
sequestered that technology

00:12:13.681 --> 00:12:14.907 align:middle line:90%
for their military advantage.

00:12:14.907 --> 00:12:16.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, like it or not,
they would do that, right?

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:18.407 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: 70 years
down the road?

00:12:18.407 --> 00:12:20.073 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: 70 years
down the road, right.

00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:20.890 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Really?

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:21.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And in the film, which you
were featured in prominently,

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:28.480 align:middle line:84%
one of the statements made
was that "weather modification

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:32.560 align:middle line:84%
is the ultimate weapon
of covert warfare"

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:36.530 align:middle line:84%
because of its ability to create
food shortages, and so forth.

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And what happens
with food shortages?

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:39.070 align:middle line:90%
Then you have unrest.

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:42.730 align:middle line:84%
Then you have people in fear,
and you have people revolting,

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:43.740 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:44.540 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.005 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Mm-hm, all of that.

00:12:46.005 --> 00:12:46.921 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All of that.

00:12:46.921 --> 00:12:48.634 align:middle line:84%
So that's just one
picture politically,

00:12:48.634 --> 00:12:50.800 align:middle line:84%
if you were going to use
it against another country,

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:54.200 align:middle line:84%
an enemy country, that you
can create that kind of unrest

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.657 align:middle line:90%
within their population.

00:12:56.657 --> 00:12:58.240 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
let's look at it

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.760 align:middle line:84%
from the point of the
disaster capitalist.

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:01.905 align:middle line:90%
Even in our own country--

00:13:01.905 --> 00:13:02.863 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Naomi Klein.

00:13:02.863 --> 00:13:05.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --what people
will do to our own people.

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:06.700 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
that at some length,

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:09.400 align:middle line:84%
because now we're getting into
the connection between this

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:11.144 align:middle line:84%
and follow the money,
and where we're

00:13:11.144 --> 00:13:12.310 align:middle line:90%
going to go with this story.

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:16.570 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And ultimately, if
you hand that technology off

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:21.012 align:middle line:84%
to corporations, then you
could have a government saying,

00:13:21.012 --> 00:13:23.740 align:middle line:90%
it's not us.

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:26.670 align:middle line:90%
And then there's deniability.

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:29.770 align:middle line:84%
Then, we're there
to rally the troops.

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:31.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the whole
purpose of 9/11

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:33.560 align:middle line:84%
was to get Bush's
approval ratings up

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.010 align:middle line:84%
to into the 90%
range-- and it worked--

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:39.040 align:middle line:84%
so we could go off adventuring
into the Middle East.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:44.980 align:middle line:84%
And so weather can be used as
an emotional turning point.

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:49.120 align:middle line:84%
If we have so many
disasters, then there's

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.470 align:middle line:90%
got to be a reason for them.

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And Lord knows it's
not geoengineering.

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:54.490 align:middle line:90%
No, we can't do that yet.

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:56.410 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's just
it's a pipe dream.

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:59.035 align:middle line:84%
Maybe something we'll invest in
in the future, but no, no, no,

00:13:59.035 --> 00:13:59.910 align:middle line:90%
we can't do that yet.

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:01.930 align:middle line:84%
So we all have to
quit driving our cars.

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:03.180 align:middle line:90%
We all have to drive Priuses.

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:06.310 align:middle line:84%
We have to, we have to,
and we have to, with CO2.

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:08.840 align:middle line:84%
No, no, and then we're all
going after wear masks,

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:11.710 align:middle line:84%
so we sequester our
CO2 because, you know,

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:13.060 align:middle line:90%
it's all about the CO2.

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:15.820 align:middle line:84%
You know, plants,
they're a problem too.

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:18.790 align:middle line:84%
So they've spun this
whole series of lies.

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:22.690 align:middle line:84%
The ultimate agenda
is a global tax.

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And if they can get
all of these countries

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:28.930 align:middle line:84%
to sign onto an accord,
a climate-change accord,

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:31.990 align:middle line:84%
then that gives them
access to water rights,

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:35.810 align:middle line:84%
atmospheric rights, pollution
rights, energy usage rights,

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:37.090 align:middle line:90%
health rights.

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:38.410 align:middle line:90%
All of these things.

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:42.160 align:middle line:84%
This is the one thing that
all of humanity has in common,

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.790 align:middle line:90%
is the planet.

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:46.180 align:middle line:84%
And if we turn the
planet against us,

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:50.160 align:middle line:84%
then we will use that as
the tool to tax everyone

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.989 align:middle line:90%
and to control all aspects of--

00:14:51.989 --> 00:14:53.405 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Carbon
credits and such.

00:14:53.405 --> 00:14:54.550 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Thank you.

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And then it becomes a whole
other medium for money

00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:00.490 align:middle line:90%
back into the machine.

00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:04.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, fair to say that
your take on global climate

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:07.360 align:middle line:84%
change is that they can tell
whatever story they want,

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.860 align:middle line:84%
depending on what they choose
to manipulate at a given time.

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:11.190 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's,
oh, it's cooling.

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:12.520 align:middle line:90%
Oops, no, it seems to be warm.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, over here it's warming,
over here it's cooling.

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:15.160 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Exactly.

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That it's all
a matter of manipulation.

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:17.830 align:middle line:90%
It's not organic.

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:20.260 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And it all-- the
people will believe what

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.880 align:middle line:90%
the mouthpiece of the machine--

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The media.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:25.720 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: --tells them.

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.370 align:middle line:84%
If we have a problem
with climate.

00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:30.820 align:middle line:84%
And in this regard I have
to applaud the Republicans

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:34.630 align:middle line:84%
in Congress for standing
up to the Democratic side

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:38.920 align:middle line:90%
of this illusion.

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:40.930 align:middle line:90%
Because climate always changes.

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:43.390 align:middle line:90%
It has never not changed.

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:44.350 align:middle line:90%
Just like the weather.

00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:46.300 align:middle line:90%
It changes.

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:47.859 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It
happens organically.

00:15:47.859 --> 00:15:49.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it goes
through these cycles,

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:52.112 align:middle line:84%
which has to do with solar
input and everything else.

00:15:52.112 --> 00:15:53.570 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And
orbital precession--

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:54.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:54.380 align:middle line:90%
All of it.

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:54.990 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: All of it.

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:55.120 align:middle line:90%
Sunspots--

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet
at the same time,

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:59.620 align:middle line:84%
we now have chemtrails
added to the mix, which is

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:01.330 align:middle line:90%
to change the climate at will.

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:05.410 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: So the question
is, what's really happening?

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:07.030 align:middle line:84%
If we're playing
with the weather,

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:10.540 align:middle line:84%
is the planet really
warming or is it cooling?

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:13.300 align:middle line:84%
And if the National Climatic
Data Center in Asheville, North

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:16.420 align:middle line:84%
Carolina has to truly
come in and seasonally

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:20.530 align:middle line:84%
adjust the data
aggressively to maintain

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:24.610 align:middle line:84%
the illusion of warming,
then what's really happening?

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:25.985 align:middle line:84%
Are we warming or
are we cooling?

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:26.785 align:middle line:90%
And then you have--

00:16:26.785 --> 00:16:28.119 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's really happening.

00:16:28.119 --> 00:16:29.618 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: For me
it's apparent-- we

00:16:29.618 --> 00:16:30.710 align:middle line:90%
ought to go to the sun.

00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:32.980 align:middle line:84%
All of the heat,
all of the energy,

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:35.800 align:middle line:84%
and essentially the
surface life of this planet

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.280 align:middle line:90%
is dependent on the sun.

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:38.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Totally.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:41.020 align:middle line:84%
So what happens when you cut
off huge percentages of that

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:43.030 align:middle line:84%
on a day-to-day
basis from the sun

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:46.010 align:middle line:84%
by blocking it with these
chemtrails and reflective

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:46.810 align:middle line:90%
metals?

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:47.726 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Two things.

00:16:47.726 --> 00:16:48.940 align:middle line:90%
Two things can happen.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:51.130 align:middle line:84%
Either you're reflecting
enough during the day

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:54.790 align:middle line:84%
to inhibit
photosynthesis, to inhibit

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:59.160 align:middle line:84%
the deployment of
solar photovoltaics,

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.090 align:middle line:84%
that you end up with
fallout that impacts

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:05.619 align:middle line:90%
the pH of soils and oceans.

00:17:05.619 --> 00:17:06.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And people.

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:09.069 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And we're just
dealing with the conductivity

00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:10.277 align:middle line:90%
in the atmosphere in general.

00:17:10.277 --> 00:17:12.660 align:middle line:90%
And this is still a side point.

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:14.890 align:middle line:84%
Because the main
issue is the sun.

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:18.155 align:middle line:84%
Right The main issue
always has been the sun.

00:17:18.155 --> 00:17:19.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I get that.

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:22.630 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And so it's
like there's this cliff.

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:24.855 align:middle line:84%
Either it's a warming
cliff or a cooling cliff

00:17:24.855 --> 00:17:27.490 align:middle line:90%
that they're trying to delay.

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:32.020 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, why spend the ungodly
sums of money that they have,

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:33.220 align:middle line:90%
to do this?

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:36.560 align:middle line:84%
And cloak it in such
intense secrecy?

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:39.160 align:middle line:84%
There's something
that they're hiding.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.480 align:middle line:90%
And it's big.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:43.210 align:middle line:90%
It's really, really big.

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you were to venture
to guess which-- that's what it

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:48.070 align:middle line:90%
would be, what would you think?

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:51.175 align:middle line:84%
Aside from the sheer potential
for massive amounts of profit.

00:17:51.175 --> 00:17:54.692 align:middle line:90%


00:17:54.692 --> 00:17:56.650 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Whatever they
tell you is happening,

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:58.225 align:middle line:84%
let's look at it from
the other point of view.

00:17:58.225 --> 00:17:59.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In reverse.

00:17:59.100 --> 00:17:59.920 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:01.212 align:middle line:90%
So if they say global warming--

00:18:01.212 --> 00:18:02.420 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: That's an ice age.

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:03.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --global cooling.

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:04.200 align:middle line:90%
It's an ice age.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.325 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: It's an ice age.

00:18:05.325 --> 00:18:07.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think that became
apparent in the '60s and '70s

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.666 align:middle line:84%
because that was
all the discussion.

00:18:09.666 --> 00:18:10.790 align:middle line:90%
There is an ice age coming.

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:11.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, there's an ice age coming.

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:13.978 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden in the
'80s-- no, no, no, no, no,

00:18:13.978 --> 00:18:14.920 align:middle line:90%
it's global warming.

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:19.600 align:middle line:84%
They had this technology to
delay the arrival of the cold.

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.600 align:middle line:84%
But now the sun is,
each solar cycle,

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.900 align:middle line:84%
the higher the peak, the
more energy, the more warmth

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:27.250 align:middle line:90%
coming from the sun.

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:32.020 align:middle line:84%
Each succeeding 22-year cycle
is increasingly shallow.

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:35.816 align:middle line:84%
And there is a beautiful,
beautiful solar physicist--

00:18:35.816 --> 00:18:37.690 align:middle line:84%
well, beautiful, you
know, it's all relative,

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:39.940 align:middle line:90%
beauty-- in England.

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And her model of
the magnetics that

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:48.150 align:middle line:84%
are happening sub-surface of the
sun, and also on the surface,

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:50.440 align:middle line:90%
are 99.x.

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:53.370 align:middle line:84%
They are very, very accurate
when you reverse engineer

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:54.620 align:middle line:90%
what's happening with the sun.

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, by 2030
we're in an ice age.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.590 align:middle line:84%
The question is, how
long does it last?

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:01.630 align:middle line:84%
Is it like the previous
cool spells that we've

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:02.890 align:middle line:90%
had in previous centuries?

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:05.200 align:middle line:84%
Or is it truly the
arrival of something

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.600 align:middle line:90%
that lasts 90,000 years?

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.610 align:middle line:90%
I don't have that answer.

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:12.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do they feel--
so are you saying, then,

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:17.290 align:middle line:84%
that on one level, while various
interests behind chemtrails

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:22.550 align:middle line:84%
are profiting hugely from it,
at the same time that there

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:26.890 align:middle line:84%
is an attempt to modulate
the climate on the Earth

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:29.019 align:middle line:90%
so the species can continue on?

00:19:29.019 --> 00:19:31.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, then you look at
someone like Bill Gates.

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:34.780 align:middle line:84%
Why is he gathering all
of these heirloom seeds

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:36.020 align:middle line:90%
in a vault in the Arctic?

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:37.300 align:middle line:90%
I mean, why is that going on?

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:39.350 align:middle line:90%
Against what kind of disaster?

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:41.170 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I think
that we're going

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:43.610 align:middle line:84%
to go through a pole shift--
a magnetic field pole shift.

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and that was
the discussion 20 years ago.

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:48.155 align:middle line:84%
Gregg Braden really was
central to that discussion,

00:19:48.155 --> 00:19:50.450 align:middle line:84%
and he stopped talking
about it over 15 years ago.

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:51.250 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: No.

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:53.920 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at
the mathematics,

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:57.530 align:middle line:84%
the pace of the pole
change across the north,

00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:58.907 align:middle line:90%
it seems inevitable.

00:19:58.907 --> 00:20:00.490 align:middle line:84%
And all of these
changes are geometric

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:03.930 align:middle line:90%
in pattern and play-out.

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:07.130 align:middle line:84%
When it happens, it will happen
very, very, very, very fast.

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:07.930 align:middle line:90%
Very fast.

00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:09.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I wonder-- OK.

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:10.655 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to bring
a little esoterica up

00:20:10.655 --> 00:20:11.170 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of this.

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:11.620 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Please.

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:12.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.620 align:middle line:84%
So I was meditating on
that a few years ago.

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:16.540 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember why, even.

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:19.300 align:middle line:84%
But I was meditating and just
looking at what was happening.

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And what came up was
kind of surprising.

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:24.220 align:middle line:84%
And it had to do with odd
storm patterns in the Midwest,

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:25.420 align:middle line:90%
apparently.

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:27.859 align:middle line:84%
And what I was seeing--
and you tell me

00:20:27.859 --> 00:20:28.900 align:middle line:90%
whether this is possible.

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:31.960 align:middle line:84%
I know others have apparently
seen similar things-- is

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:37.360 align:middle line:84%
that there are these areas
and pockets where the pole,

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.130 align:middle line:84%
essentially the magnetic
field has already

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:42.730 align:middle line:84%
reversed, in little isolated
pockets around the world.

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:44.690 align:middle line:90%
That it's already begun.

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:45.490 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:46.015 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:20:46.015 --> 00:20:46.270 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Mm-hm.

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:47.811 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, well
that's what I saw.

00:20:47.811 --> 00:20:51.130 align:middle line:84%
Which led me to
think, is it possible

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:53.380 align:middle line:84%
that this will
continue happening?

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:56.680 align:middle line:84%
And be more of a gradual
kind of pole shift,

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:58.930 align:middle line:84%
as more of these places
establish themselves?

00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:03.059 align:middle line:84%
Rather than boom-- from positive
to negative, north to south.

00:21:03.059 --> 00:21:05.350 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And I don't know
if it's going to be a this.

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:06.430 align:middle line:90%
It might just be a this.

00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:07.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I'm wondering,

00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:10.250 align:middle line:84%
because I was seeing that
this is happening all over.

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:11.050 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Yeah.

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:13.420 align:middle line:84%
That we don't have a
complete reversal that way,

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:15.570 align:middle line:90%
but just simply a readjustment.

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:16.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:16.720 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:17.530 align:middle line:90%
And that's--

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:18.310 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: And I could see--

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:19.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We could
live through it.

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:19.345 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Yes.

00:21:19.345 --> 00:21:19.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: More or less.

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:20.077 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: We will
live through it.

00:21:20.077 --> 00:21:21.827 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everything
will live through it.

00:21:21.827 --> 00:21:24.200 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I don't say
we, as in all of us.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:27.100 align:middle line:84%
But the majority have
the potential to,

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:29.185 align:middle line:90%
depending on their preparedness.

00:21:29.185 --> 00:21:31.180 align:middle line:84%
And their ability
and willingness

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:35.562 align:middle line:84%
to accept difficult times, and
have a positive outlook on it.

00:21:35.562 --> 00:21:37.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's
what I was seeing.

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:38.740 align:middle line:84%
The same thing, that
this is totally-- we

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:39.614 align:middle line:90%
can get through this.

00:21:39.614 --> 00:21:42.910 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And at the same
time, this planet barely

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:45.404 align:middle line:84%
can support the population
that it has to bear now.

00:21:45.404 --> 00:21:47.695 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, certainly
the way we're doing business.

00:21:47.695 --> 00:21:48.310 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Thank you.

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:49.225 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is
very inefficient.

00:21:49.225 --> 00:21:49.960 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: That's
the difference.

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:51.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not
about the numbers,

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:53.430 align:middle line:84%
it's about the quality and
the way we're doing business.

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:54.783 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And why
are we doing that?

00:21:54.783 --> 00:21:56.050 align:middle line:90%
Because it's all for profit.

00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:56.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, for profit.

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:57.760 align:middle line:90%
OK, now.

00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.410 align:middle line:84%
I want to get into a
couple of things on that

00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:00.940 align:middle line:84%
because that's where
we started, and that's

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:02.106 align:middle line:90%
where we're going to end up.

00:22:02.106 --> 00:22:03.900 align:middle line:84%
OK, in my notes
here-- all right.

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:08.560 align:middle line:84%
Weather derivatives were
originally traded by Enron.

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.820 align:middle line:84%
No one wants to hear the word
"weather" an "Enron" together.

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:14.380 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: No, but that's
where they made so much money.

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:15.838 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Talk
about that, and then

00:22:15.838 --> 00:22:18.090 align:middle line:84%
talk about where they
ended up and what happened.

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:20.060 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: They were
trading futures.

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:20.860 align:middle line:90%
Literally.

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:23.050 align:middle line:84%
They-- when you
control the power

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:24.760 align:middle line:84%
grid, which is
something I think needs

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:26.215 align:middle line:90%
to end and be decentralized.

00:22:26.215 --> 00:22:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
beautiful things that's

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:32.590 align:middle line:84%
happening with solar, is we're
getting a lot of distributed

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:33.769 align:middle line:90%
inputs to the grid.

00:22:33.769 --> 00:22:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's
other technologies that

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:37.510 align:middle line:84%
have been withheld
from us that could

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:41.480 align:middle line:84%
complete that transition to a
distributed electronic grid.

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:43.750 align:middle line:84%
So because they have
a centralized system,

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:47.110 align:middle line:84%
they can manipulate the movement
of electricity across the lines

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:50.530 align:middle line:84%
that they have to buy
time on, by capacity.

00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:53.590 align:middle line:84%
And so if you've got
the LA Basin, when

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:56.680 align:middle line:84%
you get into the interior
it's 102, 103 degrees.

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:57.760 align:middle line:90%
It's not comfortable.

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:00.304 align:middle line:84%
We don't build a
building in the desert.

00:23:00.304 --> 00:23:01.220 align:middle line:90%
How brilliant is that?

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:05.050 align:middle line:84%
With 2x6 construction
and R-13 insulation

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:06.520 align:middle line:90%
that's gappy at best.

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:07.930 align:middle line:90%
It's stupid.

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:08.846 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:23:08.846 --> 00:23:09.760 align:middle line:90%
I live in the desert.

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:10.180 align:middle line:90%
I get it.

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:11.050 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: It's not small.

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:12.175 align:middle line:90%
We should be in the ground.

00:23:12.175 --> 00:23:14.350 align:middle line:84%
Plain and simple, we
should be in the ground.

00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:15.759 align:middle line:90%
It's a great insulator.

00:23:15.759 --> 00:23:17.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there are
experimental communities,

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.770 align:middle line:84%
like Arcosanti, where people
have dug into the ground.

00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:21.984 align:middle line:90%
And you have your insulation.

00:23:21.984 --> 00:23:23.650 align:middle line:84%
A little more primitive
housing, though,

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:25.740 align:middle line:84%
than most people moving
from LA to Phoenix wanted.

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:26.580 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Different
from what it used to be.

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:28.350 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean
it's primitive.

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:30.550 align:middle line:84%
It's just not what
we're accustomed to.

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:30.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:31.693 align:middle line:90%
It can be quite beautiful.

00:23:31.693 --> 00:23:32.690 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: It can be.

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:35.140 align:middle line:90%
And very secure, very quiet.

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:36.940 align:middle line:90%
I don't hear the neighbor's dog.

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:38.530 align:middle line:84%
I don't hear the
train next door.

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:38.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
not only that, you

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:41.440 align:middle line:84%
get this incredibly pure
energy of the emanation

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:44.200 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth itself, rather
than all of this other stuff

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.705 align:middle line:84%
that's bombarding our
entire environment.

00:23:46.705 --> 00:23:47.830 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: It's just noise.

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:48.640 align:middle line:90%
It's EM noise.

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:49.713 align:middle line:90%
It's just noise.

00:23:49.713 --> 00:23:50.838 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But we digressed.

00:23:50.838 --> 00:23:52.815 align:middle line:90%
Enron and weather.

00:23:52.815 --> 00:23:54.190 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: So
Enron, because they

00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:57.340 align:middle line:84%
had this centralized system,
could withhold power.

00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:59.200 align:middle line:84%
They could charge
the local utilities

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:02.350 align:middle line:84%
a higher rate than-- far higher
than what they were getting

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:03.760 align:middle line:84%
the power for, so
they can create

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:05.800 align:middle line:90%
these artificial shortages.

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And then they were
making money off it.

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:09.770 align:middle line:90%
There were derivatives.

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:12.580 align:middle line:90%


00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:14.920 align:middle line:84%
It was a big Ponzi
scheme, essentially.

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:17.609 align:middle line:90%
And they were using debt.

00:24:17.609 --> 00:24:19.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know how
to get into all this.

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.290 align:middle line:90%
It's rather complex.

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:24.230 align:middle line:84%
But Enron being that
centralized power distributor,

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:30.095 align:middle line:84%
if you know two weeks ahead of
time, before your weatherman,

00:24:30.095 --> 00:24:31.720 align:middle line:84%
before the National
Weather Service has

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:35.920 align:middle line:84%
committed to a heat wave,
you lease those power lines.

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.762 align:middle line:90%
You buy that resource.

00:24:37.762 --> 00:24:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And then you resell it when
the heat wave is imminent

00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:42.400 align:middle line:84%
or upon us, and people
are in panic mode,

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.370 align:middle line:90%
at a much higher rate.

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:44.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
what they were doing.

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:46.000 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And
that's what they do.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.410 align:middle line:84%
When I was in Tulsa, on the
air, I had a pipeline company.

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:53.500 align:middle line:84%
They paid me weekly
for weather forecasts.

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:55.360 align:middle line:84%
Because if I could
get them capacity

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:59.830 align:middle line:84%
on a pipeline from Cushing,
Oklahoma up to Chicago,

00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:03.580 align:middle line:84%
all they had to do is be hours
ahead of the competition,

00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:06.310 align:middle line:84%
and they could get that
capacity at a reduced rate.

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:09.280 align:middle line:84%
Then they can move their
product ahead of competition.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:12.410 align:middle line:84%
Because it was a finite
ability to move energy, to move

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:15.750 align:middle line:84%
BTUs-- British Thermal
Units-- from point to point.

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:17.230 align:middle line:84%
And so if you know
what's happening

00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:19.490 align:middle line:84%
with weather ahead
of the competition,

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:21.880 align:middle line:90%
there is a fortune to be made.

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:23.890 align:middle line:84%
If it's orange juice
futures and you

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:26.650 align:middle line:84%
know there's a frost coming in
three weeks', four weeks' time,

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:31.690 align:middle line:84%
you buy those futures and you
sell them at twice the price.

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:35.050 align:middle line:84%
After it's apparent, or
after the damage is done.

00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:37.090 align:middle line:90%
If you know, you know.

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:38.020 align:middle line:90%
And you profit.

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:39.853 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there are
billions and billions

00:25:39.853 --> 00:25:42.610 align:middle line:84%
of dollars to be made
on a corporate level

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:44.720 align:middle line:84%
by those involved
with this technology.

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:45.640 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Absolutely.

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:46.560 align:middle line:90%
I mean reinsurance.

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:47.860 align:middle line:90%
Insurance companies.

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:49.870 align:middle line:84%
But see, then the
question is, who knows

00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:51.720 align:middle line:90%
about the agenda ahead of time?

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I'm wondering.

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:55.270 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I don't think
it's that widely known.

00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:59.530 align:middle line:84%
I truly think it's a
tightly-held secret.

00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:03.700 align:middle line:84%
It's really-- pilots
probably know.

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:07.450 align:middle line:84%
Airlines have to be aware
of what's happening.

00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:12.820 align:middle line:84%
So there is a-- NDAs,
nondisclosure agreements.

00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:18.109 align:middle line:84%
You know, there are penalties
to pay for breaking ranks.

00:26:18.109 --> 00:26:19.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm just looking at--

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:20.070 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Where are
you going with this?

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:21.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I'm
just looking at it

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:23.530 align:middle line:90%
from a financial point of view.

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:27.230 align:middle line:84%
If Enron and these companies
trading in these derivatives,

00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:29.245 align:middle line:84%
weather derivatives
are the ones to gain,

00:26:29.245 --> 00:26:30.620 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't they be
the ones to also

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:33.140 align:middle line:90%
be paying for that technology?

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:34.730 align:middle line:84%
What kind of
companionship is there

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:37.120 align:middle line:84%
between the military
and these corporations?

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:38.572 align:middle line:84%
Military industrial
complex here.

00:26:38.572 --> 00:26:40.280 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And it
truly could be the guys

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:45.860 align:middle line:84%
at the tip of the pyramid at
Enron that get the signal,

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:47.630 align:middle line:84%
get the anonymous
email from there.

00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:51.780 align:middle line:84%
Dudes, this is going to happen
here, go ahead and act on it.

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And so then, that edict to
buy this, this, and this,

00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:57.260 align:middle line:84%
at this price, at
this time, just

00:26:57.260 --> 00:26:58.465 align:middle line:90%
ends up in the order stream.

00:26:58.465 --> 00:27:00.740 align:middle line:90%
And so then they're positioned.

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:03.560 align:middle line:84%
And the traders don't have
to know what's going on.

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:06.290 align:middle line:84%
It just is a purchase
order, a cell order,

00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:08.930 align:middle line:84%
a protocol to the broker
that comes down from above,

00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:09.780 align:middle line:90%
from some client.

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:10.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:12.110 align:middle line:90%
All right, that makes sense.

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:14.540 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: That's how
I would deal with it.

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:16.374 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's look
at the notion of crops.

00:27:16.374 --> 00:27:18.081 align:middle line:84%
We already talked a
little bit about what

00:27:18.081 --> 00:27:19.940 align:middle line:84%
happens if people are
hungry, so we don't

00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:21.180 align:middle line:90%
need to go there any further.

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:24.874 align:middle line:84%
But from more of a
profiteering point of view,

00:27:24.874 --> 00:27:27.290 align:middle line:84%
one of the things in "Why in
the World are They Spraying?"

00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:29.480 align:middle line:84%
that came up was
that if you have

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.850 align:middle line:84%
a farm that is now
failed-- they've

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:34.170 align:middle line:84%
had two seasons in a
row that have failed.

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:35.430 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: You're pulling
out the almond trees.

00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:37.763 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're pulling them
out, you're selling cheap.

00:27:37.763 --> 00:27:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And there are people very
happy to buy that land cheaply.

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.210 align:middle line:84%
And again, part of what
that film brought up

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:49.100 align:middle line:84%
was the potential that
this was being orchestrated

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:51.200 align:middle line:84%
so that companies in
bed with Monsanto,

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.760 align:middle line:84%
for example, can replace
these farms with GMO farms.

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:56.510 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I think
it's entirely possible.

00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:58.280 align:middle line:84%
Who knows what they
talk about it at, say,

00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.380 align:middle line:84%
the Bilderberg
meetings and the CFR's.

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:02.360 align:middle line:90%
You know, the agenda.

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:05.240 align:middle line:84%
All of these people
have to get together

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:09.050 align:middle line:84%
and game out the next year, two
years, five years, 10 years.

00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And we're so involved with
our 401Ks and those companies'

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:16.595 align:middle line:90%
three-month, six-month view.

00:28:16.595 --> 00:28:18.045 align:middle line:90%
You know, time horizon.

00:28:18.045 --> 00:28:19.920 align:middle line:84%
That it's the next
quarter, the next quarter.

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:22.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe the next half
of next year will be better.

00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:24.350 align:middle line:84%
These guys are dealing
with a generation.

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:26.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
Monsanto alone--

00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:29.210 align:middle line:84%
they have the patents on
almost all the seeds that

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:31.520 align:middle line:84%
exist right now, except
for some heirlooms, right?

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:35.000 align:middle line:84%
But they also have these
all-weather-resistant types

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.689 align:middle line:90%
of patents of seeds.

00:28:37.689 --> 00:28:39.980 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I think they're
in precarious-- very, very--

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:40.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I hope they are.

00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:40.940 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: --precarious grounds.

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:42.260 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:43.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
they're already

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:48.272 align:middle line:84%
engineering seeds for the
future weather disaster, right?

00:28:48.272 --> 00:28:50.480 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I also think
these companies are so loaded

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:55.250 align:middle line:84%
with debt, that when this
debt bomb goes off, that they

00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:57.770 align:middle line:90%
become failed entities.

00:28:57.770 --> 00:28:59.810 align:middle line:10%
The question is,
then, where do farmers

00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:04.040 align:middle line:10%
go to get their seeds if
their traditional heirloom

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:07.480 align:middle line:10%
supplies have been dried up?

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's my greatest
concern with what's happening.

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:11.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Me, too.

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:14.570 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Because then how do
we kick-start the next regime?

00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:17.360 align:middle line:84%
In the past, all of the
research done with agriculture

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:20.000 align:middle line:84%
had been done at their
state universities.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.940 align:middle line:84%
You know, Kansas State, Colorado
State, University of Idaho.

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:24.660 align:middle line:90%
They all had their ag schools.

00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:26.060 align:middle line:90%
Idaho dealing with potatoes.

00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:29.250 align:middle line:84%
Kansas with the
wheat and sunflowers.

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And everybody had their
area of specialties.

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And now we've had
this monoculture

00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:39.980 align:middle line:84%
where corn is grown from the
Rockies to the Appalachians.

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:41.905 align:middle line:84%
And there's not much
diversity in between.

00:29:41.905 --> 00:29:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And the wildlife
is starving for it.

00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:46.710 align:middle line:90%
Literally starving for it.

00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:50.450 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's the bees or the
butterflies or the smaller

00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:53.300 align:middle line:84%
mammals, everything's
starving because of it.

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:56.552 align:middle line:84%
And so, when corn goes
down because of a failure,

00:29:56.552 --> 00:29:58.760 align:middle line:84%
because of a flood, because
of something-- maybe it's

00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:00.260 align:middle line:84%
because the price
of oil goes down

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:02.270 align:middle line:84%
and that corn is
going to ethanol--

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:04.550 align:middle line:84%
and the two are
now tied together,

00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:07.640 align:middle line:84%
that that farmer doesn't
have the equipment to go back

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.950 align:middle line:90%
to wheat, to grain, to rye.

00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:14.210 align:middle line:84%
To some other crop that his
father and grandfather grew.

00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:17.210 align:middle line:84%
He simply doesn't have the
machinery or labor to do it.

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:19.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and also the
soil has been contaminated.

00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And in addition to
that, now to go back

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:24.170 align:middle line:84%
and try to buy those
seeds is very expensive.

00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:24.970 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Yeah.

00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:26.640 align:middle line:84%
Because he's been
backed against a wall.

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:30.192 align:middle line:84%
The machine has-- not
literally, but figuratively--

00:30:30.192 --> 00:30:32.150 align:middle line:84%
put a gun to his head
said, you will grow this,

00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:34.940 align:middle line:84%
and you'll get this price,
and this, this, and this.

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:35.980 align:middle line:90%
And they have to comply.

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:36.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:38.910 align:middle line:84%
And to me, this is
a really big issue.

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:41.110 align:middle line:84%
And then, I've
been for many years

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:45.260 align:middle line:84%
a big fan of whoever has a few
pots or a little bit of soil--

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:46.910 align:middle line:90%
get your own heirloom seeds.

00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:48.680 align:middle line:84%
And take responsibility,
and take yourself

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:53.582 align:middle line:84%
somewhat off the supply chain,
in terms of food distribution.

00:30:53.582 --> 00:30:55.040 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I think
we underestimate

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:58.670 align:middle line:84%
how much food each of us,
as individuals and families,

00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:01.250 align:middle line:84%
consume over the
course of the year.

00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:03.440 align:middle line:84%
When you want to go buy
a year's worth of food

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.120 align:middle line:84%
and put it somewhere
in the house,

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:10.100 align:middle line:84%
you're like, oh, my
goodness, I can't do this.

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:11.870 align:middle line:90%
I can't do this.

00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:15.380 align:middle line:84%
So we're all kind of feeding
the system because we've

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:16.700 align:middle line:90%
been entrained into it.

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:18.537 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We have,
but we can break away.

00:31:18.537 --> 00:31:20.120 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk
about various ways

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:22.160 align:middle line:84%
to break away,
starting about now.

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:24.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know I
live in Sedona, right?

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:26.230 align:middle line:90%
And so I put in raised beds.

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:29.522 align:middle line:84%
I got some river silt, and put
compost, and a little manure.

00:31:29.522 --> 00:31:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to
grow year-round--

00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:32.730 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Oh, I see
that with your nails.

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:35.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I know,
they don't look like it.

00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:35.270 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:36.930 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Mine already did,
but it's been a few days.

00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:38.013 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I put gloves on.

00:31:38.013 --> 00:31:39.150 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Thank you.

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:42.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But I was able to grow
year-round almost everything.

00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And then I took the
extra precaution,

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:46.620 align:middle line:84%
because Sedona is
heavily chemtrailed.

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:47.420 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Mm-hm.

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:47.930 align:middle line:90%
Oh, we all are.

00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:50.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I had these little
sheets, the little white,

00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:51.226 align:middle line:90%
what do you call them?

00:31:51.226 --> 00:31:52.230 align:middle line:90%
Solar cloths.

00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And soon as I saw
them spraying I'd

00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:56.060 align:middle line:84%
roll the little solar
cloths out for the day.

00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And then when it stopped and
it settled, I'd pull them back.

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:01.370 align:middle line:84%
You know, at night, and let
the plants breathe properly.

00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:03.230 align:middle line:90%
And then I had some chickens.

00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:08.780 align:middle line:84%
And I was amazed how easy
it was to actually grow

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:10.980 align:middle line:84%
a fair amount of
my own food supply.

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:12.370 align:middle line:90%
It was not a big deal.

00:32:12.370 --> 00:32:12.720 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: You can do it.

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:14.261 align:middle line:84%
And as we talked
about the last show,

00:32:14.261 --> 00:32:16.350 align:middle line:90%
just put some Ormus on it.

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:17.540 align:middle line:90%
Put some Ormus on it.

00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:18.680 align:middle line:90%
It will taste good.

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:20.950 align:middle line:84%
The elements and
minerals will come back.

00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:23.122 align:middle line:84%
And you will have
resistance against plants

00:32:23.122 --> 00:32:24.830 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of the
environmental pollutions

00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:26.000 align:middle line:90%
that we're dealing with.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.530 align:middle line:90%
This is going to be a secret.

00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And in the next decade or two,
this alkalinized saltwater

00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:34.550 align:middle line:84%
with Ormus is going to be
a key part of remediation.

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:36.950 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's
weather-specific radiation,

00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:39.130 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the GMOs
that at some point in time

00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:41.810 align:middle line:84%
have got to be reverted
to heritage genetics.

00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:43.220 align:middle line:90%
That's got to happen.

00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And so if we want to
talk about solutions,

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.570 align:middle line:84%
that simply is going
to be one of them that

00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:50.600 align:middle line:84%
is-- it is simple,
simple, simple to do.

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:52.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know
the Ormus thing.

00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:55.796 align:middle line:84%
15 years ago I was taking my
Ormus every day, and all that.

00:32:55.796 --> 00:32:57.170 align:middle line:84%
And then what
happened over time,

00:32:57.170 --> 00:32:59.427 align:middle line:84%
I started noticing the
quality of it changing.

00:32:59.427 --> 00:33:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
noticing, you know,

00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:04.730 align:middle line:84%
this is an underground
world, pretty much.

00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:06.120 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Health is.

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:06.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:10.160 align:middle line:84%
You have to go underground
to maintain your health.

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed that
there is-- obviously,

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:14.320 align:middle line:84%
there's no oversight
in terms of Ormus.

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:15.980 align:middle line:84%
So you have to
say, how do I know

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:18.860 align:middle line:84%
what I'm getting is
actually really refined

00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:19.910 align:middle line:90%
on a frequency level?

00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:22.450 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: That comes
to your discretion.

00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And in a way, that
absence is a gift,

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:31.050 align:middle line:84%
because it simply lets that
exist in the first place.

00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:32.630 align:middle line:84%
Because how many
things-- I mean,

00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:34.710 align:middle line:84%
if you've got the FDA
looking at cranberry

00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:38.630 align:middle line:84%
juice because it's
good for you, [SIGH].

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:40.010 align:middle line:90%


00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:40.840 align:middle line:90%
Heavens to Betsy.

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:41.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:46.160 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk-- I mean,
I'm OK with it if you are.

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:50.060 align:middle line:84%
So, what is the source
of Ormus that you use?

00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:51.730 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: We use
Blue Water Alchemy.

00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:53.480 align:middle line:84%
We use the Essene
Wet Method, so we

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:55.955 align:middle line:84%
use salt. Whether
it's an Atlantic salt,

00:33:55.955 --> 00:33:59.210 align:middle line:84%
a Himalayan salt, Andes
salt. Dead Sea is important.

00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:00.794 align:middle line:84%
Dead Sea salt is
very, very important.

00:34:00.794 --> 00:34:02.085 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is very important.

00:34:02.085 --> 00:34:03.400 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: It's very important.

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:03.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Actually.

00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:05.466 align:middle line:84%
It carries properties
that people

00:34:05.466 --> 00:34:06.590 align:middle line:90%
aren't really aware of yet.

00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:07.640 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Right.

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And so you go
through a pH shock.

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:13.469 align:middle line:84%
And you take this saltwater
up from pH 6.7 to almost 11.

00:34:13.469 --> 00:34:15.050 align:middle line:90%
And so it becomes very alkaline.

00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:18.679 align:middle line:84%
And you end up with
literally a product

00:34:18.679 --> 00:34:20.210 align:middle line:90%
that looks like half-and-half.

00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:23.000 align:middle line:84%
Saltwater turned into, it
looks like half-and-half.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And so you go through a process
of reducing the salinity,

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:28.580 align:middle line:84%
and it's just something
you take sublingually.

00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:30.679 align:middle line:84%
And it restores the
elements to the body,

00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:34.949 align:middle line:84%
so the body sees
what its issues are.

00:34:34.949 --> 00:34:38.420 align:middle line:84%
It literally-- these elements
end up like ceramics.

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:40.670 align:middle line:84%
So they drop into the body
and then communication

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:43.389 align:middle line:84%
happens cell-to-cell, across the
DNA, through the chromosomes.

00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:47.618 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- there's so much
happening in our food absent

00:34:47.618 --> 00:34:48.909 align:middle line:90%
of nutrients, with chemtrails--

00:34:48.909 --> 00:34:51.889 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what I was
hinting at-- chemtrails.

00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:54.590 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: It was a sacrament
in Egyptian and older times.

00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:56.150 align:middle line:90%
It was simply a sacrament.

00:34:56.150 --> 00:34:58.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
is this called again?

00:34:58.110 --> 00:34:58.910 align:middle line:90%
The blue what?

00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:00.200 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Blue Water Alchemy.

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:00.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Blue Water Alchemy.

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's where people would
find it if they want to look.

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:03.610 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Yep.

00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:05.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's just one
of the solutions

00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:06.980 align:middle line:90%
to deal with what's coming.

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:07.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Indeed.

00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I keep thinking
one of the other solutions

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:13.730 align:middle line:84%
has to be that, on
subtle levels or not--

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:16.550 align:middle line:84%
even if you have to go to a
health-care practitioner--

00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:19.820 align:middle line:84%
that these subtle
levels of chelation

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:21.980 align:middle line:84%
have to be part and
parcel to the way

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:24.710 align:middle line:84%
we counter the effects of
the chemtrails on our brain

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:25.670 align:middle line:90%
and nervous system.

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:27.705 align:middle line:84%
And our bodies and
cells and DNA at large.

00:35:27.705 --> 00:35:29.330 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And this
is one that I'm not

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:31.030 align:middle line:90%
as good at, or diligent about.

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:34.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's using like
diatomaceous earth.

00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:38.450 align:middle line:84%
So it's just-- you know, I've
got a 50-pound bag at home.

00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:40.040 align:middle line:90%
Do I get into it that often?

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:40.370 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:40.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:41.520 align:middle line:90%
This is the thing.

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:42.770 align:middle line:90%
And there are ways to chelate.

00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:46.850 align:middle line:84%
You can-- a lot of
naturopathic physicians

00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:48.527 align:middle line:90%
offer that service, for example.

00:35:48.527 --> 00:35:49.860 align:middle line:90%
And they've been slammed for it.

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:53.780 align:middle line:84%
But if there were ever a time
to start using subtle chelation

00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:54.640 align:middle line:90%
therapies--

00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:55.520 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: It was last year.

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:57.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was last
year a decade ago,

00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:59.780 align:middle line:84%
once they started spraying
the heck out of us.

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:00.950 align:middle line:90%
This is in our bodies.

00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:02.870 align:middle line:90%
It's in our hair follicles.

00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:05.799 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And it
affects our fertility.

00:36:05.799 --> 00:36:07.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Exactly,
which is another--

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:11.310 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: It affects our
nervous system and as we age,

00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:14.940 align:middle line:84%
whether it's Parkinson's,
whether it's dementia--

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:18.584 align:middle line:84%
all of these things
don't just happen.

00:36:18.584 --> 00:36:19.500 align:middle line:90%
They are degenerative.

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:20.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Cumulative
and degenerative, yeah.

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:22.620 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And so
this is why it's

00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:24.450 align:middle line:84%
important to do these
things when you're

00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:26.850 align:middle line:90%
in your 20s, 30s, and 40s.

00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:29.820 align:middle line:84%
So that when you get to
your 60s, you're like,

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:30.960 align:middle line:90%
is it too late?

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:33.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, no, it's not
too late, but it sure

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:34.770 align:middle line:90%
would have been nice had you.

00:36:34.770 --> 00:36:35.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:36.720 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:39.960 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you're saying
that all of this

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:43.020 align:middle line:84%
goes away when our
system of money crashes,

00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:46.580 align:middle line:84%
burns, changes, reforms,
transforms, right?

00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:47.460 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about it.

00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:48.700 align:middle line:90%
Explain that to us.

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:52.440 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I'm not so-- not
that I'm anti-chemtrail.

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:55.060 align:middle line:84%
It's just that it's a symptom
of the geoengineering that's

00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:55.860 align:middle line:90%
happening.

00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:57.570 align:middle line:90%
The climate engineering.

00:36:57.570 --> 00:37:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And it'll end the day
it's supposed to end.

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:03.150 align:middle line:84%
You know, all the
marching, yes, it's nice.

00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:04.390 align:middle line:90%
Awareness is a good thing.

00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:06.598 align:middle line:84%
But it isn't going to pull
the planes out of the sky.

00:37:06.598 --> 00:37:09.850 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to end it.

00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:12.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think that-- I know
that will only happen when

00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:13.315 align:middle line:90%
the monetary system implodes.

00:37:13.315 --> 00:37:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you need
to take some time

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:16.699 align:middle line:84%
to explain to people
what you mean by this

00:37:16.699 --> 00:37:17.990 align:middle line:90%
and why that would be the case.

00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:19.823 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Well, we're
all kind of concerned

00:37:19.823 --> 00:37:24.990 align:middle line:84%
about how you keep a
debt-based system going.

00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:27.030 align:middle line:84%
When you go buy a car,
when you go buy a house,

00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:28.560 align:middle line:90%
where does that money come?

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:30.120 align:middle line:84%
Sure, you've got to
come to the table

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:31.860 align:middle line:84%
with a little bit
of down payment.

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:33.870 align:middle line:84%
In the days of old, when
you went to the bank

00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:36.330 align:middle line:84%
to buy a house, you
needed 20% down.

00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:38.790 align:middle line:84%
That was your savings that you
brought to the bank and say,

00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:40.810 align:middle line:90%
hey, I got skin in the game.

00:37:40.810 --> 00:37:44.340 align:middle line:84%
Now you go to the bank,
it's 3% or less, sometimes.

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:47.700 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes there are 100%
loan-to-value, or LTV loans.

00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:48.662 align:middle line:90%
The bank says, good.

00:37:48.662 --> 00:37:50.370 align:middle line:84%
You've got a heartbeat,
you're breathing,

00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:52.860 align:middle line:84%
you've got a job--
let's write you a check.

00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:54.870 align:middle line:90%
Where does that money come from?

00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:56.880 align:middle line:90%
It's simply a ledger entry.

00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:00.810 align:middle line:84%
More debt comes into existence,
so the bank doesn't draw on its

00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:03.720 align:middle line:90%
savers', its depositors' money.

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:06.530 align:middle line:84%
It just is literally,
there it is.

00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:07.410 align:middle line:90%
There's $100,000.

00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:09.240 align:middle line:90%
There's $1.2 million.

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's how the system grows,
is by the creation of debt.

00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:15.060 align:middle line:84%
So this is why the federal
government has never

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:17.310 align:middle line:90%
been able to not have debt.

00:38:17.310 --> 00:38:20.130 align:middle line:84%
Because if the federal
government were ever

00:38:20.130 --> 00:38:23.670 align:middle line:84%
bound to have balanced
budgets, the money supply

00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:25.350 align:middle line:90%
would begin to contract.

00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:29.670 align:middle line:84%
There would be less money around
to support this Ponzi scheme.

00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:33.330 align:middle line:84%
And so, as great as that
Bill Clinton huge surplus

00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:35.790 align:middle line:84%
was going to be, it
was never meant to be.

00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:37.920 align:middle line:84%
They had to get us back
into deficit spending

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:41.020 align:middle line:84%
because every year that deficit
of, what is it, $600 billion

00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:41.820 align:middle line:90%
now?

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:44.430 align:middle line:84%
Is money that's injected
into the system.

00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:48.390 align:middle line:84%
Money that were used
to pay salaries.

00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:50.680 align:middle line:84%
That's money that
wasn't there before.

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:53.430 align:middle line:84%
So when this system
breaks apart-- as

00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:56.640 align:middle line:84%
it almost did in
2007, 2008, and 2009--

00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:58.440 align:middle line:90%
there has to be a replacement.

00:38:58.440 --> 00:38:59.847 align:middle line:90%
We've all thought, gold, silver.

00:38:59.847 --> 00:39:01.680 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm going to
have a little silver.

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:02.490 align:middle line:90%
And I did.

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:04.966 align:middle line:84%
After 9/11, I'm like, I'm
getting me some silver.

00:39:04.966 --> 00:39:06.090 align:middle line:90%
You know, I was like, gold.

00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:06.923 align:middle line:90%
I can't afford gold.

00:39:06.923 --> 00:39:08.780 align:middle line:90%
I got [GASP] silver!

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:09.580 align:middle line:90%
Lights on.

00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:11.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm going every
Friday, every paycheck.

00:39:11.590 --> 00:39:13.925 align:middle line:84%
I was buying 20
one-ounce rounds.

00:39:13.925 --> 00:39:16.330 align:middle line:90%
It was $5 at the time.

00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:17.760 align:middle line:90%
Works for me.

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:19.650 align:middle line:90%
And then we had the big crisis.

00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And silver should have gone
through the roof and it didn't.

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:23.775 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it's
totally manipulated.

00:39:23.775 --> 00:39:24.680 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Thank you.

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't realize
how long they

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.830 align:middle line:90%
could hold that game together.

00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:29.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A long time.

00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:31.289 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Longer
than I thought.

00:39:31.289 --> 00:39:32.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it
can't go on forever.

00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:33.390 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: It can't.

00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:34.190 align:middle line:90%
It can't.

00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:36.570 align:middle line:84%
Every paper money
system eventually fails.

00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And so after the
last crisis, there

00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:44.040 align:middle line:84%
was a white paper written
by an anonymous guy, Satoshi

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:45.030 align:middle line:90%
Nakamoto.

00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:49.620 align:middle line:84%
And it was about a concept, a
cryptocurrency called Bitcoin.

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:52.830 align:middle line:84%
This cryptocurrency
is not a hard money.

00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:55.050 align:middle line:90%
It's simply an output, a key.

00:39:55.050 --> 00:40:00.840 align:middle line:84%
A 30-alphanumeric key that's
generated by a computer.

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And this computer-- how
do we even get into this?

00:40:04.930 --> 00:40:07.470 align:middle line:84%
As every 10 minutes,
this computer

00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:09.180 align:middle line:84%
that's running
this, this hashing,

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:12.840 align:middle line:84%
this energy-intensive
algorithm every 10 minutes

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:16.440 align:middle line:84%
will create a block of
all of the transactions

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:19.110 align:middle line:84%
that have happened in
that previous 10 minutes.

00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:21.420 align:middle line:84%
And these computers
get rewarded--

00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:24.720 align:middle line:84%
at this point in time-- 12
and 1/2 coins-- or Bitcoins--

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:27.720 align:middle line:84%
for participating in
securing this network.

00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:29.910 align:middle line:90%
this cryptographic currency.

00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:32.340 align:middle line:84%
And so every 10 minutes,
all of the transactions

00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:35.520 align:middle line:84%
that have happened across
this now-global network

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:38.490 align:middle line:84%
are locked and encoded,
but yet readable,

00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:41.130 align:middle line:90%
inside this block chain.

00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:44.640 align:middle line:84%
So, beginning in January
2009, the blockchain

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:46.080 align:middle line:90%
had its first link.

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:50.070 align:middle line:84%
And the first miner was given
the reward of 50 Bitcoins.

00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:51.990 align:middle line:84%
The next 10 minutes,
another 50 Bitcoin

00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:54.600 align:middle line:84%
came out for
securing the network.

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:58.274 align:middle line:84%
And every 10 minutes a new
block is added to this chain.

00:40:58.274 --> 00:40:59.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, for
most people listening

00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:02.490 align:middle line:84%
that don't deal in Bitcoin,
it sounds like a video game.

00:41:02.490 --> 00:41:02.790 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:04.650 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Which is
probably 98% of the people.

00:41:04.650 --> 00:41:05.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And this
is why it's beautiful.

00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:08.726 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I still
don't understand it.

00:41:08.726 --> 00:41:10.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's like a
video game and you think,

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:11.891 align:middle line:90%
how secure do I feel with that?

00:41:11.891 --> 00:41:13.600 align:middle line:84%
Because initially,
don't you have

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:15.854 align:middle line:84%
to input some money
into that game?

00:41:15.854 --> 00:41:17.770 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: The other
question is-- no, there's

00:41:17.770 --> 00:41:19.050 align:middle line:90%
two ways to get in on it.

00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:19.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:41:19.850 --> 00:41:21.308 align:middle line:84%
Explain all this
to us, and explain

00:41:21.308 --> 00:41:23.560 align:middle line:84%
how this is relevant
to this larger picture.

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:27.040 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: You either invest
hashing power, meaning,

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:28.760 align:middle line:90%
I have two computers at home.

00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:29.800 align:middle line:90%
I've got two Macs.

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sitting
there using them.

00:41:31.850 --> 00:41:33.550 align:middle line:90%
So what are they doing?

00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:35.300 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:36.310 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:41:36.310 --> 00:41:38.200 align:middle line:84%
It's like having two
employees that I'm

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:42.280 align:middle line:84%
paying, because they're
turned on, doing nothing.

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:45.160 align:middle line:84%
I've got a phone sitting there,
waiting for me to use it.

00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:46.880 align:middle line:90%
It's doing nothing.

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:49.270 align:middle line:84%
So there's all of
this processing power.

00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:53.500 align:middle line:84%
Literally millions of
petahashes, all this CPU power,

00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:55.150 align:middle line:90%
doing nothing.

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:57.850 align:middle line:84%
When this Bitcoin
becomes common knowledge,

00:41:57.850 --> 00:41:59.560 align:middle line:84%
people will put their
computers to work.

00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:00.770 align:middle line:90%
They'll download a program.

00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:02.020 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have to be Bitcoin.

00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:04.270 align:middle line:84%
There are literally
hundreds of other currencies

00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:07.480 align:middle line:84%
that they can mine, depending on
the capability or the strength

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:08.980 align:middle line:90%
of their computers.

00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:11.320 align:middle line:84%
So then their computers
are securing the networks,

00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:12.970 align:middle line:84%
processing transactions,
essentially

00:42:12.970 --> 00:42:16.420 align:middle line:84%
doing what a bank does--
and getting rewarded

00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:18.700 align:middle line:90%
in fractions of a coin.

00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:22.810 align:middle line:84%
So my computers are mining
two particular coin.

00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:24.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm not at home, but
yet they're working

00:42:24.970 --> 00:42:28.067 align:middle line:84%
and they're earning me
coins, which are then

00:42:28.067 --> 00:42:29.650 align:middle line:84%
convertible to
Bitcoin, which are then

00:42:29.650 --> 00:42:31.900 align:middle line:90%
convertible to fiat money.

00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:33.340 align:middle line:90%
Spendable money.

00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:36.550 align:middle line:84%
So what will happen when
the next system goes down?

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:39.700 align:middle line:84%
Either they open the
fire hose and print

00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:41.800 align:middle line:84%
and print and print and
print and print money

00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:44.170 align:middle line:90%
to try to get inflation to go.

00:42:44.170 --> 00:42:47.680 align:middle line:84%
So that our money, our
debts, the government's debts

00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:49.870 align:middle line:90%
are more easily paid off.

00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:53.620 align:middle line:84%
So if you took out of
house loan in 1978--

00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:57.400 align:middle line:84%
let's say it was a $50,000
house-- your house payment is

00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:59.170 align:middle line:90%
under $400.

00:42:59.170 --> 00:43:02.740 align:middle line:84%
Which is very easy to
pay in today's dollars.

00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:05.730 align:middle line:90%
Not so much 30 years ago.

00:43:05.730 --> 00:43:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And this is the beauty
of inflation for them.

00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:11.740 align:middle line:84%
So these currencies,
these cryptocurrencies

00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:12.880 align:middle line:90%
can be deflationary.

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:14.710 align:middle line:90%
Bitcoin is deflationary.

00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:18.340 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that the value
of the coin goes up.

00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:20.180 align:middle line:90%
So six years ago--

00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:22.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Rather than with
currencies where it goes down.

00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:25.090 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Six years ago
it was worth less than $1.

00:43:25.090 --> 00:43:30.355 align:middle line:84%
Now it's worth, in mid-August of
2016, worth in the $560, $570,

00:43:30.355 --> 00:43:31.940 align:middle line:90%
$580 range.

00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:34.570 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that that
house payment requires

00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:36.815 align:middle line:90%
maybe 6/10, 7/10 of a Bitcoin.

00:43:36.815 --> 00:43:39.460 align:middle line:84%
That $400 house
payment-- or now it's

00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:42.350 align:middle line:84%
a car payment-- at
that price point.

00:43:42.350 --> 00:43:45.970 align:middle line:84%
So as the value of this
coin goes up-- and it will,

00:43:45.970 --> 00:43:48.890 align:middle line:84%
because people, do I
buy government bonds?

00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:49.690 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:43:49.690 --> 00:43:51.720 align:middle line:84%
Am I going to give
the government--

00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:53.740 align:middle line:84%
and in the case with
Switzerland, their debt

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:56.080 align:middle line:84%
after 30 years, the
Swiss or whoever's

00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:58.090 align:middle line:84%
investing in Swiss
government bonds,

00:43:58.090 --> 00:44:01.504 align:middle line:84%
paying them money for that
government to say, hm,

00:44:01.504 --> 00:44:02.920 align:middle line:84%
what are we going
to do with this?

00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:04.210 align:middle line:90%
How do we service our debt?

00:44:04.210 --> 00:44:06.190 align:middle line:84%
And when you get
your bond back, it's

00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:09.100 align:middle line:84%
going to be worth less
than what you paid.

00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And this is happening
in Japan and China.

00:44:11.350 --> 00:44:13.774 align:middle line:84%
Not in China yet, but
it's all over the world.

00:44:13.774 --> 00:44:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So where are
governments in their position

00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:17.800 align:middle line:90%
on cryptocurrencies?

00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:19.960 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems like if
there's an opportunity,

00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:21.820 align:middle line:84%
they're already in
it and all over it.

00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:23.650 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: They
love it and hate it.

00:44:23.650 --> 00:44:25.810 align:middle line:90%
They can see the wisdom of it.

00:44:25.810 --> 00:44:28.280 align:middle line:84%
They can see that if
the blockchain, meaning

00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:33.130 align:middle line:84%
an immutable, undisputed
record of transactions, then

00:44:33.130 --> 00:44:35.380 align:middle line:84%
the Pentagon wouldn't
have gone up in the press

00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:37.390 align:middle line:84%
conference the day
before 9/11 and say, hey,

00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:39.347 align:middle line:90%
we lost $2.4 trillion dollars.

00:44:39.347 --> 00:44:40.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Where did it go?

00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:40.870 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Where did it go?

00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:41.900 align:middle line:84%
It would all be
on the blockchain.

00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:42.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there's
a certain amount

00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:44.162 align:middle line:90%
of transparency involved.

00:44:44.162 --> 00:44:45.870 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: That's
exactly what it brings.

00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:47.170 align:middle line:90%
It brings transparency.

00:44:47.170 --> 00:44:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And yet, if the Pentagon wanted
to go misspend $2.4 trillion

00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:53.650 align:middle line:84%
with Bitcoin, they would
have to go out and purchase

00:44:53.650 --> 00:44:55.150 align:middle line:90%
that Bitcoin.

00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:57.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Didn't they
do that at one point?

00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:57.390 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: No.

00:44:57.390 --> 00:44:57.760 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no, no.

00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:58.810 align:middle line:90%
They're nowhere near it.

00:44:58.810 --> 00:44:59.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No?

00:44:59.290 --> 00:45:00.090 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: No.

00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:02.440 align:middle line:84%
But if they were to
go buy that Bitcoin,

00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:04.450 align:middle line:84%
the value of the Bitcoins
in existence today

00:45:04.450 --> 00:45:07.810 align:middle line:84%
would have been up
at least $160,000.

00:45:07.810 --> 00:45:11.140 align:middle line:84%
Because you see somebody
accumulating this asset,

00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:15.280 align:middle line:84%
just as you would gold,
and its value goes up.

00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:18.910 align:middle line:84%
And so, now you can have-- you
would set up a bank account,

00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:22.240 align:middle line:84%
buy your Bitcoin, and then
you can travel with a QR code.

00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:23.840 align:middle line:90%
Most of us know what those are.

00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:27.040 align:middle line:84%
Little block with black digits
in there, and then a code.

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:30.010 align:middle line:84%
You can go to England
and withdraw it in pound.

00:45:30.010 --> 00:45:32.530 align:middle line:84%
You can go to France
and withdraw it in euro.

00:45:32.530 --> 00:45:35.220 align:middle line:84%
You go to Japan,
withdraw it in yen.

00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:39.530 align:middle line:84%
And so you have this currency
that will appreciate in value,

00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:40.750 align:middle line:90%
that is global.

00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:44.740 align:middle line:84%
It truly becomes the first
global reserve currency.

00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:48.010 align:middle line:84%
And when it becomes
adopted, and we

00:45:48.010 --> 00:45:50.320 align:middle line:84%
realize that the safety
of bonds isn't there,

00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:52.270 align:middle line:84%
the safety of real
estate being over-bought,

00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:54.700 align:middle line:84%
that stocks are
manipulated up in price,

00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:58.390 align:middle line:84%
there will be a torrent of
funds looking for a safe haven.

00:45:58.390 --> 00:46:01.090 align:middle line:84%
Someplace that can't
be confiscated.

00:46:01.090 --> 00:46:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to end up being
these anonymous currencies that

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:06.870 align:middle line:90%
are numerous in number.

00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:08.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, one
thing you just said

00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:11.440 align:middle line:84%
there, which I know a lot of
people's ears will perk up at,

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:13.600 align:middle line:84%
is it becomes the
first global currency.

00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:17.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, now, so going back
into the world of esoterica.

00:46:17.130 --> 00:46:18.526 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:46:18.526 --> 00:46:19.900 align:middle line:84%
We have a person
that I interview

00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:21.760 align:middle line:90%
on occasion, Sheila Gillette.

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:22.980 align:middle line:90%
She channels the Theo group.

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And I had asked them
about the future of money

00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:30.430 align:middle line:84%
and forms of government in
the future around the planet.

00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:34.725 align:middle line:84%
And they said there will be more
of a global kind of government

00:46:34.725 --> 00:46:36.850 align:middle line:84%
at some point, and there
will be a global currency.

00:46:36.850 --> 00:46:37.510 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Absolutely.

00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:38.968 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they
said, however it

00:46:38.968 --> 00:46:41.080 align:middle line:84%
will be responsible
to the people,

00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:42.910 align:middle line:90%
not what you think of as now.

00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:44.660 align:middle line:84%
Because there will
be that transparency.

00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:45.460 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Exactly.

00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:48.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So are you seeing,
with them saying that,

00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:51.220 align:middle line:84%
would you say that
the Bitcoin and

00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:53.710 align:middle line:84%
these other cryptocurrencies
are part of that movement?

00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:54.290 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: It's the
tip of the iceberg.

00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:56.706 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's being taken
back in the hands of people?

00:46:56.706 --> 00:46:59.390 align:middle line:84%
It's a populist movement to
create a global currency?

00:46:59.390 --> 00:47:00.190 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Yep.

00:47:00.190 --> 00:47:03.342 align:middle line:84%
And then we dictate how
valuable the currency becomes.

00:47:03.342 --> 00:47:05.050 align:middle line:84%
There's another currency
called Ethereum,

00:47:05.050 --> 00:47:06.280 align:middle line:90%
and it's not very old.

00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:06.990 align:middle line:90%
Less than a year and a half.

00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:08.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How do you spell it?

00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:11.470 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: E-T-H-E-R-E-U-M.
E-T-H is the ticker code.

00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:12.270 align:middle line:90%
E-T-H.

00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:13.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ethereum, OK.

00:47:13.210 --> 00:47:15.210 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And there's
about 80 million of them.

00:47:15.210 --> 00:47:17.830 align:middle line:84%
But what was so
fascinating is that there

00:47:17.830 --> 00:47:22.270 align:middle line:84%
was a project
called the DAO that

00:47:22.270 --> 00:47:24.810 align:middle line:84%
secured a portion of
the Ethereum blockchain.

00:47:24.810 --> 00:47:27.950 align:middle line:84%
The Decentralized
Autonomous Organization.

00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And the Dow, as it became
known, was open to investors

00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:33.910 align:middle line:84%
to invest their Ethereum
or their Bitcoin

00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:35.470 align:middle line:90%
into this project.

00:47:35.470 --> 00:47:38.420 align:middle line:84%
They were hoping to
get maybe $10 million.

00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And what they wanted
to do with this money

00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:44.590 align:middle line:84%
is then take proposals from
inventors, from developers,

00:47:44.590 --> 00:47:48.370 align:middle line:90%
from esoteric cool ideas.

00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:50.060 align:middle line:90%
What can we do with this?

00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:53.350 align:middle line:84%
If these inventions
are up to us,

00:47:53.350 --> 00:47:56.210 align:middle line:84%
could we have a
free energy device?

00:47:56.210 --> 00:47:57.010 align:middle line:90%
What can we do?

00:47:57.010 --> 00:47:58.630 align:middle line:90%
Send us your ideas.

00:47:58.630 --> 00:48:02.710 align:middle line:84%
So instead of $10 million, they
ended up with $150 million,

00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:06.810 align:middle line:84%
saying, yeah, I want to
be a part of that future.

00:48:06.810 --> 00:48:09.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, OK, let me
just get my mind around this.

00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:11.410 align:middle line:84%
Because this is very complicated
if you haven't been--

00:48:11.410 --> 00:48:11.600 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Yeah.

00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:12.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:14.380 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:16.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, if it does not
require your own resources,

00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:17.710 align:middle line:90%
but simply--

00:48:17.710 --> 00:48:18.550 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: But it does.

00:48:18.550 --> 00:48:19.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, that's
what we need to find out.

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:19.930 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Yes and no.

00:48:19.930 --> 00:48:21.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because if you're
just using your computer to run

00:48:21.550 --> 00:48:22.350 align:middle line:90%
these algorithms--

00:48:22.350 --> 00:48:23.990 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: It's a
slow way to get in.

00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:48:24.790 --> 00:48:26.614 align:middle line:90%
Because I was going to say--

00:48:26.614 --> 00:48:28.780 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: That was what I
learned in December, when

00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:30.470 align:middle line:90%
I started mining these coins.

00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:33.425 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, I'm
going to buy these.

00:48:33.425 --> 00:48:34.850 align:middle line:90%
This Is taking too long.

00:48:34.850 --> 00:48:35.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm impatient.

00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And by nature I see
where this is going,

00:48:38.890 --> 00:48:41.320 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted a bigger
stake in the game.

00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:43.900 align:middle line:84%
So I already had several
Bitcoin off to the side.

00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:46.430 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, this is cheap.

00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:48.820 align:middle line:84%
Let's just-- I started buying
these, and then researching

00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:50.200 align:middle line:90%
all these other coins.

00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:53.200 align:middle line:84%
And you can send one
coin from me to you.

00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:55.570 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to go
all in one lump sum.

00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:57.140 align:middle line:90%
It can be randomized.

00:48:57.140 --> 00:48:59.710 align:middle line:84%
So the transaction
happens with a cryptokey

00:48:59.710 --> 00:49:01.210 align:middle line:90%
at your end and my end.

00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:05.200 align:middle line:84%
But then it's broken up into
six different keys, spread out

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:06.640 align:middle line:90%
over maybe 20, 30 minutes.

00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:09.580 align:middle line:84%
So you can't forensically come
back and go from time to time.

00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:13.120 align:middle line:84%
So if I sent you this
at 11:07 and 22 seconds,

00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:15.550 align:middle line:84%
it had arrived at your
place six seconds later,

00:49:15.550 --> 00:49:16.570 align:middle line:90%
or two seconds later.

00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:19.360 align:middle line:84%
That's how fast
this stuff happens.

00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're going
to have is privacy back

00:49:22.510 --> 00:49:24.100 align:middle line:90%
in our financial transactions.

00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:26.620 align:middle line:90%
Privacy back in our savings.

00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:30.926 align:middle line:84%
And with a government that wants
to take everything you've got,

00:49:30.926 --> 00:49:32.800 align:middle line:84%
or know everything that's
happening with you,

00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:35.080 align:middle line:84%
we have to go
toe-to-toe with them.

00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:36.214 align:middle line:90%
We have to have those--

00:49:36.214 --> 00:49:38.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this
completely circumvents this.

00:49:38.130 --> 00:49:40.004 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
what happened in Florida

00:49:40.004 --> 00:49:42.040 align:middle line:84%
with the judge, and
help people understand

00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:43.300 align:middle line:90%
this just a little bit better.

00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going to ask you
another question about primer

00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:46.120 align:middle line:90%
courses.

00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:48.340 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Because
there was a-- well,

00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:50.110 align:middle line:90%
the question is, what is it?

00:49:50.110 --> 00:49:54.434 align:middle line:84%
I mean, truly that
is the "what is it?"

00:49:54.434 --> 00:49:55.312 align:middle line:90%
What is money?

00:49:55.312 --> 00:49:57.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's like a product
of an algorithm of some kind.

00:49:57.770 --> 00:49:57.960 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Thank you.

00:49:57.960 --> 00:49:59.500 align:middle line:90%
At its most general scale.

00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:00.770 align:middle line:90%
But what is money?

00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:04.420 align:middle line:84%
A unit of accounting, a
store of value, and a medium

00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:05.590 align:middle line:90%
of exchange.

00:50:05.590 --> 00:50:08.050 align:middle line:90%
Those three things define money.

00:50:08.050 --> 00:50:11.410 align:middle line:84%
And yet Bitcoin, because
you determine it has value,

00:50:11.410 --> 00:50:16.402 align:middle line:84%
and there is an open 24/7/365
market for it-- they're

00:50:16.402 --> 00:50:18.610 align:middle line:84%
in China, they're in the
states, they're in-- I mean,

00:50:18.610 --> 00:50:20.740 align:middle line:84%
there are global markets
for this currency.

00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:22.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like gold
that closes on Friday

00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:25.010 align:middle line:84%
and doesn't open, gap up
or gap down, on Monday.

00:50:25.010 --> 00:50:25.810 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:50:25.810 --> 00:50:28.410 align:middle line:90%
It's open 24/7.

00:50:28.410 --> 00:50:29.729 align:middle line:90%
A unit of accounting.

00:50:29.729 --> 00:50:31.270 align:middle line:84%
Some of these coins
you're getting so

00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:33.790 align:middle line:84%
developed that we can have
smart contracts on them.

00:50:33.790 --> 00:50:38.650 align:middle line:84%
So let's say that Target has
a coin, an Ethereum coin.

00:50:38.650 --> 00:50:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And they have an agreement
with a supplier in China,

00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:44.420 align:middle line:84%
that when a certain
condition is met,

00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:48.070 align:middle line:84%
the supplier scans the code, it
triggers the payment to Target.

00:50:48.070 --> 00:50:51.080 align:middle line:84%
Or Target triggers the
payment to the supplier.

00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:53.500 align:middle line:84%
And so these things
take-- literally the banks

00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:55.540 align:middle line:90%
become dumb pipelines.

00:50:55.540 --> 00:50:57.760 align:middle line:84%
One of the big issues with
the last financial crisis

00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:59.430 align:middle line:90%
was letters of credit.

00:50:59.430 --> 00:51:01.630 align:middle line:84%
That if the banks
are not solvent,

00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:05.140 align:middle line:84%
then how is the manufacturer,
distributor, warehouse dude

00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:07.030 align:middle line:90%
going to get paid for his work?

00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:09.280 align:middle line:84%
If all of a sudden that
big bank letter of credit

00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:10.624 align:middle line:90%
it isn't any good.

00:51:10.624 --> 00:51:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the
blockchain and these cryptos--

00:51:12.790 --> 00:51:14.581 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it
circumvents the banks.

00:51:14.581 --> 00:51:16.420 align:middle line:84%
But doesn't this
necessarily mean a bank,

00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:18.460 align:middle line:84%
if enough people
bought into it, this

00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:21.250 align:middle line:84%
means the banks would
essentially become--

00:51:21.250 --> 00:51:22.270 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Dumb.

00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:23.560 align:middle line:90%
Dumb and useless.

00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:27.407 align:middle line:84%
And so 90%-plus of their
workforce will be let go.

00:51:27.407 --> 00:51:28.990 align:middle line:84%
And so how are they
going to get paid?

00:51:28.990 --> 00:51:30.406 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've got a
computer at home.

00:51:30.406 --> 00:51:32.140 align:middle line:90%
I've got to join the revolution.

00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:34.540 align:middle line:84%
And then they have
to start working.

00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:37.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how much of this
requires-- in your opinion,

00:51:37.570 --> 00:51:40.000 align:middle line:90%
you've dealt with it-- faith?

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:41.140 align:middle line:90%
Faith in the system?

00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:42.490 align:middle line:90%
Faith in the coins?

00:51:42.490 --> 00:51:45.380 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: What base-- what
is the basis of our dollar?

00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:48.156 align:middle line:84%
Full failing credit of the
United States government.

00:51:48.156 --> 00:51:49.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is true.

00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:50.613 align:middle line:84%
But it's just been
a perpetual pattern

00:51:50.613 --> 00:51:52.489 align:middle line:84%
for so long, that people,
kind of by default,

00:51:52.489 --> 00:51:54.113 align:middle line:84%
have faith that you
can go to the store

00:51:54.113 --> 00:51:55.420 align:middle line:90%
and get something with it.

00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:58.540 align:middle line:84%
But in this, where they can't
see it, touch it or understand

00:51:58.540 --> 00:51:59.340 align:middle line:90%
it, exactly--

00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:01.480 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And yet my
debit card, I can't see,

00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:02.710 align:middle line:90%
touch any of that.

00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:04.360 align:middle line:90%
It's the same thing.

00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:07.810 align:middle line:84%
Except-- how do I
want to say this?--

00:52:07.810 --> 00:52:11.950 align:middle line:84%
when you go to a consumer or a
vendor or a merchant that takes

00:52:11.950 --> 00:52:15.520 align:middle line:84%
Bitcoin, more likely than not,
they will give you a discount

00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:17.260 align:middle line:90%
for using Bitcoin.

00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:20.650 align:middle line:84%
Simply because the
value of the Bitcoin

00:52:20.650 --> 00:52:24.790 align:middle line:90%
will go up while they hold it.

00:52:24.790 --> 00:52:26.500 align:middle line:84%
Because they have
that much faith in it.

00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:27.760 align:middle line:90%
Overstock.com one of them.

00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:28.561 align:middle line:90%
Not to drop names.

00:52:28.561 --> 00:52:30.518 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I was going
to ask you to give us

00:52:30.518 --> 00:52:32.500 align:middle line:84%
the name of several
companies that are actually

00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:33.200 align:middle line:90%
accepting Bitcoin.

00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:34.000 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Amazon.

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:34.870 align:middle line:90%
Newegg.

00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:35.830 align:middle line:90%
Microsoft.

00:52:35.830 --> 00:52:39.010 align:middle line:84%
Microsoft, their whole
cloud-based platform, Azure,

00:52:39.010 --> 00:52:41.200 align:middle line:90%
is going to be Ethereum-based.

00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:42.940 align:middle line:84%
So that they don't
have to have people

00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:45.040 align:middle line:84%
in there dealing with
contracts and managing this.

00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:47.690 align:middle line:84%
This is all going to
be done by-- honestly,

00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:51.370 align:middle line:84%
it will be all our computers
running the Ethereum network.

00:52:51.370 --> 00:52:55.510 align:middle line:84%
And so, for us devoting our
computer-- 90% of our computing

00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:57.910 align:middle line:84%
processor-- to these
coins, mining these coins,

00:52:57.910 --> 00:53:00.640 align:middle line:84%
securing these networks,
dealing with the transactions,

00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:04.280 align:middle line:84%
we get rewarded by an
aspect of that currency.

00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:06.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's a true
democratization of money.

00:53:06.730 --> 00:53:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: It's
decentralized money.

00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:11.410 align:middle line:90%
And that will set us free.

00:53:11.410 --> 00:53:14.820 align:middle line:84%
Free from the tyranny
of these banks.

00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:17.410 align:middle line:84%
And I hope it doesn't
take a crisis,

00:53:17.410 --> 00:53:18.620 align:middle line:90%
but more than likely it does.

00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:19.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Probably.

00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:21.370 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: It is that
which moves us out

00:53:21.370 --> 00:53:23.550 align:middle line:90%
of our comfort zone.

00:53:23.550 --> 00:53:25.925 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And tying
this all back together,

00:53:25.925 --> 00:53:28.510 align:middle line:84%
you originally said
that the chemtrails

00:53:28.510 --> 00:53:31.600 align:middle line:84%
will stop when the
monetary benefit to them

00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:32.800 align:middle line:90%
is no longer there.

00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:35.570 align:middle line:84%
Meaning when you can't control
large sums of money in the way

00:53:35.570 --> 00:53:36.370 align:middle line:90%
they have been.

00:53:36.370 --> 00:53:37.330 align:middle line:90%
The movement of money.

00:53:37.330 --> 00:53:38.829 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Meaning
when those planes

00:53:38.829 --> 00:53:42.400 align:middle line:84%
can't get the fuel because
the money system isn't there.

00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:46.030 align:middle line:84%
When Boeing and Lockheed
and Lear and Gulfstream

00:53:46.030 --> 00:53:49.390 align:middle line:84%
and Bombardier, and all these
aircraft companies can't get

00:53:49.390 --> 00:53:51.944 align:middle line:84%
paid via the dollar
to build the aircraft.

00:53:51.944 --> 00:53:53.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Meaning if
they were-- they probably

00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:55.651 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't be paid if
their transactions were

00:53:55.651 --> 00:53:56.680 align:middle line:90%
made transparent, right?

00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:57.400 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Thank you.

00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:57.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:53:57.730 --> 00:53:59.646 align:middle line:84%
When they had to do a
full accounting, because

00:53:59.646 --> 00:54:02.160 align:middle line:84%
of the blockchain, of where
their resources, their moneys

00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:02.960 align:middle line:90%
are coming from.

00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:06.070 align:middle line:84%
Because the dark
pool then disappears.

00:54:06.070 --> 00:54:07.240 align:middle line:90%
I mean, yes and no.

00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:09.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can
have other layers,

00:54:09.850 --> 00:54:11.560 align:middle line:84%
but that value in
this dark layer

00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:15.790 align:middle line:84%
has got to come into this
transparent system eventually.

00:54:15.790 --> 00:54:17.532 align:middle line:90%
Eventually.

00:54:17.532 --> 00:54:19.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's the first time
I've heard someone explain it

00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:22.000 align:middle line:84%
in this particular
way, you know,

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:23.860 align:middle line:84%
rather than just
trying to explain

00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:26.390 align:middle line:90%
how this thing exists at all.

00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:29.799 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And that's still kind
of mysteriously cool, in a way.

00:54:29.799 --> 00:54:31.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, yeah, I
mean, I still can't quite

00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:34.390 align:middle line:84%
get my mind around it,
looking in a digital way

00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:35.590 align:middle line:90%
through the maze.

00:54:35.590 --> 00:54:39.100 align:middle line:84%
What happens, though,
in terms of fears

00:54:39.100 --> 00:54:43.430 align:middle line:84%
of if the poo really hits the
fan and the grid goes down?

00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:44.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:46.563 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I don't think the
grid will go down entirely.

00:54:46.563 --> 00:54:49.669 align:middle line:84%
I think there will be periods of
time where it comes in and out.

00:54:49.669 --> 00:54:51.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How do you
do transactions when--

00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:54.430 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: They need it
more than that we need it.

00:54:54.430 --> 00:54:55.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they need
it to watch us.

00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:57.810 align:middle line:84%
They need it to
keep their sniffers

00:54:57.810 --> 00:54:59.860 align:middle line:90%
and their awareness-- the NSA.

00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:02.860 align:middle line:84%
The system needs it up and
operating, otherwise they

00:55:02.860 --> 00:55:04.464 align:middle line:90%
lose control of us.

00:55:04.464 --> 00:55:06.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What happens
if it's something

00:55:06.130 --> 00:55:07.300 align:middle line:90%
even beyond their control?

00:55:07.300 --> 00:55:08.425 align:middle line:90%
Beyond anyone's control?

00:55:08.425 --> 00:55:08.930 align:middle line:90%
Natural forces.

00:55:08.930 --> 00:55:11.305 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And I anticipate
that that's what will happen.

00:55:11.305 --> 00:55:13.315 align:middle line:90%
The ATMs will be dark, too.

00:55:13.315 --> 00:55:14.190 align:middle line:90%
They'll be dark, too.

00:55:14.190 --> 00:55:17.500 align:middle line:84%
But, because this is a
decentralized system,

00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:20.950 align:middle line:84%
there'll still be a server
running in South Africa.

00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:23.920 align:middle line:90%
Still managing the blockchain.

00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And one in India,
maybe one in Sri Lanka.

00:55:26.890 --> 00:55:29.290 align:middle line:84%
And then when the system
reboots, comes back on,

00:55:29.290 --> 00:55:30.880 align:middle line:84%
other people connect,
infrastructure

00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:32.872 align:middle line:90%
gets rebuilt-- there it is.

00:55:32.872 --> 00:55:34.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But in
the interim, you'd

00:55:34.330 --> 00:55:35.535 align:middle line:84%
better have your
own heirloom seeds

00:55:35.535 --> 00:55:36.590 align:middle line:90%
and have your own chickens.

00:55:36.590 --> 00:55:38.140 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Yeah, that's why
we have our food closet.

00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:39.376 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:55:39.376 --> 00:55:40.200 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:42.408 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When we were
talking off-camera about this,

00:55:42.408 --> 00:55:45.790 align:middle line:84%
you were saying that
the system really--

00:55:45.790 --> 00:55:49.180 align:middle line:84%
but whether Republican,
Democrat, and all this nonsense

00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:52.300 align:middle line:84%
having to do politics, and
conservatism versus liberal

00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:53.740 align:middle line:90%
versus progressive.

00:55:53.740 --> 00:56:00.430 align:middle line:84%
That there is a process
of humbling or humiliation

00:56:00.430 --> 00:56:04.690 align:middle line:84%
that we need to go through
as a species in order for any

00:56:04.690 --> 00:56:06.370 align:middle line:90%
of this to really be embraced.

00:56:06.370 --> 00:56:08.490 align:middle line:90%
Can you talk about that?

00:56:08.490 --> 00:56:10.870 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: We kind of
briefly mentioned it earlier,

00:56:10.870 --> 00:56:15.820 align:middle line:84%
that nothing really changes
until you're forced to change.

00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:18.980 align:middle line:84%
I remember a time when my
parents were humbled simply

00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:21.400 align:middle line:84%
because of Dad was
going to school.

00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And on my plate, I was probably
six years old at the time,

00:56:25.310 --> 00:56:27.284 align:middle line:90%
was this pool of ketchup.

00:56:27.284 --> 00:56:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, is
that all we get?

00:56:29.660 --> 00:56:32.150 align:middle line:90%
Is that all we get?

00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:35.870 align:middle line:84%
So we all get to this
point where what we have,

00:56:35.870 --> 00:56:38.220 align:middle line:84%
what we've been comfortable
with, is taken away from us.

00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:41.120 align:middle line:84%
Either we lose a job,
we get into an accident,

00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:43.020 align:middle line:90%
we have a health crisis.

00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:46.520 align:middle line:84%
But as you know, karma
exists at all levels,

00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:50.750 align:middle line:84%
whether it's us as individuals,
family units, genetic history

00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:53.350 align:middle line:90%
lines, or countries.

00:56:53.350 --> 00:56:55.310 align:middle line:90%
And there are karma.

00:56:55.310 --> 00:56:57.830 align:middle line:84%
There's a karma coming back
to this country for the things

00:56:57.830 --> 00:56:59.000 align:middle line:90%
that have happened.

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:00.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I would
say all countries.

00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:01.280 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: All of them.

00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:02.500 align:middle line:90%
Every unit has a group.

00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:04.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a time
of a kind of reckoning

00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:07.040 align:middle line:84%
of our ethical and
moral behaviors.

00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:09.120 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: To bring
us back to center.

00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:10.910 align:middle line:84%
It will be a slap
across the face.

00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:12.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
it's going to come.

00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:14.780 align:middle line:84%
The planet, we've
poisoned the water,

00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:17.090 align:middle line:90%
so there may be water issues.

00:57:17.090 --> 00:57:19.340 align:middle line:84%
We've put toxic
stuff in the air,

00:57:19.340 --> 00:57:22.370 align:middle line:90%
so there may be wind issues.

00:57:22.370 --> 00:57:24.590 align:middle line:10%
There's plenty of
reasons, and plenty

00:57:24.590 --> 00:57:26.892 align:middle line:10%
of reasons for these
elements, if you want to go in

00:57:26.892 --> 00:57:28.100 align:middle line:10%
at the very, very base level.

00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:30.370 align:middle line:10%
You know, fire,
water, earth, air.

00:57:30.370 --> 00:57:34.010 align:middle line:10%
To come back at us for
how we've treated them.

00:57:34.010 --> 00:57:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And so, whatever
is coming is big.

00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:38.769 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I would think so.

00:57:38.769 --> 00:57:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And I think in the end, it
comes back to each one of us

00:57:41.060 --> 00:57:42.890 align:middle line:84%
to ask those questions
of ourselves, right?

00:57:42.890 --> 00:57:43.904 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Absolutely.

00:57:43.904 --> 00:57:45.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Any final--
we're out of time.

00:57:45.570 --> 00:57:48.069 align:middle line:84%
Any final statement you'd like
to make before we wrap it up?

00:57:48.069 --> 00:57:49.352 align:middle line:90%
It's been a wonderful romp.

00:57:49.352 --> 00:57:51.560 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Just that there's
beautiful things coming.

00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:51.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:57:51.930 --> 00:57:54.320 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And our destiny
will be back in our hands

00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:56.080 align:middle line:90%
before you know it.

00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:57.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: On that, perfect.

00:57:57.290 --> 00:57:58.544 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Scott.

00:57:58.544 --> 00:57:59.460 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: You betcha.

00:57:59.460 --> 00:58:01.168 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To follow
more on Scott's work,

00:58:01.168 --> 00:58:02.771 align:middle line:90%
you can go to weatherwars.org.

00:58:02.771 --> 00:58:04.770 align:middle line:10%
If you haven't already
seen our first interview,

00:58:04.770 --> 00:58:07.610 align:middle line:10%
you might want to take a look
at that as a primer to this one.

00:58:07.610 --> 00:58:09.800 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:11.950 align:middle line:10%
on "Open Minds."
