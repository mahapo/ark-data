>>REGINA MEREDITH:
I can't tell you

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.850 align:middle line:10%
how many people I come
across who, at any age,

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.030 align:middle line:10%
do not understand what
their purpose in life is.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.040 align:middle line:84%
This causes a deep
kind of despair

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.530 align:middle line:84%
and sends one searching for
their own version of the Holy

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.650 align:middle line:84%
Grail, or they sink into
depression and apathy.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.320 align:middle line:84%
Simon Chokoisky has
found his unique path

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.580 align:middle line:84%
after discovering some profound
Vedic wisdoms, which led him

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.850 align:middle line:84%
to mastering Sanskrit
and authoring

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.530 align:middle line:84%
books on using Vedic
typology to discover

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.150 align:middle line:90%
our true purpose in life.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Today he's there to talk
about the five dharma types,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.702 align:middle line:84%
and we've been having a lot of
fun in the makeup room talking

00:01:00.702 --> 00:01:02.910 align:middle line:84%
about this with the makeup
artists, and some of which

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.640 align:middle line:84%
we'll get into because this
is highly nuanced information.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.860 align:middle line:84%
You can only do so much
in your book, which is

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.150 align:middle line:90%
beautifully done, by the way.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON CHOKOISKY: Thank you.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.555 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But we'll even
take it a little bit

00:01:12.555 --> 00:01:15.650 align:middle line:84%
beyond just as a tease so people
can start seeing themselves

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:16.520 align:middle line:90%
in the story.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.020 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Well,
that's the thing.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.150 align:middle line:10%
Dharma types are everywhere,
and they don't exist--

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.300 align:middle line:10%
they're not just in a book.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.542 align:middle line:10%
They're in everyday life,
like the laws-- like gravity.

00:01:25.542 --> 00:01:28.000 align:middle line:10%
You know it's there, but you
can't put your finger on it,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.470 align:middle line:10%
and it affects you
every day of your life.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.120 align:middle line:84%
So knowing your
archetype, knowing

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.360 align:middle line:84%
who you are at
your core can help

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.770 align:middle line:84%
affect-- can help you steer
your destiny and find happiness.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, now
what about you?

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, you started out in a
completely different area

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.310 align:middle line:84%
of life, and I want to talk
about have you-- share with us

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.650 align:middle line:84%
so we get to know you, but where
you were, where you are now.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.250 align:middle line:84%
Were you living your
truth in the past or not?

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: In some way, yes,
but I used to work in fitness.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.440 align:middle line:84%
I've been in sales,
but looking back,

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.930 align:middle line:84%
the things that-- I've always
been an educator, and even as

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.520 align:middle line:84%
a fitness consultant,
my focus was

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.340 align:middle line:84%
to teach people, to show them
how to do a proper exercise.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.220 align:middle line:84%
Even when I was
selling timeshare--

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.300 align:middle line:84%
I was a horrible
timeshare salesperson--

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.630 align:middle line:90%
I would counsel the person.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:20.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You would
try to educate them--

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.190 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: I would
try to educate them.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.898 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --rather
than sell, sell, sell.

00:02:22.898 --> 00:02:25.700 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: And here were my
merchant friends and coworkers

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.880 align:middle line:84%
just selling away and
doing a great job,

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.930 align:middle line:84%
and I was having this deep,
profound counseling session

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.800 align:middle line:84%
with my client, because
as educators, we're

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.090 align:middle line:90%
fundamentally counselors.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.395 align:middle line:84%
We're here to convey
information and be diplomats.

00:02:41.395 --> 00:02:42.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That makes sense.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.080 align:middle line:84%
Once upon a time,
a long, long time

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.100 align:middle line:84%
ago, I, too, was in
the capacity to sell,

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.520 align:middle line:84%
and I was supposed to
be selling jewelry.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.630 align:middle line:84%
And what I was doing was
talking people out of things

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.400 align:middle line:84%
that I really thought I
would try to educate them

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.110 align:middle line:84%
as to which might
be more flattering,

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.935 align:middle line:90%
and is that within their budget?

00:02:58.935 --> 00:03:00.717 align:middle line:90%
I lost my job in no time.

00:03:00.717 --> 00:03:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: I'm sure it drove
your boss crazy as it did mine.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.132 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It did.

00:03:04.132 --> 00:03:04.870 align:middle line:90%
It did.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.480 align:middle line:84%
So now what happened
that allowed you to go

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.000 align:middle line:90%
so deeply into these studies?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.100 align:middle line:84%
You have multiple
languages you speak.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.310 align:middle line:90%
You speak Sanskrit.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.730 align:middle line:90%
You read Sanskrit.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.660 align:middle line:84%
So you were able to,
in a very refined way,

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.280 align:middle line:84%
put this information
together, right?

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yeah.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, Sanskrit is
a very deep well,

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.700 align:middle line:84%
and I think I've just
only skimmed the surface,

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.940 align:middle line:84%
so I just want to set
that record straight.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And I've always had
this search for truth,

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.210 align:middle line:84%
because as I write in the book,
you can be one dharma type,

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.650 align:middle line:84%
but you go through
different life cycles.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.330 align:middle line:84%
So for example, it's
like being born American,

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.830 align:middle line:84%
but you go travel
through Greece,

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.080 align:middle line:84%
you travel through Italy,
and your American-ness

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.110 align:middle line:84%
expresses differently
in different phases

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.510 align:middle line:84%
of your life in different
places that you go.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.900 align:middle line:84%
So I was in a huge
outsider period,

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.980 align:middle line:84%
and when you, or anyone,
is in an outsider period,

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:57.690 align:middle line:90%
you're searching.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:58.380 align:middle line:90%
You're questing.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.560 align:middle line:84%
You're on the
periphery of society,

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.890 align:middle line:84%
and unless you have
something particularly

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.310 align:middle line:84%
valuable like the newest
internet money making scheme

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.690 align:middle line:84%
or something out of the box
that can make money for society,

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.150 align:middle line:90%
typically you're on the outside.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.080 align:middle line:90%
You're not welcome.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.450 align:middle line:90%
You're not part of it.

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.519 align:middle line:90%
So this took a lot of research.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.470 align:middle line:84%
It took eight years to write
the book, but what I've found

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:26.480 align:middle line:84%
is that every culture from
the Hawaiians, the Polynesian,

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.910 align:middle line:84%
to the northern Europe, to India
has a version of these types,

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.260 align:middle line:84%
and I've tried to
convey that in the book.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So is
this original work

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.870 align:middle line:84%
where you've taken all these
different characteristics

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.332 align:middle line:84%
and overlaid them
to create this?

00:04:42.332 --> 00:04:44.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yeah, I guess
it's original in the sense

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.520 align:middle line:84%
that I've compiled
information, but it's not mine.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.150 align:middle line:84%
This doesn't belong
to me, and that's

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.270 align:middle line:84%
the key to the outsider--
is, as an outsider,

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.770 align:middle line:84%
you have to blend
different things

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.140 align:middle line:84%
and pull from different
areas of life.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.820 align:middle line:90%
So you have Tae Bo.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.260 align:middle line:84%
Someone took-- this
is an old example.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.890 align:middle line:84%
I should use a different
one-- Thai boxing and boxing,

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.740 align:middle line:90%
or fusion cuisine.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.450 align:middle line:84%
There's a chef out there
who was an outsider chef,

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.950 align:middle line:84%
and he or she said, man, I love
sushi, but I also love steak.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.940 align:middle line:90%
Why can't we put them together?

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.320 align:middle line:90%
That's what the outsider does.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.190 align:middle line:84%
They're able to blend things
that no one else thought

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.740 align:middle line:90%
of blending before.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.832 align:middle line:90%
Hot yoga.

00:05:24.832 --> 00:05:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's a multi-billion
dollar industry.

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.081 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, they're often
the ones who are the risk taker

00:05:29.081 --> 00:05:30.250 align:middle line:90%
innovators in society.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yeah, you
have a lot to lose,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.460 align:middle line:84%
but also if that's your
dharma, if that's who you are,

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.070 align:middle line:84%
then that's the only
thing you can do.

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's true.

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: So it seems
like a risk to someone else,

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.220 align:middle line:90%
but to an outsider it's not.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But it's not really.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.190 align:middle line:84%
We were playing a
little bit with it

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.142 align:middle line:84%
on a personal level in the back,
and you were doing my birth

00:05:46.142 --> 00:05:47.600 align:middle line:84%
date, and it looked
like one thing,

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.730 align:middle line:84%
but when I did the self
test, that all of you

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:54.350 align:middle line:84%
can do online-- when
I did the self test,

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:57.260 align:middle line:84%
I came out more as an
outsider or educator,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.440 align:middle line:84%
and I relate most
strongly to the outsider.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, you said that's because
I'm in a very long outsider

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:04.480 align:middle line:90%
cycle of life.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.790 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Correct.

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so when we're
doing these self tests

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.985 align:middle line:84%
like that, I say I don't
feel like a warrior, which

00:06:10.985 --> 00:06:12.660 align:middle line:90%
my birth date would indicate.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.660 align:middle line:90%
Explain how that works.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.260 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Well, I was
just having this conversation

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.300 align:middle line:84%
on the way over here
with the driver--

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.240 align:middle line:84%
is that we invented
astrology so that we

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.960 align:middle line:84%
can make economics
and weather prediction

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.550 align:middle line:84%
reputable in the sense that
it's difficult to predict

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.420 align:middle line:84%
using astrology, and
it's just as difficult

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.452 align:middle line:90%
to predict economics.

00:06:35.452 --> 00:06:36.160 align:middle line:90%
Anyway that's a--

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.456 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:06:37.456 --> 00:06:39.330 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: It's a
silly joke, but the point

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.850 align:middle line:84%
is that you have
to take the test,

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:43.690 align:middle line:84%
and it's a free
test in the book.

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:48.030 align:middle line:84%
The test is on the site, and
you'll come up with two types.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.230 align:middle line:84%
You came up with outsider
and one is educator.

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.880 align:middle line:10%
One type will reflect
your core dharma

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.260 align:middle line:10%
type, who you are genetically,
and that doesn't change.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.750 align:middle line:10%
What changes is the
period that you're in,

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:04.190 align:middle line:10%
and so you, Regina, are in an
outsider life cycle, outsider

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:04.690 align:middle line:10%
period.

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:06.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: For already 13 years.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.050 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Since 2002.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.910 align:middle line:84%
And beginning in that
period, your consciousness

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:13.880 align:middle line:90%
begins expanding.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:19.470 align:middle line:84%
You start taking alternative
ways of researching,

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:20.870 align:middle line:90%
of seeing the world.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:22.370 align:middle line:90%
Your gift is different.

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.277 align:middle line:84%
The 9 to 5 no longer
works for you.

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:25.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, never did.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.340 align:middle line:90%
I was very poor at that.

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.280 align:middle line:90%
Not a good person for that.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.480 align:middle line:84%
So we need to know that
when we're reading this,

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.095 align:middle line:84%
and how can one
determine the actual--

00:07:36.095 --> 00:07:37.470 align:middle line:84%
we're jumping
ahead of ourselves,

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:40.180 align:middle line:84%
but how can one determine the
cycle of life they're in so

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.220 align:middle line:84%
when they do finally
take this test they

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:43.696 align:middle line:90%
see what's influencing them?

00:07:43.696 --> 00:07:45.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: There are
exercises in the book.

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:49.340 align:middle line:84%
There are homework
assignments, and when you read,

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.610 align:middle line:84%
there is a chapter
for each dharma type.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:53.770 align:middle line:84%
And really you should
read about each one,

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:57.190 align:middle line:84%
because I guarantee you
there's someone in your family

00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:00.650 align:middle line:84%
who is each type, and
in fact, Hollywood

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:05.400 align:middle line:84%
knows this very well because
the best shows in Hollywood

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.480 align:middle line:84%
feature each one of
the dharma types.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, really?

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:09.700 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Now, I'm sure
they're not consciously--

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.616 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They don't it
consciously, but yeah.

00:08:11.616 --> 00:08:12.560 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Exactly.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.420 align:middle line:90%
So take "Friends."

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:16.960 align:middle line:90%
We have Ross is the educator.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:21.050 align:middle line:90%
We have Joey is the Warrior.

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:23.140 align:middle line:84%
Chandler is the
merchant, and so on.

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:25.810 align:middle line:84%
Each one of the dharma
types are represented,

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:29.190 align:middle line:84%
and then when we watch, we
go, oh yeah, I get that guy.

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:32.070 align:middle line:84%
I get that girl, because
we are one of those types.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:35.034 align:middle line:90%
So to have a successful show--

00:08:35.034 --> 00:08:36.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everything
is reflected.

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:39.080 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: You have to speak
to each of the dharma types

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.850 align:middle line:84%
to understand and
cohere your family

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:43.860 align:middle line:84%
you should understand
each of the dharma types,

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:45.680 align:middle line:84%
because one of your
kids may be a laborer,

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.130 align:middle line:90%
one may be a merchant.

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:49.134 align:middle line:84%
So you will discipline
this one differently

00:08:49.134 --> 00:08:50.550 align:middle line:84%
than you will
discipline this one.

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:51.591 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very important.

00:08:51.591 --> 00:08:54.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: You'll incentivize
the merchant with things,

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:57.390 align:middle line:90%
with gifts, with incentives.

00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:00.510 align:middle line:84%
The warrior is
incentivized with praise.

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:03.680 align:middle line:84%
You don't punish the warrior,
because they'll fight back.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.814 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then the
laborer needs love.

00:09:05.814 --> 00:09:07.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: And the
laborer needs love,

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.810 align:middle line:84%
and they need you to show
that you are the boss.

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:12.590 align:middle line:84%
Bruce Springsteen
is a laborer type.

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:15.580 align:middle line:84%
His name is The
Boss, and laborers

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:17.250 align:middle line:90%
are extremely hard working.

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:18.060 align:middle line:90%
They're loyal.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:19.140 align:middle line:90%
They're down to earth.

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:20.950 align:middle line:84%
Oprah Winfrey is
another laborer.

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:23.730 align:middle line:84%
They love to create
community, but communities

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.730 align:middle line:84%
created around a central
figure, and if you're a parent

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:31.172 align:middle line:84%
and your child is a laborer,
you have to be that boss,

00:09:31.172 --> 00:09:32.630 align:middle line:84%
and they will
respect you for that.

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:34.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You need the societal
structure, so to speak,

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:35.840 align:middle line:90%
the familial structure.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.260 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yes.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.897 align:middle line:84%
And structure, rules--
chores are done at this time.

00:09:39.897 --> 00:09:40.980 align:middle line:90%
This is done at that time.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.990 align:middle line:84%
Whereas for the outsider,
that will not work.

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:46.290 align:middle line:84%
If you tell the outsider
5:00 PM you got to do this.

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:47.660 align:middle line:90%
6:00 PM you got to do that.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:50.340 align:middle line:84%
7:00 PM-- they'll resent
you, and they'll run away.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.510 align:middle line:90%
The laborer appreciates it.

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:54.070 align:middle line:90%
The outsider rebels against it.

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:55.990 align:middle line:84%
So you have to understand
how to work with it.

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:58.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What a beautiful
system of insight

00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.970 align:middle line:90%
to family harmony.

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:01.470 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: And it's easy.

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:02.480 align:middle line:90%
It's not rocket science.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:02.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, no.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:03.460 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:04.490 align:middle line:90%
It's really beautiful.

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:06.650 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Because these
archetypes are in us.

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:10.130 align:middle line:84%
Walt Disney, when he draws
a hero or a heroine--

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:12.010 align:middle line:84%
doesn't matter if
you're male or female.

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:14.000 align:middle line:90%
There's that strong square jaw.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.290 align:middle line:90%
The shoulders wide.

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:16.087 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Gaston.

00:10:16.087 --> 00:10:16.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Gaston.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.295 align:middle line:90%
Everyone says Gaston.

00:10:18.295 --> 00:10:19.170 align:middle line:90%
I have to watch that.

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:20.336 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He's such a beast.

00:10:20.336 --> 00:10:23.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: I think
of Superman or Batman,

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:26.160 align:middle line:84%
but they all have the strong
jaw, the square shoulders.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And earlier we were talking
about even recognizing

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:34.010 align:middle line:84%
certain facial and body features
that identify you or identify

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:36.010 align:middle line:90%
tendencies in you.

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:38.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I would like
to put those features in.

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:39.904 align:middle line:84%
As we start going through
each of the types,

00:10:39.904 --> 00:10:41.820 align:middle line:84%
please-- I wasn't going
to ask you about that,

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.800 align:middle line:84%
but I'd like you to add
some of those features

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.985 align:middle line:84%
in so we can literally
see ourselves in it.

00:10:45.985 --> 00:10:47.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yeah, why not.

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:50.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, you were also--
this is kind of off course

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:54.430 align:middle line:84%
a little bit, but you were also
teaching medical astrology.

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:56.680 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about that for a
moment and how all of this

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:59.100 align:middle line:84%
built in to what
you're doing now.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:02.072 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Well,
astrology-- they say that--

00:11:02.072 --> 00:11:03.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was this
Vedic astrology?

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:05.071 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: This
is Vedic astrology,

00:11:05.071 --> 00:11:08.590 align:middle line:84%
but Vedic and Western
astrology are two parts

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:10.550 align:middle line:90%
of the same continuum.

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:13.590 align:middle line:84%
They're very similar, and
we share the same planet,

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:16.620 align:middle line:84%
same signs, and different
in certain ways,

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:19.990 align:middle line:84%
but the goal is to give
insight into-- let's

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:21.750 align:middle line:90%
say you're having an ailment.

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:27.010 align:middle line:84%
Using Vedic astrology, we can
see what the karma associated

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:30.950 align:middle line:84%
with that ailment is and the
timing, when we can expect

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:35.620 align:middle line:84%
it to run its
course, and also some

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:37.560 align:middle line:90%
of the more subtle influences.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:40.880 align:middle line:84%
For example, some people have
migraines, and there's no cure.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:42.900 align:middle line:84%
They don't know how
to get rid of him.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:44.590 align:middle line:84%
In the chart, we
can see maybe this

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:47.250 align:middle line:84%
is caused by a certain
planetary position,

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:49.370 align:middle line:84%
and now we can do
something about it.

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:50.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:52.760 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: So there
are alternative, I guess,

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:56.260 align:middle line:84%
healing methods that present
themselves once we look

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.160 align:middle line:90%
at the horoscope of a person.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:02.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is that something
that most Vedic or Arya Vedic

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.570 align:middle line:84%
practitioners would
be able to address,

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:08.910 align:middle line:84%
or you're putting so many
different kind of modalities

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:11.525 align:middle line:90%
over each other within it.

00:12:11.525 --> 00:12:14.300 align:middle line:84%
Are you unique in that
way being able to say

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:16.230 align:middle line:84%
let's look at your
astrology for this migraine

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:18.090 align:middle line:90%
and see how we can handle it.

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:20.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: This is not unique.

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:23.790 align:middle line:84%
It is unique in our culture,
but ancient cultures

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:26.900 align:middle line:84%
taught the ability to
hold different thoughts

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:30.900 align:middle line:84%
and to work with different
systems simultaneously.

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:34.972 align:middle line:10%
For example, in Ayurveda, we
have three mind body types,

00:12:34.972 --> 00:12:35.930 align:middle line:10%
vata, pitta, and kapha.

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:36.720 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: That's
my next question.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:37.620 align:middle line:10%
Let's go there.

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:38.786 align:middle line:10%
>>CHOKOISKY: Let's go there.

00:12:38.786 --> 00:12:42.280 align:middle line:10%
And to understand
your body type is

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:47.320 align:middle line:10%
to understand the dharma,
the purpose, the natural laws

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:51.770 align:middle line:10%
of your body, because your body
is different from person X, Y,

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:54.020 align:middle line:10%
and Z. So when you
take an aspirin,

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:55.640 align:middle line:10%
it works slightly
differently for you

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.980 align:middle line:10%
than it does for
these other people,

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:00.160 align:middle line:10%
and to take this a
little bit further,

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.170 align:middle line:10%
and I hope this isn't going
too far out on a limb here,

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:07.960 align:middle line:10%
but there are things you can
do-- like eating hot spicy

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:12.650 align:middle line:10%
food if you're a hot type-- that
will take you over the edge.

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:14.820 align:middle line:84%
I noticed watching the
Super Bowl a couple of days

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:21.780 align:middle line:84%
ago Katy Perry wearing the
nose ring on her right side.

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:24.010 align:middle line:84%
I also noticed a
couple of the employees

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:25.970 align:middle line:90%
here are doing the same thing.

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:30.690 align:middle line:84%
The nose piercing
on the right nostril

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:34.580 align:middle line:84%
will open up your heat
in your masculine center.

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:36.900 align:middle line:84%
So if you're a woman
with this piercing,

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:39.860 align:middle line:84%
it will get you in touch
with your masculine energy.

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:41.990 align:middle line:84%
It'll make you more
assertive, more powerful.

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:42.800 align:middle line:90%
Look at me, world.

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm here.

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And more of a boyish
energy, whereas

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.870 align:middle line:84%
having the piercing
on the left nostril--

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:54.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is more
classic in India, for example.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.900 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Which is the
traditional Indian form,

00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:01.170 align:middle line:84%
is opening up your female
energy, and as a result,

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:04.910 align:middle line:84%
helping you to become more
of a lady, so to speak,

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:06.030 align:middle line:90%
or to be the woman--

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:08.276 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: More nurturing,
a mother, and so forth.

00:14:08.276 --> 00:14:09.650 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY:
Correct, and to open

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:12.210 align:middle line:84%
up the reproductive
channels, as well.

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:15.610 align:middle line:84%
So there are ways
to balance each one.

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:18.590 align:middle line:84%
In the West, women naturally
gravitate to the right,

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:21.040 align:middle line:84%
because there's a competitive
masculine sort of push.

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I've noticed that.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:25.565 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when our makeup artist,
and you, and others-- and we

00:14:25.565 --> 00:14:27.020 align:middle line:90%
were talking about others.

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:28.774 align:middle line:84%
I started thinking
and reflecting on it,

00:14:28.774 --> 00:14:30.940 align:middle line:84%
and most of the women I
know seem to have their nose

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:32.470 align:middle line:90%
rings on the right side.

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:35.810 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: And the personality
qualities associated with that

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:36.960 align:middle line:90%
will come out.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:40.520 align:middle line:84%
We're all individual
people, but that hot energy

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:41.660 align:middle line:90%
will want to come out.

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:42.451 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So Pitta.

00:14:42.451 --> 00:14:44.340 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Pitta, yeah.

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And there are ways
to balance that.

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:48.710 align:middle line:10%
So if you feel like you're
becoming too aggressive,

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:53.970 align:middle line:10%
too sort of alienating your
feminine nature, take it out.

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:56.110 align:middle line:84%
Put it in the left one
for a month or two.

00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:57.480 align:middle line:90%
See what happens.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:04.010 align:middle line:10%
So what about-- say if
you're very heavily balanced

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:05.376 align:middle line:10%
toward kapha energy.

00:15:05.376 --> 00:15:06.750 align:middle line:84%
Let's go through
the doshas first

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:08.390 align:middle line:84%
and talk about their
characteristics,

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:10.870 align:middle line:84%
and then I'll ask
you that question.

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:13.520 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: So there are
three basic mind body types,

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.410 align:middle line:84%
and my book doesn't
deal with this.

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:17.320 align:middle line:90%
This is straight up Ayurveda.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.760 align:middle line:84%
These three basic
mind body types

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:24.060 align:middle line:84%
are vata, which is
the-- in bodybuilding--

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:25.630 align:middle line:84%
I told you I used
to be in fitness--

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:27.760 align:middle line:90%
we call it the ectomorph type.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:33.946 align:middle line:84%
Skinny, puts on weight
with difficulty--

00:15:33.946 --> 00:15:35.320 align:middle line:84%
those are the
physical qualities.

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.226 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Often tall,
and long limbs, drier.

00:15:37.226 --> 00:15:38.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Correct.

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:38.820 align:middle line:90%
Dry skin.

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:39.980 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And in what the Vedic
tradition has also

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:46.010 align:middle line:84%
associated with that is
psychological characteristics.

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:47.480 align:middle line:90%
They are more fearful.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:51.290 align:middle line:90%
They are quick talkers.

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:54.300 align:middle line:84%
They have more anxiety
than the other types.

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:56.540 align:middle line:90%
The mesomorph is the middle.

00:15:56.540 --> 00:16:00.720 align:middle line:10%
That's the pitta type,
and they are primarily

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:03.360 align:middle line:10%
ruled by the fire
element, and so

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.750 align:middle line:10%
typically two pittas in
a relationship-- they

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:09.180 align:middle line:10%
really have to learn
to give because they're

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:13.680 align:middle line:10%
both the leader, so too
many cooks in the kitchen.

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:16.810 align:middle line:84%
So just knowing your body type
can help you understand even

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:18.730 align:middle line:90%
relationship dynamics.

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:23.340 align:middle line:84%
If I'm a pitta and I
always want to be right,

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:26.330 align:middle line:84%
then I have to look at what
my spouse or significant other

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:28.350 align:middle line:90%
is so that we can balance that.

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And there's a saying that
says treat vata like a flower.

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:33.390 align:middle line:90%
Nurture them.

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:34.580 align:middle line:90%
Water them.

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:38.390 align:middle line:84%
Give them a certain warm
nourishing kinds of foods.

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:40.500 align:middle line:90%
Treat pitta like a spouse.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.930 align:middle line:90%
Always say, yes, honey.

00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:45.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, honey.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.080 align:middle line:84%
So for someone who is
a pitta like yourself

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.170 align:middle line:84%
and myself, as well,
the best answer

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:50.710 align:middle line:90%
is, yes, you are right, Regina.

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:51.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:52.810 align:middle line:90%
That's a very good answer.

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:54.497 align:middle line:90%


00:16:54.497 --> 00:16:56.330 align:middle line:10%
>>CHOKOISKY: And finally
there is the kapha,

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:59.560 align:middle line:10%
and the kaphas are
the endomorphs,

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.450 align:middle line:10%
and we don't use this
terminology so much in the west

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:05.329 align:middle line:10%
anymore, but it's more
from fitness circles.

00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:08.119 align:middle line:10%
Endomorphs are the
big boned types,

00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:10.470 align:middle line:10%
and they tend to be more steady.

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:11.750 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Softer, rounder.

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:13.760 align:middle line:10%
>>CHOKOISKY: Softer,
rounder, more relaxed.

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:17.170 align:middle line:84%
Much more difficult to
take off weight for them,

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:20.609 align:middle line:84%
and kaphas you
treat like an enemy.

00:17:20.609 --> 00:17:21.319 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:22.119 align:middle line:90%
Five more pushups.

00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:22.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, push.

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:23.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: You
want to kick them.

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:24.239 align:middle line:90%
Push.

00:17:24.239 --> 00:17:28.620 align:middle line:84%
Push a little more, because if
you don't, they won't budge.

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:30.570 align:middle line:84%
And here's the
interesting thing--

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:32.990 align:middle line:84%
is if I'm a fitness
consultant and I

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:37.010 align:middle line:84%
have vata, a pitta, and
a kapha, the kapha I'm

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:39.030 align:middle line:84%
going to go and
kick a couple times,

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:42.070 align:middle line:84%
and they won't
respect me until I do

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:43.720 align:middle line:90%
because they know I'm on them.

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.937 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this is
more the laborer in terms

00:17:45.937 --> 00:17:48.020 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to look
at personality types, some

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:49.239 align:middle line:90%
of that characteristic there.

00:17:49.239 --> 00:17:50.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Right.

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:51.130 align:middle line:90%
Well very good.

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:55.445 align:middle line:84%
Now the thing-- I try to
keep Ayurveda at Ayurveda--

00:17:55.445 --> 00:17:57.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I understand you
can't make a literal-- yes.

00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:00.361 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: --and the Dharma
types-- we all want the unified

00:18:00.361 --> 00:18:04.700 align:middle line:84%
field theory where we can blend
everything-- Chinese medicine,

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:08.340 align:middle line:84%
Western medicine, Ayurveda,
Native American healing

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:12.220 align:middle line:84%
medicine, and so on, but to
gain the respect of each body

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:14.505 align:middle line:84%
type, the kapha I want
to push, but the vata I

00:18:14.505 --> 00:18:18.680 align:middle line:84%
want to treat very gently
and with a very soft hand.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And the pitta-- I want them
to see their own truth.

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:24.010 align:middle line:90%
Pittas are very visual.

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:27.260 align:middle line:84%
Fire, light-- without fire
and light, we can't see.

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.940 align:middle line:90%
The fire element rules pitta.

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:33.370 align:middle line:84%
So if pitta says two and two
is five, it's definitely five.

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:35.690 align:middle line:90%
I know it, and you're wrong.

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:38.300 align:middle line:90%
You don't say, no, you're wrong.

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:41.540 align:middle line:84%
You say, oh, you're
probably right.

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:44.300 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at the
book just to make sure.

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:47.510 align:middle line:84%
You open the book, and
they go, oh, it's four.

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:49.687 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's definitely
four, and then they're

00:18:49.687 --> 00:18:50.520 align:middle line:90%
convinced it's four.

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:53.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's kind of an
out of balance pitta, but yeah.

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:56.264 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: It's good to use
extremes to get the point.

00:18:56.264 --> 00:18:57.221 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, exactly.

00:18:57.221 --> 00:18:59.330 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: But pitta
needs to see the true.

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:02.360 align:middle line:84%
So as a pitta interviewer
or a pitta therapist,

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:06.650 align:middle line:84%
let's say-- let's say I'm a
pitta and I go to a therapist.

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:08.250 align:middle line:84%
I want them to prove
themselves to me.

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:11.010 align:middle line:84%
If they can show me that
they know what they're doing,

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:12.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm loyal for life.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.250 align:middle line:90%
If they can't, I'm out of there.

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:18.380 align:middle line:84%
So that's how you
deal with pittas.

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:21.230 align:middle line:84%
You show them your
integrity and that you

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:22.650 align:middle line:90%
know what you're talking about.

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:29.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Whereas with a
kapha, you need to what?

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:31.869 align:middle line:84%
Just express yourself
and take control?

00:19:31.869 --> 00:19:33.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: If a
kapha comes to you,

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:35.490 align:middle line:84%
it's usually because
a doctor has-- let's

00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:37.570 align:middle line:90%
say it's the therapist setting.

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:39.870 align:middle line:84%
A doctor has told them
that if they don't go

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:41.604 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
die in six months.

00:19:41.604 --> 00:19:43.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Otherwise
they're not budging.

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:44.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: They're
not budging or they

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:46.340 align:middle line:84%
have a coupon that
expired three years ago,

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:48.550 align:middle line:84%
and they're coming
into your office,

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:51.740 align:middle line:84%
and there are ice cream stains
on the shirt that may or may

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:54.460 align:middle line:84%
not have been washed
recently, and they're there

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:56.029 align:middle line:90%
for their free session.

00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:58.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it's
hard to move when you're--

00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:59.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: It's
hard to motivate.

00:19:59.440 --> 00:19:59.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hard, yeah.

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:02.151 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: And if you
don't take action immediately

00:20:02.151 --> 00:20:03.650 align:middle line:84%
with them, you won't
see them again.

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:04.960 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I'm speaking
in superlatives.

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:07.376 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have to grab
them, take control immediately.

00:20:07.376 --> 00:20:10.650 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yes, and show them
how good it feels to exercise,

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:12.580 align:middle line:90%
to move, to change.

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:15.660 align:middle line:84%
So you give them a
herb that heats them.

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:17.700 align:middle line:84%
You get them on the
treadmill doing something,

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:20.100 align:middle line:90%
and they start sweating.

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:21.380 align:middle line:90%
You see how good that feels?

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:23.820 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, this kind of
feels pretty good.

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:25.620 align:middle line:90%
Then they'll respect you.

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:26.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And then vata.

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:28.180 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: And
then vata you will

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:31.920 align:middle line:84%
begin by affirming
that it's OK for them

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:35.710 align:middle line:84%
to be and feel
the way they feel.

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:40.360 align:middle line:84%
You will nourish-- the
room can't be too cold.

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:43.290 align:middle line:90%
Vatas get very cold very easy.

00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:44.780 align:middle line:84%
You will give them
lots of water.

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:49.130 align:middle line:84%
You will hydrate them,
and you will give them--

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:52.560 align:middle line:90%
vatas love features.

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:56.170 align:middle line:84%
They love-- when a vata buys,
they don't buy the book itself.

00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:59.610 align:middle line:84%
They may buy-- oh, wow, with
the book I get this, and this,

00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:01.302 align:middle line:90%
and there's a cool test here.

00:21:01.302 --> 00:21:02.760 align:middle line:84%
Oh, and there's
some illustrations.

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:04.410 align:middle line:90%
OK, I'll get the book.

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:06.639 align:middle line:90%
They buy the--

00:21:06.639 --> 00:21:08.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Kind of
ancillary features.

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:09.040 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: The
ancillary features.

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:10.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The things
that excite them, yeah.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.950 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: So for
a vata, you want

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:14.700 align:middle line:84%
to build up-- if they're
your client, you want to say,

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:15.200 align:middle line:90%
listen.

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:16.410 align:middle line:90%
We're going to use herbs.

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:17.960 align:middle line:84%
We're going to use
diet and exercise.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.570 align:middle line:84%
We're going to use
this, and we're

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:21.730 align:middle line:84%
going to use this
incredible complimentary

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:26.650 align:middle line:90%
approach to help you bloom.

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:28.190 align:middle line:84%
And then they go,
wow, this is cool.

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:28.950 align:middle line:90%
There's variety.

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:29.820 align:middle line:90%
There's excitement.

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:33.300 align:middle line:84%
Vatas love variety,
because it's hard for them

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:36.071 align:middle line:84%
to stick to the same old boring
diet, the same old boring

00:21:36.071 --> 00:21:36.570 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:38.153 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
tell them, listen,

00:21:38.153 --> 00:21:39.690 align:middle line:90%
you can eat whatever you want.

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:41.320 align:middle line:90%
Just do this, this, this.

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:42.530 align:middle line:90%
They love that.

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:44.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
really good information.

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:46.790 align:middle line:84%
Again, whether it's
business, whether it's

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:48.850 align:middle line:84%
working with our
colleagues, or whatnot,

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:51.460 align:middle line:84%
if we really stopped and
considered this for a moment

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:56.092 align:middle line:84%
before we just start
mouthing off to each other.

00:21:56.092 --> 00:21:58.175 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Both in our
family, with our clients,

00:21:58.175 --> 00:22:00.800 align:middle line:84%
in our businesses, and this
is already being taught.

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:02.870 align:middle line:84%
It's out there at
the elite levels.

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:04.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, that's wonderful.

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:06.780 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to
go into-- I want

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:10.702 align:middle line:84%
to ask one question before we
go into the actual typology,

00:22:10.702 --> 00:22:12.410 align:middle line:84%
and that is the word
dharma, which you've

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:17.240 align:middle line:84%
used several times already,
and what does dharma mean in

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:19.110 align:middle line:90%
your language, so to speak?

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:22.200 align:middle line:84%
Because we use that in a lot
of different ways-- and karma,

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:24.640 align:middle line:90%
and how do the two interface?

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:28.010 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: If you know
dharma, dharma erases karma.

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:30.890 align:middle line:90%
That's a little shorthanded.

00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:35.740 align:middle line:84%
A long time ago our wise elders
figured out three things.

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:40.400 align:middle line:84%
The first thing is
everybody wants to be happy,

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:43.290 align:middle line:84%
but there's a difference
between long term happiness

00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:44.460 align:middle line:90%
and short term happiness.

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:46.930 align:middle line:84%
To be happy in the
long term you have

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:50.150 align:middle line:84%
to go with nature rather
than against nature.

00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:53.650 align:middle line:84%
So in the short term, jumping
off a cliff might feel amazing.

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:58.410 align:middle line:84%
Oh, the wind in your
face, and then splat.

00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:00.520 align:middle line:90%
Nature catches up to us.

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:05.910 align:middle line:84%
The same thing
applies to yourself.

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:09.150 align:middle line:84%
So for long term
success, we have

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:11.990 align:middle line:90%
to abide by the laws of nature.

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:13.960 align:middle line:84%
The third thing they
realize is each one

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:18.690 align:middle line:84%
of us has an individual way
of abiding by these laws,

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:21.840 align:middle line:90%
and I term these dharma types.

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:25.350 align:middle line:84%
They use a different
Sanskrit word for it.

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:28.460 align:middle line:84%
So knowing your dharma
type, you understand how

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:30.840 align:middle line:90%
to follow nature to be happy.

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:34.759 align:middle line:84%
So just as we gave the example
earlier for the outsider child,

00:23:34.759 --> 00:23:36.050 align:middle line:90%
they're going to want to rebel.

00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:37.340 align:middle line:90%
That's their nature.

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:38.680 align:middle line:90%
Let them.

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:41.230 align:middle line:84%
The laborer is going to want
to do things differently.

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:46.479 align:middle line:84%
Allow them to express
themselves that way.

00:23:46.479 --> 00:23:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And basically there are five
dharma types like the five

00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:50.020 align:middle line:90%
fingers in the hand.

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:51.960 align:middle line:84%
No one finger is
better than another.

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.572 align:middle line:90%
You cut one off.

00:23:53.572 --> 00:23:54.530 align:middle line:90%
You're going to suffer.

00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:55.030 align:middle line:90%
Same thing.

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:56.000 align:middle line:90%
There's no hierarchy.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.160 align:middle line:90%
There's no one above the others.

00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:58.910 align:middle line:90%
They're all equal.

00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:01.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's true, but
when you start reading them

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:03.060 align:middle line:84%
and you just look
at that, most people

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:05.935 align:middle line:84%
would probably say, oh god,
I hope I'm not a laborer.

00:24:05.935 --> 00:24:07.060 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: It's amazing--

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:08.535 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As you said,
Oprah Winfrey is a laborer.

00:24:08.535 --> 00:24:10.039 align:middle line:84%
She's not doing too
badly with that.

00:24:10.039 --> 00:24:12.330 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yeah, she's not
doing too badly with that.

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:15.720 align:middle line:84%
To be a laborer simply
means that your dharma

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.370 align:middle line:90%
is to create a community.

00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:20.740 align:middle line:84%
Your dharma is to nourish
people because you're solid.

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:24.950 align:middle line:84%
Laborers come into this world
more ready than any other type.

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:25.930 align:middle line:90%
They're solid.

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:29.470 align:middle line:84%
That's why often laborers
work in the health industry

00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:36.100 align:middle line:84%
as nurses, doctors, EMTs,
because they know how to look

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:37.660 align:middle line:90%
at suffering and say it's OK.

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:39.970 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
take care of this.

00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:41.910 align:middle line:90%
An educator is not that stable.

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:44.480 align:middle line:84%
You come to me with that,
and I'll refer you somewhere.

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.340 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you words
of wisdom, but

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:48.970 align:middle line:84%
for the actual
physical sustenance,

00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:50.370 align:middle line:90%
I probably can't do it.

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:52.445 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So shall we
start with the laborer.

00:24:52.445 --> 00:24:52.730 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Why not?

00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:53.605 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Is that OK?

00:24:53.605 --> 00:24:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And start diving
in, because as soon

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:59.090 align:middle line:84%
as you say that, I'm already
seeing- my sister is a nurse.

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:02.210 align:middle line:84%
My mother was a nurse, and I see
their friends who are nurses.

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:05.110 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them have a lot
of kapha-- some pitta,

00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:06.640 align:middle line:90%
but kapha characteristics.

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.150 align:middle line:90%
Not a lot of vata.

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:11.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: You're very
astute, because each dharma type

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:14.740 align:middle line:84%
is associated with an element,
and for the laborer, the earth

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:15.740 align:middle line:90%
element.

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And the earth element
is what makes you solid,

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:19.320 align:middle line:90%
and dependable, and loyal.

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:22.160 align:middle line:84%
These are all things that are
very important to laborers,

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.770 align:middle line:84%
but it also makes it a
little more difficult

00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:29.970 align:middle line:84%
to have that glamorized ideal
Hollywood body, for example.

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:35.360 align:middle line:84%
And laborers struggle with
that if they hitch on to that,

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:39.280 align:middle line:84%
like I have to look this way,
but the earth element also

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:41.640 align:middle line:90%
is Mother Earth.

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:44.660 align:middle line:84%
Whether you're male or
female, it doesn't matter.

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:47.090 align:middle line:90%
You are a source of nurturing.

00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Just a couple of days
ago I ran across a book

00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:52.750 align:middle line:84%
called "The Five
Love Languages,"

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:55.572 align:middle line:90%
and it's the dharma types.

00:25:55.572 --> 00:25:56.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:59.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: These
things exist in us,

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:04.160 align:middle line:84%
and this reverend counselor
tapped into this idea

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:07.620 align:middle line:84%
that the five different
types of people

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:12.290 align:middle line:84%
respond to different
types of communication,

00:26:12.290 --> 00:26:15.897 align:middle line:84%
and for the laborer, if
your spouse is a laborer,

00:26:15.897 --> 00:26:17.730 align:middle line:84%
they may not tell you,
oh honey, I love you.

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:18.630 align:middle line:90%
You look so beautiful.

00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:19.546 align:middle line:90%
I got you these rings.

00:26:19.546 --> 00:26:22.690 align:middle line:84%
No, they won't do it that way,
but they will fix the car.

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:25.360 align:middle line:90%
They will wash the dishes.

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:27.660 align:middle line:84%
They will take care of
what needs to be done,

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:30.310 align:middle line:84%
and that's how
they express love.

00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:33.900 align:middle line:84%
So if you know that that's
them, don't constantly

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:37.247 align:middle line:84%
pester them to tell
you, oh, all the time

00:26:37.247 --> 00:26:39.080 align:middle line:84%
how beautiful you look,
because they express

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:40.930 align:middle line:90%
love in a different way.

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:45.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I also
noticed that the people

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:48.030 align:middle line:84%
I know who would
just at face value

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:52.700 align:middle line:84%
seem to fall into that
category-- very thorough.

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:54.460 align:middle line:84%
People that follow
through on their word,

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:56.930 align:middle line:84%
they're very thorough,
but also when

00:26:56.930 --> 00:27:00.700 align:middle line:84%
I come in with my whirlwind
of energy and 1,000 new ideas

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:01.990 align:middle line:90%
it's an affront.

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:05.590 align:middle line:84%
It's an attack, and it's
very difficult for them

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:08.916 align:middle line:84%
to deal with that kind of energy
when I'm just high as a kit

00:27:08.916 --> 00:27:10.850 align:middle line:90%
and can't wait to share.

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:13.110 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Well, they
bring it down to earth,

00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:17.090 align:middle line:84%
but you being a fire element,
you stimulate their ideas.

00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:21.500 align:middle line:84%
So even though they may not
show it, it's good for them

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:23.650 align:middle line:90%
to some degree.

00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:26.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the sensitivity
has to run both ways.

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:27.269 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Absolutely.

00:27:27.269 --> 00:27:29.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I need to be
more sensitive to this

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:31.930 align:middle line:84%
is a person that takes in
information perhaps more

00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:33.010 align:middle line:90%
methodically.

00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:35.000 align:middle line:90%
Very smart.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000 align:middle line:84%
Very ready and willing
when their moment

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.740 align:middle line:84%
comes to take action and
follow through, right?

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:43.900 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Correct, and
there's some telltale even

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:46.634 align:middle line:84%
physical characteristics
to determine--

00:27:46.634 --> 00:27:47.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The laborer?

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:48.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: The laborer.

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:50.850 align:middle line:84%
Warriors have large
hands typically.

00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:51.830 align:middle line:90%
Not always.

00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:54.070 align:middle line:90%
Laborers may have thing lips.

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:54.710 align:middle line:90%
May have.

00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:56.960 align:middle line:84%
This is not
absolutely necessary,

00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:00.730 align:middle line:84%
but a person with thin
lips is thin lipped.

00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:02.360 align:middle line:90%
They don't express.

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:04.580 align:middle line:84%
They're not like people
with larger lips who

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:05.320 align:middle line:90%
want to express.

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:06.537 align:middle line:90%
Here, let's talk.

00:28:06.537 --> 00:28:07.620 align:middle line:90%
Let's have a conversation.

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:09.892 align:middle line:84%
No, they speak
with their actions.

00:28:09.892 --> 00:28:12.192 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, that's a good
thing to note in a family.

00:28:12.192 --> 00:28:13.900 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: So even
when you're at home,

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:15.360 align:middle line:84%
look at the people
in your family.

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.050 align:middle line:90%
Who has the thin lips?

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:18.100 align:middle line:90%
Who has the large lips?

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:19.334 align:middle line:90%
The large lips will want to--

00:28:19.334 --> 00:28:20.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Are flapping more.

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:21.958 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: They're
flapping more.

00:28:21.958 --> 00:28:25.510 align:middle line:84%
They're made to do that,
especially if the upper lip

00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:26.820 align:middle line:90%
is more well developed.

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:28.500 align:middle line:90%
Then you have a talker.

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:30.850 align:middle line:84%
Narendra Modi, the
Prime Minister of India,

00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:32.800 align:middle line:90%
has a very pronounced upper lip.

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:35.710 align:middle line:90%
He's an incredible orator.

00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:38.810 align:middle line:84%
A pronounced lower lip will
be able to keep secrets

00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:43.340 align:middle line:84%
and has a deep sensual
nature, lower lips,

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:45.870 align:middle line:84%
which is why women--
maybe some men,

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:48.870 align:middle line:84%
as well-- get that
collagen implant to give

00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:54.640 align:middle line:90%
more of that sensual quality.

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:55.310 align:middle line:90%
It's a thing.

00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:57.340 align:middle line:84%
It is a thing,
believe it or not.

00:28:57.340 --> 00:29:00.025 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if your bottom
lip has more fullness--

00:29:00.025 --> 00:29:01.400 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: You're
more sensual.

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:03.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --you're more sensual.

00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And so it's kind of
unfair to say in the sense

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:10.600 align:middle line:84%
that some people have
thin lips, but is it true

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:12.100 align:middle line:84%
that generally if
you have thin lips

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:14.030 align:middle line:90%
you're not quite as sensual.

00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:17.334 align:middle line:84%
That's not your first
calling, so to speak, in life.

00:29:17.334 --> 00:29:18.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY:
Sensually expressive.

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:23.010 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have anything
to do with sex drive or--

00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:25.296 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or sensually
experiencing life, even.

00:29:25.296 --> 00:29:26.170 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Correct.

00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:28.090 align:middle line:84%
Sensually experiencing
and the ability

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:30.250 align:middle line:90%
to express yourself that way.

00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:34.630 align:middle line:84%
As I said, the laborer and
a person with thin lips--

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:35.950 align:middle line:90%
we're going everywhere here.

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:36.908 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But let's do.

00:29:36.908 --> 00:29:37.900 align:middle line:90%
I would like to.

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:41.070 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: They express
through acts of service.

00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:43.400 align:middle line:84%
They express through
being of service,

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.920 align:middle line:84%
whereas someone
with more full lips

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:50.360 align:middle line:84%
and, say, an outsider who
is very much into touch,

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:51.290 align:middle line:90%
they appreciate touch.

00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:55.110 align:middle line:84%
They will need to have
affirmation through touch.

00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:55.830 align:middle line:90%
Honey, come here.

00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:56.730 align:middle line:90%
Let's hug.

00:29:56.730 --> 00:29:57.729 align:middle line:90%
Let's kiss.

00:29:57.729 --> 00:29:59.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: With the larger lips.

00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:01.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Larger lips,
and also outsider types

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:03.440 align:middle line:90%
tend to go that route.

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now with laborers
let's get into a little more

00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:10.430 align:middle line:84%
of just anymore indicators
of physical typology

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:11.340 align:middle line:90%
for a laborer.

00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:12.464 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: For a laborer.

00:30:12.464 --> 00:30:14.810 align:middle line:84%
Laborers physically,
because the earth element

00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:17.890 align:middle line:84%
is strong in them, may have
stronger bone structure,

00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:22.360 align:middle line:84%
wider hips for
childbearing, because they

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:24.280 align:middle line:90%
are centered on family.

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And typically laborers
will want to have a family

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:30.370 align:middle line:90%
and to have more children.

00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:34.970 align:middle line:84%
In yoga philosophy, there
are 10 commandments.

00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:40.840 align:middle line:84%
There are 10 ethical precepts
called the Yamas-- Y-A-M-A--

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:44.420 align:middle line:84%
and then the
Niyamas-- N-I-Y-A-M-A.

00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And these are basically the
ten commandments of yoga

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:50.180 align:middle line:84%
philosophy, and the first
five are the most important.

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:53.940 align:middle line:84%
The one specific to the
laborer is called Brahmacharya,

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:58.330 align:middle line:84%
which means abstinence,
but it really

00:30:58.330 --> 00:31:01.260 align:middle line:84%
means conserving your
sexual energy just

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:05.040 align:middle line:84%
for your relationship, not
fooling around too much.

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:08.070 align:middle line:84%
So laborers naturally,
when they're younger,

00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:09.270 align:middle line:90%
want to marry younger.

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:10.850 align:middle line:84%
They want to have
a family younger.

00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:11.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're loyal.

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:12.505 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: They're loyal.

00:31:12.505 --> 00:31:14.110 align:middle line:84%
They want to create
that structure,

00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:16.480 align:middle line:84%
whereas the outsider, or
the educator, or the warrior

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:17.600 align:middle line:90%
might go, no.

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:18.460 align:middle line:90%
I have a career.

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:22.400 align:middle line:84%
I've got other things I want
to do before I go that route,

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:25.190 align:middle line:84%
but it's different strokes
for different folks.

00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:27.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Each of these types
has an evolutionary path

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.620 align:middle line:84%
and a devolutionary path,
and I think that's important

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:31.880 align:middle line:90%
that we just touch on.

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:32.630 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Sure.

00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:35.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What helps the
evolution of a laborer

00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:36.732 align:middle line:90%
and what takes them down.

00:31:36.732 --> 00:31:38.190 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: So
for a laborer, it's

00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:41.569 align:middle line:84%
very good to hang around with
merchants, merchant types,

00:31:41.569 --> 00:31:42.610 align:middle line:90%
as described in the book.

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:44.193 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We'll go
to them next, then.

00:31:44.193 --> 00:31:46.660 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Merchants are
ruled by the water element.

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:48.660 align:middle line:84%
When you combine
earth and water,

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:52.100 align:middle line:84%
you get civilization,
because-- think about it--

00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:55.160 align:middle line:84%
earth and water
creates crops, farming.

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:57.980 align:middle line:84%
Earth and water creates clay,
and you can build vessels.

00:31:57.980 --> 00:31:59.210 align:middle line:90%
You can build houses.

00:31:59.210 --> 00:32:02.250 align:middle line:84%
The combination
of earth and water

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:06.210 align:middle line:84%
creates civilization,
and money, and society.

00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:09.180 align:middle line:84%
So the earth by itself
is dry and rough.

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:11.060 align:middle line:90%
The water smooths it out.

00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:12.830 align:middle line:84%
The water by itself
kind of flows

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:15.311 align:middle line:84%
anywhere, but when it
has an earth channel--

00:32:15.311 --> 00:32:16.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To contain it.

00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:18.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: --it
contains it and guides it.

00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:22.280 align:middle line:84%
So merchants and
laborers need each other.

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:24.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So maybe
what we best do

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:26.360 align:middle line:84%
is go through each
of the types, then

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:31.100 align:middle line:84%
I can ask you about where each
one goes to, evolve or devolve,

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:33.610 align:middle line:84%
so then that way when
you're saying merchant,

00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:35.560 align:middle line:84%
everyone knows
exactly what you mean.

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:37.060 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk
about the merchant.

00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:41.200 align:middle line:84%
So the merchant is
like the water element.

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:45.300 align:middle line:84%
They are the most-- you
can't taste anything

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:48.490 align:middle line:84%
if you don't have water,
moisture in your mouth.

00:32:48.490 --> 00:32:51.490 align:middle line:84%
If you dry up your tongue
and you put some sugar there,

00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:54.110 align:middle line:84%
you won't know whether
it's sugar or sand.

00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:56.660 align:middle line:84%
So we need water,
the water element,

00:32:56.660 --> 00:33:01.510 align:middle line:84%
to feel good, to taste
life's juiciness,

00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:05.240 align:middle line:84%
and merchants make life
fun and worth living.

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:07.080 align:middle line:10%
A laborer may build a house.

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:10.110 align:middle line:10%
A merchant will deck it out
and make it look fabulous

00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:11.690 align:middle line:10%
so it's comfortable.

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:16.250 align:middle line:84%
So some of the best known
personalities in the world

00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:18.660 align:middle line:84%
are merchant types
because merchants are fun.

00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:21.130 align:middle line:90%
They're Elvis Presley.

00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:25.530 align:middle line:84%
We have Marilyn Monroe, Muhammad
Ali, Frank Sinatra-- merchant

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:28.490 align:middle line:90%
types.

00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And merchants are very social,
but that sociability hides

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:36.930 align:middle line:84%
a core emptiness inside,
and fundamentally merchants

00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:38.210 align:middle line:90%
feel empty.

00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:39.500 align:middle line:90%
This is their little--

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:41.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Marilyn Monroe might
be a good example of that,

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:41.780 align:middle line:90%
then.

00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: They're
all good examples

00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:45.970 align:middle line:90%
whether they show it or not.

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:47.520 align:middle line:84%
That's their little
secret, and they

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:51.320 align:middle line:84%
will try to hide it with
more company, the newest

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:53.640 align:middle line:84%
BMW, the newest
spouse, the newest

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:56.190 align:middle line:84%
drug, the newest
whatever the case may be,

00:33:56.190 --> 00:34:00.280 align:middle line:84%
but those things only assuage
that feeling for awhile.

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:04.530 align:middle line:84%
The antidote to any
merchant is charity,

00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:08.000 align:middle line:84%
giving, giving that which
you have in abundance.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.400 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have to be money.

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:13.489 align:middle line:84%
The other day a merchant
gave me a compliment.

00:34:13.489 --> 00:34:16.350 align:middle line:84%
She said, wow, you look
really good in those pants.

00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:18.699 align:middle line:90%
I was flying high the whole day.

00:34:18.699 --> 00:34:20.820 align:middle line:84%
The whole day I felt
great because merchants

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:22.710 align:middle line:84%
have the ability to
make you feel good just

00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:24.190 align:middle line:90%
by saying something authentic.

00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:25.495 align:middle line:90%
She really meant it.

00:34:25.495 --> 00:34:26.120 align:middle line:90%
They can't lie.

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:30.739 align:middle line:84%
They can't fake it, but even
a compliment from a merchant

00:34:30.739 --> 00:34:32.580 align:middle line:90%
can change someone's life.

00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:34.050 align:middle line:90%
So merchants have to give.

00:34:34.050 --> 00:34:38.300 align:middle line:84%
They have to give their time,
their energy, and, yes, money,

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:40.730 align:middle line:90%
resources to help others.

00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:43.489 align:middle line:84%
Then what they get
in return feeds them

00:34:43.489 --> 00:34:48.949 align:middle line:84%
and fills that void the
way that nothing else can.

00:34:48.949 --> 00:34:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And Bill Clinton is a merchant,
and love him or hate him,

00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:56.510 align:middle line:84%
he balanced the budget
while he was the president.

00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:57.750 align:middle line:90%
We had a surplus.

00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:59.210 align:middle line:84%
That's the merchant's
strength-- is

00:34:59.210 --> 00:35:02.230 align:middle line:84%
to create money, and
wealth, and resources.

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:04.150 align:middle line:84%
And now after his
presidency, he's

00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:08.100 align:middle line:84%
trying to do a lot of
charitable deeds both abroad

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:11.260 align:middle line:84%
and in the US, as
well, to erase poverty.

00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:13.900 align:middle line:84%
This is a dharma of a
merchant, and again,

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:16.120 align:middle line:84%
whether you're on the
right side or the left side

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:19.330 align:middle line:84%
of the political
debate, you have

00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:21.910 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that this
person-- for all their faults,

00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:26.230 align:middle line:84%
whatever they may be-- is
following the merchant path.

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:28.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And in the case of
Bill Clinton, for example,

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:30.715 align:middle line:84%
with the various
affairs and so forth,

00:35:30.715 --> 00:35:32.340 align:middle line:84%
that might have been
an attempt to fill

00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:33.860 align:middle line:90%
that empty space inside.

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:35.026 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yes, beautiful.

00:35:35.026 --> 00:35:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And there is a desire
to experience life,

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:41.790 align:middle line:84%
to fill up on sensuality,
on things, on stuff,

00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:44.180 align:middle line:84%
on the good time,
on the burgers.

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:47.160 align:middle line:90%
Now he's vegan.

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:49.200 align:middle line:84%
There's a point in
the merchant's life--

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:52.540 align:middle line:84%
the Scrooge myth is also very
central to the merchant life.

00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:56.050 align:middle line:84%
Scrooge was a miser
merchant type.

00:35:56.050 --> 00:36:00.110 align:middle line:84%
All his family was dead,
and so he didn't feel

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:01.910 align:middle line:90%
like he should give to anyone.

00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:04.500 align:middle line:84%
For the merchant, the aha
moment comes when they

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:08.120 align:middle line:90%
realize I have a wider family.

00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:09.610 align:middle line:90%
It's not just my blood family.

00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:12.980 align:middle line:84%
I have responsibility to my
neighbors, to my neighborhood,

00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:16.450 align:middle line:84%
to my city, to my country,
and ultimately to the world.

00:36:16.450 --> 00:36:19.350 align:middle line:84%
Then they become forces
of incredible change.

00:36:19.350 --> 00:36:21.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So again,
so a person--

00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:23.290 align:middle line:84%
what the contributions
of the merchant

00:36:23.290 --> 00:36:25.770 align:middle line:84%
are and then what some
of the typology is?

00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Oh, merchants
are round, even Muhammad Ali,

00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:31.760 align:middle line:90%
who was heavyweight champion.

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:34.740 align:middle line:84%
He had a roundness about
his body, a fluidity.

00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:37.100 align:middle line:84%
He could move in a way that
the other opponents who

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:37.944 align:middle line:90%
were more warriors--

00:36:37.944 --> 00:36:39.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he
had a round face.

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: And
he had a round face

00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:43.150 align:middle line:84%
and a roundish kind of body,
and he flowed like water.

00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:45.330 align:middle line:84%
And people, they
couldn't touch him.

00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:48.110 align:middle line:90%
So there is a roundness.

00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:51.710 align:middle line:84%
Merchants don't like to
exercise unless there's

00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:54.570 align:middle line:90%
some kind of monetary incentive.

00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:56.660 align:middle line:84%
I believe Britney Spears
is also a merchant.

00:36:56.660 --> 00:37:00.080 align:middle line:84%
There are many, many merchants
in the entertainment business,

00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:03.700 align:middle line:84%
but if they need to get the six
pack abs for a certain movie,

00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:06.360 align:middle line:84%
they'll do it, but then
after that forget about it.

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:07.622 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's when
you see them bloat back

00:37:07.622 --> 00:37:08.300 align:middle line:90%
up a 100 pounds.

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:09.174 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Exactly.

00:37:09.174 --> 00:37:11.930 align:middle line:84%
So merchants, there's
a certain way--

00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:14.080 align:middle line:84%
and I add detail some
strategies in the book

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:17.340 align:middle line:90%
on how to motivate merchants.

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:20.245 align:middle line:84%
For merchants who love to
have fun and essential,

00:37:20.245 --> 00:37:21.850 align:middle line:90%
you find ways.

00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:24.170 align:middle line:90%
Look, sex burns calories.

00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:26.250 align:middle line:84%
Instead of doing pushups
on the gym floor, try--

00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:27.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So make
it sensual and fun.

00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:28.070 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Make
it sensual and fun.

00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:30.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Fun is a central
element to the merchant.

00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:33.960 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: You have to
shake up their consciousness.

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:36.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's go to the,
would you say, educator next?

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:37.700 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Sure.

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:42.290 align:middle line:84%
So the educator then is
ruled by the air element.

00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:45.580 align:middle line:84%
So we have two pairs of types
that really go well together.

00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:48.720 align:middle line:84%
The merchant and the
laborer need each other.

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:51.600 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm a laborer, I want
to hang out with merchants.

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:53.985 align:middle line:84%
If I'm a merchant, I want to
hang out with the laborers

00:37:53.985 --> 00:37:55.154 align:middle line:90%
to kind of keep me grounded.

00:37:55.154 --> 00:37:57.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Keep you grounded, and
the other brings the laborer up

00:37:57.820 --> 00:37:59.910 align:middle line:84%
and gives them some
spark and fun in life.

00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:00.370 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Exactly.

00:38:00.370 --> 00:38:01.744 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's
a good combo.

00:38:01.744 --> 00:38:03.630 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: And the
second positive combo

00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:06.090 align:middle line:84%
is between educators
and warriors.

00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:08.340 align:middle line:90%
Educator is the air element.

00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:10.930 align:middle line:84%
Their job is to convey
wisdom to the world,

00:38:10.930 --> 00:38:13.220 align:middle line:84%
to bring good
counsel, diplomacy,

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:19.700 align:middle line:84%
and to promote-- educators
are the idea people.

00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:23.170 align:middle line:84%
Even the founding of a nation
needs the written word,

00:38:23.170 --> 00:38:25.810 align:middle line:84%
the Constitution,
before cities are built,

00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:29.990 align:middle line:84%
before the population
comes to move in.

00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:31.420 align:middle line:90%
You need a certain set of laws.

00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:35.610 align:middle line:84%
The educator is very capable
of giving that to the world,

00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:39.360 align:middle line:84%
of giving new ideas, whether
through the realm of science,

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:42.310 align:middle line:84%
through scientific
discovery, through religion,

00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:45.100 align:middle line:84%
or through politics,
doesn't matter.

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:49.980 align:middle line:84%
As an educator, you bring
wisdom and ideas to the world.

00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:50.790 align:middle line:90%
That's your dharma.

00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:51.610 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:53.085 align:middle line:90%
Teach the world.

00:38:53.085 --> 00:38:55.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now what are some
of the physical characteristics

00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:57.170 align:middle line:90%
of the educator?

00:38:57.170 --> 00:38:59.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Educators are
the least robust physically

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:00.390 align:middle line:90%
of all the types.

00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:03.352 align:middle line:84%
I'm an educator type, and
I look sort of burly, but--

00:39:03.352 --> 00:39:05.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you were
a fitness guru, trainer.

00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:06.726 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: And
I was in fitness.

00:39:06.726 --> 00:39:10.305 align:middle line:84%
Part of the reason I didn't
last that long in fitness--

00:39:10.305 --> 00:39:11.680 align:middle line:84%
I was in fitness
for about eight,

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:16.580 align:middle line:84%
nine years-- is because the
body starts to break down,

00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:20.260 align:middle line:84%
and educators are
ultimately very

00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:24.300 align:middle line:84%
aware of the surrender that
happens because of the body.

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:25.330 align:middle line:90%
The knees start hurting.

00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:30.330 align:middle line:84%
The back starts hurting, and you
have to say, well, forget it.

00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:34.880 align:middle line:84%
My dharma is to be an
ideas person rather than

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:38.085 align:middle line:84%
a physical person, and you
have to learn to surrender

00:39:38.085 --> 00:39:39.921 align:middle line:90%
if you're an educator.

00:39:39.921 --> 00:39:42.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because the body
will just do its own thing.

00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:43.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: The
body insists-- yes.

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:47.080 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and educators
have a lot of passion,

00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:51.840 align:middle line:84%
but the educator knows best
the concept of instant karma.

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:54.420 align:middle line:90%
You step on a bug.

00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:59.740 align:middle line:84%
10 minutes later a bug
bites you, or you transgress

00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:01.860 align:middle line:84%
and you do something,
you say something

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:04.490 align:middle line:84%
mean behind someone's back, and
you immediately go oh my god.

00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:05.370 align:middle line:90%
Why did I do that?

00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:07.140 align:middle line:90%
And you feel so guilty.

00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:09.520 align:middle line:84%
This is a quality
of the educator.

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:12.110 align:middle line:84%
They feel instant karma,
instant repercussions

00:40:12.110 --> 00:40:16.540 align:middle line:84%
from any sort of
non-dharmic action.

00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:20.070 align:middle line:84%
They feel it first more
so than any other type.

00:40:20.070 --> 00:40:23.020 align:middle line:84%
So If you are experiencing
the quality of instant karma

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:25.634 align:middle line:84%
in your life a lot, it's
likely that you're an educator.

00:40:25.634 --> 00:40:27.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what are the
physical characteristics?

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:31.040 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Physically,
educators are gentle.

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:33.424 align:middle line:84%
If you're an educator
and you're at a bus stop,

00:40:33.424 --> 00:40:35.340 align:middle line:84%
you're the type of person
that people can just

00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:38.350 align:middle line:84%
come up to and start
telling you their problems.

00:40:38.350 --> 00:40:43.400 align:middle line:84%
Even though I'm 6'4" four,
220 pounds, but presumably--

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:45.910 align:middle line:84%
I don't 100% how
other people see me,

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:49.980 align:middle line:84%
but there is a welcoming
quality to educators,

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:53.160 align:middle line:84%
a nonjudgmental quality
that you can come to me,

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:56.580 align:middle line:84%
and I won't judge you and say
what a horrible person you are.

00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:58.530 align:middle line:90%
How dare you tell me this?

00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:01.725 align:middle line:90%
There's a sort of--

00:41:01.725 --> 00:41:03.683 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: People want to
tell educators their--

00:41:03.683 --> 00:41:05.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yeah, and you
can be at the bus stop--

00:41:05.290 --> 00:41:06.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --secrets and--

00:41:06.350 --> 00:41:08.391 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: --at 2:00
AM, and someone just says,

00:41:08.391 --> 00:41:09.433 align:middle line:90%
I just left my boyfriend.

00:41:09.433 --> 00:41:11.807 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure why, but it felt
like the right thing to do,

00:41:11.807 --> 00:41:13.160 align:middle line:90%
and I don't even know your name.

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:15.130 align:middle line:90%
Why am I telling you this?

00:41:15.130 --> 00:41:16.610 align:middle line:90%
That's a quality educators have.

00:41:16.610 --> 00:41:20.304 align:middle line:84%
There's a non sort of
threatening quality.

00:41:20.304 --> 00:41:21.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And as
you said earlier,

00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:23.740 align:middle line:84%
you might be able to
give some wise counsel,

00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:26.540 align:middle line:84%
but when it comes to actually
doing the work of helping this

00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:28.320 align:middle line:84%
person that's just
shared with you,

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:29.570 align:middle line:90%
put their life back together--

00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:30.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: We
can't walk the walk.

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:31.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:33.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Our weak
point for educators-- one

00:41:33.210 --> 00:41:36.480 align:middle line:84%
of our weak points is we don't
do what we know we should do.

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:39.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So a lot of people
that sit across from me

00:41:39.210 --> 00:41:42.240 align:middle line:84%
here would probably be
educators, I would say,

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:44.070 align:middle line:90%
and that is true.

00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:46.750 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people that
understand things conceptually,

00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:49.860 align:middle line:84%
can write beautiful books,
often don't walk the walk.

00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:51.450 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: It's tough.

00:41:51.450 --> 00:41:54.310 align:middle line:84%
So that's why
educators integrate.

00:41:54.310 --> 00:41:56.842 align:middle line:84%
They take on the best
qualities from the warrior.

00:41:56.842 --> 00:41:58.800 align:middle line:84%
That's why they need to
hang out with warriors,

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:01.280 align:middle line:84%
because if a warrior
says, I'm doing

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:05.070 align:middle line:84%
X, Y, Z, they're going to do it,
or they're going to die trying.

00:42:05.070 --> 00:42:07.460 align:middle line:84%
Robert Redford,
warrior type, defending

00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:09.350 align:middle line:90%
the rights of young filmmakers.

00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:12.900 align:middle line:84%
Angelina Jolie, warrior
type, helping kids

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:17.310 align:middle line:84%
in war torn places,
removing mines, and so on.

00:42:17.310 --> 00:42:21.530 align:middle line:84%
They have a mission,
and for an educator,

00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:23.370 align:middle line:84%
it's very good to
see people like that,

00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:26.110 align:middle line:84%
because you can model
yourself after them

00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:28.250 align:middle line:84%
and actually get up in the
morning, go to the gym,

00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:30.240 align:middle line:84%
do what you said you
were going to do.

00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:33.120 align:middle line:84%
Behave how you're telling
other people to behave.

00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:35.700 align:middle line:90%


00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:37.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, I
understand that.

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:38.190 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:41.521 align:middle line:90%
So now let's go to the warrior.

00:42:41.521 --> 00:42:43.520 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: So the warrior
is the fire element,

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:46.750 align:middle line:84%
and air, educator, and
fire need each other.

00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:51.270 align:middle line:84%
To have fire, you need oxygen
to feed it, and for air to move,

00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:54.530 align:middle line:84%
it needs change of
temperature so it can rise.

00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:56.580 align:middle line:84%
For an educator to
really rise in the world,

00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:58.910 align:middle line:84%
they need that
heat, that impetus,

00:42:58.910 --> 00:43:00.634 align:middle line:90%
otherwise they grow stale.

00:43:00.634 --> 00:43:01.550 align:middle line:90%
Does that makes sense?

00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:02.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:05.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: And so just
like the fire element,

00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:09.200 align:middle line:84%
warriors are the
most dangerous type.

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:12.770 align:middle line:84%
They can be extremely
harmful if they're misguided,

00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:14.670 align:middle line:90%
or they can be extremely useful.

00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:17.060 align:middle line:90%
It's a double edged sword.

00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:20.770 align:middle line:84%
Warriors are like a Ferrari
without a steering wheel.

00:43:20.770 --> 00:43:23.790 align:middle line:84%
Incredible engine, but
they need guidance.

00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:26.580 align:middle line:84%
They need to hang around with
educators to give them ideas,

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:30.880 align:middle line:84%
to give them principles so they
can find their way in life.

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:33.300 align:middle line:84%
Typically you know you're a
warrior if you hated school

00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:34.950 align:middle line:90%
when you were young.

00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:37.980 align:middle line:84%
Warriors prefer to be outside
running with the other boys

00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:40.810 align:middle line:84%
and girls than in
a stuffy classroom,

00:43:40.810 --> 00:43:48.050 align:middle line:84%
but come about age 35, 40 they
begin to appreciate wisdom.

00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:49.970 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll either
go back to school

00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:54.890 align:middle line:84%
or start watching that
National Geographic or Gaiam TV

00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:56.470 align:middle line:90%
and start learning.

00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:59.272 align:middle line:84%
They want to start learning
again because they missed out

00:43:59.272 --> 00:44:00.480 align:middle line:90%
on that when they were young.

00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:03.840 align:middle line:84%
That's a typical trajectory
for a warrior type.

00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And physically
warriors-- like I said,

00:44:07.350 --> 00:44:10.209 align:middle line:84%
they may have large hands,
but you have to look.

00:44:10.209 --> 00:44:11.750 align:middle line:84%
There's a certain
glitter in the eye.

00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:14.990 align:middle line:84%
There's a certain
strength of character.

00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:17.550 align:middle line:90%
I don't care if you're 5'4".

00:44:17.550 --> 00:44:20.369 align:middle line:84%
If you're a warrior, you
could probably take me out

00:44:20.369 --> 00:44:21.910 align:middle line:84%
because I'm not a
warrior, and you'll

00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:25.401 align:middle line:84%
find just the right
place to just go-- ow.

00:44:25.401 --> 00:44:25.900 align:middle line:90%
Stop.

00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:26.620 align:middle line:90%
OK, I give.

00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:27.410 align:middle line:90%
I give.

00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:29.950 align:middle line:84%
Because warriors know how
to find your weak point,

00:44:29.950 --> 00:44:32.840 align:middle line:84%
and they have that
sense of focus.

00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:36.740 align:middle line:84%
So rather than
describing specific--

00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:38.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's more
what you can see

00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:39.406 align:middle line:90%
in the eye and the attitude.

00:44:39.406 --> 00:44:41.495 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: There's a
certain luster to warriors.

00:44:41.495 --> 00:44:42.949 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And a
determined nature.

00:44:42.949 --> 00:44:44.240 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Determined nature.

00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:45.827 align:middle line:90%
Strong cheekbones.

00:44:45.827 --> 00:44:46.993 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Strong cheekbones.

00:44:46.993 --> 00:44:50.200 align:middle line:90%


00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:52.500 align:middle line:90%
Now let's talk about outsiders.

00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:53.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Outsiders.

00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:58.810 align:middle line:84%
Outsiders are the
most populous type.

00:44:58.810 --> 00:45:01.230 align:middle line:84%
Believe it or not, there are
more outsiders on the planet

00:45:01.230 --> 00:45:05.750 align:middle line:90%
now in our age than ever before.

00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:10.970 align:middle line:84%
However, there are very few
fully integrated outsiders.

00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:12.990 align:middle line:84%
Outsiders are the
bookend of society.

00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:15.890 align:middle line:84%
On the one hand, you
have people like Jesus,

00:45:15.890 --> 00:45:19.900 align:middle line:84%
who is the ultimate
outsider in the sense

00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:21.690 align:middle line:90%
that he walked into the temple.

00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:24.890 align:middle line:84%
He looked the priest in the eye,
and he said prostitutes and tax

00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:29.730 align:middle line:84%
collectors are going to heaven
before you, you scumbag-- was

00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:32.880 align:middle line:90%
basically what he was saying.

00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:37.640 align:middle line:90%
That's a huge rebel activity.

00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:42.110 align:middle line:84%
He spoke truth to power in a way
that many outsiders have done,

00:45:42.110 --> 00:45:46.640 align:middle line:84%
but to do it effectively
as an outsider

00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:49.930 align:middle line:84%
you have to cleanse
yourself first.

00:45:49.930 --> 00:45:52.600 align:middle line:84%
I was sitting with one
outsider, a friend of mine,

00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:54.890 align:middle line:84%
and she was talking
about the government

00:45:54.890 --> 00:45:57.070 align:middle line:84%
and how this is wrong
and that's wrong.

00:45:57.070 --> 00:45:58.870 align:middle line:84%
And she was driving
at the moment,

00:45:58.870 --> 00:46:01.220 align:middle line:84%
and just as she was
pulling into another lane,

00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:03.860 align:middle line:84%
she cut off this other driver
and started yelling at them.

00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:05.060 align:middle line:90%
Why are you buh buh buh buh.

00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:07.150 align:middle line:90%
Why did you do this?

00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:08.040 align:middle line:90%
And it struck me.

00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:11.294 align:middle line:84%
She sees everyone else's wrong,
but she doesn't see her own.

00:46:11.294 --> 00:46:12.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I see.

00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:13.690 align:middle line:90%
So the self purification.

00:46:13.690 --> 00:46:14.540 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise it's--

00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:16.331 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Look at
yourself in the mirror

00:46:16.331 --> 00:46:21.220 align:middle line:84%
first before you try to seek
to create change in the world.

00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:23.600 align:middle line:84%
So that's the number one
lesson for outsiders,

00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:25.860 align:middle line:84%
and the outsider
chapter in my book

00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:32.210 align:middle line:84%
is the most detailed because
there's a step by step plan

00:46:32.210 --> 00:46:35.040 align:middle line:90%
outline for outsiders.

00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:36.790 align:middle line:84%
How to take
responsibility and how

00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:40.850 align:middle line:84%
to ultimately express
your-- give the world

00:46:40.850 --> 00:46:42.520 align:middle line:90%
you're unique expression.

00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:44.940 align:middle line:84%
Like we were talking
about fusion cuisine.

00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:48.810 align:middle line:84%
Well to do fusion cuisine
you have to have tried sushi.

00:46:48.810 --> 00:46:52.370 align:middle line:84%
You have to have tried
Mongolian barbecue.

00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:53.990 align:middle line:84%
Homemade potato
chips from Idaho.

00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:56.200 align:middle line:84%
You have to try
everything first.

00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:58.720 align:middle line:84%
So if you're an
outsider, chances

00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:02.400 align:middle line:84%
are early in life you
go away from your birth

00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:07.710 align:middle line:84%
culture and experience
Rastafarian, South Africa,

00:47:07.710 --> 00:47:08.710 align:middle line:90%
northern European.

00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:11.190 align:middle line:84%
You just take it
all in, and there

00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:14.090 align:middle line:84%
comes a point in your
life when that starts

00:47:14.090 --> 00:47:17.980 align:middle line:84%
blending and digesting
in your spiritual body,

00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:20.010 align:middle line:84%
and then something
new comes out.

00:47:20.010 --> 00:47:21.520 align:middle line:84%
That's the gift
from the outsider.

00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:25.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you say this
is a dominant type right now.

00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:27.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: It is a
very populous type.

00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:31.240 align:middle line:84%
I would say about 50%
of the population--

00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:34.420 align:middle line:84%
this is an estimate--
is likely outsiders.

00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:35.489 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:47:35.489 --> 00:47:37.030 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: But
what usually ends up

00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:43.450 align:middle line:84%
happening is, instead of doing
that is that search, that

00:47:43.450 --> 00:47:46.770 align:middle line:84%
walk about, so to speak,
outsiders will often

00:47:46.770 --> 00:47:48.860 align:middle line:84%
repress themselves
and force themselves

00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:52.890 align:middle line:84%
to blend in because outsiders
are the chameleons of society.

00:47:52.890 --> 00:47:56.824 align:middle line:84%
They can look just like
anybody else and hide.

00:47:56.824 --> 00:47:58.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They can
blend anywhere.

00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:00.160 align:middle line:84%
I remember reading about
the characteristics.

00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:01.550 align:middle line:90%
They can blend high.

00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:02.580 align:middle line:90%
They can blend low.

00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:05.140 align:middle line:84%
They can travel in the
world and blend anywhere.

00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:06.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Exactly.

00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And that ability to
blend is actually good

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:11.830 align:middle line:84%
because it allows you
to go to, say, Africa

00:48:11.830 --> 00:48:14.130 align:middle line:84%
and just become part
of the culture there.

00:48:14.130 --> 00:48:17.820 align:middle line:84%
You're not sticking
out like a sore thumb,

00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:21.940 align:middle line:84%
but eventually you have
to learn who you are

00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:24.530 align:middle line:84%
and come back to
yourself, there's

00:48:24.530 --> 00:48:28.757 align:middle line:84%
a whole methodology to it,
how to do it step by step.

00:48:28.757 --> 00:48:30.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are there
physical characteristics

00:48:30.590 --> 00:48:31.507 align:middle line:90%
with the outsider?

00:48:31.507 --> 00:48:33.590 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yeah, the
outsider organ is the skin.

00:48:33.590 --> 00:48:38.070 align:middle line:84%
It's literally outside the
body, and in the same way--

00:48:38.070 --> 00:48:40.970 align:middle line:84%
so outsiders may decorate
their skin, tattoos,

00:48:40.970 --> 00:48:47.110 align:middle line:84%
or they may show more skin,
but because they're also

00:48:47.110 --> 00:48:49.210 align:middle line:84%
able to blend very
well, it's often

00:48:49.210 --> 00:48:51.110 align:middle line:84%
difficult to tell who
is an outsider or not.

00:48:51.110 --> 00:48:52.470 align:middle line:90%
Halle Berry is an outsider.

00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:54.250 align:middle line:84%
Denzel Washington
is an outsider.

00:48:54.250 --> 00:48:57.900 align:middle line:84%
David Beckham is an outsider
example I use in the book.

00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:01.260 align:middle line:84%
Very misunderstood when
he was a young player.

00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:05.830 align:middle line:84%
All of England hated him until
he scored this goal in a World

00:49:05.830 --> 00:49:08.270 align:middle line:84%
Cup match, and then
they all loved him,

00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:11.110 align:middle line:84%
and that's how the
outsider world works-- is

00:49:11.110 --> 00:49:13.840 align:middle line:84%
the society may hate
you at one moment,

00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:19.260 align:middle line:84%
but when you give your gift and
you're persistent in wanting

00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:21.170 align:middle line:84%
to give your gift
to that society,

00:49:21.170 --> 00:49:23.350 align:middle line:90%
they'll eventually embrace you.

00:49:23.350 --> 00:49:26.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now because we're
having so much fun time

00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:29.070 align:middle line:84%
is actually just flying
here, which is great,

00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:32.145 align:middle line:84%
but let's bring up
another nuance here.

00:49:32.145 --> 00:49:33.770 align:middle line:84%
We are living, as
you say in your book,

00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:34.956 align:middle line:90%
in the age of the merchant.

00:49:34.956 --> 00:49:35.830 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Correct.

00:49:35.830 --> 00:49:38.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, how do
outsiders and everyone

00:49:38.610 --> 00:49:40.690 align:middle line:90%
fit in this age of the merchant?

00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:44.320 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting to have
such a dominance of outsiders

00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:47.165 align:middle line:90%
in that particular age.

00:49:47.165 --> 00:49:48.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Living
in a merchant world

00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:52.570 align:middle line:84%
means whatever you do has
to make sense financially.

00:49:52.570 --> 00:49:53.900 align:middle line:90%
So let's say I'm a teacher.

00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:56.190 align:middle line:90%
I teach Sanskrit.

00:49:56.190 --> 00:49:59.150 align:middle line:84%
Merchant society doesn't
really put much value on that.

00:49:59.150 --> 00:50:01.940 align:middle line:84%
It actually doesn't put much
value on teachers in general

00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:05.350 align:middle line:84%
unless I'm teaching
people how to make money.

00:50:05.350 --> 00:50:08.600 align:middle line:84%
So teachers aren't well
recognized or remunerated

00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:10.980 align:middle line:90%
in a merchant society.

00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:12.360 align:middle line:90%
Outsiders-- the same thing.

00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:15.310 align:middle line:84%
Unless your invention,
your gift somehow helps

00:50:15.310 --> 00:50:18.084 align:middle line:90%
people make money, who cares?

00:50:18.084 --> 00:50:20.000 align:middle line:84%
Who cares if you know
how to meditate and hold

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.650 align:middle line:90%
your breath for 20 minutes?

00:50:21.650 --> 00:50:24.340 align:middle line:84%
Unless we can turn it into
a TV show, and then great.

00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:27.130 align:middle line:90%
Let's make money from it.

00:50:27.130 --> 00:50:31.200 align:middle line:84%
So one interesting
way to use this

00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:33.620 align:middle line:84%
is to know which
country to live in.

00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:36.900 align:middle line:84%
The US is a merchant
country, which

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:38.770 align:middle line:84%
is why the US is
very successful,

00:50:38.770 --> 00:50:42.060 align:middle line:84%
because the world is sort
of in this merchant period.

00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:45.610 align:middle line:84%
We're a global merchant
society, so the US is very good.

00:50:45.610 --> 00:50:47.050 align:middle line:90%
Canada is not.

00:50:47.050 --> 00:50:50.540 align:middle line:84%
Canada is an educator
country, and I'm not

00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:52.360 align:middle line:84%
sure what the politics
in Canada are like,

00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:55.080 align:middle line:84%
but I would wager that
their teachers are better

00:50:55.080 --> 00:51:01.070 align:middle line:84%
treated than ours, that their
education system is integrated

00:51:01.070 --> 00:51:01.595 align:middle line:90%
than ours.

00:51:01.595 --> 00:51:03.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's interesting,
because when you're

00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:06.430 align:middle line:84%
talking about the US
being a merchant society,

00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:09.650 align:middle line:84%
probably the biggest pain
in most people's lives

00:51:09.650 --> 00:51:12.200 align:middle line:84%
is the notion that
everything they do

00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:14.460 align:middle line:84%
has to somehow be
attached to money.

00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: And
the bill, right?

00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:18.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, it all
has to be monetized.

00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:20.110 align:middle line:84%
When there are so
many people with so

00:51:20.110 --> 00:51:23.850 align:middle line:84%
many beautiful and diverse
talents that aren't regarded,

00:51:23.850 --> 00:51:28.930 align:middle line:84%
that we generally
aren't paid well for,

00:51:28.930 --> 00:51:31.640 align:middle line:84%
it's a very painful
society in that sense.

00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:33.720 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: The hallmark
of a merchant society--

00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:36.110 align:middle line:84%
remember that the
merchant's dharma is not

00:51:36.110 --> 00:51:40.360 align:middle line:84%
to fill up on stuff, and
more events, and adventures,

00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:42.720 align:middle line:84%
and things, but to
give to charity.

00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:49.250 align:middle line:84%
So I would argue that
having traveled a fair bit

00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:55.390 align:middle line:84%
around the world people love
America because we build wells,

00:51:55.390 --> 00:51:56.266 align:middle line:90%
because we give food.

00:51:56.266 --> 00:51:57.556 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, that's true too.

00:51:57.556 --> 00:51:59.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Because
we export fun culture.

00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:03.610 align:middle line:84%
Even Coke, and Pepsi, and
blue jeans, and rock and roll

00:52:03.610 --> 00:52:06.030 align:middle line:90%
gives people hope in life.

00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:09.330 align:middle line:84%
They don't love us
because of our armies.

00:52:09.330 --> 00:52:13.075 align:middle line:84%
So just in the same way
that a type can integrated,

00:52:13.075 --> 00:52:14.310 align:middle line:90%
it can disintegrate.

00:52:14.310 --> 00:52:17.190 align:middle line:84%
So a merchant disintegrates
into the warrior.

00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:18.760 align:middle line:90%
I talk about this in the book.

00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:21.470 align:middle line:84%
It seems complicated because
we don't have graphs and stuff

00:52:21.470 --> 00:52:22.522 align:middle line:90%
to look at here.

00:52:22.522 --> 00:52:24.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the book
is available, yes.

00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:26.688 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: For the merchant,
the worst thing is to become

00:52:26.688 --> 00:52:28.930 align:middle line:84%
a warrior, because then
you become violent,

00:52:28.930 --> 00:52:32.950 align:middle line:84%
and when people instinctively
look at a violent merchant

00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:34.610 align:middle line:84%
and say that's ugly,
I don't like it--

00:52:34.610 --> 00:52:37.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that is what
we're expressing also in the US.

00:52:37.170 --> 00:52:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: In many ways, yeah.

00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:43.460 align:middle line:84%
So in a certain way, we should
be giving more to charity.

00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:48.650 align:middle line:84%
So things that
Microsoft, Bill Gates,

00:52:48.650 --> 00:52:50.720 align:middle line:84%
and Bill Clinton, and
these types of people,

00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:54.400 align:middle line:84%
and Oprah Winfrey are doing to
create charitable organizations

00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:57.370 align:middle line:84%
around the world is
representing us well.

00:52:57.370 --> 00:52:59.550 align:middle line:84%
The other things we're
doing with our military

00:52:59.550 --> 00:53:02.990 align:middle line:84%
are not necessarily from
a dharmic standpoint.

00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:07.305 align:middle line:84%
I'm not speaking in terms of
politics or even economics.

00:53:07.305 --> 00:53:10.410 align:middle line:84%
From a dharma level, we
as a merchant country

00:53:10.410 --> 00:53:13.390 align:middle line:84%
need to be of
service, of charity.

00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:14.240 align:middle line:90%
Feed the poor.

00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:15.040 align:middle line:90%
Feed the hungry.

00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:16.310 align:middle line:90%
So what if it takes money.

00:53:16.310 --> 00:53:16.940 align:middle line:90%
So what?

00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:18.340 align:middle line:90%
Give the money.

00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:23.480 align:middle line:84%
The end result will be a
positive net outcome for us.

00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:26.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, that
makes total sense.

00:53:26.210 --> 00:53:29.150 align:middle line:84%
Now what about-- you were
talking about a little bit.

00:53:29.150 --> 00:53:30.850 align:middle line:90%
What about in relationships?

00:53:30.850 --> 00:53:32.860 align:middle line:84%
If you're giving
a little tutorial,

00:53:32.860 --> 00:53:36.080 align:middle line:84%
say someone is just starting
up a new relationship

00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:37.300 align:middle line:90%
with someone.

00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:41.360 align:middle line:84%
What kind of matches would
you more or less avoid

00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:44.630 align:middle line:84%
on a really personal,
intimate level versus which

00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:46.490 align:middle line:90%
ones would flourish best?

00:53:46.490 --> 00:53:49.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Well, a merchant
and warrior as we were just

00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:51.530 align:middle line:90%
saying are water and fire.

00:53:51.530 --> 00:53:55.410 align:middle line:84%
So we have to understand what
each one does to the other.

00:53:55.410 --> 00:53:58.410 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that kind
of relationship won't work.

00:53:58.410 --> 00:54:01.400 align:middle line:84%
It means it can work,
but fundamentally you

00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:03.650 align:middle line:90%
speak different languages.

00:54:03.650 --> 00:54:06.180 align:middle line:84%
So you have to be clear in
your communication number one.

00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:10.020 align:middle line:84%
Honey, when I said I need
you to go to the store

00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:12.560 align:middle line:84%
and pick this up, I wasn't
trying to be dictatorial.

00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:14.096 align:middle line:90%
This is the warrior speaking.

00:54:14.096 --> 00:54:15.470 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to
say that I really

00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:17.652 align:middle line:84%
want to cook you this
beautiful dinner,

00:54:17.652 --> 00:54:18.860 align:middle line:90%
but I need these ingredients.

00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:20.318 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
have to massage it

00:54:20.318 --> 00:54:21.871 align:middle line:90%
a lot more in that situation.

00:54:21.871 --> 00:54:23.370 align:middle line:84%
We have water and
fire, for example.

00:54:23.370 --> 00:54:23.730 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Correct.

00:54:23.730 --> 00:54:24.230 align:middle line:90%
Correct.

00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing when
you have air and earth.

00:54:26.930 --> 00:54:30.760 align:middle line:84%
If you have a nice mountain,
wind erodes that mountain,

00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:34.291 align:middle line:84%
and if I'm-- I'm an educator,
and I can be a little too

00:54:34.291 --> 00:54:34.790 align:middle line:90%
critical.

00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:38.160 align:middle line:84%
I can be, well, technically
you shouldn't have said that.

00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:43.274 align:middle line:84%
No, it's I before E except after
C if they're spelling sucks.

00:54:43.274 --> 00:54:43.940 align:middle line:90%
We're like that.

00:54:43.940 --> 00:54:46.870 align:middle line:84%
We're educators, so we're
constantly correcting people,

00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:49.790 align:middle line:84%
and that will wear
down a laborer.

00:54:49.790 --> 00:54:52.520 align:middle line:84%
And so what you have
to understand-- how you

00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:54.540 align:middle line:90%
come across to the other type.

00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:56.550 align:middle line:84%
And once you
understand their type

00:54:56.550 --> 00:54:58.650 align:middle line:84%
and they understand
where you're coming from,

00:54:58.650 --> 00:55:01.140 align:middle line:84%
that opens a channel
of communication.

00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:02.980 align:middle line:84%
So that's the very
first basic step--

00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:06.030 align:middle line:84%
is to understand the other,
your partner, and how

00:55:06.030 --> 00:55:07.970 align:middle line:90%
they see the world.

00:55:07.970 --> 00:55:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And when you can sort of have
that as a reference point,

00:55:11.170 --> 00:55:14.796 align:middle line:84%
then you can couch your
words more appropriately.

00:55:14.796 --> 00:55:16.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
the natural ones

00:55:16.170 --> 00:55:18.330 align:middle line:84%
are the ones we already
talked about before.

00:55:18.330 --> 00:55:20.054 align:middle line:84%
You have the laborer
and the merchant.

00:55:20.054 --> 00:55:21.220 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: They work well.

00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:21.930 align:middle line:90%
They help each other.

00:55:21.930 --> 00:55:23.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
educator and the warrior.

00:55:23.550 --> 00:55:24.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: It's
not always easy.

00:55:24.570 --> 00:55:25.361 align:middle line:90%
Don't get me wrong.

00:55:25.361 --> 00:55:27.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah, but
they can work together.

00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:28.880 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Correct.

00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:30.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What
about the outsider?

00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:31.580 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: What
about the outside?

00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:32.790 align:middle line:90%
Oh, poor little outsider.

00:55:32.790 --> 00:55:34.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What happens to them?

00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:36.800 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Outsiders
have a unique gift

00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:41.290 align:middle line:84%
in that they can play any
of the other four types.

00:55:41.290 --> 00:55:46.440 align:middle line:84%
So if you're an outsider, your
number one mantra is freedom.

00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:49.560 align:middle line:84%
For an outsider, I can
give you a million dollars

00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:53.810 align:middle line:84%
and a golden cage and say, but
you have to live in this cage.

00:55:53.810 --> 00:55:57.430 align:middle line:84%
That's a recipe for disaster,
because sooner or later they're

00:55:57.430 --> 00:55:58.640 align:middle line:90%
going to rebel.

00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:02.490 align:middle line:84%
So the outsider needs freedom
first of all in anything,

00:56:02.490 --> 00:56:07.080 align:middle line:84%
even in a relationship,
but as an outsider,

00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:09.580 align:middle line:84%
you can play any of
the other four types.

00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:13.090 align:middle line:84%
David Beckham, an outsider
playing a warrior.

00:56:13.090 --> 00:56:14.060 align:middle line:90%
He's an athlete.

00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:17.220 align:middle line:84%
Halle Berry, an outsider
playing a merchant.

00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:20.100 align:middle line:90%
She's an actress.

00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:22.610 align:middle line:84%
Or some outsiders choose
not to play any role.

00:56:22.610 --> 00:56:23.880 align:middle line:90%
I'll just be an outsider.

00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:25.880 align:middle line:90%
David Blaine, outsider.

00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:28.260 align:middle line:90%
I am who I am.

00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:29.680 align:middle line:90%
Salvador Dali.

00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:32.610 align:middle line:90%
I am an outsider.

00:56:32.610 --> 00:56:35.100 align:middle line:84%
So outsiders can take
on any of the roles.

00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:37.900 align:middle line:84%
If you're an outsider
playing an educator,

00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:41.880 align:middle line:84%
then pretty much follow
the rules of the educator--

00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:46.090 align:middle line:84%
means if you're relating
to a laborer it will

00:56:46.090 --> 00:56:48.700 align:middle line:84%
be a little more difficult,
because you're functioning

00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:50.670 align:middle line:90%
basically as an educator.

00:56:50.670 --> 00:56:51.850 align:middle line:90%
It's like a house cat.

00:56:51.850 --> 00:56:54.390 align:middle line:84%
A house cat has the
lion inside her,

00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:58.500 align:middle line:84%
but she's functioning as
your pet for now-- for now.

00:56:58.500 --> 00:56:59.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: For now.

00:56:59.250 --> 00:57:00.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Until
she decides to take--

00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:00.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
she'll turn on you.

00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:02.053 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yes, at some point.

00:57:02.053 --> 00:57:06.920 align:middle line:84%
At some point, she will come
back and honor her lion nature.

00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:08.292 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Inner major feline.

00:57:08.292 --> 00:57:09.000 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yes.

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:12.290 align:middle line:84%
In the same way, every
outsider has that nature,

00:57:12.290 --> 00:57:15.040 align:middle line:84%
but they can take on the
roles of the other types.

00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:17.920 align:middle line:84%
So to know which type you're
playing the test helps.

00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about
over a lifetime?

00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:21.737 align:middle line:90%
Can it change?

00:57:21.737 --> 00:57:23.570 align:middle line:84%
For example, you're
looking at a birth chart

00:57:23.570 --> 00:57:25.550 align:middle line:84%
and it indicates one
thing, but the self test

00:57:25.550 --> 00:57:26.800 align:middle line:90%
indicates something different.

00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:27.883 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: It can, yeah.

00:57:27.883 --> 00:57:30.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so how
do we reconcile this?

00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:34.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: That's why I tell
people go with the self test

00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:35.910 align:middle line:90%
primarily.

00:57:35.910 --> 00:57:36.410 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes--

00:57:36.410 --> 00:57:38.493 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because that's
where you are now anyway.

00:57:38.493 --> 00:57:40.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Exactly,
and that's what matters.

00:57:40.510 --> 00:57:42.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because this
is mutable, is it not?

00:57:42.730 --> 00:57:45.010 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: It's
somewhat mutable.

00:57:45.010 --> 00:57:47.550 align:middle line:90%
You are who you are from birth.

00:57:47.550 --> 00:57:49.900 align:middle line:84%
In my mind, this
is genetic, even

00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:51.770 align:middle line:84%
though scientists and
geneticists haven't

00:57:51.770 --> 00:57:54.780 align:middle line:90%
looked for the dharma type.

00:57:54.780 --> 00:57:57.640 align:middle line:90%
I think it is there.

00:57:57.640 --> 00:58:00.720 align:middle line:84%
What undergoes
change, however, is

00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:02.110 align:middle line:90%
what you do with those genes.

00:58:02.110 --> 00:58:06.601 align:middle line:84%
What you're exposed to over
your lifetime will mold that,

00:58:06.601 --> 00:58:09.100 align:middle line:84%
and that's what I call the life
cycle, the planetary period.

00:58:09.100 --> 00:58:10.730 align:middle line:90%
You're in an outsider period.

00:58:10.730 --> 00:58:14.050 align:middle line:84%
So instead of talking
about crunching numbers

00:58:14.050 --> 00:58:18.220 align:middle line:84%
with some major
corporation about X, Y, Z,

00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:20.830 align:middle line:84%
you're doing something that's
a little bit out of the box

00:58:20.830 --> 00:58:23.850 align:middle line:84%
and helping people
understand consciousness,

00:58:23.850 --> 00:58:26.620 align:middle line:90%
something that's not tangible.

00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:29.510 align:middle line:84%
Outer space, inner
space, things that

00:58:29.510 --> 00:58:31.780 align:middle line:84%
are outside of the
normal conversation.

00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:33.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I would
say interestingly 2002

00:58:33.770 --> 00:58:35.340 align:middle line:84%
is when that period
started, and it

00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:37.183 align:middle line:84%
was right after
that that my husband

00:58:37.183 --> 00:58:40.130 align:middle line:84%
at the time, Scott Meredith,
and I started Conscious Media

00:58:40.130 --> 00:58:41.650 align:middle line:90%
Network.

00:58:41.650 --> 00:58:45.070 align:middle line:84%
The seeds of that were
planted around 2003, 2004

00:58:45.070 --> 00:58:48.170 align:middle line:84%
to give birth to that genre
of programming at that time.

00:58:48.170 --> 00:58:49.220 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Fascinating.

00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And you will continue to
be in that area until 2021

00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:54.130 align:middle line:90%
if I recall.

00:58:54.130 --> 00:58:57.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So even though
what you have in your birth

00:58:57.090 --> 00:59:00.430 align:middle line:84%
chart on a computer--
that's not maybe

00:59:00.430 --> 00:59:01.750 align:middle line:90%
how you're acting and feeling.

00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:03.000 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: It's a blueprint.

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:07.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a blueprint,
but your way of expressing it

00:59:07.470 --> 00:59:09.450 align:middle line:84%
may have shifted
because of that cycle

00:59:09.450 --> 00:59:11.020 align:middle line:84%
you're in as we
spoke about earlier.

00:59:11.020 --> 00:59:11.355 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yes, correct.

00:59:11.355 --> 00:59:11.690 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:59:11.690 --> 00:59:12.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
so interesting,

00:59:12.780 --> 00:59:14.155 align:middle line:84%
and one thing we
didn't get to is

00:59:14.155 --> 00:59:17.210 align:middle line:84%
what helps each one
evolve and devolve.

00:59:17.210 --> 00:59:20.031 align:middle line:84%
I think it's best that
people just read the book.

00:59:20.031 --> 00:59:22.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Or we can talk
about it for another hour.

00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:25.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which we don't have
time to do, but I'd love to.

00:59:25.730 --> 00:59:27.950 align:middle line:90%
Simon, I want to thank you.

00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:29.940 align:middle line:84%
It's very helpful,
and as I said earlier,

00:59:29.940 --> 00:59:32.490 align:middle line:84%
I think it's something
that could be extremely

00:59:32.490 --> 00:59:35.360 align:middle line:84%
useful for families,
for co-workers,

00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:38.571 align:middle line:84%
for relationships, pretty
much any kind of interaction

00:59:38.571 --> 00:59:39.320 align:middle line:90%
with other people.

00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:42.490 align:middle line:84%
It's really nice to be
somewhat educated as to who's

00:59:42.490 --> 00:59:43.582 align:middle line:90%
sitting in front of you.

00:59:43.582 --> 00:59:45.540 align:middle line:10%
>>CHOKOISKY: Even the
type of yoga that you do.

00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:47.270 align:middle line:10%
There are certain
asanas as we were

00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:51.140 align:middle line:10%
discussing earlier that work
for educators much better

00:59:51.140 --> 00:59:51.860 align:middle line:10%
than others.

00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:56.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And also dietary
plans, and eating plans,

00:59:56.050 --> 00:59:57.810 align:middle line:84%
and such that work
better for each type.

00:59:57.810 --> 00:59:57.970 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Correct.

00:59:57.970 --> 01:00:00.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And again, we can't
get into all of it right now,

01:00:00.650 --> 01:00:03.496 align:middle line:84%
but people can take
a look at the book.

01:00:03.496 --> 01:00:04.370 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Awesome.

01:00:04.370 --> 01:00:05.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thanks so much.

01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:05.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Thank you.

01:00:05.330 --> 01:00:05.430 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:06.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I really enjoyed it.

01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:09.600 align:middle line:10%
"The Five Dharma Types"
is a wonderful self help

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:12.040 align:middle line:10%
book with tests to
discover your type.

01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:14.580 align:middle line:10%
You can find it at major
book selling sites.

01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:17.860 align:middle line:10%
To connect with Simon you

Until next time, thank you for
joining us here in Gaiam TV.

01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:28.634 align:middle line:90%
