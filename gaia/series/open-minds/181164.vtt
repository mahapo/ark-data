>>REGINA MEREDITH: 20 years
ago, thousands of hearts

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.070 align:middle line:10%
were lifted by the
film "Life After Life"

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.280 align:middle line:10%
with Dr. Raymond Moody.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.660 align:middle line:10%
It was a documentary about
near-death experiences.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.370 align:middle line:10%
After interviewing
Raymond Moody a little

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:32.960 align:middle line:10%
while back, he told
me that I needed

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.470 align:middle line:10%
to speak with his colleague
Lisa Smartt on her new book

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.350 align:middle line:10%
"Words at the Threshold:
The Words of People

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.300 align:middle line:10%
Who are about to Transition."

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.370 align:middle line:10%
And your book is
just so beautiful

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.950 align:middle line:10%
because it really
helps people understand

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.200 align:middle line:10%
this really is a transition.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.580 align:middle line:90%
This isn't a goodbye.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.290 align:middle line:90%
It's a transition.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And yet a lot of people are
edgy about even contemplating

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.840 align:middle line:84%
death, no less contemplating
the death of their loved ones.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.450 align:middle line:84%
But what I like
about this book is

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.450 align:middle line:84%
it gives us an idea of
when the time comes,

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.790 align:middle line:84%
we're sitting with someone
who's in the process

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.720 align:middle line:84%
of transitioning, it gives
us a guide of how to interact

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.520 align:middle line:84%
with them, how to perceive them
and understand them better.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.480 align:middle line:84%
So I really appreciate
the work you've done.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.130 align:middle line:84%
So first of all,
the book is based

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.610 align:middle line:84%
on 1,500 different
cases, utterances

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.050 align:middle line:90%
of people on their deathbed.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.850 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.890 align:middle line:84%
Maybe just refer to
that, the project

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.690 align:middle line:90%
itself for just a moment.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.940 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA SMARTT: The project
is the Final Words Project,

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.340 align:middle line:10%
and I founded it in 2014.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.187 align:middle line:10%
And we're actually up to 2,000
final words or utterances.

00:01:35.187 --> 00:01:36.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I've got old data.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.880 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:37.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: Yes.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.170 align:middle line:84%
Just in-- the more
that I've spoken

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.794 align:middle line:84%
about this work, the
more people who've

00:01:40.794 --> 00:01:44.132 align:middle line:84%
come forward and shared their
stories and accounts with me.

00:01:44.132 --> 00:01:45.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now
how did you end up

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.810 align:middle line:90%
pairing up with Raymond Moody?

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: Over a three-week
period, my father was dying,

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.900 align:middle line:84%
and I wrote down
all his utterances.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.335 align:middle line:84%
And I was very curious
what I had witnessed.

00:01:57.335 --> 00:02:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And as a linguist, I wrote
down everything he said.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.650 align:middle line:84%
Because when I saw language
that was so baffling to me,

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.830 align:middle line:84%
it was difficult not to write
it down and try to figure out

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.690 align:middle line:90%
what was going on.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought
back to some books

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.620 align:middle line:84%
I had read way back
in my early days

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.700 align:middle line:84%
as a teenager and young adult to
try to shed some light on what

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.510 align:middle line:90%
I had witnessed.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And I remembered
Dr. Moody's book.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And synchronistically, a
couple months after my father

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.390 align:middle line:84%
passed away, a friend
of ours told us

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.170 align:middle line:84%
that he was doing a seminar
with Raymond Moody in Alabama,

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.980 align:middle line:90%
and would I like to join him?

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.870 align:middle line:90%
And I went out to Alabama.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.720 align:middle line:84%
And the fourth day
the seminar, Raymond

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.140 align:middle line:84%
started talking
about final words.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And he had mentioned he'd been
looking for a linguist who

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.650 align:middle line:84%
might one day work with him on
this whole topic of what people

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.870 align:middle line:84%
say in those last
days, weeks, hours.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And I was just struck
by the synchronicity

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.097 align:middle line:84%
and a relationship
was born right then.

00:02:58.097 --> 00:02:59.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, he spoke
very highly of you.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.410 align:middle line:84%
And so I think I contacted
you right after I interviewed

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.010 align:middle line:90%
Raymond a few months ago.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.230 align:middle line:90%
So OK.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.560 align:middle line:84%
Let's go with the words
of one very famous person

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.254 align:middle line:90%
because I just love it so much.

00:03:11.254 --> 00:03:12.920 align:middle line:84%
So I want to toss it
out right up front.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.419 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to go into
what happened with your dad.

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:16.260 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.040 align:middle line:84%
So in the words of Steven
Jobs just before he died,

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.030 align:middle line:90%
the words were, oh wow.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.395 align:middle line:90%
Oh wow, oh wow.

00:03:24.395 --> 00:03:27.110 align:middle line:90%


00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: His words are the
ones that might be most popular.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.760 align:middle line:90%
Many of us have heard.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.840 align:middle line:84%
But what's remarkable is in
bedrooms or in hospital rooms

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.330 align:middle line:84%
throughout the country,
even throughout the world,

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.960 align:middle line:84%
words like that are
being heard privately.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.350 align:middle line:84%
People are seeing
remarkable things oftentimes

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.287 align:middle line:90%
as they leave this world.

00:03:48.287 --> 00:03:49.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I've loved that.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, of all the
things he'd seen

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.410 align:middle line:84%
in this life, what he had seen
over there was unbelievable.

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.450 align:middle line:84%
And so I mean, that's
almost like an invitation.

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:58.250 align:middle line:90%
What'd he see?

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.355 align:middle line:90%
I can't wait.

00:03:59.355 --> 00:04:00.980 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I
think there were times

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.030 align:middle line:90%
that Raymond Moody's film--

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.710 align:middle line:84%
it did make people
feel like that,

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.590 align:middle line:84%
like the experiences that
people had in near-death

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.310 align:middle line:84%
and the freedom and liberation
and the absolute vast awareness

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.400 align:middle line:90%
that they had--

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.570 align:middle line:84%
transcending time
and space even--

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.420 align:middle line:84%
was almost like a lovely
invitation in a way.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, I remember back
when the movie came out--

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.050 align:middle line:84%
the film came out-- people
saying, oh god, I can't wait.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.240 align:middle line:90%
So now, let's go to your dad.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And you wrote the book because
of those final words, as you

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.810 align:middle line:84%
said, but also the
nature of his words

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.030 align:middle line:84%
because angels spoke
to him and gave him

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.440 align:middle line:90%
very direct information.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And he did not
believe in angels.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.474 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about your
dad in those final weeks.

00:04:44.474 --> 00:04:45.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: Well,
this whole feeling

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.130 align:middle line:84%
of it being an aspirational
time rather than something

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.580 align:middle line:84%
to be frightened of was
really captured in what

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.220 align:middle line:90%
I saw in my father's last days.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.530 align:middle line:84%
Because this is a man
who believed in nothing

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:58.610 align:middle line:90%
beyond this world.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.520 align:middle line:84%
Matter of fact, he was a
New Yorker, cigar-chomping,

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.270 align:middle line:84%
kind of-- you know,
New Yorker skeptical--

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.550 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.155 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Angels weren't
part of his lexicon.

00:05:05.155 --> 00:05:06.140 align:middle line:10%
>>SMARTT: Angels were
not part of anything.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.180 align:middle line:10%
As a matter of fact, if I ever
mentioned anything like that,

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.380 align:middle line:10%
he'd roll his eyes.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.480 align:middle line:10%
And so-- and this is what struck
me so much with his final words

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.150 align:middle line:10%
was that he started
to talk about things

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.580 align:middle line:10%
that in his ordinary
life he would have never,

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.510 align:middle line:10%
ever mentioned and in ways that
he had never spoken about them.

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:29.760 align:middle line:84%
So about 10 days before he
died, he woke up from resting.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.480 align:middle line:90%
And just, his eyes popped open.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.340 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Lisa, you were
right about the angels--

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.172 align:middle line:84%
because I had spoke in the
past about angels a bit.

00:05:38.172 --> 00:05:39.380 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what do you mean?

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.610 align:middle line:90%
And he said, there are angels.

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.210 align:middle line:84%
So that, I noted that and
was blown away, but also,

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.150 align:middle line:84%
obviously, really intrigued
and wanted to know more.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.250 align:middle line:84%
And three days
before he died, he

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.540 align:middle line:84%
announced the angels say,
enough, enough already, enough,

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.700 align:middle line:90%
only three days left.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, three
days later, my father

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:01.380 align:middle line:90%
passed on very peacefully.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And the angels being
in the room with people

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:08.550 align:middle line:84%
is something we hear often
in the data I have collected.

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.680 align:middle line:84%
And also, people
seeing something up

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.190 align:middle line:90%
here is also very common.

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:15.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And your
dad's final words,

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.150 align:middle line:84%
which were not dissimilar to
Steven Jobs and many others--

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:20.620 align:middle line:90%
but I love it.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.150 align:middle line:84%
He said, I have never
done this before, Alice.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:25.530 align:middle line:90%
I have never done this.

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:30.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: Yes, and this
is interesting was the--

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.130 align:middle line:90%
I have never done this before.

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And those words
were the ones that

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.630 align:middle line:84%
pushed me into
knowing that I had

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:40.980 align:middle line:84%
to spend the rest of my life
investigating this topic,

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.980 align:middle line:84%
because I wondered,
what is this "this?"

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:47.656 align:middle line:84%
What is this "this" my
father is talking about?

00:06:47.656 --> 00:06:50.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And some people do
give you little hints of it.

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.470 align:middle line:84%
We'll move further into
the story in a bit.

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:54.360 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about this
event when you woke up

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.995 align:middle line:90%
at 3:15 in the morning.

00:06:55.995 --> 00:06:59.400 align:middle line:90%


00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: Raymond
talks about something

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.486 align:middle line:84%
called a shared
death experience.

00:07:02.486 --> 00:07:04.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course, at
this time, I didn't

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:05.790 align:middle line:84%
know Raymond's term
for this, but I

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:09.540 align:middle line:84%
had an experience where I woke
up at 3:15 in the morning.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:12.360 align:middle line:84%
And I was living in
Napa, California.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at the
red digital clock,

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:16.050 align:middle line:90%
you know, the red digits.

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:17.960 align:middle line:90%
And I saw 3:15.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.664 align:middle line:84%
And I felt this heaviness in the
room, as if there were people.

00:07:20.664 --> 00:07:22.080 align:middle line:84%
You know how if
the lights are off

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.030 align:middle line:90%
you can feel there is presences?

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:24.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, presences.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: And but there--

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:26.739 align:middle line:90%
it was so thick.

00:07:26.739 --> 00:07:27.780 align:middle line:90%
And I woke up my husband.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I wonder if
my father is dying now,

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.540 align:middle line:84%
because there is such
an energy in the room.

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.320 align:middle line:90%
And I wonder what's going on.

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.990 align:middle line:84%
And he said, honey,
get some sleep.

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:40.687 align:middle line:84%
And by 3:26, I
was back to sleep.

00:07:40.687 --> 00:07:43.020 align:middle line:84%
I remember looking at the
clock and going back to sleep.

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And I came into Berkeley the
next day to check on my father.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And I asked my mom,
how is dad doing?

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.820 align:middle line:84%
She said, he's fine,
but the strangest thing

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.410 align:middle line:90%
happened at 3:15 in the morning.

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:53.460 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yes?

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:54.690 align:middle line:90%
She said, yeah, he woke up.

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And he said, it's
so crowded in here.

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.252 align:middle line:84%
What are all these
people doing in here?

00:08:00.252 --> 00:08:02.460 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that was so
fascinating, because my dad

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:05.380 align:middle line:84%
and I both had the same
experience at the same time

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:06.180 align:middle line:90%
miles--

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:07.410 align:middle line:90%
70 miles apart.

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:09.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And three time
zone-- oh no, 70 miles, he

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:11.350 align:middle line:84%
was in the same
time zone as you?

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:11.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: Yes.

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:12.187 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, you were--

00:08:12.187 --> 00:08:12.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: So at the time--

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:12.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --at the same--

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:12.657 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: --I was in--

00:08:12.657 --> 00:08:12.804 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --time zone?

00:08:12.804 --> 00:08:12.846 align:middle line:90%


00:08:12.846 --> 00:08:13.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: California.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.707 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:08:14.707 --> 00:08:17.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: And now I have come
to know that that's called

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.123 align:middle line:90%
a shared death experience.

00:08:18.123 --> 00:08:20.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually
much more prevalent

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.890 align:middle line:84%
than we may have known
before, as we're doing

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:24.240 align:middle line:90%
more research into that area.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, now,
sitting with someone

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:32.039 align:middle line:84%
going through the
process, the transition,

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:34.169 align:middle line:84%
one thing you bring
about in this book is

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:36.912 align:middle line:84%
the notion that the final
thing to go is hearing.

00:08:36.912 --> 00:08:39.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, the final
final thing is consciousness,

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.299 align:middle line:84%
but that the final
sense to go is hearing,

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:44.580 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of times we
can't see them responding,

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:48.390 align:middle line:84%
and we just assume there is no
one home, but that's not true.

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:50.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: That is not true.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.725 align:middle line:84%
Madelaine Lawrence has
done beautiful research

00:08:52.725 --> 00:08:54.630 align:middle line:90%
with coma survivors.

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And many people who
come out of comas

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:59.210 align:middle line:90%
talk about what they have heard.

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And there are two
things that go on.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.710 align:middle line:84%
One is there is more increased
telepathic understanding

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:09.000 align:middle line:84%
as people are in comas, which
I might talk about later also.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.980 align:middle line:90%
But they're hearing.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.060 align:middle line:90%
They're hearing a lot.

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.640 align:middle line:84%
They're hearing more
than we may ever imagine.

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And every medical provider
I've spoken to in hospice

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:21.540 align:middle line:84%
has said that the hearing
is the last to go,

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:26.610 align:middle line:84%
And that really, how important
it is for us to say kind words,

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:28.440 align:middle line:90%
because people hear them.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And also there is something
called terminal lucidity.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:35.400 align:middle line:84%
Right before people die,
there is a flash of lucidity.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's often a time when
we know that people have

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:40.030 align:middle line:90%
heard more than we thought.

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:41.620 align:middle line:84%
You know, they may
say something like,

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:44.080 align:middle line:84%
well, I heard Uncle Bill
say that I never loved him,

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:44.880 align:middle line:90%
but I did.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.170 align:middle line:90%
I've always loved him.

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:48.189 align:middle line:90%
So people are much more aware.

00:09:48.189 --> 00:09:50.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, we have
to be careful about that.

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And we have to, not only
speak in kind terms,

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:54.633 align:middle line:84%
but speak as though they're in
the room with us and listening.

00:09:54.633 --> 00:09:56.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: Yes it's
so common for people

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:59.010 align:middle line:84%
to just think that the
dying, especially if they're

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:03.480 align:middle line:84%
unresponsive, are like a couch,
or a pillow, or something,

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:06.900 align:middle line:84%
but they're human beings
with, in some ways, maybe even

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:13.020 align:middle line:84%
more awakened senses
than when they're alive.

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And some of the research
indicates that, in some ways,

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:19.020 align:middle line:84%
our senses may be even
more highly attuned.

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
we're not limited

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:23.970 align:middle line:84%
to the physical boundaries
of the senses any longer.

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And I know when my mom was
in a coma before she died,

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:27.890 align:middle line:90%
I would just go--

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:31.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I would go into another
space and meet with her.

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And she could tell
me what was going on,

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:37.510 align:middle line:84%
and what she was aware of, and
right down to the final day,

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:39.170 align:middle line:90%
saying, you can let me go.

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:39.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm done now.

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:42.390 align:middle line:90%
And she did die that night.

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:45.490 align:middle line:84%
But what I saw around
her was beautiful,

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:48.640 align:middle line:84%
because I was going
where she was.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.340 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't expecting
her to come to us.

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And she had reverted in
age to a much younger--

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:58.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she looked
to be about 19 or 20.

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:01.000 align:middle line:84%
And she was surrounded
by these beings that

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.770 align:middle line:84%
were in a little
semicircle behind her,

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:06.460 align:middle line:84%
quietly just there, ushering
her through the process.

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And she was saying,
let me go now.

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:08.980 align:middle line:90%
I can go.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:09.820 align:middle line:90%
I feel good.

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:11.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready.

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And it really gave
my sister and I

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:18.530 align:middle line:84%
the courage to just be at
peace with the whole thing.

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:19.330 align:middle line:90%
And she did.

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:20.475 align:middle line:90%
She died that night.

00:11:20.475 --> 00:11:21.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: It's
wonderful that you

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:24.280 align:middle line:84%
had access to that kind
of communication with her.

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's something I hope that
my work, as well as there are

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:31.030 align:middle line:84%
so many others who are
engaging in this kind of work,

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:33.580 align:middle line:84%
to give them that opportunity
to connect with their loved

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:36.280 align:middle line:84%
ones in the way that I
imagine that you did.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.920 align:middle line:84%
Because I hear this
from nurses, people

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.840 align:middle line:84%
who have been kind of
in the closet with it,

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.200 align:middle line:84%
who have done it in a
way that was hidden--

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.640 align:middle line:84%
but now people are
coming out more

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.160 align:middle line:84%
openly about being
able to communicate.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.080 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was for
you telepathically,

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.794 align:middle line:90%
or some other way.

00:11:52.794 --> 00:11:54.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm hearing these
stories more and more.

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And they seem very,
very-- they are real.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:57.800 align:middle line:90%
They are real.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a linguist, so my
interest was in communication,

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:03.370 align:middle line:90%
or has been in communication.

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:04.750 align:middle line:84%
What I didn't
expect when I began

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:07.210 align:middle line:84%
this research is that it
would open the door for me

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:10.150 align:middle line:84%
to talk and think
about telepathy.

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:11.785 align:middle line:90%
And that is-- I mean, now I am--

00:12:11.785 --> 00:12:12.760 align:middle line:90%
I was a linguist.

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.400 align:middle line:84%
Where it used to be, there
was a range of communication

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.810 align:middle line:84%
like this, now that range
of communication for me

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:20.012 align:middle line:84%
has expanded to
something much larger.

00:12:20.012 --> 00:12:21.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, it's beautiful.

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:22.360 align:middle line:90%
And it shows in the book.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to top off that
little story after my mom left.

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:26.590 align:middle line:90%
She died.

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:29.350 align:middle line:90%


00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:34.810 align:middle line:84%
My sister in particular was
more kind of attached to my mom

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:38.080 align:middle line:84%
in a way of, oh god,
I miss you so much,

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:41.120 align:middle line:84%
where I tend to kind of go
with the flow of what is.

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.450 align:middle line:84%
But what happened one
night a little while later

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:46.750 align:middle line:84%
is, she came into my dream
at night, and said, you know,

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:50.870 align:middle line:84%
I keep coming here because
you guys are calling for me.

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:52.790 align:middle line:90%
And she was exhausted.

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And I said, mom, don't
come from where you are.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.389 align:middle line:84%
Don't come from that
realm back here for us.

00:12:59.389 --> 00:13:01.180 align:middle line:84%
You do not need to
drain yourself that way.

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.100 align:middle line:90%
Don't do this for us anymore.

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:04.630 align:middle line:90%
You already live in our hearts.

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:07.480 align:middle line:84%
She came to my sister the
same night in her dream.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:10.170 align:middle line:84%
My sister didn't talk
with her in that way.

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:12.880 align:middle line:84%
And at that, I told my sister
what had happened in my dream.

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:13.744 align:middle line:90%
She shared hers.

00:13:13.744 --> 00:13:15.910 align:middle line:84%
And my mother did not come
back again in dream time.

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:16.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: It tingles.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.215 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
happened is, we

00:13:18.215 --> 00:13:20.770 align:middle line:84%
can bind them here
during the death process

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:24.820 align:middle line:84%
by not wanting to let them
go, but we bind them afterward

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:28.207 align:middle line:84%
also if we're not careful about
it and just wish them well.

00:13:28.207 --> 00:13:29.665 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: I think
that's very true.

00:13:29.665 --> 00:13:32.380 align:middle line:84%
And you know, Raymond's research
with near-death experiences,

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:37.600 align:middle line:84%
and mediums who have spoken to
those after they have passed,

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:41.950 align:middle line:84%
and even my own experiences
now, really, there

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:44.890 align:middle line:84%
is a sense that the spirit
is so much happier and freer

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:47.050 align:middle line:90%
once it's out of the body.

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:49.425 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, it has things
to do on the other side.

00:13:49.425 --> 00:13:51.550 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't need to be having
us drag them back here

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:54.280 align:middle line:84%
all the time because
of our own emotions,

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.482 align:middle line:90%
emotional attachments.

00:13:56.482 --> 00:13:57.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: One thing
too that caught

00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:59.398 align:middle line:84%
my attention when
you were speaking

00:13:59.398 --> 00:14:02.490 align:middle line:84%
is that you said that she was
younger, in a younger form.

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And that is something
that Raymond's research

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:06.910 align:middle line:84%
and other people's
research-- that oftentimes,

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:10.000 align:middle line:84%
in near-death experiences when
we see our deceased friends

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.824 align:middle line:84%
and relatives, they're
in a younger form,

00:14:11.824 --> 00:14:13.990 align:middle line:84%
or they come back in our
dreams and they're younger.

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And I always find
that interesting.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.686 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and when
she came back in the dream,

00:14:17.686 --> 00:14:20.530 align:middle line:84%
she was that same age, had
a little green t-shirt on.

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:22.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: That's fascinating.

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:24.163 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The other
thing I've noticed too--

00:14:24.163 --> 00:14:28.240 align:middle line:84%
and this is not with the
dying, but it feeds into it.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And that is, the notion of
people with dementia who

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:35.020 align:middle line:84%
are no longer connected,
like someone who is in a coma

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.840 align:middle line:84%
or in their transition,
those with dementia who

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:41.080 align:middle line:84%
are no longer appearing
to be present in this time

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:46.090 align:middle line:84%
frame and their cognitive
skills are gone,

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:49.060 align:middle line:90%
they're still feeling us.

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:51.580 align:middle line:84%
We don't understand
how much that,

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:56.290 align:middle line:84%
what we embody in this field
the auric field around us

00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:58.870 align:middle line:84%
is what's really communicating
with other people

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:02.170 align:middle line:84%
and especially those
who are now nonverbal.

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:04.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: That's very powerful.

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:06.440 align:middle line:84%
Yes, right, I think
that's very true.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And another piece of that,
a lot of the work that I've

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:14.920 align:middle line:84%
done with the dying has to do
with metaphorical language.

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:17.680 align:middle line:84%
So I worked with this
woman in Pennsylvania

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.490 align:middle line:84%
who works with
people with dementia.

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And she had her staff start
tracking the metaphors

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:28.000 align:middle line:90%
that people were using.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And so many times,
people are picking up

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:33.540 align:middle line:84%
what you're saying
in the auric field.

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:35.870 align:middle line:84%
And they're using
metaphors to talk about it.

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:38.760 align:middle line:90%
So it's sort of doubly veiled.

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And that when her staff
started tracking--

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:44.280 align:middle line:84%
and they would actually put
it in the people's files

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:48.750 align:middle line:84%
or in a charts, what were the
stories and the metaphors that

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:51.570 align:middle line:90%
the residents were using--

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:54.420 align:middle line:84%
these connections
started to occur

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:56.250 align:middle line:84%
between the residents
and the staff,

00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:59.130 align:middle line:84%
but also with the families,
because suddenly, lights

00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:01.110 align:middle line:84%
started going on
about, oh, you mean

00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:03.210 align:middle line:84%
when she keeps talking
about the apple,

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:06.400 align:middle line:84%
she's really
referring to our son.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And so that what seemed
like crazy dementia--

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.840 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not saying, I
mean, obviously dementia,

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:15.270 align:middle line:84%
there are ways that there
are big disconnects.

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:18.270 align:middle line:84%
But there are also
ways of connecting.

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:19.800 align:middle line:90%
And metaphor is one of them.

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And just as with
the final words,

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:24.510 align:middle line:84%
we started tracking over time
with the metaphors were--

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:27.590 align:middle line:84%
we've found too
that, in some cases,

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:29.820 align:middle line:84%
this can also be true
with people of Alzheimer's

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:32.820 align:middle line:84%
dementia-- that if you track the
stories or the narratives that

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:35.460 align:middle line:84%
are going on, it's a way
to enter into their world.

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:38.850 align:middle line:84%
And there is more going on
than you might imagine, almost

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:41.040 align:middle line:90%
like the dream world.

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And also people with
autism sometimes

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.920 align:middle line:84%
will do this too,
will say things,

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.110 align:middle line:84%
and that they're picking
up on energetic things that

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:51.740 align:middle line:84%
are going on but using symbolic
ways to speak about them.

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:54.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
it occurred to me

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:57.030 align:middle line:84%
because I was thinking about
this particular situation

00:16:57.030 --> 00:17:01.050 align:middle line:84%
where there is no one really
present in terms of relating

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:03.090 align:middle line:90%
to on a conscious level.

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:05.970 align:middle line:90%
But she recognizes our auras.

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:07.980 align:middle line:84%
And she knows when
she feels safe.

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:10.290 align:middle line:84%
Because there was
some talk, does she

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:13.140 align:middle line:90%
go into a care facility now?

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, it's
my dad and my step mom.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:20.099 align:middle line:84%
And my dad's like, no, I
don't want her to be afraid.

00:17:20.099 --> 00:17:23.849 align:middle line:84%
Even if she doesn't know
me, he gets and understands.

00:17:23.849 --> 00:17:25.170 align:middle line:90%
She feels him.

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:26.319 align:middle line:90%
And she feels safe.

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:27.119 align:middle line:90%
And she feels me.

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:29.040 align:middle line:90%
And she feels safe.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:31.590 align:middle line:84%
What happens when you
think someone's not

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:34.140 align:middle line:84%
cognizant of their
surroundings and you just

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:35.920 align:middle line:90%
put them in a strange place?

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:38.936 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes, people die
quickly after that, right?

00:17:38.936 --> 00:17:40.935 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: Absolutely,
yes, that is true, and I--

00:17:40.935 --> 00:17:42.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I think
that's part of it.

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:44.190 align:middle line:90%
They don't feel safe anymore.

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:47.530 align:middle line:84%
They're missing the auric
fuel that's been feeding them

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:48.330 align:middle line:90%
the whole time.

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:49.810 align:middle line:90%


00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:52.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: We're living in a
very exciting and amazing time.

00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And our research in this
area is just accelerating.

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And I've been involved
in this for six years.

00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:58.844 align:middle line:90%
And I've seen it explode.

00:17:58.844 --> 00:18:01.260 align:middle line:84%
And when you're talking about
being responsive to people's

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.540 align:middle line:84%
energetic fields,
you can imagine

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:06.270 align:middle line:84%
what might be possible
in terms of how

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:09.510 align:middle line:84%
we create end of life
for people in tuning

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:11.970 align:middle line:90%
into these kinds of energies.

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And you know, on one hand, of
course losing someone we love

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:21.120 align:middle line:84%
or seeing someone go into
the process of dementia,

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.980 align:middle line:90%
those are painful things for us.

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And yet, if we can hold
them and imagine them

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:30.290 align:middle line:84%
in a way that has to do with
more energetically, and almost

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:32.790 align:middle line:84%
more ritualistically
and ceremonially,

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:36.870 align:middle line:84%
it offers us a chance to, A, not
be so afraid, but also really

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:39.630 align:middle line:84%
connect with the
sanctity of what's

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:42.537 align:middle line:84%
going on when it can sometimes
seem so awful, and scary,

00:18:42.537 --> 00:18:43.337 align:middle line:90%
and horrible.

00:18:43.337 --> 00:18:45.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Exactly, yeah,
and well, in her case,

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:47.121 align:middle line:84%
she's very socially
gracious, and charming,

00:18:47.121 --> 00:18:49.270 align:middle line:84%
or has been her whole
life-- cute as can be.

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:51.120 align:middle line:84%
And so for her, she
always had a way

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:54.700 align:middle line:84%
of kind of flirting with
people by winking at them.

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:55.629 align:middle line:90%
And so she winks.

00:18:55.629 --> 00:18:56.670 align:middle line:90%
You know, she'll see you.

00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:58.836 align:middle line:84%
And she doesn't know what
the conversation is about,

00:18:58.836 --> 00:18:59.820 align:middle line:90%
but she feels you.

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:00.720 align:middle line:90%
And she winks.

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.570 align:middle line:84%
If you wink back, you can
just feel this joy that's

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:06.390 align:middle line:90%
happening on this subtle level.

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:07.950 align:middle line:84%
But one of the
things you talk about

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:11.149 align:middle line:84%
is that the left hemisphere,
attached with logic, language,

00:19:11.149 --> 00:19:12.690 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, is
usually the one that

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:15.930 align:middle line:84%
starts shutting down
first in the final process

00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:19.200 align:middle line:84%
of transition, where the
right hemisphere still seems

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.747 align:middle line:90%
to be more engaged and alive.

00:19:21.747 --> 00:19:23.580 align:middle line:84%
And one of the examples
you used that I love

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:26.520 align:middle line:84%
is, one dying man
spoke of the beds--

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:29.006 align:middle line:84%
his bedside lamp being
attached to the sun.

00:19:29.006 --> 00:19:29.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: Oh, I know.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:29.960 align:middle line:90%
That was--

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:30.435 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He could see--

00:19:30.435 --> 00:19:30.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: --incredible.

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:31.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --it.

00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:35.650 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a way in
which, it's not make believe.

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:40.680 align:middle line:84%
It's artistic association--
and on that note,

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:44.910 align:middle line:84%
that poets and artists tend to
live in this zone consciously

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:46.440 align:middle line:90%
a lot of their lives.

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:48.536 align:middle line:90%
You talk about that in the book.

00:19:48.536 --> 00:19:50.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: Yeah, and I think
part of my attraction to this

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:53.340 align:middle line:90%
is I studied linguistics.

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:55.770 align:middle line:84%
I did a very traditional
academic study of language,

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:56.760 align:middle line:90%
but I'm also a poet.

00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:58.260 align:middle line:90%
And I love poetry.

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:01.210 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed with my father's
language, he said things,

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:03.060 align:middle line:90%
you know, my modality is broken.

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:06.500 align:middle line:84%
Or there is so
much so in sorrow.

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And the example you just
gave about the lamp post,

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:12.820 align:middle line:84%
and that person also said--
or the lamp at the bedside,

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:17.190 align:middle line:84%
he also said, worlds, worlds,
worlds, and more worlds,

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:19.050 align:middle line:90%
he said.

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:21.870 align:middle line:84%
So what's fascinating
to me about the words

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:24.330 align:middle line:84%
at the threshold and the
more I have studied it,

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:28.130 align:middle line:84%
it's almost a mythic
and poetic realm.

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:31.110 align:middle line:84%
And if you have an
ear for the poetry

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:34.410 align:middle line:84%
and you open your
heart to that poetry,

00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:36.240 align:middle line:84%
again, it's something
that can be much less

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.550 align:middle line:90%
frightening and more magical.

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And my hope with the
Final Words project

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:44.940 align:middle line:84%
is to-- it's actually an
invitation for everyone

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:48.946 align:middle line:84%
to become aware, and even maybe
write down the language they

00:20:48.946 --> 00:20:50.070 align:middle line:90%
hear from their loved ones.

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:51.861 align:middle line:84%
Because really, when
you freeze it in time,

00:20:51.861 --> 00:20:54.530 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes it's actually
very beautiful language.

00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:56.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, well
it makes sense.

00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:58.770 align:middle line:84%
If your left brain is
shut down, the right brain

00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:02.040 align:middle line:84%
is going to express
itself in its way, which

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:04.350 align:middle line:90%
can be symbolically, right?

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:07.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: And also, a lot of the
nonsense-- we talked about some

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:08.350 align:middle line:90%
of the nonsensical things.

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:11.350 align:middle line:84%
Especially as people
get closer to dying,

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:12.870 align:middle line:84%
there might be
nonsense syllables.

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And we know for
example, glossolalia,

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:17.460 align:middle line:84%
which is speaking in tongues
which many people describe

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:20.460 align:middle line:84%
as creating states
of ecstasy, that--

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:22.530 align:middle line:84%
they've done now
neuroscience research

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:24.990 align:middle line:84%
to show that, when people
are speaking in tongues,

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:27.240 align:middle line:90%
their right brain is activated.

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:30.540 align:middle line:10%
So it seems that the nonsense
that we may hear at end of life

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:33.090 align:middle line:10%
may actually be closely
aligned to those kinds

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:37.110 align:middle line:10%
of ecstatic or mystical states
that are associated with that,

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:39.240 align:middle line:10%
those regions in the brain.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.260 align:middle line:90%
So it's fascinating.

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:42.940 align:middle line:84%
Oh you know, a
koan, a zen koan--

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:44.940 align:middle line:84%
you know, what's the sound
of one hand clapping?

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:47.880 align:middle line:90%
That is nonsense technically.

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And yet that's the
kind of language

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:53.101 align:middle line:84%
that invites us to enter into
different states of being.

00:21:53.101 --> 00:21:55.475 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let me now
just go ahead and jump forward

00:21:55.475 --> 00:21:57.430 align:middle line:84%
to something I would
have brought up later.

00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:00.120 align:middle line:84%
But since you bring this
up, another phenomenon

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:03.260 align:middle line:84%
is people speaking in a
language that they don't know,

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:05.520 align:middle line:84%
but a real language,
but they didn't know it

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:08.190 align:middle line:84%
in this lifetime,
which is beginning

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:11.310 align:middle line:84%
to show an arc of time
beyond time, perhaps,

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:13.920 align:middle line:90%
other incarnations, perhaps.

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:15.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: Yes, and it's rare.

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:17.250 align:middle line:90%
It's rare, but it does occur.

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And just the fact that
it occurs is in itself--

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:23.940 align:middle line:90%
it catches your eye.

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:25.500 align:middle line:84%
I haven't found
enough cases, but I

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:28.140 align:middle line:84%
do know I've heard of of-- just
actually in the Final Words

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:30.520 align:middle line:84%
project, there
were three people.

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:34.410 align:middle line:84%
But it's something that,
you can't help but hear

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:36.715 align:middle line:84%
about something like that
and wonder, what it--

00:22:36.715 --> 00:22:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's in
there aura somewhere.

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:38.559 align:middle line:90%
It's coming from--

00:22:38.559 --> 00:22:38.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: It's in
there somewhere.

00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:39.942 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --somewhere.

00:22:39.942 --> 00:22:42.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: And also, we
haven't done research on words

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:45.990 align:middle line:84%
at the threshold except for
the Final Words project.

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:48.077 align:middle line:84%
So who knows what
data is out there

00:22:48.077 --> 00:22:49.160 align:middle line:90%
that we haven't collected?

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:50.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well who
knows, once this

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:52.320 align:middle line:84%
goes on for a few more
years-- it's still relatively.

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:54.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: Exactly,
it's very new.

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and so the
other thing that I think is

00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:00.217 align:middle line:84%
disturbing probably to the world
of science and medicine is that

00:23:00.217 --> 00:23:02.550 align:middle line:84%
the experiences don't appear
to have anything to do with

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:04.790 align:middle line:90%
the physical brain--

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:06.390 align:middle line:90%
which, to me, it's just a CPU.

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:08.880 align:middle line:90%
It's just a processing unit.

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:11.850 align:middle line:84%
Intelligence and data all
lives outside of the brain.

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:14.130 align:middle line:84%
In my view of it and
my understanding of it,

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:15.300 align:middle line:90%
it's more quantum.

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:16.779 align:middle line:84%
But this is perplexing
to the world

00:23:16.779 --> 00:23:18.570 align:middle line:84%
of science, which might
be why there hasn't

00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:20.350 align:middle line:90%
been more research, right?

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:21.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: Yes.

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And I think, however,
we're going to see,

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:25.980 align:middle line:84%
and just in the next five
years, more and more research

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:29.580 align:middle line:84%
in that direction, or in
this direction, and also

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:33.460 align:middle line:84%
more acceptance, because
there is just too many cases.

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:36.165 align:middle line:84%
And I would not have believed
it before I did this research,

00:23:36.165 --> 00:23:37.910 align:middle line:90%
but it's very clear to me.

00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:40.860 align:middle line:84%
You even look at the work that
Dr. Kenneth Ring and Sharon

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:42.750 align:middle line:84%
Cooper did with
the blind, people

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:44.670 align:middle line:90%
who were blind from birth.

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And when they had near-death
experiences, when they left

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.950 align:middle line:90%
their bodies, they had vision.

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:53.580 align:middle line:84%
So how can that go on if
we're talking about just

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:54.526 align:middle line:90%
being physical beings?

00:23:54.526 --> 00:23:56.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, uber
sight happens elsewhere.

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:57.702 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: Uber sight, exactly.

00:23:57.702 --> 00:24:01.226 align:middle line:90%


00:24:01.226 --> 00:24:03.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think another way
to engage the medical field

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:06.120 align:middle line:84%
is that doctors have
also been present

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:09.120 align:middle line:84%
when someone who
is passing over,

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:12.870 align:middle line:84%
or in near-death
experiences in particular,

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:15.750 align:middle line:84%
have known what the
doctor was going

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:18.550 align:middle line:84%
to say as a doctor
is still thinking it

00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:19.650 align:middle line:90%
and hasn't uttered it yet.

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:22.140 align:middle line:84%
So they're going into the
thought field with them, which

00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:23.790 align:middle line:90%
happens with the dying as well.

00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:25.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: Yeah, I
think that is true.

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:28.025 align:middle line:10%
And then you have someone
like Eben Alexander who

00:24:28.025 --> 00:24:32.200 align:middle line:10%
has come out with proof of
heaven, Tony Cicoria who

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:34.660 align:middle line:10%
was a orthopedic surgeon,
was struck by lightning,

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:37.660 align:middle line:10%
and came back with an
incredible musical gift.

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:41.830 align:middle line:84%
So Missouri Medicine
just did a whole book

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:43.810 align:middle line:90%
on physicians who have had--

00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:46.240 align:middle line:84%
themselves have had
near-death experiences

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.840 align:middle line:84%
and are sharing with
their colleagues

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.620 align:middle line:84%
that this is
something very real.

00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:53.710 align:middle line:84%
So again, it's a very exciting
time to be alive right now.

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:57.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, because we have
the various memes in culture

00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:01.580 align:middle line:84%
and the materialist end of
it through, for example,

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:05.050 align:middle line:84%
pharmaceutical advertising
and such is this great--

00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:08.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, really, we have been,
as a species, manipulated,

00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:12.790 align:middle line:84%
because we've been
encouraged to fear death.

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:14.530 align:middle line:84%
Look at the amount
of manipulation

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:17.680 align:middle line:84%
that happens to our psyche
because we fear no longer

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:18.516 align:middle line:90%
existing.

00:25:18.516 --> 00:25:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
think the work of you,

00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:23.800 align:middle line:84%
and Raymond Moody's, and
others is so important

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:26.380 align:middle line:90%
to help break the spell.

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:28.360 align:middle line:90%
So it's like, no, it's natural--

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:31.150 align:middle line:84%
and in the case of most of
the world's population--

00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:32.680 align:middle line:90%
and I'll be back again anyway.

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:34.460 align:middle line:84%
You know, there is a
time for everything.

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:35.260 align:middle line:90%
It's a wheel.

00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:36.080 align:middle line:90%
These are cycles.

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:39.760 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, to me, it's really
important that you're making it

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:44.110 align:middle line:84%
an understandable and also
a beautiful invitation,

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:45.190 align:middle line:90%
ultimately.

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:46.690 align:middle line:84%
So another thing
here is, you say

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:49.390 align:middle line:84%
in the book that telepathy
may be our original form

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:51.700 align:middle line:90%
of communication anyway.

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And I know others
who would argue that.

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:56.170 align:middle line:84%
And you gave an example
of Yukiko and her mother.

00:25:56.170 --> 00:26:01.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: Oh, yes, Carrie Rush
Willis, who is a chaplain,

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:03.100 align:middle line:90%
shared this story with me.

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:06.910 align:middle line:84%
Yukiko was someone that she
was, I guess, ministering with,

00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:08.080 align:middle line:90%
or being with.

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:12.550 align:middle line:84%
And she started talking about
her mother being in the room.

00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:15.970 align:middle line:84%
And Carrie was
with another woman

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:19.150 align:middle line:84%
who said, no, Yukiko, your
mother is in Japan, no, no, no,

00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:20.210 align:middle line:90%
no.

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:23.260 align:middle line:84%
And she said, yes, I've
been communicating with her.

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:26.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, then the friend went home
and called Yukiko's mother.

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:29.020 align:middle line:84%
And the mom said,
yes, I was having

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:30.850 align:middle line:90%
telepathic communication.

00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:33.054 align:middle line:90%
And they were able to verify.

00:26:33.054 --> 00:26:34.720 align:middle line:84%
They were talking
about the same things,

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:39.340 align:middle line:84%
about a sister in the
family, and so forth.

00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And again, we're finding out how
common those kinds of shared--

00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:46.330 align:middle line:84%
in a way that was a shared
death experience also,

00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:48.810 align:middle line:90%
because the daughter was dying.

00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:52.422 align:middle line:84%
And telepathy, we hear about
it near-death experiences.

00:26:52.422 --> 00:26:54.880 align:middle line:84%
I hear it from hospice nurses
all the time, where they know

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.130 align:middle line:90%
when a patient's going to die.

00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:58.380 align:middle line:84%
They hear the patient
saying, I'm ready now,

00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:01.410 align:middle line:84%
so then they can
tell the families.

00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:03.850 align:middle line:84%
It's just, the more
work I'm doing,

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:06.170 align:middle line:90%
the more I'm reading about it--

00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:07.332 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The more magical.

00:27:07.332 --> 00:27:08.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: --the more magical.

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And then the research from
Jeffrey Li and Jean Metzger

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:17.724 align:middle line:84%
looking at children and parents,
and seeing so much evidence

00:27:17.724 --> 00:27:20.140 align:middle line:84%
that, really, the way we're
communicating with our infants

00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:21.240 align:middle line:90%
is telepathically.

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:24.880 align:middle line:84%
When you think about it, we have
these little itty-bitty babies.

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:27.820 align:middle line:84%
And many times,
we're so connected

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:29.740 align:middle line:90%
with these little beings.

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And how so many of us make it
through childhood-- infancy

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:37.120 align:middle line:90%
is such a vulnerable time.

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:40.390 align:middle line:84%
And they did some
fascinating research

00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:43.870 align:middle line:84%
to show that there seems to
be clearly a telepathic bond

00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:44.671 align:middle line:90%
between parents.

00:27:44.671 --> 00:27:46.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, none of us who
have kids are going

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:47.680 align:middle line:90%
to be real surprised by that.

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:50.470 align:middle line:84%
But they suggest, it's
our first language.

00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:52.330 align:middle line:84%
Our first language,
is telepathy.

00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And then we develop the
traditional left-brain skills

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:57.180 align:middle line:90%
as we get older.

00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:59.880 align:middle line:84%
And then it seems at the end, we
go back to a more telepathic--

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:01.452 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, it makes sense.

00:28:01.452 --> 00:28:03.910 align:middle line:84%
The left brain shuts down as
you're going through the death

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:04.930 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:06.940 align:middle line:84%
And it only fires
up slowly when you

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:08.770 align:middle line:90%
re-enter this world at birth.

00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:11.380 align:middle line:90%


00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:13.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: It seems
like an arc to me.

00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:15.910 align:middle line:84%
You know, when
we're born, we have

00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:19.720 align:middle line:90%
the mechanics to speak up to--

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:21.790 align:middle line:90%
we could speak 800 phonemes.

00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:23.680 align:middle line:90%
We could respond to 800.

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:25.570 align:middle line:84%
But by the time--
within six months,

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:29.150 align:middle line:84%
that narrows to just the
phonemes of our language.

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:32.620 align:middle line:84%
So we come in with
this vast capacity.

00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And within six
months, it narrows.

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:39.160 align:middle line:84%
Our identity and who
we are is partially

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:41.090 align:middle line:84%
defined by the language
we're going to speak.

00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:44.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely,
and you think about that,

00:28:44.050 --> 00:28:48.430 align:middle line:84%
the beauty of that, to begin
exiting this body where you no

00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:51.520 align:middle line:84%
longer have a need to
function, so you don't need

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:53.380 align:middle line:84%
the functional
aspect of the brain,

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:57.610 align:middle line:84%
which is like to order yourself
so you don't run into things

00:28:57.610 --> 00:29:00.370 align:middle line:84%
and you get things done,
the left-brain side--

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:01.720 align:middle line:90%
and it has its role in science.

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:05.740 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is, almost every
genius in the world of science

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:09.596 align:middle line:84%
says that they had almost a
spiritual breakthrough, even

00:29:09.596 --> 00:29:10.720 align:middle line:90%
if they don't use the word.

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:12.820 align:middle line:84%
That the breakthrough
came in dream time,

00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:16.810 align:middle line:84%
or day dreaming is when their
great theory came to be.

00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:18.310 align:middle line:84%
So again, it's
always the right side

00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:21.160 align:middle line:90%
of the brain that's creating.

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:25.742 align:middle line:84%
So we don't need that
narrow aspect of the brain

00:29:25.742 --> 00:29:26.950 align:middle line:90%
when we're transitioning out.

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:28.540 align:middle line:84%
And we don't need
that narrow aspect

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:30.930 align:middle line:84%
when we're just
coming back into it.

00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:33.454 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: But I'm inclined to
think that it may have to do

00:29:33.454 --> 00:29:34.745 align:middle line:90%
that, when we first come into--

00:29:34.745 --> 00:29:35.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're not
shut down and narrowed--

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:35.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: They're not shut--

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:36.462 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --by the
left side of the--

00:29:36.462 --> 00:29:37.753 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: They're not narrowed.

00:29:37.753 --> 00:29:40.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --brain, the left
hemisphere, absolutely.

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:41.746 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's fascinating.

00:29:41.746 --> 00:29:43.120 align:middle line:84%
And also, you say
the same thing.

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:44.430 align:middle line:90%
You mentioned this earlier--

00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:48.090 align:middle line:84%
Asperger's, for example, a lot
of precognitive and telepathic

00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:52.260 align:middle line:84%
abilities because the
traditional language centers

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:53.700 align:middle line:90%
may not be as fully developed.

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:56.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: Right, it sounds
like those people are

00:29:56.910 --> 00:30:00.180 align:middle line:84%
more in the realm of
symbolic understanding

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:01.710 align:middle line:90%
as well as energetic.

00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:05.767 align:middle line:84%
And so the words
aren't always there.

00:30:05.767 --> 00:30:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And we know, with the
near-death experience,

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:08.975 align:middle line:84%
of course one of
the first things

00:30:08.975 --> 00:30:10.980 align:middle line:84%
that Raymond noted about
it in "Life After Life"

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:13.080 align:middle line:90%
is ineffability, ineffable.

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:15.120 align:middle line:84%
People cannot find
the words for it.

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:18.930 align:middle line:84%
So there's so much of who
we are as human beings that

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:23.340 align:middle line:90%
has no language attached to it.

00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And so what we see at
words at the threshold is

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:29.460 align:middle line:84%
this unraveling and also
this shifting of how language

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:33.840 align:middle line:84%
is used and expressed during
this time where people-- like

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:35.945 align:middle line:84%
when my father said,
this is so interesting,

00:30:35.945 --> 00:30:39.390 align:middle line:84%
or I've never done this
before, it just could be,

00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:42.620 align:middle line:84%
there was no other way
except "this" to explain it.

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:45.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or like with Jobs
and others, oh wow, oh wow,

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:46.810 align:middle line:84%
there is no framework
at all, just--

00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:48.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: Exactly, ah--

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:52.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wonder-- another thing
is time and space, because it

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:54.840 align:middle line:84%
tends to be circular
and all happening

00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:56.710 align:middle line:90%
at one time with people.

00:30:56.710 --> 00:31:00.290 align:middle line:84%
So again, as the structure of
the left hemisphere breaks down

00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:03.120 align:middle line:84%
and the creative realm
becomes full-blown,

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:05.970 align:middle line:84%
time and space doesn't exist
the same in the creative realm.

00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:08.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: Yes, and one of the
things that I've learned about

00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:11.550 align:middle line:84%
sort of left brain functioning,
it has to do is sequencing

00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:12.540 align:middle line:90%
and linear--

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:14.960 align:middle line:84%
being able to put
things in linear time.

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:21.060 align:middle line:84%
And so what goes on for
people outside of linear time,

00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:23.400 align:middle line:84%
of course, is this
has no time or space.

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:26.700 align:middle line:84%
You know, when people talk
about life reviews, many times

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:30.210 align:middle line:84%
it's instantaneous, kind
of instantaneous awareness,

00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:33.030 align:middle line:90%
or knowledge, or information.

00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:35.340 align:middle line:84%
And so part of what
we do is, we have

00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:36.990 align:middle line:90%
these stories that we live.

00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:39.210 align:middle line:90%
And we have these narratives.

00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:41.490 align:middle line:84%
And they are structured
in linear time.

00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:43.150 align:middle line:90%
That's what our lives are about.

00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:47.190 align:middle line:84%
But it seems that, as we end,
all that linear-ness just

00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:52.000 align:middle line:84%
disintegrates and opens
up to something else.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It just
seems to me that

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:59.370 align:middle line:84%
is a wonderful message
to us, that we don't have

00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:02.170 align:middle line:90%
to be living in those boxes.

00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:04.680 align:middle line:84%
Why wouldn't we be living
like that all the time?

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:05.670 align:middle line:90%
The language is there.

00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:09.390 align:middle line:84%
If you're not disintegrating,
the language is there.

00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:12.070 align:middle line:84%
The function of being able
to make a meeting on time

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:13.090 align:middle line:90%
is there.

00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:15.990 align:middle line:84%
But the thing that stops
us from actually living

00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:18.270 align:middle line:84%
in that creative
magical realm-- which

00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:22.080 align:middle line:84%
is where life is actually
happening, we start with

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:23.760 align:middle line:90%
and we return to.

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's a whole
other question

00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:29.250 align:middle line:84%
of allowing ourselves to be
programmed to such an extent

00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:31.560 align:middle line:84%
that we can't live those
beautiful moments while we're

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:33.120 align:middle line:90%
actually here.

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:33.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: I agree.

00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And I think that it's
about integrating.

00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:39.960 align:middle line:84%
It's all, for me, very much
about what this life is about,

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:42.630 align:middle line:90%
is integration.

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:44.140 align:middle line:84%
Because, of course
we need language.

00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:46.723 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't be sitting here with
you and connecting in this way

00:32:46.723 --> 00:32:50.500 align:middle line:84%
and connecting with other
people without language.

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:52.680 align:middle line:90%
However, there is this realm--

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:54.690 align:middle line:84%
and again, the realm
that I was able to enter

00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:56.520 align:middle line:84%
through doing the
research, I continue

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:58.650 align:middle line:84%
to enter through doing
the research, that I'm

00:32:58.650 --> 00:33:02.430 align:middle line:84%
so grateful for, because it
has expanded my own awareness,

00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:06.940 align:middle line:84%
and my own comfort, my
own joy, and my own life.

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And you know, my
mother is an artist.

00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:10.574 align:middle line:90%
And so I grew up with the arts.

00:33:10.574 --> 00:33:11.490 align:middle line:90%
And I'm very grateful.

00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And she was dyslexic,
so she was never very--

00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:15.690 align:middle line:84%
you know, she didn't
think of herself

00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:17.040 align:middle line:90%
as being good with language.

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:20.220 align:middle line:84%
But she lived in
another way, in terms

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:23.940 align:middle line:90%
of imagery and visual reality.

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:25.790 align:middle line:90%
And that is as valid.

00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:28.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, but
integration to me is--

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:31.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it is
absolutely undervalued

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:34.290 align:middle line:84%
in our modern
materialistic world.

00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:35.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: I agree.

00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:37.887 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And part of it is
because you can't control it.

00:33:37.887 --> 00:33:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, I'm even
thinking on a personal level.

00:33:39.970 --> 00:33:43.700 align:middle line:84%
I had a conversation recently
with a business associate.

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And they were trying to get me
to state, what is your plan.

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:48.750 align:middle line:90%
What is your master plan?

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:51.570 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I don't have one.

00:33:51.570 --> 00:33:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And she read an early
version of my book,

00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:56.160 align:middle line:90%
which is just about out.

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I didn't
think that was real.

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:00.000 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I read the book.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And it does seem like you
certainly go with the flow.

00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:04.470 align:middle line:84%
But she couldn't
understand how can you

00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:06.770 align:middle line:90%
get from A to B without a plan.

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:11.159 align:middle line:84%
And when you understand that
it's more listening instead

00:34:11.159 --> 00:34:12.750 align:middle line:84%
of demanding-- and
I know that there

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:17.310 align:middle line:84%
is a place for both, where you
do have to have an intention.

00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:20.580 align:middle line:84%
But in my mind and my
world, I'm listening

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:21.810 align:middle line:90%
to see where the energy is.

00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:24.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking to see where
my excitement is happening.

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:26.310 align:middle line:90%
And then I start following that.

00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And that becomes--
people think it's a goal.

00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:29.699 align:middle line:90%
It's not a goal.

00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:32.179 align:middle line:84%
It becomes a
creation, so to speak.

00:34:32.179 --> 00:34:34.870 align:middle line:84%
But it's very disconcerting
for other people

00:34:34.870 --> 00:34:37.000 align:middle line:90%
to know there is no plan.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.739 align:middle line:84%
You know, what can
you hook on to?

00:34:38.739 --> 00:34:40.900 align:middle line:84%
Instead of just having
faith-- you'll see.

00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:42.170 align:middle line:90%
Watch what happens.

00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:43.942 align:middle line:90%
It emerges.

00:34:43.942 --> 00:34:46.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: Isn't that a much
more magical way to live?

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:48.524 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I don't know any
other way to live, personally.

00:34:48.524 --> 00:34:50.571 align:middle line:84%
But it's very irritating
for everybody around me.

00:34:50.571 --> 00:34:52.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: No, but it's
true, because then you're

00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:54.650 align:middle line:90%
co-creating with whatever is.

00:34:54.650 --> 00:34:56.860 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I've
learned so much from doing

00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:58.861 align:middle line:90%
this research is listening.

00:34:58.861 --> 00:35:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'm working right
now with someone who

00:35:00.610 --> 00:35:01.990 align:middle line:90%
had a near-death experience.

00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:04.180 align:middle line:84%
He's the person
Kevin Braheny Fortune

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:05.710 align:middle line:90%
who did "Hearts of Space."

00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:08.840 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if you recall that
music that was pretty popular,

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:09.640 align:middle line:10%
I guess, in the--

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:10.750 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Not right off--

00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:12.612 align:middle line:10%
but I may remember
it if I heard it.

00:35:12.612 --> 00:35:15.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: Yeah, but sort of
the first techno music-- but he

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:17.500 align:middle line:84%
had a near-death experience
and heard this music

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:21.400 align:middle line:84%
from his near-death experience
and brought it back.

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:24.040 align:middle line:84%
And he was describing
to me this process

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:26.860 align:middle line:84%
that he calls deep
listening that came

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:29.080 align:middle line:90%
from his near-death experience.

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And this has also
happened for me

00:35:30.850 --> 00:35:33.430 align:middle line:84%
through doing "Words
at the Threshold."

00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And the near-death
experience also

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:40.090 align:middle line:84%
teaches those about
deep listening.

00:35:40.090 --> 00:35:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And I love the idea
of deep listening,

00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:48.710 align:middle line:84%
because it feels like it has
changed my life, because this

00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:49.510 align:middle line:90%
is what's going on.

00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:54.920 align:middle line:84%
When the dying speak to us,
we're used to-- this is a cup.

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:56.110 align:middle line:90%
And this is all this is.

00:35:56.110 --> 00:36:00.280 align:middle line:84%
But when the dying speak, a cup
may be a million other things.

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:02.170 align:middle line:90%
And we have to listen carefully.

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:04.630 align:middle line:84%
And you know, Regina, if you
were in meditation or prayer

00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:06.550 align:middle line:84%
and the cup showed
up for you, it's

00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:08.590 align:middle line:84%
going to be different
than the cup for me

00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:10.040 align:middle line:90%
and what it may mean.

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:13.541 align:middle line:84%
And for me, that's kind of
the magic of deep listening.

00:36:13.541 --> 00:36:15.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think
that, for me, it's

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:16.910 align:middle line:84%
one of the exciting
things about the book.

00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:18.730 align:middle line:84%
It's not just talking
about the dying.

00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:21.250 align:middle line:84%
It's actually opening
up a whole world,

00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:24.340 align:middle line:84%
as I mentioned just a little bit
ago, that we could be living in

00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:27.890 align:middle line:84%
while we're here during
our Earth years here too,

00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:30.640 align:middle line:84%
and access to that by
that deep listening,

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:33.210 align:middle line:84%
even deep listening
to higher self,

00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:37.370 align:middle line:84%
or whichever voices
we wish to hear.

00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:39.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: Yeah, I'm
so excited to hear

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:42.160 align:middle line:84%
you say that was one of the
things you got from the book,

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:45.070 align:middle line:84%
because it's something
that was a gift to me

00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:46.900 align:middle line:90%
from doing the research.

00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost as
if, in so many ways,

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.100 align:middle line:90%
the dying or teaching us.

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the
many lessons of the dying.

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And you know, after
my father passed on,

00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:58.570 align:middle line:90%
I woke up one morning.

00:36:58.570 --> 00:37:00.280 align:middle line:90%
And I heard him speaking to me.

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:01.660 align:middle line:90%
And I just wrote down.

00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:04.870 align:middle line:84%
He said, I want you to give
some love poems for your mother

00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:07.120 align:middle line:84%
because I know how
much she is grieving

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:08.980 align:middle line:90%
and how much she misses me.

00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:10.670 align:middle line:90%
And I just trusted it.

00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And over a period of a
year, these poems came out.

00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:16.191 align:middle line:84%
And it was very beautiful
and healing for me.

00:37:16.191 --> 00:37:18.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, someone could go,
oh, that wasn't your dad.

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:19.940 align:middle line:84%
That was just your
blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:21.900 align:middle line:84%
You know, that was
just your imagination.

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:25.330 align:middle line:84%
OK, but these beautiful
poems came from it.

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:26.920 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe it wasn't
my imagination.

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:28.100 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:30.610 align:middle line:84%
But there was this co-creation
with that voice that

00:37:30.610 --> 00:37:32.240 align:middle line:90%
was very rich and beautiful.

00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:35.540 align:middle line:84%
And I've lived my life
much more that way.

00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, I moved
to Georgia so I

00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:39.550 align:middle line:90%
could study with Raymond Moody.

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:41.849 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and it was
the best thing.

00:37:41.849 --> 00:37:43.765 align:middle line:84%
I would have never
imagined moving to Georgia.

00:37:43.765 --> 00:37:45.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely,
so all of this

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:49.490 align:middle line:84%
has shown you how to engage
with life not with death, even

00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:51.255 align:middle line:84%
though it's about
words at the threshold.

00:37:51.255 --> 00:37:51.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: Absolutely.

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:53.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I think
that's a huge takeaway

00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:54.610 align:middle line:90%
lesson here for all of us.

00:37:54.610 --> 00:37:55.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: Yes, absolutely.

00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:57.103 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The other
thing that happens

00:37:57.103 --> 00:37:59.110 align:middle line:84%
when people are making
their transition

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:03.240 align:middle line:84%
is, they go to areas of passion,
including your dad, right?

00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:06.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: Mhm, he went to
a couple areas of passion.

00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:08.320 align:middle line:84%
Not situations that
you have in mind,

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:10.410 align:middle line:84%
but I'll tell you the
ones that I recall.

00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:11.770 align:middle line:90%
He was a horse race.

00:38:11.770 --> 00:38:12.880 align:middle line:90%
He loved the horses.

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:14.918 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, with a cigar.

00:38:14.918 --> 00:38:19.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: And so he talked
a lot about the big gamble,

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:21.100 align:middle line:84%
and the gambling,
and all of that.

00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:22.630 align:middle line:90%
That had multiple meanings.

00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:24.580 align:middle line:90%
He talked about Marilyn Monroe.

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:28.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, wow, poster girl.

00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:30.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: And let's see,
what other passions--

00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:30.920 align:middle line:90%
tell me.

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:32.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: One of them was,
he was talking about he was

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:33.590 align:middle line:90%
attending an art exhibition.

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:36.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: Oh, well that was
a very meaningful passion,

00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:37.420 align:middle line:90%
indeed.

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And that is what began
the dying process.

00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:46.450 align:middle line:84%
My father one night-- it
was actually my birthday--

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:48.970 align:middle line:84%
just, my mother was
upstairs in their bedroom.

00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And he had fallen
asleep in his study.

00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And then he walked out the
front door in his underwear,

00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:57.950 align:middle line:84%
January night in California,
Berkeley, California,

00:38:57.950 --> 00:39:00.470 align:middle line:84%
walked down the
very busy street.

00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And when the police came
and said what are you--

00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:05.500 align:middle line:90%
what's going, sir?

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:07.510 align:middle line:84%
He said, I'm looking for
the big art exhibition.

00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:13.930 align:middle line:84%
I've got boxes here I've got
to take to my wife's art show.

00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And this, I came to find
out once I did the research,

00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:19.670 align:middle line:90%
this is very common.

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:22.390 align:middle line:84%
That oftentimes, as
death is approaching--

00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:25.000 align:middle line:84%
and we didn't know how
sick my father was.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.960 align:middle line:84%
But now it's some
kind of big event,

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:31.120 align:middle line:84%
and something that's very
close to their heart,

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:33.370 align:middle line:84%
or is their passion, as you
said, something very dear.

00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:36.880 align:middle line:84%
And for my father, 56
years of carrying the boxes

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:40.180 align:middle line:84%
to my mother's art exhibitions
was very dear to his heart,

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:41.540 align:middle line:90%
and very meaningful.

00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:43.760 align:middle line:84%
So for him, the big art
exhibition was coming.

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:45.760 align:middle line:84%
Well of course, the police
thought he was crazy,

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:47.430 align:middle line:90%
brought him to the hospital.

00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:49.690 align:middle line:90%
And my mother was contacted.

00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And it was from
there on, my father

00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:55.060 align:middle line:90%
moved in to the dying process.

00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:57.880 align:middle line:84%
And we brought him home, but
it began with that big art

00:39:57.880 --> 00:39:59.620 align:middle line:90%
exhibition, taking those boxes.

00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly
enough, boxes appear

00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:04.840 align:middle line:84%
a lot in the language
of the dying, which

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:07.420 align:middle line:84%
has multiple meanings, I
think, in terms of what

00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:10.850 align:middle line:90%
we carry with us, so yeah.

00:40:10.850 --> 00:40:14.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I
found that beautiful.

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:17.497 align:middle line:84%
Another one was Andrea was
speaking about her grandmother

00:40:17.497 --> 00:40:18.580 align:middle line:90%
going through the process.

00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:22.390 align:middle line:84%
And her grandmother asked her to
bring her best dress and shoes

00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:25.090 align:middle line:84%
to the hospital, put on
her makeup and jewelry

00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:26.470 align:middle line:90%
for the big dance.

00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:28.000 align:middle line:90%
She loved the big dance.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.490 align:middle line:90%
And she got her all dolled up.

00:40:30.490 --> 00:40:32.060 align:middle line:90%
And she died.

00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:33.400 align:middle line:90%
She was ready for the big dance.

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:37.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: And the big dance was
pretty common in final words.

00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:39.730 align:middle line:84%
Multiple people
besides Andrea just

00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:42.250 align:middle line:84%
describe that
their loved one was

00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:44.740 align:middle line:84%
getting ready for a
big event such as that.

00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:46.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And also, the
notion, like I brought up

00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:49.210 align:middle line:84%
about my mother, once
the big dance happens,

00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:52.360 align:middle line:84%
is this notion that,
like, this crowded

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:57.020 align:middle line:84%
feeling in the room, this crowd
of beings, or in my mom's case,

00:40:57.020 --> 00:41:01.300 align:middle line:84%
this semicircle of beings
who were just glowing,

00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:03.220 align:middle line:90%
that they are light beings.

00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:05.960 align:middle line:84%
Even people call them
angels, oftentimes.

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:08.350 align:middle line:84%
But that the room is filled
with all these other beings,

00:41:08.350 --> 00:41:09.280 align:middle line:90%
how often--

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:11.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't expect you
give an exact percentage--

00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:13.180 align:middle line:90%
but is that pretty common?

00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:14.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: It is very common.

00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And other researchers,
David Kessler

00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:20.140 align:middle line:84%
has written about this
quite exhaustively.

00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:23.060 align:middle line:90%
Christopher Kerr spoke about it.

00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And in Christopher
Kerr's research,

00:41:26.590 --> 00:41:31.300 align:middle line:84%
they said that 72%
of their sample--

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:33.430 align:middle line:90%
and I think it was 500 people--

00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:37.209 align:middle line:84%
had some kind of beings in the
room, deceased loved ones--

00:41:37.209 --> 00:41:38.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So we don't go alone.

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:39.666 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: We don't go alone.

00:41:39.666 --> 00:41:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And this is very much, I would
say were many of our samples--

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:47.860 align:middle line:84%
I want to say probably
mid-70%, same thing,

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:50.770 align:middle line:84%
having conversations with
deceased loved ones and family

00:41:50.770 --> 00:41:51.850 align:middle line:90%
members.

00:41:51.850 --> 00:41:54.770 align:middle line:84%
And rooms get crowded
before people pass on.

00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:57.120 align:middle line:84%
This is a very common
thing that I've heard

00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:59.260 align:middle line:84%
and I've seen in
the transcripts.

00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:01.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And also, how
about the people that

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:02.304 align:middle line:90%
are in the rooms with them?

00:42:02.304 --> 00:42:04.660 align:middle line:84%
Is it common for
them to experience

00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:06.200 align:middle line:90%
kind of a fullness in the room?

00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:07.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: That's
a great question.

00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:08.530 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how common it is.

00:42:08.530 --> 00:42:10.238 align:middle line:84%
I think people are
becoming more and more

00:42:10.238 --> 00:42:12.520 align:middle line:84%
comfortable with honoring
what they're feeling.

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:17.110 align:middle line:84%
So I think, I would maybe
say 20% of the time.

00:42:17.110 --> 00:42:19.619 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think we'll hear
more stats in the years ahead.

00:42:19.619 --> 00:42:22.035 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And as also people
dial in and get comfortable--

00:42:22.035 --> 00:42:22.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: Yes--

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:22.483 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --with talking--

00:42:22.483 --> 00:42:22.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: --as people--

00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:22.915 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --about it.

00:42:22.915 --> 00:42:24.373 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: --dial
in, I love the way

00:42:24.373 --> 00:42:25.780 align:middle line:90%
you say that-- yeah, dial in.

00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:27.446 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Another one
I loved, this is--

00:42:27.446 --> 00:42:29.830 align:middle line:90%
I loved some of these anecdotes.

00:42:29.830 --> 00:42:32.680 align:middle line:90%
And this one is, he told me--

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:33.520 align:middle line:90%
this is about Jack.

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:36.320 align:middle line:84%
He had been a
vaudeville musician.

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:38.320 align:middle line:84%
And he had told
the hospice worker,

00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:41.480 align:middle line:84%
you will see a great magic
trip today-- trick today.

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:42.280 align:middle line:90%
Come in.

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And he kept saying,
closer, closer, closer.

00:42:46.690 --> 00:42:48.680 align:middle line:90%
Now, watch me disappear.

00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:49.720 align:middle line:90%
And he died.

00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:50.577 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: Exactly.

00:42:50.577 --> 00:42:51.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:52.618 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: Isn't that amazing?

00:42:52.618 --> 00:42:55.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, a totally
masterful trick.

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:57.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: Yes, and using
the metaphor, the signature

00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:00.710 align:middle line:84%
metaphor, because he was
a vaudeville magician.

00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:02.461 align:middle line:84%
And of course, what
would be the language?

00:43:02.461 --> 00:43:03.918 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Make
something disappear.

00:43:03.918 --> 00:43:05.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: And make
something disappear.

00:43:05.550 --> 00:43:06.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:08.870 align:middle line:84%
Another one, numbers
come in a lot of times.

00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:10.729 align:middle line:84%
And someone waiting
for a game, and said,

00:43:10.729 --> 00:43:11.770 align:middle line:90%
yeah, they need a fourth.

00:43:11.770 --> 00:43:13.061 align:middle line:90%
I've got to go to my golf game.

00:43:13.061 --> 00:43:14.220 align:middle line:90%
They need a fourth.

00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:14.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: Yes.

00:43:14.650 --> 00:43:16.316 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And numbers
coming in, can you

00:43:16.316 --> 00:43:19.120 align:middle line:84%
talk a little bit about where
numbers play into the magic?

00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:21.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: Yeah, this
whole idea of completion,

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:24.310 align:middle line:84%
it showed up more than
I would have expected,

00:43:24.310 --> 00:43:28.520 align:middle line:90%
lots of golf going on.

00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And people will
say, we have three.

00:43:30.850 --> 00:43:34.000 align:middle line:84%
They have three, but they need
a fourth for their foursome.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.530 align:middle line:90%
So it might be a poker.

00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:38.150 align:middle line:84%
I saw it come up in
the poker example.

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:39.370 align:middle line:90%
So there is three guys.

00:43:39.370 --> 00:43:42.190 align:middle line:84%
They have three playing,
but they need a fourth.

00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:43.240 align:middle line:90%
And I'm that fourth.

00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:44.880 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to go join them.

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:46.544 align:middle line:84%
And in one case, a
person was saying,

00:43:46.544 --> 00:43:48.460 align:middle line:84%
there are three guys
playing poker over there.

00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:50.200 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I
want to join them.

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:52.499 align:middle line:84%
He was at first like,
I'm not too sure.

00:43:52.499 --> 00:43:54.040 align:middle line:84%
Oh, they're calling
me and telling me

00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:56.500 align:middle line:84%
they need me to come
in and play a hand.

00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And then finally--
and that's what

00:43:58.150 --> 00:44:00.520 align:middle line:84%
I was saying before about
these sustained narratives,

00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:02.860 align:middle line:90%
these stories that evolve.

00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:04.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What do you
think is going on there?

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:07.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know it's just
conjecture at this point

00:44:07.570 --> 00:44:09.430 align:middle line:84%
because you're not
there, but what

00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:11.020 align:middle line:84%
do you think is
going on by looking

00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:13.480 align:middle line:84%
at these stories of
this adding themselves

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:14.854 align:middle line:90%
to make a completeness?

00:44:14.854 --> 00:44:16.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: Yeah, that's
a great question.

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:18.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the
things with the Final

00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:21.610 align:middle line:84%
Words project, that I found this
whole thing about completion.

00:44:21.610 --> 00:44:24.010 align:middle line:84%
One person says something
like, the circles

00:44:24.010 --> 00:44:26.980 align:middle line:84%
are telling me it's time
to complete the cycle.

00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:30.080 align:middle line:84%
One man who was a boat
owner said to his wife,

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:31.690 align:middle line:90%
I've got two holes.

00:44:31.690 --> 00:44:33.880 align:middle line:90%
I need to make a whole.

00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:35.170 align:middle line:90%
I need to make a whole.

00:44:35.170 --> 00:44:36.670 align:middle line:84%
So it makes sense
that people are

00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:38.560 align:middle line:84%
beginning to think
about completion,

00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:40.600 align:middle line:90%
because that's what's going on.

00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:42.880 align:middle line:10%
And so this idea that
there is a threesome that

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:45.750 align:middle line:10%
needs a fourth to make
something complete,

00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:47.260 align:middle line:10%
and Jung talks about this.

00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:49.426 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's where
I was going to go next.

00:44:49.426 --> 00:44:51.310 align:middle line:90%


00:44:51.310 --> 00:44:53.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: It's a number
that's a archetype.

00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And so when I saw three
to four coming up pretty--

00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:01.510 align:middle line:84%
a lot in the transcripts,
it made sense

00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:05.720 align:middle line:84%
in the context of a
number of completion.

00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:06.830 align:middle line:90%
But it surprised me.

00:45:06.830 --> 00:45:08.590 align:middle line:84%
It's something that came
up that really surprised

00:45:08.590 --> 00:45:10.089 align:middle line:84%
me, this whole idea
of the foursome,

00:45:10.089 --> 00:45:14.320 align:middle line:84%
and that people were
joining as the fourth one.

00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:17.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And Jung also said
that threes usually mean

00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:20.620 align:middle line:90%
transformation of some kind.

00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:22.948 align:middle line:84%
And then the four
is the completion.

00:45:22.948 --> 00:45:25.506 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: Yeah, the
completing, yes, and one

00:45:25.506 --> 00:45:27.130 align:middle line:84%
of the people in this
study, I remember

00:45:27.130 --> 00:45:30.530 align:middle line:84%
he talked about seeing a
number eight in the corner.

00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:32.920 align:middle line:84%
And it also makes
sense just intuitively

00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:35.740 align:middle line:84%
that threes and eights
would show up just

00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:39.190 align:middle line:84%
in terms of transformation,
and kind of the affinity side,

00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:41.980 align:middle line:84%
just intuitively, I thought,
oh, that's interesting

00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:45.370 align:middle line:84%
that people are seeing
different landscapes.

00:45:45.370 --> 00:45:50.170 align:middle line:84%
So from one example, a father
described to his daughters

00:45:50.170 --> 00:45:52.157 align:middle line:84%
about how there
were three doors.

00:45:52.157 --> 00:45:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And he was having a
hard time deciding

00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:56.710 align:middle line:90%
which one to go through.

00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:59.650 align:middle line:84%
So the daughters said, well
just try each one, dad.

00:45:59.650 --> 00:46:01.075 align:middle line:90%
You know, so he opened one.

00:46:01.075 --> 00:46:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And he talked about this
big landscape that he saw.

00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:07.240 align:middle line:90%
And another one had more trees.

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:09.190 align:middle line:90%
And this is pretty common.

00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:11.620 align:middle line:84%
My father talked about
the green dimension.

00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:14.230 align:middle line:84%
He said, oh, there
is a green dimension.

00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:16.300 align:middle line:90%
There is a green dimension.

00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes people will say
just little bits of things.

00:46:19.090 --> 00:46:22.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're not going to
give you large explanations,

00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:24.679 align:middle line:84%
but those are the times
to maybe ask questions.

00:46:24.679 --> 00:46:27.220 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes, you feel like, oh
my god, dad's not making sense.

00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:28.810 align:middle line:84%
What's he saying,
green dimension?

00:46:28.810 --> 00:46:30.130 align:middle line:90%
That makes no sense--

00:46:30.130 --> 00:46:32.770 align:middle line:84%
but instead going oh,
a green dimension.

00:46:32.770 --> 00:46:35.244 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that makes
perfect sense, just engage--

00:46:35.244 --> 00:46:36.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: Just engage.

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:37.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --and learn something.

00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:39.443 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be having
a glimpse into something

00:46:39.443 --> 00:46:42.010 align:middle line:84%
that we don't normally get
a glimpse into day to day.

00:46:42.010 --> 00:46:44.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: And you know,
when I look back now,

00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:46.180 align:middle line:84%
I was so afraid when
my father was dying.

00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:47.470 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I had the pad in here.

00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to
do it this way.

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:52.000 align:middle line:84%
That's one way I handled my
fear, I think, and my grief.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.370 align:middle line:84%
But now, looking back, if
I could go back in time,

00:46:55.370 --> 00:46:58.780 align:middle line:84%
I would have said, daddy, tell
me about that green dimension.

00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:00.610 align:middle line:84%
At the time, I was
like, oh my goodness,

00:47:00.610 --> 00:47:01.470 align:middle line:90%
what is he talking about?

00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:02.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He's losing his mind.

00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:03.671 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: He's losing his mind.

00:47:03.671 --> 00:47:05.630 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
what to say to him.

00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:06.430 align:middle line:90%
And i.

00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:09.940 align:middle line:84%
Think one of the things is, you
know, almost the less we say

00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:14.240 align:middle line:84%
and the more we ask is
probably the best we can do.

00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:17.607 align:middle line:84%
Because one, we don't
want to impose our reality

00:47:17.607 --> 00:47:19.690 align:middle line:84%
upon the person who is
transitioning, because they

00:47:19.690 --> 00:47:24.780 align:middle line:84%
probably have a lot more to
teach us than for us to tell us

00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:27.856 align:middle line:90%
what to do or how to do things.

00:47:27.856 --> 00:47:29.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
is really too,

00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:32.260 align:middle line:84%
when they start talking about
green dimensions and such, this

00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:35.560 align:middle line:84%
really, again, as a
word to the living,

00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:39.880 align:middle line:84%
is where dreams
crossover, where often, we

00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:43.390 align:middle line:84%
don't have a problem
dealing with the fact

00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:46.180 align:middle line:84%
that we can live in kind of
alternate realities and dream

00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:49.690 align:middle line:84%
time, but we think that someone
who's passing into those states

00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:54.130 align:middle line:84%
is uttering gibberish when
they try to describe the very

00:47:54.130 --> 00:47:56.080 align:middle line:84%
same things we
dream about, which

00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:59.050 align:middle line:84%
are worlds that are altered,
worlds that look different,

00:47:59.050 --> 00:48:02.667 align:middle line:84%
with more trees, less trees,
fewer trees, bigger, smaller.

00:48:02.667 --> 00:48:05.000 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like a lot of people
are going to those places

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.270 align:middle line:90%
we dream into anyway.

00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:11.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: Yes, and very well
developed, you know, people--

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:14.740 align:middle line:84%
and again, these narratives,
someone sees a boxing champion.

00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:17.530 align:middle line:84%
He describes a boxing
champion walks into the room.

00:48:17.530 --> 00:48:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And then three days later,
oh, now the boxing champion

00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:21.790 align:middle line:90%
has got his son with him.

00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:23.590 align:middle line:84%
And you know,
they're at a parade.

00:48:23.590 --> 00:48:25.697 align:middle line:84%
And this is going on
over several days.

00:48:25.697 --> 00:48:27.280 align:middle line:84%
And again, if we
didn't write it down,

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:29.650 align:middle line:84%
we may not have
really understood.

00:48:29.650 --> 00:48:32.020 align:middle line:84%
These little snippets
become a story.

00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:33.550 align:middle line:90%
And they're vivid.

00:48:33.550 --> 00:48:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And in the research that
I've read about dreams says

00:48:36.010 --> 00:48:41.064 align:middle line:84%
our minds are very active
when we're dreaming.

00:48:41.064 --> 00:48:42.730 align:middle line:84%
So this whole thing
about consciousness,

00:48:42.730 --> 00:48:46.150 align:middle line:84%
how could it be, when
technically we're dying,

00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:47.980 align:middle line:84%
our brains are not
supposed to be active,

00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:50.980 align:middle line:84%
and yet this very rich
kind of dream state

00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:53.920 align:middle line:90%
is going on in these final days?

00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:58.790 align:middle line:84%
People are hallucinating or
having these visions of things.

00:48:58.790 --> 00:49:02.680 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it really convinced
me that consciousness--

00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:04.810 align:middle line:84%
that we are more
transmitters or receivers

00:49:04.810 --> 00:49:06.970 align:middle line:84%
and that there is
consciousness around us.

00:49:06.970 --> 00:49:09.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely,
another thing is vehicles.

00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:13.450 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times people use
vehicles to get from this realm

00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:14.320 align:middle line:90%
to another realm.

00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:16.640 align:middle line:84%
Like, oh here's
the bus, got to go.

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:19.880 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about some of
those-- trains, buses, planes,

00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:20.890 align:middle line:90%
automobiles?

00:49:20.890 --> 00:49:23.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: All of those,
and the bus stop--

00:49:23.150 --> 00:49:24.150 align:middle line:90%
take me to the bus stop.

00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:27.070 align:middle line:84%
One case was some, take
me to the bus stop.

00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:31.280 align:middle line:84%
But every vehicle you
mentioned shows up,

00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:32.840 align:middle line:90%
and sometimes more specifically.

00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:37.204 align:middle line:84%
One guy said, Jetta,
Jetta, I need my Jetta.

00:49:37.204 --> 00:49:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And the wife was like,
what is he talking about?

00:49:40.070 --> 00:49:41.210 align:middle line:90%
What's he talking about?

00:49:41.210 --> 00:49:42.600 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't figure it out.

00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And then finally,
they put it together.

00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:45.085 align:middle line:90%
It's, that's the car he drove.

00:49:45.085 --> 00:49:45.428 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: His car, Yeah.

00:49:45.428 --> 00:49:47.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: And he loved his car.

00:49:47.210 --> 00:49:48.500 align:middle line:90%
That's the vehicle.

00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And so the nurse said to him,
OK, honey, you know what?

00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:55.730 align:middle line:84%
We're going to gas it up and get
it all ready for your big trip.

00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And that was a nurse who was
able to step into his world,

00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:01.370 align:middle line:84%
and validate, and
maybe open things up

00:50:01.370 --> 00:50:05.780 align:middle line:84%
so he could transition
more smoothly and easily.

00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things that I noticed

00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:10.910 align:middle line:84%
is that, oftentimes,
they're vehicles

00:50:10.910 --> 00:50:12.362 align:middle line:90%
that are not our own agency.

00:50:12.362 --> 00:50:13.820 align:middle line:84%
So what I mean is,
they're outside.

00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:15.540 align:middle line:90%
They're buses, trains.

00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And up until two weeks ago, I
had not heard one person say,

00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:22.902 align:middle line:84%
I'm putting on my own shoes and
I'm going to walk somewhere.

00:50:22.902 --> 00:50:23.985 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:50:23.985 --> 00:50:25.734 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: Right, it
was an outside agency.

00:50:25.734 --> 00:50:29.450 align:middle line:84%
But just a couple weeks
ago, I got some transcripts.

00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:33.306 align:middle line:84%
And the mother said, I
want to walk with Jesus.

00:50:33.306 --> 00:50:35.180 align:middle line:84%
And then also, that's
kind of a phrase that's

00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:38.150 align:middle line:84%
right-- but still, I'm
going to go walk with Jesus.

00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:40.380 align:middle line:84%
That's the first time I
had heard more agency.

00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:43.010 align:middle line:84%
But also, with that phrase,
she was using a phrase

00:50:43.010 --> 00:50:46.230 align:middle line:84%
that she had probably heard
all her years with church.

00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:49.220 align:middle line:84%
But generally, it's
an outside vehicle

00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:50.840 align:middle line:90%
that takes them somewhere.

00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:51.890 align:middle line:90%
And they're waiting.

00:50:51.890 --> 00:50:53.300 align:middle line:90%
Their bags are packed.

00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:54.950 align:middle line:90%
And they're getting ready to go.

00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:57.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and while
they're getting ready to go,

00:50:57.650 --> 00:50:59.444 align:middle line:84%
and getting excited
at possibilities,

00:50:59.444 --> 00:51:01.610 align:middle line:84%
and uttering things, sometimes
it can take them back

00:51:01.610 --> 00:51:02.660 align:middle line:90%
into the past.

00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:06.510 align:middle line:84%
It can take people back into
old loves and things like this.

00:51:06.510 --> 00:51:08.090 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens
is that people

00:51:08.090 --> 00:51:10.940 align:middle line:84%
that are their current
loved ones in their life

00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:15.470 align:middle line:84%
can even feel hurt by the
detachment that the person

00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:16.610 align:middle line:90%
no longer--

00:51:16.610 --> 00:51:19.900 align:middle line:84%
they don't seem relevant
to the person anymore.

00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:22.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: That's a very
wonderful and beautiful point

00:51:22.590 --> 00:51:23.390 align:middle line:90%
you made.

00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:27.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think, especially
with, well, with all of it,

00:51:27.890 --> 00:51:30.590 align:middle line:84%
but you know, when it's
our moms and dads or--

00:51:30.590 --> 00:51:32.510 align:middle line:84%
no, it's between
husbands and wives also.

00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:37.890 align:middle line:84%
We have this, in this point and
time, we are their special one.

00:51:37.890 --> 00:51:43.470 align:middle line:84%
But the people we love have
spanned a whole lifetime.

00:51:43.470 --> 00:51:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And we get this sense
often at threshold

00:51:45.690 --> 00:51:48.071 align:middle line:84%
they've spanned
multiple lifetimes.

00:51:48.071 --> 00:51:49.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
they may be remembering

00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:51.950 align:middle line:84%
is a lovely moment
from when they

00:51:51.950 --> 00:51:53.970 align:middle line:90%
loved someone other than you.

00:51:53.970 --> 00:51:54.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: Yes.

00:51:54.770 --> 00:51:57.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they
say these things.

00:51:57.020 --> 00:51:59.230 align:middle line:84%
I read one book and
interviewed one woman who

00:51:59.230 --> 00:52:00.980 align:middle line:84%
went through this
process with her husband

00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:02.330 align:middle line:90%
and the dementia prior.

00:52:02.330 --> 00:52:06.410 align:middle line:84%
And it was very difficult for
her on an emotional level.

00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:08.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: It really,
it is difficult.

00:52:08.690 --> 00:52:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is part more
the teachings of dementia

00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:16.350 align:middle line:90%
and the end of life.

00:52:16.350 --> 00:52:17.790 align:middle line:90%
And that's a very good point.

00:52:17.790 --> 00:52:20.140 align:middle line:84%
I have heard other
stories like that.

00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:22.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so it's just,
we need to watch, this is--

00:52:22.580 --> 00:52:25.375 align:middle line:90%
and be respectful of the fact.

00:52:25.375 --> 00:52:27.500 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't there with them
the moment they were born.

00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:28.300 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't there.

00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:29.110 align:middle line:90%
Or maybe you were.

00:52:29.110 --> 00:52:31.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, but they've had
their own experiences.

00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And other lifetimes could
even be bleeding in--

00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:40.460 align:middle line:84%
and not to put our own neediness
ahead of their experience

00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:42.110 align:middle line:84%
and not take it
personally, because it

00:52:42.110 --> 00:52:45.510 align:middle line:84%
doesn't diminish what
you've had with that person.

00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:47.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: Yeah, I think
that's absolutely the truth--

00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:49.800 align:middle line:84%
and to make sure we're
getting support too,

00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:52.310 align:middle line:90%
because grief is devastating.

00:52:52.310 --> 00:52:56.600 align:middle line:84%
And double losses-- and we've
heard stories talking about

00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:58.079 align:middle line:90%
people finding about other--

00:52:58.079 --> 00:52:59.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Other families.

00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:01.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: --other
families, or other loves.

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.564 align:middle line:84%
So we definitely want to be
there for those who are dying.

00:53:04.564 --> 00:53:06.980 align:middle line:84%
And we also want to make sure
we get support for ourselves

00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:07.780 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:10.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely, and
also, this is kind of fun.

00:53:10.370 --> 00:53:13.070 align:middle line:84%
This area is about
how different cultures

00:53:13.070 --> 00:53:15.860 align:middle line:84%
have their own metaphors
for dying born out

00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:17.720 align:middle line:90%
of their own culture.

00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:21.480 align:middle line:84%
With Africans, they're going to
go to the goat fields, right?

00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:25.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: Right, and some,
it's kicking off their clogs.

00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:27.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Kicking off eternal--

00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:29.849 align:middle line:84%
the Germans go to the
eternal hunting grounds,

00:53:29.849 --> 00:53:31.640 align:middle line:84%
which of course hunting
has been a big part

00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:35.870 align:middle line:84%
of the culture for hundreds,
if not thousands of years.

00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:39.610 align:middle line:84%
Irish are going on
the path to truth.

00:53:39.610 --> 00:53:42.350 align:middle line:10%
And that's very druidic.

00:53:42.350 --> 00:53:48.410 align:middle line:10%
That puts all that beautiful
druidic spiritual knowledge

00:53:48.410 --> 00:53:50.390 align:middle line:10%
at the forefront
of their return.

00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:53.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: Yes, that's lovely.

00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:55.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the Portuguese
call it going upstairs.

00:53:55.940 --> 00:53:58.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: Yup,
which makes sense.

00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:00.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're
going upstairs now.

00:54:00.090 --> 00:54:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And this one was
interesting, the Dutch,

00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:03.830 align:middle line:90%
going out of the pipe.

00:54:03.830 --> 00:54:05.030 align:middle line:90%
What's that mean?

00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:07.424 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: I'm not too sure,
but somehow, it feels right.

00:54:07.424 --> 00:54:08.840 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
the tunnel image,

00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:10.495 align:middle line:90%
was the one that I had gotten.

00:54:10.495 --> 00:54:12.140 align:middle line:84%
You know, that was
my sense of it.

00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:14.877 align:middle line:90%


00:54:14.877 --> 00:54:16.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Interesting,
this is the one

00:54:16.460 --> 00:54:19.160 align:middle line:84%
that I found the
most interesting.

00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:22.370 align:middle line:84%
Death row inmates
on lethal injections

00:54:22.370 --> 00:54:26.030 align:middle line:84%
tend to have
positive final words.

00:54:26.030 --> 00:54:30.770 align:middle line:84%
It's as though the mountain,
that mountain at the top

00:54:30.770 --> 00:54:33.920 align:middle line:84%
is better than what they've
been experiencing on this Earth.

00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:35.465 align:middle line:90%
And it's truly a relief.

00:54:35.465 --> 00:54:36.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: Yeah, I think so.

00:54:36.590 --> 00:54:38.465 align:middle line:84%
I think that's why we're
hearing those words.

00:54:38.465 --> 00:54:41.350 align:middle line:90%
And I also think--

00:54:41.350 --> 00:54:43.040 align:middle line:84%
and I mentioned
this in the book--

00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:45.610 align:middle line:84%
that there is something
about looking back.

00:54:45.610 --> 00:54:47.210 align:middle line:90%
We may go on a trip.

00:54:47.210 --> 00:54:48.320 align:middle line:90%
And it may be terrible.

00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:50.300 align:middle line:84%
You know, there might
be bugs at the hotel.

00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:51.690 align:middle line:90%
And our car may break down.

00:54:51.690 --> 00:54:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And our Aunt was a
drunk when we saw her.

00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:56.900 align:middle line:84%
But looking back,
we're able to see

00:54:56.900 --> 00:54:58.460 align:middle line:90%
the things that were jewels.

00:54:58.460 --> 00:55:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And the whole thing
about before we die,

00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:02.670 align:middle line:90%
it's an intensified period.

00:55:02.670 --> 00:55:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And we see, really, so often,
we see what was precious

00:55:06.380 --> 00:55:09.560 align:middle line:90%
rather than what was painful.

00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:13.550 align:middle line:84%
And even with the death row
inmates, with this research,

00:55:13.550 --> 00:55:17.147 align:middle line:90%
they saw what was beautiful.

00:55:17.147 --> 00:55:18.230 align:middle line:90%
Or their words, I should--

00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:19.970 align:middle line:84%
that's probably
an overstatement.

00:55:19.970 --> 00:55:23.270 align:middle line:84%
But their language slanted more
towards positive descriptions

00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:26.750 align:middle line:84%
of their lives and the
people in their lives.

00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:28.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
in your book--

00:55:28.770 --> 00:55:30.560 align:middle line:90%
I didn't read this.

00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:33.350 align:middle line:84%
There must be some
instances, I don't know,

00:55:33.350 --> 00:55:35.390 align:middle line:84%
where someone is
passing over and they

00:55:35.390 --> 00:55:36.890 align:middle line:90%
have mean or spiteful words.

00:55:36.890 --> 00:55:38.840 align:middle line:90%
Does that ever happen?

00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:39.825 align:middle line:90%
Or is it almost never?

00:55:39.825 --> 00:55:42.281 align:middle line:90%


00:55:42.281 --> 00:55:44.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: Right before
the threshold, it's very,

00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:44.990 align:middle line:90%
very rare--

00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:46.310 align:middle line:90%
maybe a couple of weeks before.

00:55:46.310 --> 00:55:49.622 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, of course,
kind of settling up with things.

00:55:49.622 --> 00:55:51.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: Absolutely,
settling up--

00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:53.540 align:middle line:84%
or one woman, when she was
dying and her family was

00:55:53.540 --> 00:55:56.030 align:middle line:84%
really loud in the other
room said, will you

00:55:56.030 --> 00:55:57.050 align:middle line:90%
please quiet down?

00:55:57.050 --> 00:55:59.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm f-ing trying to die in here.

00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And she apparently was
a character anyway.

00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:06.380 align:middle line:84%
But as we get closer,
really the words

00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:10.620 align:middle line:84%
are generally ones of
reconciliation, and love--

00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:11.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Beauty.

00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:11.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: --and beauty.

00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:12.980 align:middle line:90%
It's very rare.

00:56:12.980 --> 00:56:17.190 align:middle line:84%
But a few weeks before, and even
maybe 10 days, 7 days, yeah.

00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:20.060 align:middle line:84%
When people are uncomfortable--
and there are a smaller

00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:24.080 align:middle line:84%
percentage, but there are people
more often who are afraid.

00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:26.450 align:middle line:84%
And so you might hear
more words like, help me.

00:56:26.450 --> 00:56:28.547 align:middle line:90%
I'm scared.

00:56:28.547 --> 00:56:29.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Afraid of the unknown.

00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:33.277 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: Of the unknown-- but
spitefulness really disappears.

00:56:33.277 --> 00:56:34.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's a--

00:56:34.110 --> 00:56:34.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: Generally.

00:56:34.310 --> 00:56:35.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --wonderful thing.

00:56:35.030 --> 00:56:36.230 align:middle line:90%
That's good education--

00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:36.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: Yeah, generally,

00:56:36.740 --> 00:56:37.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --for all of us.

00:56:37.210 --> 00:56:38.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: --that's true.

00:56:38.210 --> 00:56:39.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
now you have-- we

00:56:39.710 --> 00:56:42.360 align:middle line:84%
just have a few minutes left
here, some basic guidelines

00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:43.160 align:middle line:90%
that are helpful.

00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And you say-- and all of
which we talked about.

00:56:46.270 --> 00:56:48.380 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like little
bullet recaps, which is,

00:56:48.380 --> 00:56:53.100 align:middle line:84%
enter the world of the person
that's dying, that you love.

00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:54.110 align:middle line:90%
Enter their world.

00:56:54.110 --> 00:56:54.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: Enter their world.

00:56:54.980 --> 00:56:56.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Don't try to
bring them back to yours--

00:56:56.720 --> 00:56:57.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: Exactly.

00:56:57.440 --> 00:56:58.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --which we're
always trying to do.

00:56:58.730 --> 00:57:00.039 align:middle line:90%
No, dad, that's not happening.

00:57:00.039 --> 00:57:01.330 align:middle line:90%
You're in a hospital right now.

00:57:01.330 --> 00:57:02.750 align:middle line:90%
No, that's not happening.

00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:04.190 align:middle line:90%
Don't do that.

00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:05.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: Enter their world.

00:57:05.450 --> 00:57:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And you'll be surprised, or
many will be surprised by how--

00:57:09.710 --> 00:57:11.300 align:middle line:90%
what they discover.

00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:16.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The next one is
to have eyes for the sacred.

00:57:16.010 --> 00:57:18.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: When you walk into
a hospital room or a room

00:57:18.350 --> 00:57:21.490 align:middle line:84%
with someone who is dying, it
seems, for many of us, awful.

00:57:21.490 --> 00:57:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's hard to believe that
something sacred is going on.

00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:29.080 align:middle line:84%
Step into the room
as if it is sacred,

00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:30.500 align:middle line:90%
or knowing that it's sacred.

00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:35.142 align:middle line:84%
And then that allows all kinds
of possibilities to occur.

00:57:35.142 --> 00:57:37.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Next, validate
your loved one's words

00:57:37.100 --> 00:57:37.850 align:middle line:90%
and experiences.

00:57:37.850 --> 00:57:39.335 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: Yes, similar to
what we were saying before.

00:57:39.335 --> 00:57:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, be beautiful.

00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:41.686 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: Yes, you're right.

00:57:41.686 --> 00:57:43.490 align:middle line:90%
Oh a train, the train's coming.

00:57:43.490 --> 00:57:44.870 align:middle line:90%
You lost your passport?

00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:46.110 align:middle line:90%
We'll find it for you.

00:57:46.110 --> 00:57:49.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and then ask
questions with authenticity

00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:53.720 align:middle line:84%
and open curiosity,
really be engaged

00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:55.460 align:middle line:90%
in an authentic way with them.

00:57:55.460 --> 00:57:58.190 align:middle line:84%
What does that green
dimension look like?

00:57:58.190 --> 00:58:00.440 align:middle line:84%
Is there anyone there-- you
know, that kind of thing,

00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:01.240 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:02.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SMARTT: Exactly.

00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:06.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Another thing
is to take responsibility

00:58:06.020 --> 00:58:08.990 align:middle line:84%
for the words that are
being uttered in the room.

00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:11.120 align:middle line:84%
Don't let doctors
and other people

00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:13.370 align:middle line:84%
use words like, oh,
they lost the battle.

00:58:13.370 --> 00:58:15.650 align:middle line:90%
They're losing the battle.

00:58:15.650 --> 00:58:17.690 align:middle line:84%
They'll be dead by
tomorrow morning.

00:58:17.690 --> 00:58:20.930 align:middle line:84%
Don't let that kind of
language happen in the room,

00:58:20.930 --> 00:58:22.410 align:middle line:90%
just stop that.

00:58:22.410 --> 00:58:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And so I guess my
final comment on it

00:58:24.980 --> 00:58:27.760 align:middle line:90%
is that, what it left me with--

00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:32.120 align:middle line:84%
and I think kind of like Moody's
film all those years ago,

00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:36.530 align:middle line:84%
is that the final
gift of life is dying,

00:58:36.530 --> 00:58:39.907 align:middle line:84%
the process of letting
go of life itself.

00:58:39.907 --> 00:58:41.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SMARTT: Yes, and what a
way to walk through life

00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:45.530 align:middle line:84%
and to walk through your
death or those you love.

00:58:45.530 --> 00:58:50.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is such a more
sacred and comfortable way

00:58:50.510 --> 00:58:51.890 align:middle line:90%
to move through life, I think.

00:58:51.890 --> 00:58:53.431 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let it
be a celebration.

00:58:53.431 --> 00:58:54.884 align:middle line:84%

00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:04.070 align:middle line:10%
and helping people walk through

00:59:04.070 --> 00:59:06.800 align:middle line:10%
and the lives of others, so
thank you for your good work.
