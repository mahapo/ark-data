>> REGINA MEREDITH: This
season on "Open Minds,"

who has discovered evidence
pointing to the connection

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.980 align:middle line:10%
between the island of Sardinia
and the ancient culture

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.870 align:middle line:10%
of Atlantis.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.770 align:middle line:84%
Their elaborate stone sites,
roughly 7,000 of them,

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.550 align:middle line:84%
are sprinkled all over the
island, revealing tombs, bones,

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.250 align:middle line:84%
and highly sophisticated
architecture.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.800 align:middle line:84%
It's speculated that
people from Atlantis,

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.410 align:middle line:84%
including a giant
race of people,

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.379 align:middle line:84%
emigrated to Sardinia with
their great knowledge,

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.460 align:middle line:84%
leaving their tombs and
temples, called nuraghe, behind.

understanding of these giants,

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.070 align:middle line:10%
their nuraghe, and the
mystery surrounding

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.883 align:middle line:10%
their incredible

and make a wonderful

>> REGINA: The message that
there may have been highly

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.470 align:middle line:84%
sophisticated cultures before
our current time begs many

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.020 align:middle line:84%
questions that we've
been grappling with.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.790 align:middle line:90%
Why did they disappear?

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And how many more are there
buried under the sands of time?

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:09.430 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.350 align:middle line:10%
You are in for an adventure.

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.410 align:middle line:10%
I'm here in Sardinia with
Paola Harris and Freddy Silva.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.870 align:middle line:84%
And even though we're in
this lovely little apartment

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.290 align:middle line:84%
in Cagliari, Sardinia, we have
spent the last three days out

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.320 align:middle line:90%
in the field.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And we've been examining some
mysteries that none of us

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.790 align:middle line:90%
have ever seen before.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.500 align:middle line:84%
I can't wait to get
started on this.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.270 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the subjects that
we covered is that of giants.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.500 align:middle line:84%
It's a subject that has a
big giggle factor around it

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.300 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.175 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to take
the giggle factor out

00:02:36.175 --> 00:02:37.750 align:middle line:84%
of it by going
out into the field

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:38.980 align:middle line:90%
to the tombs of the giants.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.220 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to do this part
of the story with Paola Harris.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.740 align:middle line:10%
And Paola, for you, it's
the third time here.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.230 align:middle line:10%
For the rest of us, it
was our first time here.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.520 align:middle line:10%
So first of all, let's
launch into Sardinia itself,

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.560 align:middle line:10%
and the nature of the
people, and when you first

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.570 align:middle line:10%
started coming here how
you experienced Sardinia.

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.270 align:middle line:84%
>> PAOLA HARRIS: Well, Sardinia
is a little-known island

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.330 align:middle line:84%
because everybody goes
to Sicily or Corsica.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.640 align:middle line:10%
And Sardinia is
right next to Sicily.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.130 align:middle line:10%
But I was invited
to speak about UFOs.

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.280 align:middle line:90%
That's how I came to Sardinia.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.410 align:middle line:84%
Rosella, whom you'll
meet, she invited

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.700 align:middle line:84%
me to speak on the UFO
phenomenon in these very, very

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.320 align:middle line:90%
small villages.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.170 align:middle line:84%
So when they hear
an American comes,

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.020 align:middle line:84%
what happens next is everybody
comes out of the woodwork.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.900 align:middle line:84%
They'll either come
to me about sightings

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.790 align:middle line:84%
that they've had
over military bases--

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.460 align:middle line:84%
but this particular
gentleman came forward

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.910 align:middle line:84%
and he said, come to
my farm because I want

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.620 align:middle line:90%
to tell you about the giants.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.540 align:middle line:84%
Of course this isn't
my area of study,

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.210 align:middle line:84%
but I went anyway, with some
friends and with Rosella.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:47.230 align:middle line:90%
He had artifacts.

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.050 align:middle line:84%
And then he brings out
his father and his uncle,

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.790 align:middle line:90%
and they tell me their stories.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.022 align:middle line:84%
And this happened
about 10 years ago.

00:03:54.022 --> 00:03:55.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I find
this fascinating.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.825 align:middle line:84%
Because you know,
something like this--

00:03:57.825 --> 00:03:59.950 align:middle line:84%
first of all, it would be
hard to dig up that story

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.260 align:middle line:84%
because people are so
afraid of being made fun of.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.900 align:middle line:84%
It's not the Luigi hasn't
had his share of trouble

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.940 align:middle line:84%
and ridicule over
the subject, but it's

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.580 align:middle line:84%
something you really don't
even talk about in most

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:10.840 align:middle line:90%
of the Western world.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.180 align:middle line:84%
The subject of
giants is verboten.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get
into it and talk about,

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.230 align:middle line:84%
even in his journey,
what happened

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.180 align:middle line:84%
after discovering the bones of
giants and such in his youth.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.370 align:middle line:90%
But this particular topic is--

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, it's
as bad, if not worse,

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.870 align:middle line:84%
than the subject
of UFOs in terms

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.040 align:middle line:90%
of any kind of disclosure.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.710 align:middle line:10%
I mean, here we're
in Sardinia, where

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.260 align:middle line:10%
it has the tombs of giants--

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.660 align:middle line:10%
tomba dei giganti, right?--

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.342 align:middle line:10%
all over the island.

00:04:39.342 --> 00:04:40.300 align:middle line:90%
And you can go to them.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.350 align:middle line:90%
There are no guardrails.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:42.150 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.900 align:middle line:84%
They're just sitting
out in nature, alone.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And the people
actually don't seem

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.640 align:middle line:84%
to embrace the notion that
there were giants there.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.320 align:middle line:84%
Talk about your
own understanding

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.620 align:middle line:84%
of that through the years,
what the common person has

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:54.900 align:middle line:90%
come to believe--

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.650 align:middle line:84%
like all of us, with
a lot of conditioning

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.870 align:middle line:84%
from the media, and churches,
and everything else--

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:59.830 align:middle line:90%
about this topic.

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.280 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: The way of telling
a country's history is not

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.630 align:middle line:84%
by reading the authoritative
books of anthropologists.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.670 align:middle line:84%
It's by talking to the
people in the villages.

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:13.630 align:middle line:84%
Because most history, especially
in islands like Sardinia

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:18.790 align:middle line:84%
and other places that are
not really tourist places,

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.190 align:middle line:84%
is that this goes through family
from generation to generation.

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.310 align:middle line:84%
The real history goes
through families.

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.870 align:middle line:84%
So Luigi's family
knew about the giants.

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they knew
about the giants

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.130 align:middle line:84%
because there are
bones all over.

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.920 align:middle line:84%
They were discovering
them on his property,

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.570 align:middle line:90%
in caves, everywhere.

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.380 align:middle line:84%
When he was a
child, he saw them.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.370 align:middle line:84%
He saw what he calls
the authorities come

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:40.780 align:middle line:90%
and take these bones away--

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.370 align:middle line:90%
huge skulls.

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.590 align:middle line:84%
This is what we call
witness testimony, which

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.650 align:middle line:90%
is the only work I ever do.

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.680 align:middle line:84%
It's a witness is the regular
people of the village,

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.620 align:middle line:84%
but of course they're
not allowed to talk.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.180 align:middle line:90%
Their life is made miserable.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.480 align:middle line:84%
They're told by formal
archaeology, do not

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.340 align:middle line:90%
talk about this.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And of course they
can ruin your life.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so Luigi's
taking a risk.

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:09.610 align:middle line:84%
He said he's lost
a lot of friends.

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.850 align:middle line:10%
Because he wants to talk,
because he thinks that

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:17.360 align:middle line:10%
this is such an important aspect
of the history of this island.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.900 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And I mean, in that
way, it's akin to Roswell.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.960 align:middle line:84%
After Roswell occurred, then
the governmental agencies,

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.430 align:middle line:84%
military, came
around and said, you

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.630 align:middle line:90%
won't be talking about this.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.407 align:middle line:84%
And it really frightened
the local people.

00:06:27.407 --> 00:06:28.990 align:middle line:84%
And they pretty much
kept their mouths

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:30.073 align:middle line:90%
shut for many, many years.

00:06:30.073 --> 00:06:31.198 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: They're afraid--

00:06:31.198 --> 00:06:33.280 align:middle line:84%
in this case, this
is anthropology,

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.648 align:middle line:84%
this organized institution
where this doesn't fit in.

00:06:37.648 --> 00:06:39.190 align:middle line:10%
And where are you
going to fit giants

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.920 align:middle line:10%
into the history of
the Mediterranean?

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.440 align:middle line:84%
It does fit into the
mythology though.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And it does fit
into oral tradition.

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:50.200 align:middle line:10%
So if you're going to take
everything into consideration

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:55.720 align:middle line:10%
and not take the institution's
point of view only,

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.540 align:middle line:10%
and you talk to the townspeople,
you'll get the real truth.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you do,
and that's what I do.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:01.680 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And now you mentioned
a little bit ago,

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:07.130 align:middle line:84%
you did have the opportunity,
quite a few years ago now,

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.460 align:middle line:84%
to with Luigi when his father
and his uncle were still alive.

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.880 align:middle line:10%
Now, in his book, he
also has the testimony

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.220 align:middle line:10%
of other locals,
neighbors and such,

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.880 align:middle line:10%
talking about their experiences

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.260 align:middle line:10%
they were kids and such.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:25.400 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately all these lovely
people that we see in the book

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.660 align:middle line:90%
have passed away.

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.120 align:middle line:84%
So we need to stop
teasing everybody

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.320 align:middle line:90%
and go out into the field.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.350 align:middle line:84%
We'll go out, and first we're
going to meet with Luigi.

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:35.960 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get a
little bit of his life story.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.000 align:middle line:84%
Because as you
alluded to earlier,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.950 align:middle line:84%
for Luigi, the whole
thing with the giants,

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:44.480 align:middle line:84%
personally, started when
he was a pubescent boy

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.120 align:middle line:84%
and he was helping with the
family sheep, grazing sheep,

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.030 align:middle line:84%
which took him out in the
field for many hours a day.

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:51.499 align:middle line:90%
Let's go talk to Luigi.

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:57.920 align:middle line:84%
First, Luigi, thank
you so much for letting

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.030 align:middle line:90%
us come and talk to you.

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:02.210 align:middle line:84%
Because I know you've had some
harassment and difficulties

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:07.280 align:middle line:84%
because what you share with
us is not necessarily accepted

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.580 align:middle line:84%
by a lot of the archaeologists,
and government, and so forth.

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:12.920 align:middle line:84%
The same happens
in America, so I

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:17.000 align:middle line:84%
appreciate that it's a little
risky for you to talk to us.

>>INTERPRETER: Thank you so much
for coming here, because you're

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.800 align:middle line:10%
letting me tell my story.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.240 align:middle line:90%
This has to do with Atlantis.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.560 align:middle line:90%
This has to do with the world.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.810 align:middle line:84%

>> REGINA: The story that has
emerged is an amazing story

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:37.740 align:middle line:84%
about the presence of giants
in Sardinia, and a very,

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:39.530 align:middle line:90%
very ancient culture.

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:42.890 align:middle line:84%
So can you talk about
your personal part of it

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:44.210 align:middle line:90%
as a little boy?

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:46.010 align:middle line:90%
>> MUSCAS: [SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:47.890 align:middle line:84%
>>INTERPRETER: It's a
story that's very old,

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:49.890 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to tell you
from the point of view

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:51.050 align:middle line:90%
of my own family.

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:52.760 align:middle line:84%
When the family
got together, they

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.710 align:middle line:84%
would tell stories
about my ancestors

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:57.950 align:middle line:90%
coming from the line of giants.

00:08:57.950 --> 00:08:59.420 align:middle line:84%
My relatives had
their first trucks

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:01.550 align:middle line:90%
after the Second World War.

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:05.060 align:middle line:84%
They used to bring grains
into the center of Sardinia.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:07.700 align:middle line:84%
Once, they found two skeletons
of the giants blocking

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.340 align:middle line:90%
one of these old roads.

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:13.640 align:middle line:84%
So they had to take the
grains on their backs.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.670 align:middle line:84%
I grew up with these stories,
and I remember about 70%

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:18.140 align:middle line:84%
of what I was told
as a little boy.

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:22.370 align:middle line:90%


00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:25.370 align:middle line:84%
From two years old,
I was used to this.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:28.010 align:middle line:84%
But now that I'm 57,
I know the places

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:30.200 align:middle line:84%
where they took the
skeletons, where they got

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.170 align:middle line:90%
the skeletons of the giants.

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:35.180 align:middle line:90%
It's normal to me.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:39.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So what was
interesting is he said that he

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:43.700 align:middle line:84%
found some of these bones in
an area that was abandoned.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:49.910 align:middle line:84%
He calls it the Lost City, and
the tomb of the Atlantian king.

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:54.170 align:middle line:10%
Because he believes that his
people came from Atlantis,

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:58.053 align:middle line:10%
and that Sardinia is the
remnant of Atlantis, right?

00:09:58.053 --> 00:09:59.720 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Yes, he's
very proud of that.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.680 align:middle line:90%
He talks about Atlantis.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.300 align:middle line:84%
But not only him, his whole
family have believed that.

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.440 align:middle line:90%
So we go back generations here.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.990 align:middle line:90%
So this is what makes me wonder.

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:11.210 align:middle line:84%
Because you know, if you
take witness testimony,

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:13.760 align:middle line:90%
it's not just the modern one.

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.110 align:middle line:84%
If your whole family--
your great-grandfather,

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:19.290 align:middle line:84%
your great-great-grandfather--
is talking about this,

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:22.580 align:middle line:84%
there is a little trace
of truth coming out

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.290 align:middle line:84%
that goes through
family stories.

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:26.090 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:27.570 align:middle line:90%
And he's in good company.

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:30.500 align:middle line:84%
Because Plato,
Aristotle, Herodotus,

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.710 align:middle line:84%
all believed that
Sardinia was Atlantis,

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:36.920 align:middle line:84%
is a remnant of
what was Atlantis.

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:40.000 align:middle line:84%
And they believed that these
Atlantian people existed.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.987 align:middle line:84%
So they're just carrying
on the same story.

00:10:42.987 --> 00:10:43.820 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: They are.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:47.180 align:middle line:84%
But we have artifacts,
and we have tombs.

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And there's so many
nuraghe, and there's

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:54.680 align:middle line:84%
so many really important
monuments, and some of them

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:57.592 align:middle line:84%
are buried under mounds of
grass and are not excavated yet.

00:10:57.592 --> 00:11:00.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, most of them
haven't even been discovered.

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:01.442 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
undiscovered land.

00:11:01.442 --> 00:11:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And when we're talking about
those sites, which we're

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:06.190 align:middle line:84%
going to get to
in our next show,

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:07.790 align:middle line:84%
there are 20,000
or 30,000 of them,

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:10.280 align:middle line:84%
they think, that
are identifiable,

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.650 align:middle line:84%
and they don't even know how
many more under the land.

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:16.070 align:middle line:84%
Why would anyone need to
build that many, basically,

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:18.880 align:middle line:84%
ritualistic, sophisticated
sites, right,

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.360 align:middle line:84%
unless something pretty
interesting is going on?

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.270 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to go
back out with Luigi.

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:25.190 align:middle line:84%
Because he took us
up to the Lost City,

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:28.670 align:middle line:84%
which basically is
rubble and plants.

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:32.050 align:middle line:84%
But you can see the
remnants of the old wall.

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And the place that he's
going to show us here

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:39.280 align:middle line:84%
is the remnant of what
was a giant's tomb.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And it'll make more sense as
we go into the future episodes

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:44.960 align:middle line:84%
and we look at more of
these tombs of giants,

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.800 align:middle line:84%
the shape and the length
he's talking about.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.300 align:middle line:84%
So let's go back
out in the field,

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:52.315 align:middle line:84%
then, with Luigi, when he took
us up on top of the Lost City.

>>INTERPRETER: My
most direct experience

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:02.840 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you about was in
the Lost City, in the tomb

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:06.470 align:middle line:84%
that I call The First
King of Atlantis.

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:10.160 align:middle line:84%
In 1972, I was bringing
some sheep to the pasture.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.350 align:middle line:84%
There was a big storm,
and I was a little kid,

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:14.360 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't have
a coat or anything.

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:17.120 align:middle line:84%
So I looked around for
a place for shelter.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:20.540 align:middle line:84%
I tried to go under a
tree, but that didn't work.

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:24.890 align:middle line:84%
So I saw this kind
of a hole of a cave.

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:27.230 align:middle line:10%
So I went in there.

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:32.060 align:middle line:10%
In this cave, I saw this mummy
of a giant, and I looked at it.

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:35.460 align:middle line:84%
I didn't get scared, I
just wanted to look at it

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:38.810 align:middle line:90%

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:11.360 align:middle line:90%


00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.110 align:middle line:84%
Now I'll show you the
base of the pyramid.

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:16.830 align:middle line:90%


00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:18.900 align:middle line:90%
This is the base of the pyramid.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.320 align:middle line:90%
It's covered in quartz, see?

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:36.000 align:middle line:90%


00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.010 align:middle line:84%
Here, all these stones
have quartz, all of them,

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:41.420 align:middle line:90%
just like Cheops Egypt.

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:43.480 align:middle line:84%
All the stones are
made of quartz,

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.890 align:middle line:84%
from the first to the last,
because they fell that way.

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:53.050 align:middle line:90%


00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:53.980 align:middle line:90%
They were on top.

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:54.780 align:middle line:90%
Look at these.

00:14:54.780 --> 00:15:03.230 align:middle line:90%


00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:04.880 align:middle line:90%
These have been worn away here.

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.060 align:middle line:90%


00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:11.440 align:middle line:84%
All of these stones
have been broken.

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:13.898 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, so that kind of
looks like rubble and ruins.

00:15:13.898 --> 00:15:16.232 align:middle line:84%
But you can see the foundation
that was initially there.

00:15:16.232 --> 00:15:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And you said there were
pyramids all around,

00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:20.570 align:middle line:84%
and that actually the government
knocked those smaller pyramids

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:21.080 align:middle line:90%
down.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.538 align:middle line:84%
Some of them just looked like
kind of cone-shaped mountains

00:15:23.538 --> 00:15:26.990 align:middle line:84%
that are now covered over in
vegetation, and some of them

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:28.830 align:middle line:90%
have nuraghe on top of them.

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:30.860 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of hard
to tell, historically,

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:31.910 align:middle line:90%
what actually went on.

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:34.580 align:middle line:84%
Because we have civilization
after civilization

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:36.800 align:middle line:84%
piled on top of each
other throughout the eons.

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:41.270 align:middle line:84%
So here we're now looking at the
subject, then, of the giants.

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:44.060 align:middle line:84%
Let's go in a little
more specifically.

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:45.950 align:middle line:84%
As Luigi and I are
sitting and talking,

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:48.620 align:middle line:84%
all these little stone
figures surrounding us.

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:50.810 align:middle line:84%
And you can explain
that a little bit,

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:52.027 align:middle line:90%
because Luigi is an artist.

00:15:52.027 --> 00:15:53.360 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Yeah, he's an artist.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.540 align:middle line:84%
And he's kind of obsessed
with what he's seen.

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:58.940 align:middle line:84%
Because what he has
carved in stone--

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:02.600 align:middle line:84%
and when you see all these
figures, and some of them

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:04.790 align:middle line:84%
are really
bizarre-looking-- it' what

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:08.550 align:middle line:90%
he saw inside the giant tombs.

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:10.330 align:middle line:90%
>> MUSCAS: [SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:12.417 align:middle line:90%


00:16:12.417 --> 00:16:14.500 align:middle line:84%
>> INTERPRETER: I took my
friends back to the cave

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:17.590 align:middle line:90%
to show them the giant mummy.

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:19.840 align:middle line:84%
The color of the skin
on the mummy was gray,

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:24.430 align:middle line:84%
and we would play with
the hands and the legs.

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:28.360 align:middle line:84%
After lunch, my friend and I
would go there and take naps.

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.520 align:middle line:84%
We would sleep on either
side of the mummy.

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.700 align:middle line:84%
We were used to these
stories from childhood.

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:37.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So when you were
playing with these giants,

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:40.420 align:middle line:84%
and their hands, and so
forth, did they appear to be

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:44.140 align:middle line:84%
anatomically the same as
human beings are today,

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:48.250 align:middle line:84%
the same number of
digits, or anything extra,

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:50.134 align:middle line:90%
or the same as us?

00:16:50.134 --> 00:16:51.840 align:middle line:90%
>> MUSCAS: [SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:53.105 align:middle line:90%


00:16:53.105 --> 00:16:55.480 align:middle line:84%
>> INTERPRETER: Most of the
skeletons I would find looked

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:56.530 align:middle line:90%
like us.

00:16:56.530 --> 00:17:01.570 align:middle line:84%
But I also found anthropomorphic
skeletons, including

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:06.700 align:middle line:84%
the body of a human and the
head of an animal with one,

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:09.670 align:middle line:90%
and some with two horns.

00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:13.359 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And from historical
documents through ancient

00:17:13.359 --> 00:17:18.280 align:middle line:84%
lineages, it does talk about
these types of creatures that

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.422 align:middle line:90%
existed in Atlantis.

00:17:20.422 --> 00:17:22.880 align:middle line:84%
>> INTERPRETER: Our stories
say that these people came from

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.040 align:middle line:90%
the stars.

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And when they came, they taught
us everything in technology.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.700 align:middle line:84%
We were here, but we
were small people.

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:32.740 align:middle line:84%
We were taught that
they came to this island

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:35.680 align:middle line:84%
to construct the first
place in Atlantis.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:38.590 align:middle line:84%
We call them the
people from the stars.

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:41.870 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: The little kids,
or the boys, way back when--

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:43.900 align:middle line:90%
I think in the '60s, he said--

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:48.100 align:middle line:84%
would go into these caves
and see these figures.

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.320 align:middle line:84%
They would see these
representations.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:53.920 align:middle line:84%
They would see all of this,
and also they would see bones.

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:56.180 align:middle line:90%
It was normal for them.

00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And if they talked about
it, then what would happen

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:00.517 align:middle line:84%
is the authorities would
come and empty the cave.

00:18:00.517 --> 00:18:01.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Which they did.

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:02.683 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Which they did.

00:18:02.683 --> 00:18:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And he watched
the whole process.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.733 align:middle line:84%
So did the other
people in the town.

00:18:06.733 --> 00:18:07.900 align:middle line:90%
Of course they're very good.

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:09.880 align:middle line:90%
They didn't talk about it.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.260 align:middle line:84%
I think it's called
hidden archaeology.

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.200 align:middle line:10%
But in his house--
he's so obsessed, he

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:17.950 align:middle line:10%
has made these clay
figures, he's painted them,

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:20.110 align:middle line:10%
he's sculpted them.

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:24.457 align:middle line:84%
And also he said he
remembers another life there.

00:18:24.457 --> 00:18:25.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That was interesting.

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:26.320 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: That was interesting.

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:27.362 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I mean, he is.

00:18:27.362 --> 00:18:29.325 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as
obsessive as in "Close

00:18:29.325 --> 00:18:30.700 align:middle line:84%
Encounters of the
Third Kind," he

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:33.040 align:middle line:84%
can't stop building
this mound, right?

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And Luigi-- if you had a
chance to see the whole studio,

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:37.120 align:middle line:90%
it's kind of amazing.

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.730 align:middle line:84%
There are paintings, there
are little sculptures,

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:42.250 align:middle line:84%
there are big sculptures,
there are stone carvings.

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:45.520 align:middle line:84%
He has this stuff all around
him, depicting these things.

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he's obsessed
on many levels.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.120 align:middle line:84%
And part of it,
when he was younger,

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:51.730 align:middle line:84%
he was taken down into
an area that was low

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:54.363 align:middle line:84%
and toward the sea, and he got
this horrible feeling, he said.

00:18:54.363 --> 00:18:56.530 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: And this is when
he started talking about

00:18:56.530 --> 00:19:01.910 align:middle line:84%
remembering that some kind
of deluge put the land under

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:02.710 align:middle line:90%
water.

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:04.373 align:middle line:84%
And that would
explain an awful lot.

00:19:04.373 --> 00:19:06.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And let's let him
explain what happened when he

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:08.500 align:middle line:90%
went there.

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:11.312 align:middle line:90%
>> MUSCAS: [SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:19:11.312 --> 00:19:13.770 align:middle line:84%
>> INTERPRETER: We believe this
civilization was taken away

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:19.650 align:middle line:84%
in one day and one
night, 12,000 years ago.

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:22.950 align:middle line:84%
We believe it was the heating
of the air, the meteorites,

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:25.800 align:middle line:84%
the earthquakes, and then
there came a big tsunami

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.630 align:middle line:90%
that took everything away.

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:30.660 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: There seems to be
a discrepancy in when that

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:32.875 align:middle line:84%
happened with some
of the researchers.

00:19:32.875 --> 00:19:37.020 align:middle line:84%
But it could have happened
multiple times as well.

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:38.410 align:middle line:90%
>> MUSCAS: [SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:39.098 align:middle line:90%


00:19:39.098 --> 00:19:41.640 align:middle line:84%
>> INTERPRETER: I live this part
of reality when I go to that

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:42.810 align:middle line:90%
part of the island.

00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:44.333 align:middle line:90%
I remember.

00:19:44.333 --> 00:19:45.750 align:middle line:84%
When I was a little
kid, I did not

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:48.060 align:middle line:84%
want to go to that pasture
with my grandfather.

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:51.000 align:middle line:84%
Because I could still
see that wave coming.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.280 align:middle line:90%
I still have memories of it.

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:56.790 align:middle line:84%
He would comfort me, and tell
me that it already happened,

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:57.840 align:middle line:90%
it happened in the past.

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:01.032 align:middle line:90%


00:20:01.032 --> 00:20:03.240 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Luigi has done
his best to have this stuff

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.100 align:middle line:90%
validated by modern science.

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:07.620 align:middle line:10%
So in his book, you
have proof of this

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:12.090 align:middle line:10%
by the photo of the mandible,
plus the analysis done

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:16.650 align:middle line:10%
by the University of Padua,
in Italian and in English.

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:17.610 align:middle line:90%
But one of the things--

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:19.190 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And this was their
archaeological department.

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:21.540 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: This is the
archaeological department.

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:23.430 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
that interest me

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:27.390 align:middle line:84%
as a researcher who works
with hidden mysteries

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:31.650 align:middle line:84%
is they asked him to write
it so tiny in this book--

00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:34.590 align:middle line:84%
and you see, it's tiny,
you can hardly read that.

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:36.340 align:middle line:84%
That was the only way
he could publish it.

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:38.882 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The stipulation was
that if he put it in-- this is

00:20:38.882 --> 00:20:40.740 align:middle line:84%
like a 1 or 2 font at
the back of the book,

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:41.850 align:middle line:90%
for anyone who cares to look.

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:43.558 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of like,
we'll let you do it,

00:20:43.558 --> 00:20:44.670 align:middle line:90%
but you gotta bury it.

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:46.350 align:middle line:84%
But basically what
it came back with

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:48.900 align:middle line:84%
was the dimensions
of the jawbone

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:50.820 align:middle line:84%
that we see in
this picture here.

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:53.880 align:middle line:10%
And there are other body
parts that they examined

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:55.440 align:middle line:10%
the dimensions of those.

00:20:55.440 --> 00:21:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And also they talked about the
blood type of the individual,

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:05.090 align:middle line:84%
of the giant, which was an O
type, which was Rh-negative.

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:08.490 align:middle line:84%
Luigi said, that's my family's
blood type, that's my blood

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:10.288 align:middle line:90%
type, those are our ancestors.

00:21:10.288 --> 00:21:12.080 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: It's very
rare, that blood type.

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:12.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It is very rare.

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:13.485 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Very rare.

00:21:13.485 --> 00:21:16.890 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And there are
stories within the community

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:19.290 align:middle line:84%
of alternative
archaeology and research,

00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:23.010 align:middle line:84%

>> REGINA: And various parts.

00:24:04.898 --> 00:24:07.087 align:middle line:84%

>> MUSCAS: [SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:14.220 align:middle line:84%
>> INTERPRETER: The femur alone
is 1 meter, 11 centimeters.

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:15.030 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Wow.

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:16.450 align:middle line:90%
>> INTERPRETER: 3.6 feet.

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:17.370 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Wow.

00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:20.850 align:middle line:84%
OK, and so that was
the femoral bone.

00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:22.620 align:middle line:84%
>> INTERPRETER: This
is the biggest femur.

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:26.220 align:middle line:84%
There's another that is 1 meter,
26 centimeters, like this.

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:28.250 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So how
tall is the person.

00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>> INTERPRETER: 4 meters,
80 centimeters tall.

00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:32.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: 4 and 1/2 meters?

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:33.980 align:middle line:90%
4 and 1/2 meters.

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:39.630 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking at about
15 feet tall, roughly.

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:41.850 align:middle line:90%
15 feet.

00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:45.380 align:middle line:84%
And so when you were a little
boy, and you were in the cave,

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:53.200 align:middle line:84%
OK, the tomb, the giant
was quattro meters?

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:54.600 align:middle line:90%
>> MUSCAS: [SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:56.473 align:middle line:84%
>> INTERPRETER: 4 meters
and 24 centimeters.

00:24:56.473 --> 00:24:57.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:24:57.390 --> 00:24:59.130 align:middle line:90%
>> INTERPRETER: 13.9 feet tall.

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:00.270 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: He was bigger--

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:02.310 align:middle line:90%
like from here to the door.

00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:04.620 align:middle line:84%
>> INTERPRETER: This is
the most important proof--

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:07.740 align:middle line:84%
three skeletons analyzed in
the Institute of Anthropology

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:12.120 align:middle line:84%
in Padova, 1981, with the
names of the actual professors.

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.230 align:middle line:10%
Everything is here.

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:15.480 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Well, this is good.

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:18.550 align:middle line:84%
People will find this
very, very interesting.

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:19.350 align:middle line:10%
Yeah?

00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:19.550 align:middle line:10%
>> MUSCAS: Thank you.

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:20.980 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:21.990 align:middle line:10%
No, thank you.

00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:24.090 align:middle line:84%
He was talking about a
tooth, and some people

00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:26.840 align:middle line:84%
said, no, that's not a human
tooth, that's a cow tooth.

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:28.230 align:middle line:90%
It's not a giant tooth.

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:30.600 align:middle line:10%
But he also shows,
in this image,

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:35.100 align:middle line:10%
the mandibular structure
of a human being.

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:40.050 align:middle line:84%
He described it like this,
about 33 centimeters, this jaw.

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:43.467 align:middle line:84%
He says it's the tooth
from someone that big.

00:25:43.467 --> 00:25:45.300 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: But he found
others-- this is it.

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:47.760 align:middle line:84%
That isn't the only
tooth he found.

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:50.760 align:middle line:90%
He had many of those teeth.

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:52.870 align:middle line:84%
And then we also saw
another little jaw

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:54.810 align:middle line:90%
that's bigger than a human jaw.

00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:57.590 align:middle line:84%
So these are people that
aren't going looking for them.

00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:59.340 align:middle line:84%
They're there, right
there in their lands.

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:01.170 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And there's another
tooth that's a human tooth.

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:02.640 align:middle line:90%
It's much, much smaller.

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:05.270 align:middle line:84%
So it would have been from
a person larger than us--

00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:09.930 align:middle line:84%
a tall person, but not as
large as what he's saying they

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:12.820 align:middle line:84%
were seeing in the past in
terms of these massive, gigantic

00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:13.620 align:middle line:90%
frames.

00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:17.280 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Yeah, massive
skulls, massive teeth.

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And then he had talked
about, 10 years ago,

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:22.620 align:middle line:90%
the femur that I saw.

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:24.300 align:middle line:84%
And then I said,
well, where is that?

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:25.500 align:middle line:90%
Can we see that?

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:28.440 align:middle line:84%
He said, they came to
take it to carbon-date it.

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:30.910 align:middle line:84%
He said, I had to
give it to them.

00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:32.035 align:middle line:90%
But they never returned it.

00:26:32.035 --> 00:26:33.618 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But you
saw it in his shop.

00:26:33.618 --> 00:26:36.120 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Oh, yeah, because
he had many more bones.

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And then while I was
there, another car

00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:40.590 align:middle line:90%
drove up with some people.

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we
want to show you--

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:43.350 align:middle line:90%
they opened up their trunk.

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:46.920 align:middle line:84%
And my God, I've never
seen bones so big.

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.392 align:middle line:90%
And they said, we found these.

00:26:48.392 --> 00:26:50.850 align:middle line:84%
Because they found out I was
there, you know, the American.

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:54.537 align:middle line:84%
And they thought, this story
is big, let's go show her.

00:26:54.537 --> 00:26:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And they opened up the trunk,
and I couldn't believe it.

00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:59.328 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Did you ever think
that people were maybe trying

00:26:59.328 --> 00:27:00.810 align:middle line:84%
to take advantage
of the Americana?

00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:01.110 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: No.

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:01.910 align:middle line:90%
Why would they?

00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:03.690 align:middle line:90%
Because this is farm land.

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:08.230 align:middle line:84%
This is way out they had to
drive away far away to do this.

00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:10.590 align:middle line:84%
I think there is a
part of human beings

00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:12.570 align:middle line:90%
that want to tell the truth.

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:14.200 align:middle line:84%
And they're very
proud of the island.

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:15.130 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And they
want their story told.

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: And they
want their story told.

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:17.398 align:middle line:90%
And they're very proud.

00:27:17.398 --> 00:27:19.500 align:middle line:84%
They're very nationalistic
of their island.

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:23.680 align:middle line:84%
So what you have to look at is
the value of witness testimony.

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:27.000 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so
after that he said,

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take you to a
place that is very typical.

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:33.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's labeled
tomb of the giants--

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.770 align:middle line:84%
a very typical
tomb of the giants.

00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:37.710 align:middle line:84%
We were going to see
more in subsequent days.

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:39.630 align:middle line:84%
But this is the
first one we saw.

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:41.260 align:middle line:10%
It was really cool.

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:45.710 align:middle line:10%
So Luigi, this is outside
of the little town of Siddi.

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:46.510 align:middle line:90%
>> MUSCAS: Siddi.

00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:47.498 align:middle line:90%

00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:04.340 align:middle line:90%
So the head-- the giganti--

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:06.142 align:middle line:90%
>> MUSCAS: Sí, giganti.

00:28:06.142 --> 00:28:07.850 align:middle line:84%
>> INTERPRETER: The
giant would lay here,

00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:10.040 align:middle line:84%
and the soul would go
through the door over there.

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:13.220 align:middle line:90%


00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:14.140 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:16.450 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful stonework.

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:17.630 align:middle line:90%
Nicely fitted.

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:20.780 align:middle line:90%
>> MUSCAS: [SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:23.610 align:middle line:84%
>> INTERPRETER: These walls,
they would precisely cut them,

00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:25.610 align:middle line:84%
and they would put them
together without cement.

00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:27.905 align:middle line:90%


00:28:27.905 --> 00:28:29.030 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: This is amazing.

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:32.180 align:middle line:84%
And of course, massive stones
put together with no cement.

00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:34.400 align:middle line:84%
And so this is
where the giants--

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:38.840 align:middle line:84%
where they came after the
death, with the head down here,

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.690 align:middle line:84%
the feet at that
end, and the spirit

00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:44.030 align:middle line:84%
would go out through their
feet, through the other end.

00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:44.830 align:middle line:90%
>> MUSCAS: Sí.

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:45.630 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And then their body would
be removed and then buried.

00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:50.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

When the giant died,

they would put them in the
tomb through that hole there.

00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And depending on how
big the giant was,

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:03.080 align:middle line:84%
they would put either
one, two, or three.

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.580 align:middle line:84%
The next night,
they would come back

00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:06.500 align:middle line:84%
to do the soul passage,
where the soul would

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:09.390 align:middle line:84%
go through the hole,
straight to heaven.

>> INTERPRETER: It's too
hard to date these stones.

00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:52.880 align:middle line:90%
These stones are very old.

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:56.570 align:middle line:84%
The stones could be more
than 10 million years old.

00:29:56.570 --> 00:30:01.380 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere you go, you can find
five or six of these sites.

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:03.875 align:middle line:84%
These sites were to
perform these rituals.

00:30:03.875 --> 00:30:06.000 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, because
they had a higher spiritual

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:06.900 align:middle line:90%
understanding.

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:09.570 align:middle line:90%


00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:11.755 align:middle line:84%
When Freddie jumped
into the story--

00:30:11.755 --> 00:30:14.130 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to be seeing
a lot of Freddie in our next

00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:15.192 align:middle line:90%
episode, right--

00:30:15.192 --> 00:30:16.650 align:middle line:84%
when Freddie jumped
into the story,

00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:21.570 align:middle line:84%
he said, I believe they weren't
just for people who had died--

00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:23.760 align:middle line:90%
for the giants who had died.

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:27.060 align:middle line:84%
He believes they're
also a chamber

00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:29.300 align:middle line:90%
for a ritualized experience.

00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:33.280 align:middle line:84%
So let's go to
Freddie's take on it.

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:35.660 align:middle line:84%
>> SILVA: If you can go back
thousands of years in time,

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:37.900 align:middle line:84%
and just use your
imagination a little bit,

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:40.030 align:middle line:84%
this was actually
covered with earth,

00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:43.640 align:middle line:84%
and it was alternating layers of
organic and inorganic material.

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And again, you got to
ask these questions--

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:47.635 align:middle line:84%
why would anyone go
through that trouble

00:30:47.635 --> 00:30:49.960 align:middle line:84%
to-- if you're going to
bury someone, bury them.

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:53.050 align:middle line:84%
Just cover the whole thing
with earth, get a few rocks,

00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:54.010 align:middle line:90%
and be done with it.

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:56.260 align:middle line:84%
But no, everything is
covered with alternate layers

00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:58.500 align:middle line:84%
of organic and
inorganic material.

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And we've done
studies whereby we've

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:03.850 align:middle line:84%
taken frequencies of the
energy outside of the mounds

00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:05.800 align:middle line:84%
compared to the energy
inside the mound.

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:07.520 align:middle line:84%
The two are very
different things.

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:08.320 align:middle line:90%
So there's--

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:10.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Especially
in circular areas.

00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:10.500 align:middle line:90%
>> SILVA: Exactly.

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:12.667 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Which, I mean,
even Michael Tellinger had

00:31:12.667 --> 00:31:16.390 align:middle line:84%
the readings done inside and
outside of the similar stone

00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:17.920 align:middle line:90%
structures in South Africa.

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:20.260 align:middle line:84%
Very high readings,
energetically and acoustically,

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:21.250 align:middle line:90%
from the inside.

00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:22.690 align:middle line:84%
>> SILVA: And why would a
dead person require that?

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:23.110 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:23.860 align:middle line:90%
>> SILVA: Right.

00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:25.450 align:middle line:84%
So this comes back
to the other point.

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:27.880 align:middle line:84%
If they left no instructions--
that's the fun part of this

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:28.570 align:middle line:90%
job--

00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:30.320 align:middle line:84%
we're taking little
breadcrumbs and trying

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.420 align:middle line:84%
to make a wonderful
loaf of bread out of it.

00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:35.680 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing I tend to do
is, well, what's it looking at?

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:38.590 align:middle line:84%
Because everything-- every
temple on the face of the earth

00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:40.750 align:middle line:90%
can usually be figured out--

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:42.540 align:middle line:84%
it's date of
construction can usually

00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:45.220 align:middle line:84%
be figured out by its
alignments to a background star.

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:47.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So what is this
alignment we're looking at?

00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:50.385 align:middle line:84%
>> SILVA: Well, here, we
have three potential hits.

00:31:50.385 --> 00:31:51.760 align:middle line:84%
Again, they left
no instructions,

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:53.440 align:middle line:84%
so let's start with
the most basic--

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:56.110 align:middle line:84%
equinox sunrise, winter
solstice sunrise.

00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:57.880 align:middle line:90%
Those are two classic ones.

00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:00.310 align:middle line:84%
The moon definitely doesn't
factor into this one at all.

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:02.680 align:middle line:84%
We now have the ability
to backtrack in time.

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And if you were standing
here, in 8500 BC,

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:08.860 align:middle line:84%
you would get a
perfect alignment

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:10.850 align:middle line:90%
with the equinox sunrise.

00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And an hour before
that, you'd see

00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:14.540 align:middle line:90%
Venus rising just before it.

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:15.340 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Aha.

00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:17.400 align:middle line:84%
>> SILVA: And you see this again
and again around the world.

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:19.330 align:middle line:84%
And any time you see
that kind of chamber,

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:21.880 align:middle line:84%
that's usually a place that
was used for initiation.

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:24.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And what I find
interesting about that is,

00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:27.070 align:middle line:84%
then, we were talking about--
and I say the word, cults,

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:28.060 align:middle line:90%
very loosely--

00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:31.900 align:middle line:84%
but groups of individuals
that had knowledge

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:34.000 align:middle line:84%
that were aligned
with the sun, which

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.370 align:middle line:84%
is, in the classic
hermetic sense,

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:38.260 align:middle line:84%
the shining ones with
the advanced knowledge

00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:41.050 align:middle line:84%
would be the ones more prone
to aligning their structures

00:32:41.050 --> 00:32:43.780 align:middle line:84%
toward the sun, rather than
the moon cults, for example.

00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:45.610 align:middle line:90%
>> SILVA: Exactly, exactly.

00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And Venus rising before
the equinox sunrise

00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:50.980 align:middle line:84%
was always the mark
of the risen initiate.

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:53.020 align:middle line:84%
Someone who had gone
into a special place,

00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:55.398 align:middle line:84%
like this, they would have
gone in because-- well,

00:32:55.398 --> 00:32:56.440 align:middle line:90%
the frequencies are here.

00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:57.773 align:middle line:90%
They're different on the inside.

00:32:57.773 --> 00:33:02.090 align:middle line:84%
They would have been the
ones to become much more,

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:05.770 align:middle line:84%
I want to say, tempered by the
frequencies inside the chamber.

00:33:05.770 --> 00:33:08.238 align:middle line:84%
Because they would have actually
been beneficial to them.

00:33:08.238 --> 00:33:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And we know that these
frequencies actually

00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:12.220 align:middle line:84%
align with the human body
in a way that drives down

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:15.497 align:middle line:84%
your state of thinking to a
place where it's not thinking.

00:33:15.497 --> 00:33:17.830 align:middle line:84%

happen to be.

that's another story.

00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:39.160 align:middle line:90%
That's another situation.

It's just a lot cheaper if you
just sit here and actually get

00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:02.980 align:middle line:84%
you're saying that
the shaman of the day,

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:05.410 align:middle line:84%
or the priests of
the day, understood

00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:08.650 align:middle line:84%
that this had a particular
lay line pattern here

00:34:08.650 --> 00:34:10.870 align:middle line:84%
that was beneficial
for building this?

00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:12.909 align:middle line:84%
Or you're saying, by
evidence that it's built,

00:34:12.909 --> 00:34:14.530 align:middle line:84%
we know that the
ley lines are here?

00:34:14.530 --> 00:34:14.983 align:middle line:90%
>> SILVA: Both.

00:34:14.983 --> 00:34:15.436 align:middle line:90%

>> REGINA: OK.

00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:18.070 align:middle line:84%
>> SILVA: So they used to
get people who are actually

00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:18.870 align:middle line:90%
intuitive.

00:34:18.870 --> 00:34:20.420 align:middle line:84%
They would sense
the energy lines.

00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And then they would
call in someone.

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And it actually became called
the augurs, where we get

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:26.469 align:middle line:90%
the term, inauguration, from.

00:34:26.469 --> 00:34:30.130 align:middle line:84%
They would inaugurate the site
by marking the specific points

00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:33.280 align:middle line:84%
along the land where
this invisible--

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:36.489 align:middle line:84%
these energy lines cross so
that the builders-- the stone

00:34:36.489 --> 00:34:39.000 align:middle line:84%
builders could say, OK,
we have to now build

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.550 align:middle line:84%
the site aligned to this
specific alignment using

00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:44.710 align:middle line:90%
this specific type of stone.

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:47.350 align:middle line:84%
In this case, it's
very old sandstone.

00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:50.757 align:middle line:84%
And basically align it
to the exact position

00:34:50.757 --> 00:34:52.090 align:middle line:90%
of the invisible energy current.

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:55.150 align:middle line:84%
So you're giving shape
to an invisible force,

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:58.060 align:middle line:84%
which a very expensive piece
of machinery will detect.

00:34:58.060 --> 00:34:59.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So we're saying--

00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:01.870 align:middle line:84%
at least from what they
said outside on the placard,

00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:03.808 align:middle line:90%
this is roughly 5,000 years old.

00:35:03.808 --> 00:35:05.350 align:middle line:84%
You're seeing more
so-- you're saying

00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:07.687 align:middle line:90%
maybe 8,000, 9,000 years.

00:35:07.687 --> 00:35:09.520 align:middle line:84%
>> SILVA: The original
hit that I'm getting,

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:11.950 align:middle line:84%
if you match the
sky-ground relationship,

00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:14.880 align:middle line:90%
8,500 BC to the equinox sunrise.

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:17.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So this would have
been 1,000 years or so after

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:20.480 align:middle line:84%
the deluge, in the
rebuilding of the cultures.

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:21.280 align:middle line:90%
>> SILVA: Exactly.

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:23.113 align:middle line:84%
But there's another
point to the story here.

00:35:23.113 --> 00:35:26.110 align:middle line:84%
Because if the-- the Earth
moves relative to its background

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:28.690 align:middle line:84%
of stars, every
few hundred years.

00:35:28.690 --> 00:35:31.060 align:middle line:90%
So one degree every 72 years.

00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:33.930 align:middle line:84%
Everything in the background
to move ever so slightly.

00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:35.850 align:middle line:84%
The alignments
goes slightly off.

00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:37.580 align:middle line:84%
So the next time
you get a major hit

00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:41.020 align:middle line:84%
is the winter solstice
sunrise in 3700 BC.

00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:43.340 align:middle line:84%
Still quite old,
still pretty much

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:45.170 align:middle line:84%
where the archaeologists
were saying,

00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:48.490 align:middle line:84%
yes, this kind of fits
into the Neolithic pattern.

00:35:48.490 --> 00:35:50.960 align:middle line:84%
But there's no
evidence behind it.

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.700 align:middle line:90%
Because you can't date stone.

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:55.700 align:middle line:84%
You can only date the
actual soil around it.

00:35:55.700 --> 00:36:00.468 align:middle line:84%
But that only tells us when the
site came out of commission.

00:36:00.468 --> 00:36:03.940 align:middle line:90%
[RAIN FALLING]

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:10.690 align:middle line:90%


00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:11.490 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:12.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:14.750 align:middle line:84%
>> SILVA: So this is pretty
much where the beginning--

00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:15.720 align:middle line:84%
the edge of the mound
would have been.

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:17.470 align:middle line:84%
You can still see the
stones in the ground

00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:20.130 align:middle line:84%
that would have formed the
edge of the passage mound.

00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And then it would have
circled the round like a tube.

00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:25.780 align:middle line:84%
It would have probably
been about yea high.

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:27.990 align:middle line:84%
Of course I'm
pretty tall myself.

00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:30.460 align:middle line:84%
And then it used to be
covered with other stones.

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:33.035 align:middle line:10%
So it would have been a
perfect passage mound.

00:36:33.035 --> 00:36:34.410 align:middle line:10%
And all of this
that you see here

00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:36.490 align:middle line:10%
would have been where
the earth used to be.

00:36:36.490 --> 00:36:38.370 align:middle line:10%
It's now filled in,
the actual hole.

00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:40.240 align:middle line:10%
So it would have been
quite deep as well.

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:42.360 align:middle line:10%
But again, you'd
have to crawl in.

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:45.200 align:middle line:10%
Even for tall people,
you've had to crawl in,

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:46.800 align:middle line:10%
in a state of humility.

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.380 align:middle line:10%
That's the whole
point of this thing.

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:50.672 align:middle line:84%
In the King's Chamber in the
Great Pyramid, same thing.

00:36:50.672 --> 00:36:51.578 align:middle line:90%

got all the space you want,

00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:54.380 align:middle line:90%
what are you going to do?

00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:56.505 align:middle line:84%
You're going to make a nice
little hole for someone

00:36:56.505 --> 00:36:57.550 align:middle line:90%
to crawl in.

00:36:57.550 --> 00:37:00.122 align:middle line:84%
The purpose is that you
crawl in, you become humble.

00:37:00.122 --> 00:37:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And then you come back
into the big room,

00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:03.390 align:middle line:90%
and there you are in the--

00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:05.880 align:middle line:84%
essentially the body of God,
if you want to call it that.

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:07.650 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Metaphorically,
it can mean a lot of things,

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:08.580 align:middle line:90%
birth of all kinds.

00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:09.380 align:middle line:90%
>> SILVA: Exactly.

00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:10.320 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:12.900 align:middle line:84%
>> SILVA: We're now inside what
used to be the passage mound.

00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:15.150 align:middle line:84%
So this would have been
covered with big stones, which

00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:16.300 align:middle line:90%
are now on the front.

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:19.500 align:middle line:84%
So the archaeologists must
have dismembered this.

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:21.750 align:middle line:84%
They took the stones out,
they dug around in here,

00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:24.030 align:middle line:90%
and they left the stones there.

00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:25.980 align:middle line:90%
Not very nice of them.

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:28.570 align:middle line:84%
So in here, there's
the hole again.

00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:31.080 align:middle line:84%
This is where the light of
the rising sun of the equinox

00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:32.538 align:middle line:84%
would have come
right through here,

00:37:32.538 --> 00:37:34.020 align:middle line:84%
created a beautiful
shaft of light.

00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:35.755 align:middle line:84%
And it gives you a
wonderful perspective

00:37:35.755 --> 00:37:37.380 align:middle line:84%
on what it would have
felt like to have

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:38.940 align:middle line:90%
been inside this chamber.

00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And usually if you look at
the story around the world,

00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:45.150 align:middle line:84%
it's the same story
again and again.

00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:48.210 align:middle line:84%
People used to come in
here for up to three days.

00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:50.880 align:middle line:84%
They were given the mild
narcotic, like a poison.

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And they would spend a
nice quiet night in here.

00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:55.620 align:middle line:84%
And they would
literally leave the body

00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:57.710 align:middle line:84%
in an induced
near-death experience.

00:37:57.710 --> 00:38:01.130 align:middle line:84%
That's why they thought that
these places were tombs.

00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:03.240 align:middle line:84%
Except they were
expected to come

00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:05.990 align:middle line:84%
back out alive at some
point, which they did.

00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:07.470 align:middle line:84%
Three days later,
they'd reemerge,

00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:08.970 align:middle line:84%
and the first thing
they'd see would

00:38:08.970 --> 00:38:11.340 align:middle line:84%
be Venus rising
before the Equinox,

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:13.260 align:middle line:90%
the mark of the risen initiate.

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And you hear this story
all around the world.

00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:17.067 align:middle line:84%
If a South American
person was here right now,

00:38:17.067 --> 00:38:19.200 align:middle line:84%
they'd say, absolutely,
we've got the same thing

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:20.360 align:middle line:90%
at Lake Titicaca.

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:22.730 align:middle line:84%
An Egyptian would say
exactly the same thing.

00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And again, alignment tells
us so much about what

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:28.260 align:middle line:84%
was going on, not just in terms
of the relationship of the site

00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:32.200 align:middle line:84%
to the actual stars,
but also its purpose.

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:34.080 align:middle line:84%
So if this was
facing the northeast,

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:36.540 align:middle line:84%
it would have been used for a
completely different function

00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:37.340 align:middle line:90%
altogether.

00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:39.120 align:middle line:84%
So the alignment,
in terms of ritual,

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:40.520 align:middle line:90%
is very, very important.

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:43.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's interesting,
just looking at the proportions

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:45.050 align:middle line:84%
of the remnants here,
the large stones,

00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:48.900 align:middle line:84%
this is approximately the
same length as the tomb

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:50.970 align:middle line:84%
of the giants that
we were in yesterday.

00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:53.460 align:middle line:84%
How many meters would you
say from those far stones

00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:54.925 align:middle line:90%
to the primary stone?

00:38:54.925 --> 00:38:56.550 align:middle line:84%

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:12.510 align:middle line:84%
>> SILVA: Yeah, it's about
30 feet, quite a big one.

00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And you can still see
the outline a little bit,

00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:15.820 align:middle line:90%
of where the earth used to be.

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:16.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
what I'm saying.

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:17.935 align:middle line:84%
I'm just looking
at it and seeing

00:39:17.935 --> 00:39:20.370 align:middle line:84%
if there's any correlation
between this, as we go along,

00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:21.955 align:middle line:90%
and other giant tombs.

00:39:21.955 --> 00:39:24.330 align:middle line:84%
>> SILVA: And they're ever so
slightly different as well.

00:39:24.330 --> 00:39:25.800 align:middle line:90%
And I also get the sense--

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:27.240 align:middle line:84%
I guess we don't
know exactly what

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:29.115 align:middle line:84%
was going on at the
front with the two horns.

00:39:29.115 --> 00:39:32.700 align:middle line:84%
Because from above, it looks
like the horns of a bull.

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:34.800 align:middle line:10%
Now if I was looking
at that symbolically,

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:37.030 align:middle line:10%
I would say that would
refer to the Age of Taurus.

00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:37.830 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:39:37.830 --> 00:39:40.680 align:middle line:10%
>> SILVA: 4000 BC to 2000 BC.

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:42.690 align:middle line:10%
Because they would
actually design things

00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:44.730 align:middle line:10%
according to the age
in which they were in.

00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:47.163 align:middle line:84%
So in Egypt, if you look
at the Avenues of the Rams,

00:39:47.163 --> 00:39:48.330 align:middle line:90%
that was the Age of the Ram.

00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:51.810 align:middle line:84%
So you know that they're
between 2000 BC and 0 BC.

00:39:51.810 --> 00:39:54.480 align:middle line:84%
So here the site may
have been re-adapted.

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:58.350 align:middle line:84%
This may not have been
the original design.

00:39:58.350 --> 00:40:01.320 align:middle line:84%
It may just be in
the natural standing

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:04.860 align:middle line:84%
stone, the actual passage
mound, like you have in Karnak,

00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:06.300 align:middle line:90%
like you have in Britain.

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And then as the
ages went by, they

00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:10.777 align:middle line:84%
may have added that to
symbolize the age that they just

00:40:10.777 --> 00:40:11.610 align:middle line:90%
basically went into.

00:40:11.610 --> 00:40:13.902 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: There's other bull
iconography in the museum

00:40:13.902 --> 00:40:14.702 align:middle line:90%
in Cagliari, too.

00:40:14.702 --> 00:40:15.502 align:middle line:90%
>> SILVA: Yeah.

00:40:15.502 --> 00:40:17.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We saw a
couple pics this morning.

00:40:17.490 --> 00:40:18.290 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:19.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, makes sense.

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:21.950 align:middle line:90%


00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:25.880 align:middle line:84%
Both Freddie and Luigi say
this is a journey back home,

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:27.380 align:middle line:90%
out to the cosmos.

00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:30.620 align:middle line:90%
They both said, as the spirit--

00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:32.660 align:middle line:90%
or anima, as Luigi called it--

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:34.565 align:middle line:84%
leaves, it goes back
out to the stars

00:40:34.565 --> 00:40:35.690 align:middle line:90%
where the beings came from.

00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:37.940 align:middle line:84%
Freddie is saying the
same thing in his,

00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:40.160 align:middle line:84%
although he's saying that
it was a resurrection

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:43.580 align:middle line:84%
ritual, to be able to loosen
from the material world

00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:45.772 align:middle line:90%
and go back into spirit.

00:40:45.772 --> 00:40:48.230 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Luigi believes these
people come from the stars,

00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:49.520 align:middle line:90%
which is really interesting.

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:51.750 align:middle line:84%
Because he calls
them giganti dalle

00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:55.925 align:middle line:84%
stelle, which means the
giants from the stars.

00:40:55.925 --> 00:40:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And Freddie believes
the same thing, the yanu

00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:58.940 align:middle line:90%
who came from the stars.

00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And it all goes back to
a particular star system.

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:04.903 align:middle line:90%
OK, Paola, thank you so much.

00:41:04.903 --> 00:41:05.820 align:middle line:90%
This was a lot of fun.

00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:08.820 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be seeing more
of you in part number three,

00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:10.070 align:middle line:90%
which is going to be fabulous.

00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:12.060 align:middle line:84%
We're kind of saving,
in my opinion,

00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:15.410 align:middle line:84%
the best for last in our
last show of this series.

00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:19.070 align:middle line:84%
But meanwhile, we're going
to be meeting with Freddie

00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:21.830 align:middle line:84%
at the nuraghe, going around
to all these nuraghe sites

00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:22.640 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And these-- they're being
dated by the academic world

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:31.430 align:middle line:84%
here to be in the Bronze Age,
around 4,000 years old roughly.

00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:34.340 align:middle line:84%
Freddie is saying, not
according to his measurements.

00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:36.300 align:middle line:84%
It's an entirely
different story.

00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:40.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we get into
the story of archaeoastronomy

00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:42.350 align:middle line:90%
and these ancient sites.

00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:43.730 align:middle line:90%
So a lot more to come.

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:47.660 align:middle line:84%
Stunning visuals as we traveled
to the north of Sardinia

00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:49.670 align:middle line:90%
to look at the ancient nuraghe.

00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:51.620 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:52.790 align:middle line:90%
on "Open Minds."
