00:00:20.243 --> 00:00:22.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Thanks
for joining me today

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.320 align:middle line:84%
in the Gaiam Studios
in Boulder, Colorado.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, Regina Meredith.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.120 align:middle line:84%
Throughout the several years
and hundreds of interviews

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.240 align:middle line:84%
I've done with the brightest
people of our times,

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.100 align:middle line:84%
there has been one subject
that seems to dog all of us--

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.300 align:middle line:90%
money.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.250 align:middle line:84%
As many of us strive
to advance ourselves

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.230 align:middle line:84%
on a psychological
and spiritual level

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.380 align:middle line:84%
through meditation, yoga,
prayer, and other practices,

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.150 align:middle line:84%
we're instantly
taken down into fear

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.370 align:middle line:84%
when money reenters
our awareness.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.710 align:middle line:84%
Could it be that there is
something systematically

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.440 align:middle line:84%
wrong in our money matrix
that keeps us essentially

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.690 align:middle line:90%
enslaved to its scarcity?

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.450 align:middle line:84%
Today's guest, Stephen
Belgin, would answer yes.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.950 align:middle line:84%
Stephen would also
say that we can

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.520 align:middle line:84%
heal ourselves and our societies
with the flip of a switch.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.280 align:middle line:84%
His is a story of hope,
forgiveness, and redemption.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.825 align:middle line:90%
And I have to say that--

00:01:06.825 --> 00:01:08.450 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
embarrass you, Stephen,

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.150 align:middle line:84%
but Stephen is one of the most
fascinating people I've ever

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.980 align:middle line:90%
met in my entire lifetime.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.220 align:middle line:90%
And Bernard Lietaer--

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.820 align:middle line:84%
>>>STEPHEN BELGIN: One of the
great teachers I've ever had

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.020 align:middle line:84%
the pleasure and the blessing
to be involved with, yes.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we need
to talk about who

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.810 align:middle line:84%
he is because this is
really central to the book

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.310 align:middle line:84%
that the two of you have written
called "New Money for a New

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.800 align:middle line:84%
World," which I
have to praise you.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.020 align:middle line:84%
This is an incredible
work that I

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.410 align:middle line:84%
think everybody should have in
their possession because this

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.150 align:middle line:84%
is a subject that
confounds all of us

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.800 align:middle line:84%
and create such
pain on the planet.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And you're really
showing us a way out.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.883 align:middle line:84%
So why didn't you tell us,
first of all, who Bernard is

00:01:47.883 --> 00:01:50.300 align:middle line:84%
and why he is central to this
story and how the two of you

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.810 align:middle line:90%
came together.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: Well, Bernard has
a very interesting history.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.900 align:middle line:84%
But in essence, he started
working in systems.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.240 align:middle line:84%
He had his master's degree,
I think, from the MIT

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.180 align:middle line:84%
and he was then brought
in, he wrote a paper

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.540 align:middle line:90%
while he was in MIT about money.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.850 align:middle line:84%
And he started
making predictions

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.290 align:middle line:84%
based on his understanding
of systems, not economics,

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.800 align:middle line:84%
about how money works
and how that affects

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.425 align:middle line:90%
the economies of the world.

00:02:23.425 --> 00:02:24.800 align:middle line:84%
And he started
making predictions

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.490 align:middle line:84%
while he was at MIT about the
Latin-American crisis that

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.190 align:middle line:84%
was looming that nobody else
was actually looking at.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What time frame
that we're looking at there?

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.620 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: This is the 1970s.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: OK, and because of
his understanding of systems,

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.740 align:middle line:84%
he applied that to
money, not economics.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.210 align:middle line:84%
And was through
that that he came

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.420 align:middle line:84%
to understand that a lot
of what we call economics

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.420 align:middle line:90%
is actually a monetary issue.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.940 align:middle line:84%
And so from that, he was
able to predict things

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.890 align:middle line:84%
that nobody else was able to see
and he built a career on that.

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:04.340 align:middle line:84%
In the 1980s, he was approached
by members of the EU and others

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.320 align:middle line:84%
to help construct
a new currency,

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.268 align:middle line:90%
a supranational currency.

00:03:08.268 --> 00:03:10.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is making
headline news every day

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.910 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:11.710 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: Correct.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's in trouble.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: It's in
trouble but all

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.760 align:middle line:84%
of the national currencies
in our world are, in a sense,

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.560 align:middle line:90%
in trouble.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.230 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: So he made these--

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.770 align:middle line:84%
he started working on the ECU,
the European Conversion Unit,

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.190 align:middle line:90%
which then became the Euro.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.360 align:middle line:84%
And it was during this time
that he was working on the ECU

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.870 align:middle line:84%
that he started making new
observations about money,

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.760 align:middle line:84%
again, from a
structural of systems

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.157 align:middle line:84%
point of view which has led to
the work we're both doing now.

00:03:41.157 --> 00:03:42.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
some people call him

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.973 align:middle line:90%
the architect behind the Euro.

00:03:44.973 --> 00:03:46.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: Well, in a
sense, that's true.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.973 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was actually the ECU.

00:03:47.973 --> 00:03:50.488 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't the Euro itself
but it did become the Euro.

00:03:50.488 --> 00:03:51.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It became Euro.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:52.488 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: That's right.

00:03:52.488 --> 00:03:56.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you have
a lifetime of really

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.440 align:middle line:84%
not only a passionate
interest in understanding

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.770 align:middle line:84%
how money works, but
also it was because it

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:05.690 align:middle line:84%
was a source of great
stress in your own life

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:06.607 align:middle line:90%
when you were a child.

00:04:06.607 --> 00:04:08.197 align:middle line:90%
And it's such a touching story.

00:04:08.197 --> 00:04:10.280 align:middle line:84%
I'd really like it if you
could go ahead and share

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.470 align:middle line:84%
what happened when you were
very young, the way you grew up,

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.110 align:middle line:90%
what happened with your father.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'll prompt you if you
don't get to the other part

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:18.680 align:middle line:90%
that I really like.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.250 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: Well, I grew up
in the '50s and the '60s

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.540 align:middle line:90%
in New York, Brooklyn.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.980 align:middle line:84%
My father, he was one
of those many people

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.200 align:middle line:84%
that grew up during the
Depression, my father

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.650 align:middle line:90%
and mother.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.770 align:middle line:84%
He started working
at the age of eight,

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.050 align:middle line:84%
before school, 4:00
in the morning,

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.000 align:middle line:90%
making bakery deliveries.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.280 align:middle line:84%
After school, he would
work another full time job.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And by the time he
was, I think, 12 or 13,

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.940 align:middle line:84%
he left school altogether
and worked full time,

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.390 align:middle line:90%
seven days a week.

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:49.760 align:middle line:90%
This is during the Depression.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.330 align:middle line:90%
So that period for me is alive.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.980 align:middle line:84%
I understand some
of what happened

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.550 align:middle line:84%
during that period through
what my parents went through.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.000 align:middle line:84%
My father, at the age of 35,
had his first heart attack

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.090 align:middle line:84%
because of all the work we
believe that he went through.

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And he died in my
arms at the age of 49.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.460 align:middle line:84%
I was 18, he was 49, after
his ninth heart attack.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Ninth
heart attack, wow.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.680 align:middle line:84%
That's a lot of game
that would create that.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: And so my
family were always

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.500 align:middle line:84%
looking at these problems
around money, and health care,

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.540 align:middle line:90%
and all of these issues.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.630 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I grew up with.

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.170 align:middle line:90%
And it had an impact on me.

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:28.070 align:middle line:90%
And yes--

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going to say
tell what happened when you

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.860 align:middle line:84%
were eight years
old, though, when--

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.235 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: Well,
my father-- yeah,

00:05:32.235 --> 00:05:35.600 align:middle line:84%
after his first heart attack, he
came home after several months

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.470 align:middle line:90%
at the hospital.

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.430 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if
I said this overtly

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.050 align:middle line:84%
or it was something
I said to myself

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.660 align:middle line:84%
but I knew that there
was a connection

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.870 align:middle line:84%
between the Depression,
my father's health care,

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.380 align:middle line:90%
and what went on with him.

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And I remember,
it's only recently

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.110 align:middle line:84%
after the book was
completed that I remembered

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.590 align:middle line:84%
making this promise to
myself that somehow I

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.370 align:middle line:84%
would try to do something about
this money thing that was going

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.500 align:middle line:84%
on, not just for my
father and my mother,

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.620 align:middle line:84%
but for many of the people
that I grew up with.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.385 align:middle line:84%
We all had these
issues around money.

00:06:08.385 --> 00:06:10.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
were eight years old.

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.940 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: I was eight years old.

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.857 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was the
planting of a seed that

00:06:12.857 --> 00:06:15.705 align:middle line:84%
would become what someone
called darimar or life path.

00:06:15.705 --> 00:06:17.330 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: Looking
back, I'd have to say

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.420 align:middle line:84%
that that is exactly what
happened my whole life now

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.270 align:middle line:84%
that I can look back at it,
so much of what happened,

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.350 align:middle line:84%
there's a rhythm to it, there's
a kind of tapestry to it

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:32.210 align:middle line:84%
all that I simply did not
understand until recently.

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.430 align:middle line:84%
I was writing this
book for years

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.680 align:middle line:84%
and asking myself
how it was that I

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.430 align:middle line:84%
came to write with Bernard
on a subject like this.

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.150 align:middle line:84%
Because money for me was always
a sense of confusion as well.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:45.860 align:middle line:90%
I never quite understood it.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.630 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I tried to
stay away from it

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.560 align:middle line:84%
because it would seem like such
a large huge issue that was

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.230 align:middle line:90%
beyond anybody's comprehension.

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.600 align:middle line:84%
But over the years,
I met several people

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.730 align:middle line:84%
that pointed me
in directions that

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:02.000 align:middle line:84%
allowed me to see kind
of beneath the cover what

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.390 align:middle line:90%
was going on.

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, the foremost
of those was Bernard.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, well,
let's go back a little bit

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:10.250 align:middle line:84%
into childhood
because you grew up

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:14.930 align:middle line:84%
in a neighborhood that was what
most would consider very rough.

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:17.000 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of
poverty, but there

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.190 align:middle line:90%
were some pockets of wealth.

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.760 align:middle line:84%
It happened to be
amongst the mob that was

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.530 align:middle line:90%
a big part of your community.

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:26.790 align:middle line:84%
The Italian mob was very
present there and others.

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:27.590 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: Yeah.

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:29.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when we
were talking off camera,

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:33.900 align:middle line:84%
you shared something with me
that I thought was fascinating.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.650 align:middle line:84%
We all have our idea
through Hollywood,

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:39.830 align:middle line:84%
and novels, Mario Puzo, and
so forth, what the mob is.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And I think even
through that, we

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:43.310 align:middle line:84%
get these reflections
of loyalty.

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:45.680 align:middle line:84%
But you say it extended
even beyond that

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:46.760 align:middle line:90%
in your neighborhood.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.200 align:middle line:84%
When people were in
trouble and needed help,

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.008 align:middle line:84%
the help came from
them oftentimes.

00:07:51.008 --> 00:07:52.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: Oftentimes,
I mean, it came

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:54.050 align:middle line:90%
from many different directions.

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:58.050 align:middle line:84%
There was-- I must say that
going back to that period

00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:59.840 align:middle line:84%
and especially in
Brooklyn at that time,

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.410 align:middle line:84%
there seemed to be
a community sense.

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:04.990 align:middle line:90%
We took care of one another.

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:06.740 align:middle line:84%
The neighborhood took
care of one another.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:08.720 align:middle line:84%
When children,
myself included, when

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.630 align:middle line:84%
we'd misbehave on the streets,
it didn't matter who it was.

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:12.980 align:middle line:90%
They were all of our--

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.120 align:middle line:84%
all these people in
neighborhood were our parents.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.143 align:middle line:84%
And we get whacked on the
back of the head by anybody.

00:08:18.143 --> 00:08:20.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But when your
family was in trouble,

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.220 align:middle line:84%
someone came around,
someone of wealth

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.532 align:middle line:84%
and position came around and
handed you a wad of money.

00:08:24.532 --> 00:08:25.490 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: That's right.

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:26.290 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:30.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know, again, I don't
want to glorify that help--

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:32.039 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, I understand.

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:35.755 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: But on another level,
again, we all knew each other.

00:08:35.755 --> 00:08:37.130 align:middle line:84%
You know, everybody
was connected

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:38.820 align:middle line:90%
in one way or another.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And when people were in
trouble, others came.

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.960 align:middle line:84%
Those they could, came
about and gave help,

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.190 align:middle line:84%
gave assistance
to the rest of us.

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:50.390 align:middle line:84%
And I remember, my father had
just had a second heart attack

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:54.650 align:middle line:84%
and news spread, and one
of the tough guys from

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:58.940 align:middle line:84%
the neighborhood saw me sitting
in front of my house one day,

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.550 align:middle line:84%
he just came over and he
just hands me a little paper

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:04.240 align:middle line:84%
envelope-- actually,
a paper bag--

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.150 align:middle line:84%
and it had a lot bills and he
said, take care of your family.

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:09.710 align:middle line:90%
And I've never forgotten that.

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:10.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:14.288 align:middle line:84%
Because that-- the reason I
wanted you to bring it up,

00:09:14.288 --> 00:09:16.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm not trying to glorify
the cause of this or anything

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:17.380 align:middle line:90%
either.

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:19.400 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm saying
is, from all quarters,

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.140 align:middle line:90%
people took care of each other.

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:23.052 align:middle line:84%
And money, you began
to understand money

00:09:23.052 --> 00:09:25.010 align:middle line:84%
in a very different way
than most people would,

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:26.913 align:middle line:84%
because in your
average neighborhood,

00:09:26.913 --> 00:09:29.330 align:middle line:84%
someone doesn't come around
with a paper bag full of money

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.640 align:middle line:84%
and help you when your
family's in trouble.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.170 align:middle line:84%
So you were starting
to see glimpses

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:37.620 align:middle line:84%
into money and the underside of
money then even from that age.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:38.420 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: I did.

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:40.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so many of the
activities that took place back

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:41.690 align:middle line:90%
then--

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:44.552 align:middle line:84%
look, most of the people
there were hardworking, lower

00:09:44.552 --> 00:09:46.010 align:middle line:84%
and middle class,
we're poor people

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:49.160 align:middle line:84%
but working through the
system to make a better

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.540 align:middle line:90%
life for themselves.

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And most of the kids, they went
on to high school, college,

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.550 align:middle line:90%
and beyond that.

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:59.027 align:middle line:84%
Very many successful people
from that neighborhood.

00:09:59.027 --> 00:10:00.860 align:middle line:84%
But there was another
element to it as well.

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:03.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we were all
becoming somewhat aware

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:08.360 align:middle line:84%
that the system, the global
system, or the national system

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.200 align:middle line:90%
was a hard system.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.670 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't working for everybody.

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:13.220 align:middle line:84%
You had to really work
hard, and most people did,

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:16.670 align:middle line:84%
but we all look to those
that have the money

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:18.160 align:middle line:90%
and have made success.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.910 align:middle line:84%
And some of the people
who were successful

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:25.430 align:middle line:84%
were doing things that
we're not completely legal.

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And I got to see the underside,
the underbelly of what

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.810 align:middle line:90%
money was like, and what was--

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:37.520 align:middle line:84%
how it worked within our area,
and also on a national level

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.230 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of
these people went on

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:42.390 align:middle line:84%
to work on a very
successful national level--

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:43.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Some large projects.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: --some large projects
and a number of the people

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:51.270 align:middle line:84%
that I knew, they were working
to develop Atlantic City.

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:52.130 align:middle line:90%
And I watched this.

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:56.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I watched people working
hard making minimal money,

00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:59.840 align:middle line:84%
people breaking this system
and actually some of them

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.370 align:middle line:90%
doing quite well.

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:02.960 align:middle line:90%
And it gave mixed messages.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:06.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, what
did that teach you?

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: What most of what my
early experiences around money

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:14.990 align:middle line:84%
taught me was that it
wasn't as well constructed

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:16.580 align:middle line:90%
as people were telling us.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:19.580 align:middle line:84%
We were being told, you work
hard, you do this, you do that,

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:22.280 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to make
a success of your life.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.200 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, I
saw so many people

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.210 align:middle line:84%
breaking the rules
of the system,

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:28.430 align:middle line:90%
doing far better than others.

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:33.230 align:middle line:84%
And what it allowed me
to start feeling into

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:36.350 align:middle line:84%
was the sense that
these systems--

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:38.690 align:middle line:84%
be it the monetary system,
the economic system,

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:39.840 align:middle line:90%
other systems--

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:43.460 align:middle line:84%
were not as clearly well-defined
and just not as well-thought

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:47.690 align:middle line:84%
out as the propaganda
around that suggested.

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:51.920 align:middle line:84%
That there were many instances
where these systems did not

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.080 align:middle line:90%
really fulfill their promise.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:58.850 align:middle line:84%
And as we now know, you
know, 50, 60 years later,

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:02.160 align:middle line:84%
there's so many holes
within that framework.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The system seems
to be dying and it's just--

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:05.577 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: Well, in a sense--

00:12:05.577 --> 00:12:06.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --collapsing.

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:09.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: --collapsing in a
sense, but in another way,

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.470 align:middle line:84%
you know, I see
it also as a gift.

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And the gift being that
we're being revealed

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:16.700 align:middle line:84%
in a very dramatic
way, but we're

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:20.660 align:middle line:84%
being revealed the
inconsistencies and the things

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:23.630 align:middle line:90%
that we need to attend to now.

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:26.630 align:middle line:84%
People are up in arms
about the industrial model

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:29.270 align:middle line:84%
and our monetary system,
but we should also

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:33.073 align:middle line:84%
keep in mind that
with all of its faults

00:12:33.073 --> 00:12:34.490 align:middle line:84%
or whatever you
want to refer that

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:38.000 align:middle line:84%
to as, with all of the things
that we need to address,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.430 align:middle line:84%
it's also served
us in many ways.

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And so what I'd like to see is
a mature conversation about what

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:49.430 align:middle line:84%
it is that we want to hold
on to as we move forward

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:53.210 align:middle line:84%
and include and transcend
our current model by bringing

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:56.990 align:middle line:84%
in other tools that will
allow us to address what needs

00:12:56.990 --> 00:13:00.830 align:middle line:84%
to happen in our
postmodern journey,

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:05.660 align:middle line:84%
but also to hold on to what
it is that actually does work

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.248 align:middle line:90%
in the age we're coming out of.

00:13:07.248 --> 00:13:09.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And mature
conversations are beginning.

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, your
book should span

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:14.160 align:middle line:84%
a lot of more
mature conversations

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:14.960 align:middle line:90%
around the subject.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:15.760 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: I hope.

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And one
of the things, as I

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:19.250 align:middle line:84%
was reading this
book, that struck me

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:22.130 align:middle line:84%
which you do a brilliant job
of going back historically--

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:25.610 align:middle line:84%
but you also get into some very
spiritual components of what

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:26.870 align:middle line:90%
money is all about.

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:29.630 align:middle line:84%
You get into masculine
and feminine principles

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:32.420 align:middle line:84%
of money and where
we took a wrong turn.

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:36.050 align:middle line:84%
And so I would like
to go ahead and launch

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:39.710 align:middle line:84%
into some of the historical
perspective of societies that

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:41.720 align:middle line:84%
were working very
well because they

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.910 align:middle line:84%
were using a number of
tools, not just one tool.

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:45.710 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: Yes.

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:47.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you do talk
about this in your book.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.050 align:middle line:90%
It's quite cute.

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:50.960 align:middle line:84%
You have a community called
Hammer Ville and a community

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:54.230 align:middle line:84%
called Money Ville that are
parallel to each other which

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:57.620 align:middle line:84%
is how do you construct
an entire community

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:00.770 align:middle line:84%
and everything that it stands
for and offers the people

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:02.780 align:middle line:90%
with only one tool, a hammer.

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying
likewise, how do

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:07.640 align:middle line:84%
you construct a
culture, global cultures

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.760 align:middle line:84%
around the world
with one tool which

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:12.450 align:middle line:90%
is using a national currency.

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:14.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: In fact, our
national currencies--

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:17.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we tend to think of
the common way of thinking

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:20.990 align:middle line:84%
about it as we have a yen, we
have dollar, we have the euro,

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:24.050 align:middle line:84%
we have other types of
currencies from each nation.

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And we tend to think of
them as different tools,

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.170 align:middle line:90%
but they're not.

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:30.140 align:middle line:84%
They're all banked at
fiat-based, interest-bearing

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:31.190 align:middle line:90%
currencies.

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:34.230 align:middle line:84%
And they all function
in a very similar way.

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And so what we have
is a virtual monopoly

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:39.650 align:middle line:84%
of the use of these
one type of currencies,

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:41.090 align:middle line:84%
the national
currencies, and they

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:43.830 align:middle line:84%
are the monetary
equivalent of a hammer.

00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:44.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:47.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: And what is really
not appreciated today,

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:49.640 align:middle line:84%
and actually not known
by many people today,

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:53.210 align:middle line:84%
is that we actually have a
full assortment of tools,

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:56.160 align:middle line:84%
monetary tools that
are available to us.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.580 align:middle line:84%
We have the equivalent
of monetary paint brushes

00:14:58.580 --> 00:14:59.750 align:middle line:90%
and screwdrivers.

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:02.480 align:middle line:84%
We have all these other
tools, and we're not

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:05.720 align:middle line:84%
using them because we're
simply unaware of that.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And with this full assortment
of a monetary tool box,

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.495 align:middle line:90%
so much more is possible.

00:15:12.495 --> 00:15:13.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:16.220 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, when you're
dealing with essentially fiat

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:19.630 align:middle line:84%
currencies globally, then you're
open to a lot of manipulation.

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:21.090 align:middle line:84%
Since it's all
there to begin with,

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:22.780 align:middle line:84%
it can be manipulated
as we're watching.

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:23.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: Yes.

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:26.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're watching that
on the stock market, globally.

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:29.130 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing this
with certainly metals,

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:32.070 align:middle line:84%
you know, the fixing of prices
on some of the precious metals

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:33.170 align:middle line:90%
and other commodities.

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:33.570 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: Yes.

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:34.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it can
all be done essentially

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:37.440 align:middle line:84%
because we have fiat currencies
at the base of everything,

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.370 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:39.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: Well,
that's what our--

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:40.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: These are real--

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:41.868 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: Yes, I
mean, the research

00:15:41.868 --> 00:15:45.420 align:middle line:84%
shows us that it's
actually most of the issues

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:48.180 align:middle line:84%
that we're dealing with today
in our world, many of which

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:52.410 align:middle line:84%
don't appear to be linked to
money in any particular way,

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:57.210 align:middle line:84%
are in fact all linked
to this virtual monopoly

00:15:57.210 --> 00:16:00.690 align:middle line:84%
of national currencies,
the use of one hammer,

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:04.710 align:middle line:84%
one type of tool when
most of the problems

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:08.310 align:middle line:84%
can be so quickly
alleviated by making use

00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:09.870 align:middle line:90%
of these other monetary tools.

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:12.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We have people
starving all over the planet,

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:14.640 align:middle line:84%
people who don't have
access to electricity,

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.080 align:middle line:84%
almost a majority of the
people on the planet.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And yet, as you say, these tools
not only are available to us

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:23.790 align:middle line:84%
now if we choose to
employ them, but they've

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:26.220 align:middle line:90%
been there historically.

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:29.370 align:middle line:90%
And let's go back into--

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:31.770 align:middle line:84%
are you comfortable maybe
going back into Egyptian times

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:35.330 align:middle line:84%
because, here, we have
this historical perspective

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:38.140 align:middle line:84%
of the lives of the
average person in Egypt,

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:39.630 align:middle line:84%
which is you are
probably a slave,

00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:42.640 align:middle line:84%
pulling something over your
back, starving to death.

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
notion of what life

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:45.810 align:middle line:90%
was like in Egyptian times.

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:49.440 align:middle line:84%
When in fact, it's appearing
with one small exception which

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:51.630 align:middle line:84%
we kind of, we don't
need to go into.

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:53.040 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't the case at all.

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:53.728 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: No, it was not.

00:16:53.728 --> 00:16:54.020 align:middle line:90%
In fact, in many ways--

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:55.395 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about it.

00:16:55.395 --> 00:16:57.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: --in many ways,
the ancient Egyptians,

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.715 align:middle line:90%
dynastic Egypt from--

00:16:59.715 --> 00:17:01.007 align:middle line:90%
we don't know the exact dates--

00:17:01.007 --> 00:17:01.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The middle kingdoms.

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:04.470 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: But yeah, the middle
kingdom anywhere from 1500

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:08.550 align:middle line:84%
BC to a specific
date, which is 30 AD,

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:10.890 align:middle line:84%
and I'll go into
what that was about.

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:15.150 align:middle line:84%
But for the better
part of 2,000 years,

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:19.890 align:middle line:84%
Egypt had the most enviable
economy of the ancient world

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:21.390 align:middle line:90%
as far as we know.

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:26.490 align:middle line:84%
The average person
lived, well, let's say

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:30.630 align:middle line:84%
they lived as well, if not
better, than as we lived today.

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:32.370 align:middle line:84%
They had three to
four meals every day

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:35.460 align:middle line:84%
from what we can tell, that
these construction workers

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:38.350 align:middle line:84%
that were building some of
the great works of the period.

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:39.780 align:middle line:84%
Most of them were
not slaves, they

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:42.010 align:middle line:90%
were actually very well-paid.

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:46.000 align:middle line:84%
We have archeological evidence
that at least in some cases,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.050 align:middle line:84%
there was brain surgery,
eye surgery for the workers.

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:50.640 align:middle line:84%
There were three to
four meals a day.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:53.850 align:middle line:84%
They lived in extraordinary
circumstances.

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:56.250 align:middle line:84%
They worked anywhere
from three to four days

00:17:56.250 --> 00:18:01.920 align:middle line:84%
a week, in some cases, and
had plenty of holidays.

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.580 align:middle line:84%
We don't know about
the slavery issue.

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:06.300 align:middle line:84%
We know that in earlier times,
there were cases of slavery.

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:09.240 align:middle line:84%
But during the period that we're
looking at, most of the workers

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:13.830 align:middle line:84%
were highly paid and the
economy worked in such a way

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:16.410 align:middle line:84%
that from what we
can tell, there

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:19.380 align:middle line:84%
was very little evidence
of any poverty whatsoever.

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:21.630 align:middle line:84%
Most of the people were
either middle class

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:24.330 align:middle line:90%
or high class, upper class.

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:29.250 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing
happened in a period that's

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:31.770 align:middle line:84%
just now beginning
to be understood,

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:35.010 align:middle line:84%
and it was a period of 250
years in the central Middle

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:38.297 align:middle line:84%
Ages, where exactly the
same thing happened,

00:18:38.297 --> 00:18:40.630 align:middle line:84%
where the people were getting
three to four meals a day.

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:44.495 align:middle line:84%
They, in some cases, had
150 days of holidays a year.

00:18:44.495 --> 00:18:45.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know,
that's amazing.

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:47.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: And then
in one case, we

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:51.420 align:middle line:84%
have written records that when
the lords of a certain region

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.270 align:middle line:84%
in Western France were trying
to get the workers to work

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:56.980 align:middle line:84%
eight hours a day and five
days a week, they revolted.

00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:57.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:58.430 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: We're not doing that.

00:18:58.430 --> 00:18:59.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They were like, we're
not going be on a six-hour work

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:00.940 align:middle line:90%
day.

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:03.000 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: You know,
here we are today,

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.820 align:middle line:84%
several thousand years later or
in the case of central Middle

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:10.230 align:middle line:84%
Ages, 1,000 years later,
and we can't figure out

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:13.344 align:middle line:84%
how to employ people when you
had nearly full employment.

00:19:13.344 --> 00:19:15.427 align:middle line:84%
Not only full employment
during the central Middle

00:19:15.427 --> 00:19:17.170 align:middle line:90%
Ages, 1,000 years earlier.

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:17.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:19.470 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: But people
actually didn't even

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:21.345 align:middle line:84%
know what to do with
themselves after a while

00:19:21.345 --> 00:19:24.120 align:middle line:84%
and they started getting
involved in these public work

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:26.105 align:middle line:90%
projects.

00:19:26.105 --> 00:19:27.480 align:middle line:84%
Not because they
needed the work,

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.790 align:middle line:84%
because it was an
expression of who they were

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:32.597 align:middle line:84%
and the consciousness
of the time.

00:19:32.597 --> 00:19:34.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And if we go
back for a moment because I

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.600 align:middle line:84%
want to go into some
detail on that era.

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.480 align:middle line:84%
If we go back into
Egypt, they even had,

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:41.850 align:middle line:84%
very similarly to what
you were just saying,

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:43.530 align:middle line:90%
there was enough abundance.

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And you can see by
the artifacts even

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:47.530 align:middle line:84%
if you go to the various
Egyptian exhibits

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:50.010 align:middle line:84%
at the British Museum,
the Louvre, and so forth

00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:52.482 align:middle line:84%
and the traveling
exhibits that they had--

00:19:52.482 --> 00:19:53.940 align:middle line:84%
there was, well,
certainly, this is

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:56.760 align:middle line:84%
more of representing the royals,
but nonetheless, the quality

00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:00.180 align:middle line:84%
of life and workmanship and
artistry and parlor games

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:02.965 align:middle line:84%
and everything were very highly
developed during this time.

00:20:02.965 --> 00:20:04.173 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: It's extraordinary.

00:20:04.173 --> 00:20:07.742 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so they had
the first foreign aid.

00:20:07.742 --> 00:20:08.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: That's right.

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:10.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They offered
the first foreign aid

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:12.208 align:middle line:90%
regarding their crops and such.

00:20:12.208 --> 00:20:13.750 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
that a little bit?

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:14.550 align:middle line:90%
I never--

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:17.133 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: We don't know a great
deal about it but we know that

00:20:17.133 --> 00:20:19.905 align:middle line:84%
there was, as you say, there was
such abundance in that country

00:20:19.905 --> 00:20:24.580 align:middle line:84%
that they started
thinking in ways that--

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:25.810 align:middle line:90%
how do we help others?

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:28.690 align:middle line:84%
Because their needs were
met, the requirements

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:30.520 align:middle line:90%
of that society were met.

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And what we came to
understand was, you know,

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:38.140 align:middle line:84%
a lot of theory back in the
19th century scholarship

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:43.600 align:middle line:84%
assumed that the economy
of Egypt at that period

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.910 align:middle line:90%
was due to the gift of the Nile.

00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:49.570 align:middle line:84%
This fertile valley that
ran along the Nile River.

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And that that was the reason for
their extraordinary abundance.

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:54.580 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:57.233 align:middle line:90%
Many areas of the world had--

00:20:57.233 --> 00:20:58.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Equal, yeah.

00:20:58.150 --> 00:20:59.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: Equal
or, if not, better.

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:03.490 align:middle line:84%
What we've come to discover was
that they had a dual currency

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:07.630 align:middle line:84%
system, both in ancient Egypt
and in the central Middle Ages.

00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:10.990 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, many different
flourishing economies

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:13.285 align:middle line:90%
had this dual currency system.

00:21:13.285 --> 00:21:14.410 align:middle line:90%
And if I can go into that--

00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:16.868 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Go into that and then
if you would also take that

00:21:16.868 --> 00:21:18.550 align:middle line:84%
into the notion of
demurrage, because I

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:20.380 align:middle line:90%
found that fascinating.

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:23.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: So today, we have
these national currencies.

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:25.990 align:middle line:84%
They had something equivalent
to a national currency

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:27.610 align:middle line:90%
back then as well.

00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:28.522 align:middle line:90%
And they were used--

00:21:28.522 --> 00:21:30.730 align:middle line:84%
these national currencies
back then or the equivalent

00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:31.530 align:middle line:90%
thereof--

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:37.090 align:middle line:84%
were used mostly for foreign
trade and for luxury items.

00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:39.610 align:middle line:84%
They actually had a disdain
for the use of gold.

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:41.410 align:middle line:84%
They would laugh
at other societies

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:43.030 align:middle line:84%
that were using gold
and accumulating

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:44.500 align:middle line:90%
wealth in that sense.

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:49.150 align:middle line:84%
For them money, was more a
way of exchanging energies,

00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:51.700 align:middle line:90%
talents, services, goods.

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:53.800 align:middle line:90%
And unique to both--

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:57.130 align:middle line:84%
not unique but a
particular feature

00:21:57.130 --> 00:21:59.620 align:middle line:84%
that went along with the
dual currency system,

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:02.140 align:middle line:84%
both in ancient
Egypt, dynastic Egypt,

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:04.330 align:middle line:84%
and in the central
Middle Ages, was

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:06.268 align:middle line:84%
the use of a particular
type of money.

00:22:06.268 --> 00:22:07.810 align:middle line:84%
And remember earlier,
I was referring

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:09.580 align:middle line:90%
to a monetary paintbrush.

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:12.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is the
equivalent thereof.

00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:14.230 align:middle line:84%
Today, we have these
national currencies

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:16.690 align:middle line:90%
with positive interest rates.

00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:19.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, back then, the
local currencies actually

00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:21.250 align:middle line:90%
had a negative interest rate.

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:23.800 align:middle line:90%
Something we call a demurrage.

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.270 align:middle line:90%
It's like a parking fee.

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:28.030 align:middle line:84%
The longer you hold
onto a currency,

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:30.950 align:middle line:84%
the more you have to
pay on that currency.

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:33.943 align:middle line:84%
So what the incentive was,
was to use that currencies

00:22:33.943 --> 00:22:35.110 align:middle line:90%
immediately when you had it.

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:38.080 align:middle line:84%
Like a hot potato,
you want to use that.

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.140 align:middle line:84%
And what that did was
create a velocity--

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:40.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:42.950 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: --of exchange.

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:47.290 align:middle line:84%
And so somebody who is wealthy
had this demurrage currency,

00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:49.820 align:middle line:84%
they'd use it, then
they'd get rid of it.

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And in the getting rid of
it, it would filter down

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:54.550 align:middle line:84%
to other levels of
society and everybody

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:55.950 align:middle line:84%
was interchanging,
interchanging,

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:57.250 align:middle line:90%
and interchanging.

00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:59.920 align:middle line:84%
Sooner or later, most
of their basic needs

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:03.410 align:middle line:84%
and some of the other needs
that they had were met.

00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:05.770 align:middle line:84%
And so you'd have
this exchange going on

00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:08.200 align:middle line:84%
instead of today's
scarcity of money,

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.450 align:middle line:84%
and then taking that
scarce money model,

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:12.820 align:middle line:84%
and then hoarding it or
putting it into the bank

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:14.830 align:middle line:84%
and taking it out
of circulation.

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:16.840 align:middle line:90%
They instead had a continuation.

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:19.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It makes
perfect sense.

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:21.070 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that how it
should be used?

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:23.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, we'll get into
that in a bit, but--

00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:24.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: Well, I
would say quickly

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:28.660 align:middle line:90%
that there's many uses of money.

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:34.690 align:middle line:84%
The extraordinary thing here
is that because of our times,

00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:37.330 align:middle line:84%
we're used to using money in
one particular way and one

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:38.740 align:middle line:90%
type of money.

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And when you begin to realize
what money can actually do

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:47.260 align:middle line:84%
and how many different varieties
of money are available to us

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:51.020 align:middle line:84%
and they could be architected
for specific purposes

00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:53.950 align:middle line:84%
so that we could have
money to use specifically

00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:56.650 align:middle line:90%
for social issues.

00:23:56.650 --> 00:23:59.110 align:middle line:84%
We can have money to
take care of health care

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:01.680 align:middle line:84%
that's designed specifically
for one type of health

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:03.640 align:middle line:90%
care or another, for education.

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:05.640 align:middle line:84%
For most of the
needs that we have,

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:10.150 align:middle line:84%
we could design tools, monetary
tools that are specifically

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:13.630 align:middle line:84%
designed to help us
address a specific issue.

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:19.510 align:middle line:84%
Instead, what we have is this
200 or 300-year model which

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:22.330 align:middle line:90%
was an extraordinary invention.

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:26.230 align:middle line:84%
This industrial age money
that we're using today

00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:29.800 align:middle line:84%
was actually one of the,
if not the, major tools

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:33.740 align:middle line:84%
that allowed the industrial
age to come into being.

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:35.590 align:middle line:84%
So the monies that
we're using today

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:39.490 align:middle line:84%
were specifically designed
to create industrialization.

00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:42.070 align:middle line:84%
They were designed for
the burgeoning nation

00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:43.690 align:middle line:84%
states that were
coming into being

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:45.520 align:middle line:90%
several hundred years ago.

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.480 align:middle line:84%
So that money
serves that purpose.

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:49.780 align:middle line:84%
There are wonderful
commercial currency,

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:51.790 align:middle line:84%
but there are
commercial currency.

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And their specific
use was for those type

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:58.610 align:middle line:84%
of activities that would help
us to become industrialized.

00:24:58.610 --> 00:24:59.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:01.285 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: But they're
not designed very well,

00:25:01.285 --> 00:25:04.997 align:middle line:84%
and there's much better designs
for education, for other needs.

00:25:04.997 --> 00:25:07.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that was to
help us trade with each other.

00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:07.990 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: Correct.

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:09.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Move
beyond our borders.

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:11.552 align:middle line:84%
Not to take care of us on a
day-to-day bread and butter

00:25:11.552 --> 00:25:12.730 align:middle line:90%
basis per se.

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:12.805 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: No.

00:25:12.805 --> 00:25:14.347 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
limited understanding

00:25:14.347 --> 00:25:15.790 align:middle line:84%
of what money was
at that period,

00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:18.370 align:middle line:84%
and they did the best they
could to design a currency.

00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:21.410 align:middle line:84%
They had no idea at the
these national currencies

00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:22.730 align:middle line:90%
were coming into being.

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:28.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it came into being in
basically late 1600s in England

00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:31.100 align:middle line:84%
and then it spread
around the world.

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:33.680 align:middle line:84%
And we had no idea
back then that it

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:37.920 align:middle line:84%
would become the currency
for all of humanity,

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:40.490 align:middle line:84%
and that we'd have this
global financial system where

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:42.543 align:middle line:90%
we're using just these hammers.

00:25:42.543 --> 00:25:43.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The hammers.

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:44.460 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: These hammers.

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:47.427 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's
get to the Middle Ages,

00:25:47.427 --> 00:25:49.760 align:middle line:84%
back to the central Middle
Ages we're talking about just

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:51.710 align:middle line:90%
for a moment earlier.

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:54.950 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I found
so fascinating in your book

00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:59.030 align:middle line:84%
is, this was just an example
of the prosperity at the time,

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:01.520 align:middle line:84%
and it seems that you can
look to historical artifacts

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:05.960 align:middle line:84%
such as skeletal remains to
determine the size of people,

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:07.430 align:middle line:84%
for example, which
would indicate

00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:09.350 align:middle line:90%
the caloric intake of the day.

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:11.580 align:middle line:84%
To a large extent, there
may be other factors,

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:13.610 align:middle line:90%
but to a large extent.

00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And the book is talking about
how the women in England--

00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:19.730 align:middle line:90%
it was in England, right?

00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:20.530 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: Yes.

00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Were 7
centimeters taller

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:25.590 align:middle line:84%
than the women of
Victorian England,

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:28.520 align:middle line:84%
which was a good
700 years later.

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:29.750 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: Yes.

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:32.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it took
until, as I recall,

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:36.110 align:middle line:84%
1998 before the women
of today caught up

00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:39.680 align:middle line:84%
in size with these women
from medieval times.

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:43.150 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: Well, this is for
me, you know, Bernard and I--

00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:44.870 align:middle line:84%
I'll speak for
myself, but I'd say

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:47.120 align:middle line:90%
we're both these alpha males.

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And when I got involved in this
monetary discovery or journey,

00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:54.800 align:middle line:90%
I was floored by the fact--

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:56.720 align:middle line:84%
I was always, I mean,
most of my life,

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:59.570 align:middle line:84%
I've been looking for that
web of interconnection.

00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:01.130 align:middle line:84%
How one thing is
related to another

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:03.990 align:middle line:84%
linked to another, how
all of it comes together.

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And I always thought
that if there

00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:08.960 align:middle line:84%
were a point where this
mega aha would happen,

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:12.860 align:middle line:84%
that there'd be a linkage
between one component of who

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:14.150 align:middle line:90%
we are and another.

00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:17.760 align:middle line:84%
The money, actually, led
to so many discoveries.

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:21.270 align:middle line:84%
Most important that I think,
the fact that money is not value

00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:22.070 align:middle line:90%
neutral.

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:27.600 align:middle line:84%
It has such an extraordinary
connection to who we are,

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.590 align:middle line:90%
our world view.

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And what's most
interesting to me

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:34.280 align:middle line:84%
about both dynastic Egypt
and the central Middle Ages,

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:38.600 align:middle line:84%
these were two periods in
which the feminine, the yin

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:43.760 align:middle line:84%
principle, was honored at
such a high degree as compared

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:46.610 align:middle line:84%
to both other societies
of their time,

00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:49.830 align:middle line:84%
and historically, its
other periods of history.

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:52.850 align:middle line:84%
So in the central Middle Ages--
let's concentrate on that--

00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:56.660 align:middle line:84%
there was this flourishing of
the feminine at that period.

00:27:56.660 --> 00:28:02.420 align:middle line:84%
Most of the early understandings
of what we now call feminism

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:05.270 align:middle line:84%
actually had its place
both in dynastic Egypt

00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:06.920 align:middle line:90%
and in the central Middle Ages.

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:09.800 align:middle line:84%
The women, in particular,
were honored at a level

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:12.340 align:middle line:84%
that we haven't seen
since that period.

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:14.650 align:middle line:84%
We're beginning to
catch up to that today.

00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:16.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They
own property, they

00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:19.130 align:middle line:84%
participated in many and
hundreds of different career

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:19.930 align:middle line:90%
opportunities.

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:20.888 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: That's right.

00:28:20.888 --> 00:28:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And in ancient and dynastic
Egypt, even a few of the women

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:25.370 align:middle line:90%
were pharaohs.

00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:28.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and even
in a religious sense,

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:29.720 align:middle line:90%
I believe it was in France--

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:29.820 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: That's right.

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:30.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --we would go to
the abbess for your blessing.

00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:31.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: That's right,
where the women were--

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:32.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --blessing
of the abbot.

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:34.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: That's
right, and the women

00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:35.218 align:middle line:90%
were in charge of the abbess.

00:28:35.218 --> 00:28:37.020 align:middle line:84%
The abbots actually
worked for the abbess.

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:37.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:40.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: So you have
so much happening.

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:43.130 align:middle line:84%
You had women working in
most of the professions.

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:46.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is wasn't
true, you know, globally

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:47.600 align:middle line:90%
throughout all of Europe.

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:50.090 align:middle line:84%
But in Western Europe and
in the areas we studied,

00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:51.890 align:middle line:90%
it certainly was the case.

00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And the bodily remains,
they were doing excavations

00:28:55.910 --> 00:28:58.670 align:middle line:90%
for a railroad system in London.

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:01.660 align:middle line:84%
I forget exactly what year
was, in the '70s, I believe.

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:04.220 align:middle line:84%
And they came across
this ancient graveyard

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:06.890 align:middle line:84%
and they started
studying the remains.

00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:10.730 align:middle line:84%
And there was that these
women of that period, the men

00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:13.580 align:middle line:84%
and the women, of
that period were

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:18.080 align:middle line:84%
taller than any other period
that we know of up until 1998.

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:22.250 align:middle line:84%
We've just caught up
to their stature today.

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:24.733 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you say 3,000
calories a day in the book is

00:29:24.733 --> 00:29:26.650 align:middle line:84%
what they were consuming,
which was probably--

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:27.450 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: Minimum.

00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:29.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, minimum.

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:30.642 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot of food.

00:29:30.642 --> 00:29:31.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: It's a lot of food.

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:33.892 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That means
there's a lot of production.

00:29:33.892 --> 00:29:36.020 align:middle line:84%
It means food was
abundant in all ways.

00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:39.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: Historians today
are beginning to understand,

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:41.930 align:middle line:84%
beginning to understand what
took place during that period.

00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:45.800 align:middle line:84%
But they're already calling
that period from about 1040,

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:50.120 align:middle line:84%
1050, to 1290 in Western
Europe the first renaissance.

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:52.280 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the first
true renaissance.

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:55.920 align:middle line:84%
Most of the universities
came into being

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:59.060 align:middle line:84%
of the university started coming
into being during that period,

00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:03.680 align:middle line:84%
a lot of extraordinary
technologies

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:05.480 align:middle line:84%
came into being
during that period.

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:08.690 align:middle line:84%
The wine production,
the food production,

00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:10.640 align:middle line:90%
so much was taking place.

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:13.030 align:middle line:84%
But we, up until
recently, thought

00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:16.880 align:middle line:84%
of that entire millennium,
the medieval millennium,

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:18.430 align:middle line:90%
as a dark period.

00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:22.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, this period, this 1040
to 1290, was anything but.

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And again, so much
around the feminine

00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:28.448 align:middle line:84%
was beginning to take
place during that period.

00:30:28.448 --> 00:30:29.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was
also being expressed

00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:31.910 align:middle line:90%
through architecture, artwork.

00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:33.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have
Notre Dame, Chartres--

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:34.595 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: Well--

00:30:34.595 --> 00:30:37.553 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --you have many,
many magnificent edifices that

00:30:37.553 --> 00:30:38.720 align:middle line:90%
were built during this time.

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And you say, this wasn't
because the church endowed it,

00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:42.813 align:middle line:90%
these were local projects.

00:30:42.813 --> 00:30:45.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: Most of the great
cathedrals of Western Europe--

00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:47.840 align:middle line:90%
Notre Dame, Chartres, others--

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:52.070 align:middle line:84%
came into being during this
period from 1040 to 1290,

00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:54.170 align:middle line:84%
and it was the greatest
period of construction

00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:55.970 align:middle line:90%
that we know of.

00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And these monuments
still stand today

00:30:57.830 --> 00:31:00.810 align:middle line:84%
as living testimony to
what can be accomplished.

00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And again, these churches,
these monasteries,

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:08.220 align:middle line:84%
they came into being but they
were created not by the church.

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:10.430 align:middle line:84%
They were created by the
local people and the way

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:12.980 align:middle line:84%
they paid for it was
mostly through the use

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:14.870 align:middle line:90%
of complementary currencies.

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:18.200 align:middle line:84%
And they were built
as community projects,

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:20.200 align:middle line:84%
and they were almost
competing with one another,

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:21.658 align:middle line:84%
actually competing
with one another

00:31:21.658 --> 00:31:24.230 align:middle line:84%
to build the best cathedral
they could and they

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:26.480 align:middle line:84%
were using these
local currencies to be

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:28.040 align:middle line:90%
able to accomplish that.

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And these projects went on for
generation after generation.

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And there were
testimony not just

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:37.010 align:middle line:84%
to the extraordinary
talents at that time,

00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:41.480 align:middle line:84%
but it was an enduring
testimony to the world view

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:44.030 align:middle line:84%
and what can be accomplished
by rethinking money

00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:48.920 align:middle line:84%
and also by having that
feminine principle in play.

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:51.650 align:middle line:84%
Many of the dual
currency systems

00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:54.680 align:middle line:84%
that we have in our world,
when we trace them back,

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:57.110 align:middle line:84%
they traced back
to these cultures

00:31:57.110 --> 00:32:01.370 align:middle line:84%
that actually honor the feminine
along with the masculine.

00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, the
dual currency system

00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:06.390 align:middle line:90%
was an expression of that.

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:09.360 align:middle line:84%
So here we are today,
1,000 years later,

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:11.990 align:middle line:84%
the feminine is
reemerging in our world.

00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:16.820 align:middle line:84%
And here we are again, thinking
about money in a different way.

00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
important to note

00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:21.920 align:middle line:84%
that most of the
ancient forms of money

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:24.020 align:middle line:84%
were directly linked
by those people,

00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:26.060 align:middle line:84%
by those cultures
to the feminine.

00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:28.850 align:middle line:84%
Actually, to the great
mother archetype.

00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:34.660 align:middle line:84%
The word money itself comes from
the Roman goddess Juno Moneta.

00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And it was actually physically
in her womb, in her monument,

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:40.940 align:middle line:84%
it was in the
basement of her place

00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:43.370 align:middle line:84%
that the money was
minted in Rome.

00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:45.330 align:middle line:90%
And it's not by accident.

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:47.030 align:middle line:84%
Most of the ancient
forms of money

00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:49.940 align:middle line:84%
were considered to be, I mean,
the great mother archetype

00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:52.400 align:middle line:84%
was about the nurturing
of her children,

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:55.670 align:middle line:84%
taking care of her children,
and taking care of the living

00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:57.170 align:middle line:90%
systems of this planet.

00:32:57.170 --> 00:33:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And money was seen back then
as an expression of her,

00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:05.000 align:middle line:84%
as a way for us to take
care of one another

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.720 align:middle line:84%
and take care of ourselves,
and to nurture ourselves.

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:12.560 align:middle line:84%
Money today is not
able to do that.

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:14.630 align:middle line:84%
Again, using one
hammer, we're not

00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:18.590 align:middle line:84%
able to address the myriad
issues facing our world,

00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:22.610 align:middle line:84%
the diversity of our
global economic system,

00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:25.250 align:middle line:84%
all the different players with
their different world views.

00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:28.850 align:middle line:84%
To have one money that's a
commercial currency taking

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:31.940 align:middle line:84%
care of all of that,
it's impossible.

00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:33.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It is, and
it's not working.

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:36.368 align:middle line:84%
And it's stopped
working back then too.

00:33:36.368 --> 00:33:38.660 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about what happened
because as you mentioned

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:40.970 align:middle line:84%
in your book, historically,
it's been thought

00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:44.120 align:middle line:84%
that all that prosperity and
productivity ended because

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:45.580 align:middle line:90%
of the Black Plague, right?

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:46.040 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: Yeah.

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:47.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you're saying
there was an intervening event

00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:48.680 align:middle line:90%
prior to that--

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:49.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: There was.

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:51.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that really
was what took it all down.

00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is where
some of the shadow darkness

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.930 align:middle line:84%
starts coming into the
whole subject of money

00:33:56.930 --> 00:33:59.150 align:middle line:90%
in more recent modern times.

00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:00.650 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:05.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: Well there was a
contraction in the late 1200s,

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:08.420 align:middle line:84%
in France in particular,
and in other areas.

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:12.409 align:middle line:84%
There started to become this
re-emergence of what I would

00:34:12.409 --> 00:34:14.960 align:middle line:90%
call an unhealthy patriarchy.

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And there was the
consolidation of power.

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:25.302 align:middle line:84%
Local lordships then got taken
over by regional king ships,

00:34:25.302 --> 00:34:27.260 align:middle line:84%
and there was a hierarchy
that came into being.

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And one of the first things
that the king of France

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:34.040 align:middle line:84%
did in the late 1200s
was that he nationalized

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:35.060 align:middle line:90%
these local currencies.

00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:36.650 align:middle line:84%
He actually got rid
of the demurrage

00:34:36.650 --> 00:34:39.719 align:middle line:84%
currencies to a large
extent, almost entirely.

00:34:39.719 --> 00:34:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And they instituted
what we have today.

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:45.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that type of
national currency system.

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:47.929 align:middle line:84%
And in getting rid of
these local currencies,

00:34:47.929 --> 00:34:53.210 align:middle line:84%
and again, with the repression
of the feminine taking place

00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:55.340 align:middle line:84%
also during that period,
they happened yet again--

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:57.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All in position,
that burned at the stake.

00:34:57.350 --> 00:34:58.892 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: But that
happened later on.

00:34:58.892 --> 00:35:00.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:02.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: What they did was,
first, they nationalized

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:05.240 align:middle line:84%
the currency, got rid
of the local currencies,

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:10.580 align:middle line:84%
then they also devalued the
money in a particular way

00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:16.160 align:middle line:84%
by making more units but less
of a gold-backing or less

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:18.260 align:middle line:90%
of a silver-backing or whatever.

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And so you had this
consolidation of money

00:35:20.410 --> 00:35:23.800 align:middle line:84%
and the loss of these
complementary currencies.

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And what happened
in 1290 was you

00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:29.920 align:middle line:84%
had your first kind of
depression take place in 250

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:32.680 align:middle line:84%
years with this change
of the money system

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:35.510 align:middle line:84%
to the equivalent of
what we have today.

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:38.650 align:middle line:84%
And it was about 40
or 50 years later,

00:35:38.650 --> 00:35:42.640 align:middle line:84%
after 40 or 50 years of
an economic depression,

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:45.258 align:middle line:84%
that the Black Plague
finally broke out.

00:35:45.258 --> 00:35:47.050 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't something
that just happened.

00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:49.870 align:middle line:84%
It was due to this
economic collapse,

00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:52.840 align:middle line:84%
due to the change in
the monetary system that

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:56.140 align:middle line:84%
led to the Black Plague,
which then devastated

00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:58.420 align:middle line:90%
Europe for over 150 years.

00:35:58.420 --> 00:35:59.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you
make that link?

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Draw the direct link
between scarcity--

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:05.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously,
people weren't

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:08.680 align:middle line:84%
able to take care of
themselves after this occurred.

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:12.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: Well, when you
lose that local currency that

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:16.180 align:middle line:84%
was driving so much of their
economy and this velocity

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:20.650 align:middle line:84%
of money, people were no
longer able to meet their needs

00:36:20.650 --> 00:36:23.860 align:middle line:84%
because they had to now buy into
a kind of a national currency

00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:24.940 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And you had a lot
of local jobs lost.

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.280 align:middle line:84%
The equivalent of
a liquidity issue

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:33.010 align:middle line:84%
that happens today in
these booms and busts.

00:36:33.010 --> 00:36:36.460 align:middle line:84%
So with people no
longer having the means,

00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:40.060 align:middle line:84%
the currency to be able to
address their own local needs,

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:42.533 align:middle line:90%
you had very quickly the--

00:36:42.533 --> 00:36:43.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The decline.

00:36:43.450 --> 00:36:43.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: --adding
to the Depression.

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
yeah, and a decline

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:47.597 align:middle line:84%
in health, mental
and physical, both.

00:36:47.597 --> 00:36:49.930 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: Well, you had a
decline in every social system

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:50.730 align:middle line:90%
in the country.

00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:52.790 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the area, in the region.

00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:57.280 align:middle line:84%
So all of this led to
this major collapse.

00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:59.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then we went
into a very dark phase.

00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:00.340 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: Yes.

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:02.715 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even though they
say a couple years after that,

00:37:02.715 --> 00:37:04.595 align:middle line:90%
roughly, we had the Renaissance.

00:37:04.595 --> 00:37:06.970 align:middle line:84%
But you mentioned earlier,
was that the true renaissance,

00:37:06.970 --> 00:37:10.300 align:middle line:84%
was during that golden age
of productivity that happened

00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:11.990 align:middle line:90%
during that 250-year period.

00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:12.790 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: Correct.

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:16.750 align:middle line:84%
In fact, during the
Renaissance, things were not--

00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:19.960 align:middle line:84%
the conditions were not
right for most people.

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:21.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not women.

00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:22.302 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: Certainly, not women.

00:37:22.302 --> 00:37:26.260 align:middle line:84%
That's when you had
such a deep repression.

00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:29.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was actually
from the 1300s on that you

00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:30.790 align:middle line:84%
had this repression
of the feminine,

00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:35.320 align:middle line:84%
you had this, again,
unhealthy patriarchy

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:38.860 align:middle line:84%
that took over every
system in that world,

00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:41.080 align:middle line:90%
and the collapse was--

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:42.710 align:middle line:90%
again, money is not just money.

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:44.010 align:middle line:90%
It's linked to everything else.

00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:45.940 align:middle line:84%
So the type of
money that they had

00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:48.385 align:middle line:84%
became a reflection
of what was possible

00:37:48.385 --> 00:37:50.870 align:middle line:90%
and what was not possible.

00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:53.920 align:middle line:84%
So you had a collapse
on major levels

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:56.380 align:middle line:90%
at every aspect of society.

00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:59.530 align:middle line:84%
The Renaissance that took
place in 1400 or the late 1400s

00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:02.500 align:middle line:84%
and 1500s was not so
much a move forward.

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:05.560 align:middle line:84%
It was a recognition of
what had been earlier

00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:06.685 align:middle line:90%
on during the Roman period.

00:38:06.685 --> 00:38:07.485 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:07.485 --> 00:38:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: It wasn't
really an advancement.

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:12.598 align:middle line:84%
And certainly not an advancement
for women and for the feminine.

00:38:12.598 --> 00:38:13.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, not societally.

00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:18.190 align:middle line:84%
OK, so then let's hop
forward from there to Europe

00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:22.790 align:middle line:84%
in the 1920s and 1930s,
and what began to happen.

00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And then the
reintroduction of some

00:38:24.490 --> 00:38:26.290 align:middle line:84%
of these complementary
currencies.

00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:29.590 align:middle line:84%
And also World War II, and
the rise of Hitler's regime.

00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:30.520 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to--

00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:32.645 align:middle line:84%
because there are so many
questions, I just ask you

00:38:32.645 --> 00:38:34.900 align:middle line:84%
now one question, why
don't you go ahead and just

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:37.420 align:middle line:84%
start laying a portrait
of that time for us

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:39.130 align:middle line:84%
in Germany,
Switzerland, Austria?

00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:41.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: Well, you know,
again, for me, a lot of this

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:45.080 align:middle line:84%
is personal because of
what I grew up with.

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And I struggled to understand
what the Depression was about

00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:51.130 align:middle line:84%
and if there were
anything that could have

00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:54.130 align:middle line:84%
been done to prevent
that or to prevent

00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:55.660 align:middle line:90%
a new occurrence of that.

00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And there is talk about
another Depression

00:38:58.060 --> 00:38:59.440 align:middle line:90%
taking place in our world.

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
of reasons to think

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:03.100 align:middle line:90%
that that's a possibility.

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:05.140 align:middle line:84%
So let's look back
at what happened

00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:07.580 align:middle line:90%
during that horrific period.

00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:11.740 align:middle line:84%
One of the hardest hit countries
during that period was Germany.

00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:15.310 align:middle line:84%
They suffered from massive
hyperinflation during the 1920s

00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:18.730 align:middle line:84%
where their currency
was virtually worthless.

00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:21.730 align:middle line:84%
Unemployment was in
double-digit figures,

00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:25.630 align:middle line:84%
and there was really a
loss of understanding

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:28.180 align:middle line:84%
how to get out of the
period that they were in,

00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:30.070 align:middle line:84%
the conditions
that they were in.

00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:34.300 align:middle line:84%
One town, this place
called Schwanenkirchen

00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:35.810 align:middle line:90%
was a coal mining town.

00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And the local coal mine had
just gone out of business.

00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:43.360 align:middle line:84%
And one of the workers
there tried to reopen it

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:45.730 align:middle line:84%
but he couldn't use
the virtually worthless

00:39:45.730 --> 00:39:47.230 align:middle line:90%
national currency to do that.

00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:49.360 align:middle line:84%
So we got the workers
together, they said look,

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:52.180 align:middle line:84%
let's reopen this mine,
but the only way we could

00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:55.300 align:middle line:84%
do that is by accepting
another type of currency,

00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:58.660 align:middle line:84%
a complementary currency
that they called the Wara.

00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:02.020 align:middle line:84%
And this currency would be
backed by the coal inventory

00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:04.240 align:middle line:84%
and that's how the
workers would get paid.

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:05.350 align:middle line:90%
They accepted that.

00:40:05.350 --> 00:40:06.850 align:middle line:84%
They didn't really
have much choice.

00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:09.392 align:middle line:84%
It was the only way they can
get this mine reopen and go back

00:40:09.392 --> 00:40:10.270 align:middle line:90%
to work.

00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:14.110 align:middle line:84%
Within weeks, the local
shopkeepers in Schwanenkirchen

00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:17.290 align:middle line:84%
started accepting this
complementary currency.

00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:20.700 align:middle line:84%
Soon, over 2,000 businesses
around the country

00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:24.960 align:middle line:84%
started accepting payment in
Wara for services and goods.

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:26.880 align:middle line:84%
In fact, a couple
of the banks even

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:29.680 align:middle line:84%
started opening
up Wara accounts.

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:31.890 align:middle line:84%
So here, in the middle
of the Great Depression,

00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:36.960 align:middle line:84%
one town was able to go from
almost full unemployment

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:41.500 align:middle line:84%
to practically full employment
within a matter of weeks.

00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:42.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Weeks.

00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:43.100 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: Weeks.

00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:44.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
saying, and I know

00:40:44.610 --> 00:40:47.160 align:middle line:84%
you've said before, this
can all actually turn around

00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:50.010 align:middle line:84%
very quickly once you have
the confidence of the people

00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:51.367 align:middle line:90%
to come on board with it.

00:40:51.367 --> 00:40:52.950 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: And once
you have the tools.

00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:53.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And once you
have the tools, so--

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:55.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: So try digging a
ditch with a hammer, right?

00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:56.297 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, right.

00:40:56.297 --> 00:40:58.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: So try
constructing an economy

00:40:58.230 --> 00:41:00.670 align:middle line:84%
with the monetary
equivalent of just a hammer.

00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:02.890 align:middle line:90%
It's virtually impossible.

00:41:02.890 --> 00:41:04.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
happened to the Wara?

00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:08.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: Well,
actually, its success,

00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:12.000 align:middle line:84%
its extraordinary success
also became its demise.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.650 align:middle line:84%
The Reichsbank at the time,
the German Central Bank,

00:41:16.650 --> 00:41:20.520 align:middle line:84%
became concerned about the
popularity of the Wara.

00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:23.370 align:middle line:84%
They saw it as a threat
to their own of hegemony

00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:25.170 align:middle line:90%
in the issuance of money.

00:41:25.170 --> 00:41:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And in 1933, along with some
other austerity measures

00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:33.030 align:middle line:84%
and contraction measures, they
made the complementary currency

00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:34.200 align:middle line:90%
illegal.

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:36.570 align:middle line:84%
Within a matter of,
I think, a week,

00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:39.835 align:middle line:84%
Schwanenkirchen and
many other economies

00:41:39.835 --> 00:41:42.210 align:middle line:84%
that were beginning to use
these complementary currencies

00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:44.760 align:middle line:90%
went back to unemployment.

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:47.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this type
of centralized control

00:41:47.490 --> 00:41:49.650 align:middle line:84%
that was brought
down upon them is

00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:52.440 align:middle line:84%
part of what you're calling
the unhealthy patriarchy

00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:54.600 align:middle line:90%
in our monetary systems?

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:57.777 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously, fear
was driving it for one.

00:41:57.777 --> 00:41:59.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: I would say fear
was driving part of it.

00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:03.720 align:middle line:84%
But I think mostly, it's
a lack of understanding

00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:06.600 align:middle line:84%
about these
complementary currencies.

00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:11.058 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we now know
that by making use--

00:42:11.058 --> 00:42:13.350 align:middle line:84%
and the reason they're called
complementary currencies,

00:42:13.350 --> 00:42:16.962 align:middle line:84%
they're not meant to replace
our national currency system.

00:42:16.962 --> 00:42:18.420 align:middle line:84%
Why would you get
rid of the hammer

00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:19.545 align:middle line:90%
when you have a paintbrush?

00:42:19.545 --> 00:42:22.530 align:middle line:84%
You want to use all the
tools available to us

00:42:22.530 --> 00:42:25.470 align:middle line:84%
where they're most
directly usable.

00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:28.950 align:middle line:84%
So what these complementary
currencies can do

00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:31.770 align:middle line:84%
is bolster up the
national currency system

00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:33.780 align:middle line:84%
and allow for a
full, healthy economy

00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:37.297 align:middle line:84%
to take place where the banks
and everybody are doing better.

00:42:37.297 --> 00:42:39.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then why would the
banks have felt threatened?

00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:40.890 align:middle line:90%
Obviously, it was working.

00:42:40.890 --> 00:42:43.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: Well, they didn't
understand at that period--

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:46.150 align:middle line:84%
I believe they simply
didn't understand.

00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:48.540 align:middle line:84%
They were looking short
term at something.

00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:52.650 align:middle line:84%
They didn't-- other piece to
this is that we'd now call this

00:42:52.650 --> 00:42:55.510 align:middle line:84%
period, looking back,
the Great Depression.

00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:57.203 align:middle line:90%
They didn't call it that then.

00:42:57.203 --> 00:42:59.370 align:middle line:84%
They didn't even know it
was a Depression back then.

00:42:59.370 --> 00:43:01.560 align:middle line:84%
It took years for
them to understand

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:04.245 align:middle line:84%
that an actual Depression
was actually taking place.

00:43:04.245 --> 00:43:06.120 align:middle line:84%
So during that period,
they thought they just

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:08.155 align:middle line:90%
had a minor dip in the economy.

00:43:08.155 --> 00:43:09.780 align:middle line:84%
They would figure it
out using that one

00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:13.020 align:middle line:84%
tool available to them, and
that things would normalize.

00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:15.230 align:middle line:90%
But in fact, they didn't.

00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:18.132 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that
they thought that

00:43:18.132 --> 00:43:19.590 align:middle line:84%
these complementary
currencies were

00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:23.930 align:middle line:84%
more of a problem than
a help to the global

00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:25.590 align:middle line:84%
or to the national
currency system.

00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:27.015 align:middle line:90%
Obviously, they were mistaken.

00:43:27.015 --> 00:43:28.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, they're
mistaken to the point

00:43:28.890 --> 00:43:30.960 align:middle line:84%
that it allowed some
rather extraordinary things

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:33.490 align:middle line:84%
to take place politically
as a result of it.

00:43:33.490 --> 00:43:34.920 align:middle line:90%
And if you're going to that.

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:36.870 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: Well, it was--

00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:39.280 align:middle line:84%
I have a hard time pronouncing
his name sometimes--

00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:42.870 align:middle line:84%
Hjalmar Schacht, who
became the first president

00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:47.250 align:middle line:84%
of the Reichsbank onto Hitler,
who later on would testify

00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:50.820 align:middle line:84%
that the reason that Hitler
was able to come into power

00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:53.645 align:middle line:84%
was due to unemployment
and poverty.

00:43:53.645 --> 00:43:55.020 align:middle line:84%
That's what brought
him to power.

00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:56.580 align:middle line:90%
People just ran out of--

00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:58.890 align:middle line:84%
the country ran out of
solutions in Germany

00:43:58.890 --> 00:44:00.690 align:middle line:84%
and they went to
the one person who

00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:04.200 align:middle line:84%
they thought could create
a national program that

00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:08.130 align:middle line:84%
would allow them to reemerge
from this horrific period

00:44:08.130 --> 00:44:11.510 align:middle line:90%
of no money and no jobs.

00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:14.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A direct link to
the dissolution of the Wara.

00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:16.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: Well, I
would say, I mean,

00:44:16.170 --> 00:44:17.670 align:middle line:84%
there were a couple
of measures that

00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:22.380 align:middle line:84%
were taken by the Reichsbank
that led to a shortage of money

00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:24.360 align:middle line:90%
available.

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And these measures
including, especially

00:44:27.970 --> 00:44:33.720 align:middle line:84%
I would say, the loss of the
complementary currencies.

00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:38.190 align:middle line:84%
In 1933, elections took
place in Hitler and the Nazis

00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:39.530 align:middle line:90%
came into power.

00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:42.130 align:middle line:84%
That at the same
part, at that time,

00:44:42.130 --> 00:44:45.210 align:middle line:84%
the unemployment rose
to, I think, six million

00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:46.380 align:middle line:90%
or more people.

00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:50.190 align:middle line:84%
That was 33% of the
workforce were out of work.

00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:52.470 align:middle line:84%
That's what allowed
Hitler to come to power

00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:56.790 align:middle line:84%
and get this extraordinary
popularity behind him

00:44:56.790 --> 00:45:00.150 align:middle line:84%
in a country that was mostly
opposed to him prior to that.

00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:04.420 align:middle line:84%
I think his success prior
to that was 5% or 6%

00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:05.220 align:middle line:90%
of the population.

00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:08.100 align:middle line:84%
It was a marginal figure
up until the unemployment

00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:10.530 align:middle line:84%
rose to such an extent
that people ran out

00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:11.400 align:middle line:90%
of other solutions.

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:12.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:14.590 align:middle line:84%
OK, and we know the
rest of that story.

00:45:14.590 --> 00:45:18.190 align:middle line:84%
So now let's move
on into Switzerland

00:45:18.190 --> 00:45:20.950 align:middle line:84%
and what happened with their
complementary currency,

00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:21.770 align:middle line:90%
unless you want--

00:45:21.770 --> 00:45:23.650 align:middle line:84%
there's another point you
want to make here, go for it.

00:45:23.650 --> 00:45:24.450 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: Yeah.

00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:26.350 align:middle line:84%
You know, people say,
well, that's one town

00:45:26.350 --> 00:45:28.990 align:middle line:90%
and it was one fluke incident.

00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:29.980 align:middle line:90%
Actually, it's not.

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:32.560 align:middle line:84%
There were scores of
complementary currencies

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:35.660 align:middle line:84%
available around the world
during the '20s and '30s.

00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:37.840 align:middle line:84%
We don't know the
results of all of them.

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:40.690 align:middle line:84%
But one of them, most
documented of all

00:45:40.690 --> 00:45:42.640 align:middle line:84%
the complementary
currencies actually took

00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:44.540 align:middle line:90%
place in neighboring Austria.

00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And it was the Worgl
that took place.

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And they copied in a sense
what happened in Wara.

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And within weeks,
again, the city of Worgl

00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:57.850 align:middle line:84%
came to have full
employment, full employment

00:45:57.850 --> 00:46:01.790 align:middle line:84%
in a country that was suffering
from 30% unemployment.

00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And again, in the same repeat
of what took place in Germany,

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:08.290 align:middle line:84%
the Central Bank of
Austria stepped in

00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:11.800 align:middle line:84%
and made these complementary
currencies illegal.

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:13.870 align:middle line:84%
But before that
happened, a number

00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:16.000 align:middle line:84%
of economists from
around the world

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.030 align:middle line:84%
started looking at what
was taking place in Worgl.

00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:21.850 align:middle line:84%
They also noticed that the
townspeople people there

00:46:21.850 --> 00:46:24.100 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the
Depression, because

00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:26.410 align:middle line:84%
of their newfound
prosperity, were

00:46:26.410 --> 00:46:29.072 align:middle line:84%
starting to pay their taxes
earlier than anticipated.

00:46:29.072 --> 00:46:30.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Isn't that amazing?

00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:30.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: Because
they didn't even

00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:32.500 align:middle line:84%
know what to do with the
money that they were getting.

00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:34.458 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So just take
care of the obligations,

00:46:34.458 --> 00:46:37.330 align:middle line:84%
get it off your
conscience first,

00:46:37.330 --> 00:46:38.950 align:middle line:84%
and there's plenty
left for living.

00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:40.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: I mean,
it's extraordinary.

00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:40.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wouldn't
that be amazing

00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:42.640 align:middle line:90%
for us to feel that right now?

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:44.122 align:middle line:90%
And we will get to that.

00:46:44.122 --> 00:46:45.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: And let
me just say this.

00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:48.940 align:middle line:84%
One of the, in fact,
the economic superstar

00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:53.050 align:middle line:84%
of the early 20th century was
a man named Irving Fisher.

00:46:53.050 --> 00:46:55.090 align:middle line:90%
He was a Yale economist.

00:46:55.090 --> 00:46:58.730 align:middle line:84%
He, along with Russell Sprague
then from Harvard, yeah,

00:46:58.730 --> 00:47:03.250 align:middle line:84%
a Harvard economist, and then
under-secretary of the treasury

00:47:03.250 --> 00:47:05.590 align:middle line:84%
Dean Acheson all met
with President Roosevelt

00:47:05.590 --> 00:47:07.135 align:middle line:90%
when he came into the office.

00:47:07.135 --> 00:47:09.940 align:middle line:90%


00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And it was Irving
Fisher who said to FDR

00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:18.880 align:middle line:84%
that we could actually end the
Great Depression in the United

00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:21.280 align:middle line:84%
States in a matter
of three weeks

00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:24.190 align:middle line:84%
by the proper use of
complementary currencies.

00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:25.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: FDR said?

00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:28.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: FDR was, it seemed
he was in favor of it,

00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:32.770 align:middle line:84%
but political allies
and advisors to FDR

00:47:32.770 --> 00:47:35.440 align:middle line:84%
thought that there would be
more political credit given

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:39.250 align:middle line:84%
to the administration by
going ahead with the new deal.

00:47:39.250 --> 00:47:40.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, whatever else
was taking place

00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:43.090 align:middle line:84%
to hinder the use of the
complementary currencies,

00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:44.830 align:middle line:90%
we don't know, but we know that.

00:47:44.830 --> 00:47:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And so they went ahead
with the new deal but was,

00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:50.170 align:middle line:84%
as we know today, was not
the new deal that got us out

00:47:50.170 --> 00:47:51.370 align:middle line:90%
of the Depression.

00:47:51.370 --> 00:47:55.960 align:middle line:84%
It was actually our entry and
a preparation for World War II.

00:47:55.960 --> 00:48:00.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, today we're facing
dire circumstances.

00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:04.000 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
factors involved

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.220 align:middle line:84%
that concern many
economists around the world.

00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:09.940 align:middle line:84%
And I think these lessons
of the Great Depression

00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:13.270 align:middle line:84%
would serve us in
good stead in terms

00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:18.190 align:middle line:84%
of moving forward in how we
deal with the issues of our day.

00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:21.727 align:middle line:84%
And the threat that's looming if
another depression takes place.

00:48:21.727 --> 00:48:23.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely,
it seems a no-brainer.

00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:25.472 align:middle line:84%
But before we go
into some of that,

00:48:25.472 --> 00:48:27.430 align:middle line:84%
because I want to find
out how it's back to how

00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:29.330 align:middle line:90%
this thing actually works.

00:48:29.330 --> 00:48:31.330 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to Switzerland.

00:48:31.330 --> 00:48:33.475 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: Well, in
the 1930s, right

00:48:33.475 --> 00:48:35.350 align:middle line:84%
around the period that
the Wara and the Worgl

00:48:35.350 --> 00:48:38.740 align:middle line:84%
were being eliminated in those
two respective countries,

00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:44.170 align:middle line:84%
Switzerland also noticed what
was taking place in Germany.

00:48:44.170 --> 00:48:47.920 align:middle line:84%
And 16 businessmen got
together, I think it was 1934,

00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:51.160 align:middle line:84%
and they were dealing with
the throes of the depression

00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:53.770 align:middle line:90%
there as well with this decline.

00:48:53.770 --> 00:48:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And when you have a
bust of the economy,

00:48:57.220 --> 00:49:01.000 align:middle line:84%
at the very moment that small
and medium sized enterprises

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.143 align:middle line:84%
actually need credit
availability to them,

00:49:04.143 --> 00:49:05.560 align:middle line:84%
that's at the
moment when you have

00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:09.130 align:middle line:84%
these bust, that's when the
banks contract and they say no.

00:49:09.130 --> 00:49:11.000 align:middle line:84%
This is an unhealthy
business climate

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.630 align:middle line:84%
and we're not lending
out money, although do so

00:49:13.630 --> 00:49:15.740 align:middle line:90%
at very exorbitant rates.

00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:19.240 align:middle line:84%
So with the lack of credit
available to businessmen,

00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:20.990 align:middle line:84%
these small and
medium-sized enterprises--

00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:24.970 align:middle line:84%
it's exactly what happened
during the 2007-2008 crisis--

00:49:24.970 --> 00:49:26.560 align:middle line:84%
without that money
available to them

00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:29.530 align:middle line:84%
to keep inventory to
continue business going,

00:49:29.530 --> 00:49:31.080 align:middle line:90%
these businesses bust.

00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:32.780 align:middle line:90%
They go out of business.

00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:35.350 align:middle line:84%
So Switzerland, these 16
businessmen got together

00:49:35.350 --> 00:49:39.370 align:middle line:84%
and they used a
variation of the Wara.

00:49:39.370 --> 00:49:42.010 align:middle line:84%
To keep their
enterprises going, they

00:49:42.010 --> 00:49:45.820 align:middle line:84%
would trade with one another
in a complementary currency,

00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:49.840 align:middle line:84%
this WIR, while the Swiss
national currency was

00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:51.400 align:middle line:90%
having difficulty.

00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:53.290 align:middle line:84%
So there was no
disruption of business.

00:49:53.290 --> 00:49:57.110 align:middle line:84%
They simply switched over
from one economy to the other.

00:49:57.110 --> 00:49:59.410 align:middle line:84%
They kept doing business
with one another.

00:49:59.410 --> 00:50:03.190 align:middle line:84%
When the economy normalized and
credit was available to them

00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:06.258 align:middle line:84%
again, they simply switched
back to the Swiss Franc.

00:50:06.258 --> 00:50:08.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Makes all
the sense in the world.

00:50:08.050 --> 00:50:09.050 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: Well, it does.

00:50:09.050 --> 00:50:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And it costs almost nothing
to put these things into play.

00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:15.340 align:middle line:84%
There's no loss of jobs,
no loss of businesses,

00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:18.500 align:middle line:84%
and it's far harder once a
business goes out of business

00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:21.152 align:middle line:90%
to recreate that enterprise.

00:50:21.152 --> 00:50:22.860 align:middle line:84%
So even if you're
struggling a little bit

00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:26.790 align:middle line:84%
to keep operations going,
it makes so much more sense.

00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And then you look
at 2006, 2007, 2008,

00:50:30.810 --> 00:50:32.550 align:middle line:84%
we don't know how
many jobs were lost.

00:50:32.550 --> 00:50:34.050 align:middle line:84%
They were in the
tens of millions

00:50:34.050 --> 00:50:35.850 align:middle line:90%
of jobs around the world.

00:50:35.850 --> 00:50:39.150 align:middle line:84%
Most of those jobs have
not come back, especially

00:50:39.150 --> 00:50:41.610 align:middle line:84%
for the small and
medium-sized businesses.

00:50:41.610 --> 00:50:44.790 align:middle line:84%
Most of those job
losses could and can

00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:48.960 align:middle line:84%
be prevented by making use,
again, by rethinking money,

00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:51.850 align:middle line:84%
by understanding that we
have these other tools.

00:50:51.850 --> 00:50:57.180 align:middle line:84%
So I think today, it would make
so much sense for the United

00:50:57.180 --> 00:51:00.210 align:middle line:84%
States and other industrialized
powers and the developing

00:51:00.210 --> 00:51:02.670 align:middle line:84%
world, all to
consider making use

00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:06.780 align:middle line:84%
of a program similar to the
WIR to just simply protect

00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:09.840 align:middle line:84%
to get these booms and busts
that take place periodically,

00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:12.550 align:middle line:90%
and not just periodically.

00:51:12.550 --> 00:51:16.860 align:middle line:84%
One figure that I found
fascinating by the World Bank

00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:19.920 align:middle line:84%
was that in one
25-year period alone,

00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:26.790 align:middle line:84%
from 1971 to 1995, the
World Bank documented

00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:33.000 align:middle line:84%
169 banking crises and something
like in 90 monetary crises

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.610 align:middle line:90%
or one of the other.

00:51:35.610 --> 00:51:39.130 align:middle line:84%
We live in this economy
that's so unstable where

00:51:39.130 --> 00:51:41.400 align:middle line:84%
you can predict that
as soon as you start

00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:43.830 align:middle line:84%
to get a normal healthy
economy, something is going

00:51:43.830 --> 00:51:45.660 align:middle line:90%
to come in and undermine that.

00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:47.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think that
most of the undermining

00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:49.680 align:middle line:84%
takes place again
because we have

00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:54.120 align:middle line:84%
this one limited tool that we're
trying to do everything with.

00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:57.870 align:middle line:84%
To put protective measures
like the WIR in place

00:51:57.870 --> 00:51:59.155 align:middle line:90%
makes to make perfect sense.

00:51:59.155 --> 00:52:00.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:52:00.030 --> 00:52:00.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: And you
know, this is one

00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:03.570 align:middle line:84%
of the most hard-nosed
capitalist societies on earth

00:52:03.570 --> 00:52:05.970 align:middle line:84%
and they're making use of
these complementary currencies.

00:52:05.970 --> 00:52:06.990 align:middle line:90%
Why shouldn't we?

00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:08.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why shouldn't we?

00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:09.678 align:middle line:84%
And there are cities
around America

00:52:09.678 --> 00:52:12.630 align:middle line:84%
that have tried doing this and
have been involved in this.

00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:14.700 align:middle line:84%
The first one that
pops to mind is Ithaca.

00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:16.862 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: Yes, is
it the Ithaca HOURS?

00:52:16.862 --> 00:52:18.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, Ithaca
dollars and others

00:52:18.570 --> 00:52:21.420 align:middle line:84%
that are under
consideration right now.

00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:23.400 align:middle line:84%
But what I don't
understand is how

00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:27.000 align:middle line:84%
does a complementary
currency come to be born?

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:28.710 align:middle line:90%
I mean, is it asset-backed?

00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:31.590 align:middle line:84%
How do you create a
complementary currency?

00:52:31.590 --> 00:52:33.427 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: Well, there's
many different ways.

00:52:33.427 --> 00:52:35.010 align:middle line:84%
Many of the complementary
occurrences,

00:52:35.010 --> 00:52:36.930 align:middle line:84%
there's thousands of
complementary currencies

00:52:36.930 --> 00:52:38.490 align:middle line:90%
in existence today.

00:52:38.490 --> 00:52:42.070 align:middle line:84%
Most of them are
already local level,

00:52:42.070 --> 00:52:46.110 align:middle line:84%
they make use of currencies
programs such as time bank,

00:52:46.110 --> 00:52:46.910 align:middle line:90%
time dollars--

00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:47.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love that.

00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:50.910 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: And LETS, which is
Local Exchange Rate System.

00:52:50.910 --> 00:52:52.680 align:middle line:84%
There's these many
different forms

00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:54.990 align:middle line:84%
of complementary currencies
that can come into being.

00:52:54.990 --> 00:52:57.825 align:middle line:84%
All it requires, really, I
mean, many of these programs

00:52:57.825 --> 00:52:58.950 align:middle line:90%
are already up and running.

00:52:58.950 --> 00:53:02.430 align:middle line:84%
People can simply tune
into what is taking place

00:53:02.430 --> 00:53:05.610 align:middle line:84%
and develop a complementary
currency on their own as well.

00:53:05.610 --> 00:53:08.010 align:middle line:84%
Or they can partake in
the complementary currency

00:53:08.010 --> 00:53:11.310 align:middle line:84%
programs that already
exist on local levels.

00:53:11.310 --> 00:53:16.590 align:middle line:84%
Many countries today, because of
the dire economics of our time,

00:53:16.590 --> 00:53:18.750 align:middle line:84%
are beginning to
look at programs

00:53:18.750 --> 00:53:21.672 align:middle line:84%
such as the WIR
and other programs.

00:53:21.672 --> 00:53:23.130 align:middle line:84%
So there's many
different ways that

00:53:23.130 --> 00:53:26.590 align:middle line:84%
these complementary currencies
can come into being.

00:53:26.590 --> 00:53:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And again, there are all
of these different tools

00:53:28.810 --> 00:53:29.610 align:middle line:90%
available.

00:53:29.610 --> 00:53:32.310 align:middle line:84%
It will take a little
bit of orientation

00:53:32.310 --> 00:53:34.770 align:middle line:84%
to get people understand
how we can do this

00:53:34.770 --> 00:53:35.728 align:middle line:90%
but it's pretty simple.

00:53:35.728 --> 00:53:37.353 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so what
I'm hearing here,

00:53:37.353 --> 00:53:39.480 align:middle line:84%
it's not just one
thing as though you

00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:41.520 align:middle line:84%
would have tokens
for wheat in exchange

00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:44.830 align:middle line:84%
for a bushel of wheat once upon
a time as your security-backed

00:53:44.830 --> 00:53:46.500 align:middle line:90%
a local currency.

00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:48.480 align:middle line:84%
But now, you're
talking time banking,

00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:51.120 align:middle line:84%
you're talking people
hours, and energy,

00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:52.540 align:middle line:90%
and talents, and skills.

00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:56.107 align:middle line:84%
Not just a hard like
asset-backed currency.

00:53:56.107 --> 00:53:57.190 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: Well, actually--

00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:58.607 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a
basket of things.

00:53:58.607 --> 00:54:00.150 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: You can
have many-- again,

00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:02.190 align:middle line:84%
there's many different
ways to do this.

00:54:02.190 --> 00:54:04.570 align:middle line:84%
But consider the fact that
our national currencies,

00:54:04.570 --> 00:54:06.112 align:middle line:84%
when people say,
what's going to back

00:54:06.112 --> 00:54:07.830 align:middle line:90%
our complementary currencies?

00:54:07.830 --> 00:54:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And they go, you know,
this doesn't seem possible.

00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:12.030 align:middle line:84%
Consider what backs our
national currencies.

00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:12.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, nothing.

00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:13.150 align:middle line:90%
Air.

00:54:13.150 --> 00:54:13.950 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: Air.

00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:15.780 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it's the
power of the word,

00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:19.560 align:middle line:84%
of an authority saying that
something is worth something.

00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:23.910 align:middle line:84%
Or this paper or these
electronic bits in the ethers

00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:26.010 align:middle line:90%
are actually valuable.

00:54:26.010 --> 00:54:27.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, what happens
when you begin

00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:29.400 align:middle line:84%
to have one recession
after another?

00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:33.570 align:middle line:84%
You begin to have
economic fragility,

00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:37.380 align:middle line:84%
that our trust in these
non-backed national currencies

00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:39.413 align:middle line:90%
begins to waver.

00:54:39.413 --> 00:54:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And so they're not
backed by gold,

00:54:40.830 --> 00:54:42.372 align:middle line:84%
they're not backed
by silver, they're

00:54:42.372 --> 00:54:44.040 align:middle line:90%
backed by the power of the word.

00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:46.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, consider what backs our
complementary currencies.

00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:48.420 align:middle line:84%
Many of our
complementary currencies

00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:52.300 align:middle line:84%
are actually backed by either
one asset or basket of assets.

00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:53.590 align:middle line:90%
It could be bushels of wheat.

00:54:53.590 --> 00:54:54.390 align:middle line:90%
It could be gold.

00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:55.190 align:middle line:90%
It could be silver.

00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:57.810 align:middle line:84%
It could be many different
things backing the currencies.

00:54:57.810 --> 00:55:01.170 align:middle line:84%
Or it could be backed
by people's willingness

00:55:01.170 --> 00:55:03.503 align:middle line:84%
to put in an hour's
time of work.

00:55:03.503 --> 00:55:04.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Obviously,
time banking.

00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:05.340 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: That's right.

00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:07.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
which is so beautiful.

00:55:07.170 --> 00:55:10.170 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed a woman
named Stephanie Rearick

00:55:10.170 --> 00:55:12.570 align:middle line:84%
a few years ago who is
deeply involved in that

00:55:12.570 --> 00:55:13.890 align:middle line:90%
along with others.

00:55:13.890 --> 00:55:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's in
Madison, Wisconsin,

00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:16.710 align:middle line:90%
is that where they're doing it?

00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:17.510 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: Yes.

00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:20.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there was a few
thousand strong by that time,

00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:24.260 align:middle line:84%
but they were finding it
an incredible tool for also

00:55:24.260 --> 00:55:27.200 align:middle line:90%
social reform at all levels.

00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, they
had developed the software.

00:55:29.330 --> 00:55:31.657 align:middle line:84%
And she said to me,
hey, if you know anybody

00:55:31.657 --> 00:55:33.740 align:middle line:84%
that wants to get this
going in their communities,

00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:36.070 align:middle line:84%
we'll gladly donate
our software to them.

00:55:36.070 --> 00:55:38.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: There's so many
people working at local levels

00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:41.060 align:middle line:90%
and they--

00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:43.370 align:middle line:84%
not only are they taking
care of their own communities

00:55:43.370 --> 00:55:44.870 align:middle line:84%
and many of the
needs that are not

00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:49.860 align:middle line:84%
being met by our regular or
national currency system.

00:55:49.860 --> 00:55:54.260 align:middle line:84%
But there's a mindset, a
worldview that goes along

00:55:54.260 --> 00:55:57.170 align:middle line:84%
with these complementary
occurrences where people just

00:55:57.170 --> 00:55:58.670 align:middle line:90%
want to help one another.

00:55:58.670 --> 00:56:00.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:56:00.070 --> 00:56:02.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: And I think
that this is a major issue

00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:06.320 align:middle line:84%
in, you know, we look
at our current system

00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:10.760 align:middle line:84%
and we hear these very, very
powerful people talking about,

00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:11.990 align:middle line:90%
well, this is mine.

00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And there's such an
individual and myopic sense

00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:17.880 align:middle line:90%
of what our economy is about.

00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:20.360 align:middle line:84%
It's not all about
individual profit.

00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:22.580 align:middle line:90%
Individual profit is part of it.

00:56:22.580 --> 00:56:26.630 align:middle line:84%
Healthy competition is an
extraordinary, but so is

00:56:26.630 --> 00:56:28.050 align:middle line:90%
cooperation.

00:56:28.050 --> 00:56:30.230 align:middle line:84%
You can have both
in a society where

00:56:30.230 --> 00:56:31.730 align:middle line:84%
we're taking care
of our own needs

00:56:31.730 --> 00:56:35.510 align:middle line:84%
and we're taking care of the
collective needs of a country,

00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:38.270 align:middle line:90%
of a global economy.

00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And to have a
little bit of both,

00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:43.160 align:middle line:84%
and to have a balance
between these things,

00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:45.780 align:middle line:84%
I think is
extraordinarily important.

00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:48.740 align:middle line:84%
And most of the
societies looking back

00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:53.240 align:middle line:84%
at history that became
selfish, that became mostly

00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:54.950 align:middle line:84%
concerned about their
own requirements

00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:57.110 align:middle line:84%
without taking care of
the greater good, most

00:56:57.110 --> 00:56:59.330 align:middle line:84%
of those societies
have come and gone.

00:56:59.330 --> 00:57:00.407 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:57:00.407 --> 00:57:02.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: So what we're
talking about here--

00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:02.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can't
endure if you're not

00:57:02.450 --> 00:57:03.560 align:middle line:90%
nurturing each other.

00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:04.640 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: That's right.

00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:04.980 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:05.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're
talking-- what

00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:08.088 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about which
gets back to what you were

00:57:08.088 --> 00:57:11.120 align:middle line:84%
mentioning earlier about
the feminine principle,

00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:14.630 align:middle line:84%
this is about societal
nurturing, which is gone.

00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:16.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people are
suffering greatly.

00:57:16.850 --> 00:57:22.580 align:middle line:84%
I think of my son's generation
and younger, these kids, he

00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:24.830 align:middle line:84%
and his friends, I was
talking to the taxi driver

00:57:24.830 --> 00:57:27.440 align:middle line:84%
today as we were driving
in same with his son

00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:30.350 align:middle line:84%
and his son's friends, they
all have college degrees.

00:57:30.350 --> 00:57:33.357 align:middle line:84%
They're lucky if they can find
a job in the services industry.

00:57:33.357 --> 00:57:34.940 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
get jobs as waiters.

00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:37.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, biologists,
philosophers,

00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:38.870 align:middle line:84%
getting jobs as
waiters and you still

00:57:38.870 --> 00:57:40.540 align:middle line:90%
can't afford your own apartment.

00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:42.980 align:middle line:84%
If you can live
collectively, maybe you

00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:44.630 align:middle line:90%
can have a roof over your head.

00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:47.600 align:middle line:84%
It seems that they're
the generation that

00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:51.245 align:middle line:84%
are really going to want to
take this and run with it.

00:57:51.245 --> 00:57:54.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: I pray and I also
have a great deal of empathy

00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:57.380 align:middle line:84%
for what this
millennial generation is

00:57:57.380 --> 00:57:59.010 align:middle line:90%
having to deal with.

00:57:59.010 --> 00:58:01.580 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I was
graduating from university back

00:58:01.580 --> 00:58:04.260 align:middle line:84%
in the early '70s,
I too, I mean,

00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:07.387 align:middle line:84%
even back then when there
were far more jobs available,

00:58:07.387 --> 00:58:09.470 align:middle line:84%
when they were actually
coming to the universities

00:58:09.470 --> 00:58:12.080 align:middle line:90%
and trying to hire us.

00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:15.290 align:middle line:84%
But even then, there
were an extraordinary,

00:58:15.290 --> 00:58:17.720 align:middle line:84%
for me, a lack of
choices of the things

00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:19.478 align:middle line:90%
that I cared about doing.

00:58:19.478 --> 00:58:21.020 align:middle line:84%
And there's so many
people today that

00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:24.350 align:middle line:84%
want to be contributing
to the greater good,

00:58:24.350 --> 00:58:27.260 align:middle line:84%
doing work in other
countries of the world,

00:58:27.260 --> 00:58:29.835 align:middle line:84%
helping in ways that they
can, this NGO movement.

00:58:29.835 --> 00:58:30.635 align:middle line:90%
It's extraordinary.

00:58:30.635 --> 00:58:31.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:34.652 align:middle line:84%
>>BELGIN: And then when
I first met Bernard,

00:58:34.652 --> 00:58:36.110 align:middle line:84%
I was struggling
with understanding

00:58:36.110 --> 00:58:38.570 align:middle line:84%
how these complementary
currencies could possibly

00:58:38.570 --> 00:58:40.010 align:middle line:90%
help us.

00:58:40.010 --> 00:58:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And he said something to me that
has stuck with me ever since.

00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:47.570 align:middle line:84%
He said, look, consider
all of the work that really

00:58:47.570 --> 00:58:50.210 align:middle line:90%
needs to be done in our world--

00:58:50.210 --> 00:58:52.100 align:middle line:84%
the revitalization
of our cities,

00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:55.430 align:middle line:84%
our environments, rebuilding
our roads and bridges,

00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:57.410 align:middle line:84%
taking care of
educational needs,

00:58:57.410 --> 00:58:59.510 align:middle line:90%
the growing numbers of elders--

00:58:59.510 --> 00:59:02.510 align:middle line:84%
there's so much work that
needs to be accomplished.

00:59:02.510 --> 00:59:06.770 align:middle line:84%
Then there's this legion
of willing, able people,

00:59:06.770 --> 00:59:09.650 align:middle line:90%
hungry for work opportunities.

00:59:09.650 --> 00:59:12.500 align:middle line:84%
The only thing missing-- so you
have all the work that needs

00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:15.290 align:middle line:84%
to get done, you have all
these people willing to work--

00:59:15.290 --> 00:59:16.880 align:middle line:84%
the only thing
missing is this piece

00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:18.990 align:middle line:84%
of whatever, paper
or whatever it is,

00:59:18.990 --> 00:59:20.282 align:middle line:90%
that allows this to take place.

00:59:20.282 --> 00:59:21.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just that
currency of some kind.

00:59:21.770 --> 00:59:22.280 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: That's right.

00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:23.697 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
that's where we are.

00:59:23.697 --> 00:59:25.430 align:middle line:84%
Just like it's just
add water, it's just

00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:28.010 align:middle line:84%
add some kind of useful
currency, and this is global.

00:59:28.010 --> 00:59:31.140 align:middle line:84%
And on that note, because
we're out of time,

00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:32.263 align:middle line:90%
we could talk for hours.

00:59:32.263 --> 00:59:33.680 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank
you so much, and I

00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:35.330 align:middle line:90%
have to say again to everybody.

00:59:35.330 --> 00:59:37.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this book, "New
Money for a New World,"

00:59:37.970 --> 00:59:40.040 align:middle line:90%
is an absolute must read.

00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:41.742 align:middle line:90%
And this is a story of hope.

00:59:41.742 --> 00:59:42.575 align:middle line:90%
>>BELGIN: Thank you.

00:59:42.575 --> 00:59:44.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I thank you.

00:59:44.210 --> 00:59:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And again, thank everybody
else for joining us.

00:59:46.730 --> 00:59:48.590 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
keeping an open mind.

00:59:48.590 --> 00:59:51.640 align:middle line:90%
