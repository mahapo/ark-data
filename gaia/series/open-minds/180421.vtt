00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.230 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: Dr. Jude
Currivan's life has expanded

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.650 align:middle line:10%
from the UK's coal mines
to noted Oxford scholar,

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.650 align:middle line:10%
with an overarching message
that links the worlds of science

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:31.850 align:middle line:10%
and metaphysics.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.920 align:middle line:10%
She's not using science
for science's sake,

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.260 align:middle line:10%
rather for bringing a
depth of knowledge that

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.910 align:middle line:10%
can be applied to
transforming and healing

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.120 align:middle line:10%
our planetary consciousness,
which is a very

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.190 align:middle line:10%
different kind of science book.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.390 align:middle line:10%
Your work is exhaustive.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.830 align:middle line:10%
You have done really
pristine research.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's very hard,
I would think,

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.280 align:middle line:84%
for your colleagues
to argue with you,

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.730 align:middle line:90%
as much as they would like to.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.530 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.037 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:56.037 --> 00:00:58.620 align:middle line:84%
>> JUDE CURRIVAN: I think that
sums it up beautifully, Regina.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now we need
to tell people the story,

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.000 align:middle line:84%
so they know why
this is the case.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.490 align:middle line:10%
So first of all, as a child,
coming from an environment

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.200 align:middle line:10%
where people would
go into the earth

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.450 align:middle line:10%
and work during the
day, what was it

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.060 align:middle line:10%
that was making you kind
of shoot for the stars

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.310 align:middle line:10%
in your understanding of life?

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.640 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: When I was four
years old, I was in my bedroom,

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.780 align:middle line:84%
and a discarnate light came into
the room and just hung there.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.650 align:middle line:90%
And I started to hear a voice.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.020 align:middle line:84%
And that voice, as it
spoke to me, fascinated me.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And as four years old, it's
like a new toy, you know?

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.020 align:middle line:90%
What's going on here?

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.180 align:middle line:84%
And that really began
a lifelong journey

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.690 align:middle line:90%
of curiosity and discovery.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What did
the voice say to you?

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.380 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember kind of what
the feeling of the message

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.180 align:middle line:90%
was at the time?

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.940 align:middle line:84%
Or just that the light itself
was there speaking to you,

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.454 align:middle line:84%
was the inspiration,
in and of itself?

00:01:49.454 --> 00:01:51.120 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: I can't
remember the words.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.280 align:middle line:90%
It was over 60 years ago.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.410 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:53.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, sure.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.680 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: But it was
a very loving voice.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.030 align:middle line:10%
I just had a sense of
familiarity with it

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.260 align:middle line:10%
and lovingness of it.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.990 align:middle line:10%
And I know that in the
following months and years

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.480 align:middle line:10%
and on, it became clearer.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.580 align:middle line:84%
But not just that
voice, but I started

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.160 align:middle line:84%
to have what's called
clairaudient experiences

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.030 align:middle line:84%
of other beings
and intelligences.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.040 align:middle line:84%
But all sorts of
stuff was happening--

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.880 align:middle line:84%
I was going out of body, I was
having precognitive dreams.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.460 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I was really
walking between worlds.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:23.690 align:middle line:10%
And for me, it was natural.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.976 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't something strange.

00:02:25.976 --> 00:02:27.350 align:middle line:84%
It was almost like
opening a door

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.690 align:middle line:84%
and just walking into
somewhere different.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.420 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
I was fascinated.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.750 align:middle line:84%
I became fascinated
by the stars.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.200 align:middle line:84%
We lived in a
council house, which

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.680 align:middle line:84%
is where the local council
subsidizes housing.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.990 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, very modest.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.630 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: Very modest.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.090 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, we had street
lights, but still,

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.606 align:middle line:84%
not enough to stop me from
being able to see the stars.

00:02:49.606 --> 00:02:50.480 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Lucky you.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.552 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: Lucky me.

00:02:51.552 --> 00:02:53.510 align:middle line:84%
And where I live now, we
have no street lights,

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.430 align:middle line:90%
so we have a very clear sky.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.260 align:middle line:84%
But I was just
fascinated by the stars.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.140 align:middle line:84%
I always had a sense
of, again, familiarity.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.440 align:middle line:84%
And somehow we
were all connected.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And that took me down a
journey of exploration,

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.710 align:middle line:90%
of scientific discovery.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.070 align:middle line:84%
Because I wanted to
understand the why of what

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.260 align:middle line:84%
was all of this,
but also the how.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.640 align:middle line:84%
How did these experiences
that seem to be unusual--

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.190 align:middle line:84%
and I shared very little
with anybody at the time.

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.774 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't that
I was scared to.

00:03:23.774 --> 00:03:25.440 align:middle line:84%
I was just having too
much fun, I think.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.312 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right?

00:03:26.312 --> 00:03:28.020 align:middle line:84%
You didn't want anyone
to ruin your fun--

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.250 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: No.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.350 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want anybody
to ruin my fun--

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.720 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --by questioning it.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.910 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: --by
questioning it.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.284 align:middle line:84%
And I suppose
there was something

00:03:32.284 --> 00:03:35.210 align:middle line:84%
in me that perhaps
subconsciously I

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.280 align:middle line:90%
had that fear that they might.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.470 align:middle line:84%
I know my mom wouldn't
have had that problem,

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:40.980 align:middle line:90%
but perhaps others might.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.190 align:middle line:84%
So on that subconscious
level, I never shared widely.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.510 align:middle line:84%
But I just wanted
to understand how

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.720 align:middle line:84%
what we call physical
reality somehow

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.820 align:middle line:84%
emerged from this bigger,
deeper, wider reality

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.800 align:middle line:84%
that I was directly
experiencing.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.310 align:middle line:84%
So I started to study
science as a language,

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.650 align:middle line:84%
as a language to try
and help me understand

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:10.950 align:middle line:84%
how the physical world somehow
emerged from this bigger world.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And did you find
your answers while studying

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.980 align:middle line:90%
at university?

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:15.780 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: No.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.430 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Almost the opposite.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.709 align:middle line:84%
I was at Oxford in the
'70s, the early '70s.

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And I was almost shocked to
see that the physical realm was

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.760 align:middle line:84%
the only realm that
was being considered

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.140 align:middle line:84%
and that you weren't
to stray beyond that.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.870 align:middle line:84%
Even though, specializing in
quantum physics, of course,

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.840 align:middle line:84%
I realized that quantum physics
doesn't work unless there's

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.700 align:middle line:90%
a deeper level of reality.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.630 align:middle line:84%
Quantum physics doesn't work
unless our entire universe

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.660 align:middle line:84%
is interconnected at
a very profound level.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.060 align:middle line:84%
But those aspects of it
were so peripheralized.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And so it was taught in a
very physicalized perspective.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.359 align:middle line:84%
I also specialized
in relativity,

00:05:00.359 --> 00:05:01.900 align:middle line:84%
because I was looking
at the biggest.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.890 align:middle line:90%
Again, the same things.

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.810 align:middle line:84%
Relativity is showing
that, of course,

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.390 align:middle line:84%
time is relative to
an observer, space

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:15.040 align:middle line:84%
is relative to an observer, but
together they are invariant.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.382 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, our universe couldn't
exist and evolve together--

00:05:18.382 --> 00:05:19.590 align:middle line:90%
the laws of physics couldn't.

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.442 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that's
difficult for science.

00:05:21.442 --> 00:05:23.150 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: It is
difficult for science,

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:28.440 align:middle line:84%
because the methodology of
science for 300 years has said,

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.330 align:middle line:84%
look, I'm a scientist, I'm
going to experiment on this.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to look at this.

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to try
and understand it.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.090 align:middle line:90%
And science is very good--

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:39.980 align:middle line:90%
that methodology is great--

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:45.090 align:middle line:84%
at taking stuff apart and
trying to find what makes it up,

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.750 align:middle line:90%
what its constituents are--

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.010 align:middle line:90%
smaller and smaller and smaller.

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:52.220 align:middle line:84%
But rather like-- and he'll
hate me for saying this.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.890 align:middle line:84%
My brother used to be
really good at taking things

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:56.992 align:middle line:84%
like watches and clocks
apart, but he could never

00:05:56.992 --> 00:05:58.200 align:middle line:90%
put them back together again.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.392 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:59.392 --> 00:06:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
scientific methodology's

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.510 align:middle line:90%
great at taking the bits apart.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.460 align:middle line:84%
But as Deepak Chopra
once said, it's

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.770 align:middle line:84%
like taking a radio
apart, and then wondering

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.870 align:middle line:90%
where the music's gone to.

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's now changing,
but it's quite a leap.

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.800 align:middle line:84%
And also it requires
modifications

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.790 align:middle line:84%
to the scientific
methodologies that are still

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:23.434 align:middle line:90%
at their very early stages.

00:06:23.434 --> 00:06:24.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And quantum
physicists are really

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.130 align:middle line:84%
considered kind of the
outcasts and renegades

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.719 align:middle line:84%
of the world of science for
the most part anyway, right?

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:31.760 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: To a degree.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.440 align:middle line:84%
But the other part
of that, they're

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.780 align:middle line:90%
like sort of honored geeks.

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.550 align:middle line:84%
Because everybody knows that
at the most fundamental level,

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.530 align:middle line:84%
the quantum understanding is
crucial to our understanding

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:43.680 align:middle line:90%
of physical reality.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.740 align:middle line:84%
The problem with the
quantum physicists

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.680 align:middle line:84%
are that quantum
physics describes

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.870 align:middle line:84%
the behavior of
energy and matter,

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:53.820 align:middle line:84%
and now we know
they're equivalent.

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.480 align:middle line:84%
But the problem with
that is energy and matter

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.105 align:middle line:90%
have no sense of time.

00:06:58.105 --> 00:06:59.480 align:middle line:84%
They don't care
whether something

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.260 align:middle line:90%
runs that way or that way.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.370 align:middle line:84%
So the quantum physicists
don't really, in the main,

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.800 align:middle line:90%
understand the nature of time.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.420 align:middle line:84%
What investigates time
is relativity theory.

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And you need to actually,
in my perspective--

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:15.830 align:middle line:84%
and this is what I've
done in the book--

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:21.080 align:middle line:84%
if you restate the laws of
physics as laws of information,

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.570 align:middle line:84%
and if you start
even further back,

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:25.970 align:middle line:84%
back into the mid-19th
century with something called

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:29.230 align:middle line:84%
thermodynamics, which is
the behavior of gases,

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:32.780 align:middle line:84%
you can bring all of the
discoveries since then--

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:37.010 align:middle line:84%
quantum and relativity--
and actually understand

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:40.100 align:middle line:84%
that when you restate those
two laws of thermodynamics

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.310 align:middle line:84%
to two laws of
information, you get

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:45.620 align:middle line:84%
quantum mechanics
and relativity theory

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:48.600 align:middle line:84%
as free- you get them for free--
and you can reconcile them.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.400 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And reconciliation has been
really your dharma of sorts.

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:57.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've been trying
to reconcile philosophy,

00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:01.250 align:middle line:90%
physics, science, spirituality.

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:03.500 align:middle line:84%
That's a tall task,
but you really

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.330 align:middle line:90%
have been successful in this.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:08.540 align:middle line:90%


00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.450 align:middle line:84%
What was it
personally in you that

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:15.270 align:middle line:84%
needed this deep reconciliation
yourself to create--

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:17.240 align:middle line:84%
because there is a type
of cognitive dissonance

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.406 align:middle line:90%
when you have an experience.

00:08:18.406 --> 00:08:20.210 align:middle line:84%
And you say, I
know this is real,

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:22.822 align:middle line:84%
but then your background
says, no, this is not real.

00:08:22.822 --> 00:08:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And it can create a
cognitive dissonance.

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And I know a lot of
scientists suffer from this,

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.690 align:middle line:84%
because others have
too had experiences.

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:31.090 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: Exactly right.

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
very important.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.299 align:middle line:84%
For me, I never had the
cognitive dissonance,

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:37.700 align:middle line:90%
because I started so young.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:40.070 align:middle line:84%
It was like a dance
of exploration.

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And realizing that to
dance, I needed both legs.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:46.390 align:middle line:84%
I needed both left hemisphere
and right hemisphere.

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:49.100 align:middle line:84%
But also, I never
felt-- and, of course,

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:52.580 align:middle line:84%
when you go back to ancient
times and the sacred science

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:55.940 align:middle line:84%
of the Egyptians and the sacred
science of the Vedic sages

00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:01.580 align:middle line:84%
of India, we're now describing--
and in "The Cosmic Hologram"

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:05.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm describing-- something that
the ancient Vedic sages would

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:06.560 align:middle line:90%
have recognized.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.210 align:middle line:10%
Because they refer
to it as Indra's Net.

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:11.660 align:middle line:10%
So now we're almost
looping back,

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:14.660 align:middle line:10%
but we're going
forward to realize

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:19.310 align:middle line:10%
that those ancients had
immense intuitive experiential

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:20.570 align:middle line:10%
insights.

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:22.070 align:middle line:90%
We've moved forward.

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:25.640 align:middle line:84%
We've also taken a
bit of a side route--

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.190 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Into a world
of extreme materialism.

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:30.380 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN:
Extreme materialism.

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's because our
beliefs drive our behaviors

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:36.530 align:middle line:84%
that extreme materialism
and that myth of separation

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:38.570 align:middle line:84%
has driven our
dysfunctional behavior.

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:41.450 align:middle line:84%
So I suppose my work at the
end of the day, as you say,

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:45.140 align:middle line:84%
is to reconcile and to heal our
world view from a fragmented

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:48.100 align:middle line:84%
perspective into a
whole world view, where

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:52.670 align:middle line:84%
all that we are, all that we
experience, all that we embody

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:56.085 align:middle line:84%
is part of that greater
understanding of reality.

00:09:56.085 --> 00:09:58.460 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, and also
because we have taken that dive

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:01.430 align:middle line:84%
into scientific materialism,
all the way down to the bottom

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:02.360 align:middle line:90%
of that well.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:06.320 align:middle line:84%
We need that language and the
common vernacular for people

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.684 align:middle line:90%
to trust what you're saying.

00:10:08.684 --> 00:10:10.100 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: That
is so important.

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.070 align:middle line:84%
Because so many people have
been what Ken Wilber talks,

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:16.210 align:middle line:84%
waking up and growing
up and showing up--

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:19.430 align:middle line:84%
and Dustin, as well, DiPerna,
talks about cleaning up--

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:23.570 align:middle line:84%
over these years through
the whole awakening process

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:25.190 align:middle line:90%
and the shift of awareness.

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:28.370 align:middle line:84%
But for many, many,
many others, who

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:31.100 align:middle line:84%
perhaps haven't had direct
experiences, which often drives

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:34.280 align:middle line:84%
that journey, is show me the
evidence, show me the evidence.

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And until now, science,
with all of its insights,

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.190 align:middle line:84%
has not really
shown the evidence.

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:44.160 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to write
this book for 60 years.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.770 align:middle line:84%
But I couldn't
write it until now,

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:48.440 align:middle line:84%
because I need to amass
all that evidence--

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:52.760 align:middle line:84%
not just the physics and the
cosmology, but across biology,

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:53.980 align:middle line:90%
whole systems theory--

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:54.780 align:middle line:90%
all scales.

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:55.696 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Everything.

00:10:55.696 --> 00:10:56.640 align:middle line:90%
You've done it.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.440 align:middle line:90%
You've done it.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:57.730 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: Thank you.

00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:58.938 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Let's get into it.

00:10:58.938 --> 00:11:02.085 align:middle line:84%
You use the word information
hyphenated-- in-formation.

00:11:02.085 --> 00:11:03.560 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: That's right.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.584 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Just start
from there-- why?

00:11:05.584 --> 00:11:08.000 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: Because we think
we know what information is,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.960 align:middle line:84%
because information is the
basis of all our technologies.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And what we do is
with information, we--

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:17.960 align:middle line:84%
for example, now
in our interview,

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:21.250 align:middle line:84%
the camera is taking
photographs of us

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:22.730 align:middle line:90%
from the light reflected on it.

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:24.710 align:middle line:84%
It's transferring
all that information

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:25.940 align:middle line:90%
into digitized bits--

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:27.740 align:middle line:90%
ones and zeros.

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:31.970 align:middle line:84%
Anything in reality
can be described

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:35.300 align:middle line:84%
in strings of ones and zeros,
but those ones and zeros

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.940 align:middle line:90%
of themselves are data.

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:41.220 align:middle line:84%
It's not really meaningful,
unless we put it together.

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:43.790 align:middle line:84%
So instead of just
saying information,

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:45.590 align:middle line:84%
which you could think
of as just being

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:51.170 align:middle line:84%
random data, by hyphenating
in-formation, what I'm saying

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:54.890 align:middle line:84%
is our universe and everything
in it is not random.

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:56.380 align:middle line:90%
It is interrelation.

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:57.630 align:middle line:90%
It is dynamic.

00:11:57.630 --> 00:11:59.160 align:middle line:90%
It is meaningful.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.490 align:middle line:84%
It is essentially
alive, way beyond

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:04.270 align:middle line:90%
the biological term of that.

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:06.020 align:middle line:90%
And so it's patterned.

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.930 align:middle line:84%
It's intentionally patterned
and meaningful and purposeful.

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:11.765 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, if we
have an alphabet--

00:12:11.765 --> 00:12:15.740 align:middle line:84%
A and B and C-- they have
no meaning of themselves.

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:18.530 align:middle line:84%
But if we start to put
them together in words,

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:21.380 align:middle line:84%
and then we start to put those
words in terms of sentences,

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:26.730 align:middle line:84%
and those sentences in terms
of poems and plays and songs,

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:28.170 align:middle line:90%
then that's meaningful.

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:31.702 align:middle line:84%
So our universe,
essentially, is a song.

00:12:31.702 --> 00:12:34.830 align:middle line:84%
It is a meaningful song
that exists and evolves--

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:36.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It has harmonics.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.640 align:middle line:90%
It has a melody.

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:38.440 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: Yes.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:39.820 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:41.580 align:middle line:84%
I just love the way
your mind works.

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:45.160 align:middle line:84%
So you're saying that
universal physicality

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.430 align:middle line:84%
is a matter of the flows
of this information

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:51.900 align:middle line:84%
in various processes
of creation.

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:56.860 align:middle line:84%
So for people who are
visual, paint a picture--

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:58.030 align:middle line:90%
or make a song, either one--

00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:58.870 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:00.369 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: You
don't hear me sing.

00:13:00.369 --> 00:13:01.625 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:01.625 --> 00:13:05.255 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --of how this
flows, what this looks like.

00:13:05.255 --> 00:13:07.630 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: Well, perhaps we
can go back to have a sense

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:10.690 align:middle line:84%
of its beginning, 13.8
billion years ago.

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:14.530 align:middle line:10%
Because we know that
our universe began as--

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:17.860 align:middle line:10%
and now, and what I'm saying
in "The Cosmic Hologram,"

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:23.082 align:middle line:10%
is that our universe, and other
universes perhaps, are finite.

00:13:23.082 --> 00:13:25.570 align:middle line:84%
They're finite entities
in an infinity,

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:27.790 align:middle line:90%
an eternity of cosmic mind.

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And actually, Stephen
Hawking posthumously

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:34.750 align:middle line:84%
has just published a paper with
a Dutch professor, Professor

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:39.130 align:middle line:84%
Thomas Hertog, saying that our
universe is finite and closed,

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:43.240 align:middle line:84%
which is additional evidence
to what I'm saying in the book.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:47.000 align:middle line:84%
But our universe began not as a
big bang, because we think of--

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:47.800 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I agree.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.550 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: --big
bang as big and bang.

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:50.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:51.930 align:middle line:90%
You call it the big breath.

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:52.762 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: I do.

00:13:52.762 --> 00:13:53.720 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love this.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, share this with
us, and we'll go forward

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:57.480 align:middle line:90%
into that other question later.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:00.630 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: OK, because the big
breath actually perhaps begins

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:02.630 align:middle line:90%
to answer that earlier question.

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:06.750 align:middle line:84%
Because instead of chaos,
it was exquisitely ordered

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:07.990 align:middle line:90%
and fine-tuned.

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:09.920 align:middle line:84%
So literally, as
the ancients said,

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:14.950 align:middle line:84%
it's a big breath with time
flowing and space expanding.

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:20.110 align:middle line:84%
So everything is
interconnected in the most

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:25.630 align:middle line:84%
exquisitely-balanced way that
literally enables our universe

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:28.450 align:middle line:90%
to exist, but more so to evolve.

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:32.740 align:middle line:84%
So from that beginning
simplicity, ever greater levels

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:38.330 align:middle line:84%
of complexity and ever greater
levels of self-awareness

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:44.560 align:middle line:84%
at these individuated
microcosmic levels, such as us,

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:48.250 align:middle line:84%
so we can look back
13.8 billion years ago.

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:50.710 align:middle line:84%
Everything that makes
us up, all the energy

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:53.839 align:middle line:84%
and matter in our universe,
was there at the beginning,

00:14:53.839 --> 00:14:54.880 align:middle line:90%
will be there at the end.

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:56.410 align:middle line:90%
It's just changed form.

00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:57.760 align:middle line:90%
I hate to say it, Regina.

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:02.540 align:middle line:84%
But you and I are both
13.8 billion years old.

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:03.340 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:04.600 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: --in that sense.

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:05.400 align:middle line:90%
We are.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:08.410 align:middle line:84%
So we have a lineage
as human beings

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:11.560 align:middle line:84%
that literally goes back to the
beginning of the big breath.

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:13.837 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And yet you
say at the same time--

00:15:13.837 --> 00:15:16.420 align:middle line:84%
so this is where people have to
try to get their minds around,

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:21.250 align:middle line:84%
because I love this topic, I
find it absolutely beautiful--

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:23.160 align:middle line:90%
in the sense there was nothing.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:27.820 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
the logos informing

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:32.500 align:middle line:84%
the prima materia, the
primordial essence of matter,

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:35.200 align:middle line:90%
to create everything.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.010 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: Yes.

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:37.285 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: How does that work?

00:15:37.285 --> 00:15:39.160 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: Basically,
because first of all,

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:44.360 align:middle line:84%
we understand that what we call
physical solidity is incredibly

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.160 align:middle line:90%
ephemeral.

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.940 align:middle line:84%
And then when physicists
have drilled down

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:51.790 align:middle line:84%
to tinier and tinier scales,
to atomic scales and smaller,

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:55.930 align:middle line:84%
we realize that everything
we call solid materiality

00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:57.810 align:middle line:90%
is 99.999999.

00:15:57.810 --> 00:15:59.262 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly, 9999.

00:15:59.262 --> 00:16:00.470 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: "No-thing-ness."

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:01.761 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Nothing, yes, space.

00:16:01.761 --> 00:16:05.070 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: And what remains
is actually relational

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:06.640 align:middle line:90%
excitations.

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:08.820 align:middle line:90%
But the key to this--

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:11.370 align:middle line:84%
and I'm taking it over
the bridge as it were--

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:13.980 align:middle line:84%
is that we also
realize information

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:16.290 align:middle line:84%
is as physically
real as anything

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:18.090 align:middle line:90%
we call energy and matter.

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:20.340 align:middle line:84%
And there have been experiments
to show this recently.

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:22.830 align:middle line:84%
Some years ago,
theorists were already

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:27.420 align:middle line:84%
showing or really
hypothesizing that when

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:31.680 align:middle line:84%
we stored or deleted
one bit of information

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:35.400 align:middle line:84%
that it involved physical
parameters, such as work

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:36.420 align:middle line:90%
and heat.

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:40.120 align:middle line:84%
And more recently, we've been
able to experimentally show

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:40.920 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.170 align:middle line:84%
So we know that it's
not just the way

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:46.490 align:middle line:84%
that digitized
information is held

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:49.110 align:middle line:84%
and comes into friction with
cables or anything else.

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:49.980 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:55.260 align:middle line:84%
It's the information itself is
as physically real as anything

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.630 align:middle line:90%
we call energy and matter.

00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:01.660 align:middle line:84%
So information is more
fundamental than energy matter.

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:04.230 align:middle line:84%
It's more fundamental
than spacetime.

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:07.260 align:middle line:84%
It's expressed in
complementary ways as both,

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:12.210 align:middle line:84%
but it shows how that deeper,
fundamental consciousness,

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:16.690 align:middle line:84%
intelligence of the cosmos,
can give rise to a thought

00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:18.340 align:middle line:90%
form that is our universe.

00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:19.140 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:23.130 align:middle line:84%
So if we're looking at it
through a material lens

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:27.540 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, we can see atomic
functioning particles and so

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:30.680 align:middle line:84%
forth, but we're
made up of space.

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:32.821 align:middle line:90%
So what is the space?

00:17:32.821 --> 00:17:35.555 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: The space is
consciousness, essentially.

00:17:35.555 --> 00:17:36.010 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, exactly.

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:37.676 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: The space
is consciousness.

00:17:37.676 --> 00:17:41.455 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's where the
information is flowing through.

00:17:41.455 --> 00:17:42.790 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: Exactly.

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:43.740 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:44.590 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It is the space.

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:44.750 align:middle line:90%
It is, yes.

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:45.550 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: It is.

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:48.880 align:middle line:84%
Because your mind
and consciousness

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:52.030 align:middle line:84%
isn't something we have, it's
what we in the whole world are.

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:54.750 align:middle line:84%
Which is really the
last piece of the book

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:57.250 align:middle line:84%
before I go onto the second and
third books in the trilogy--

00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:58.681 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:58.681 --> 00:18:00.260 align:middle line:90%
--that are yet to come.

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:01.060 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:03.910 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you explain that
the geometrical formations

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:06.180 align:middle line:90%
of the universe are 2D.

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:07.000 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: Yeah.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.166 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK, explain this.

00:18:08.166 --> 00:18:11.400 align:middle line:84%
Because people-- again,
I'm particularly visual.

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And when I first entered the
world of quantum research

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:18.010 align:middle line:84%
about 30 years ago, I
found it fascinating,

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:21.345 align:middle line:84%
because I could see it
in my own mind's eye.

00:18:21.345 --> 00:18:22.720 align:middle line:84%
I closed my eyes,
and I could see

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.110 align:middle line:90%
what they were talking about.

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:26.680 align:middle line:84%
So for all of our
viewers who, like me,

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:29.080 align:middle line:84%
are quite visual in
our understanding,

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.489 align:middle line:90%
explain what this means.

00:18:30.489 --> 00:18:31.780 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: I'll be delighted.

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:35.745 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: 2D, because it's
fundamental to our evolution.

00:18:35.745 --> 00:18:36.610 align:middle line:90%
Why 2D?

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:37.680 align:middle line:90%
What's this look like?

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:40.900 align:middle line:84%
Why 2D, when we think
of the world in 3D?

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And now we think of
dimensions as something--

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:45.550 align:middle line:84%
well, in the context
of new age thinking,

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:47.440 align:middle line:84%
it can be anything--
angels flowing

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:50.430 align:middle line:84%
in from the 13th dimension
and on and on and on.

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:52.389 align:middle line:84%
And so let's just do the
basics on what 2D is--

00:18:52.389 --> 00:18:54.096 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: Let's do
the basics of this.

00:18:54.096 --> 00:18:55.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --and
then move to 3D, OK?

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:56.670 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: Absolutely.

00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And then we can play in
whatever level is beyond that.

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:01.760 align:middle line:84%
I think the other
important point you made,

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:05.080 align:middle line:84%
which is really important,
is so many people are visual.

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And in my experience,
people, now,

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:10.880 align:middle line:84%
as we are so
collectively waking up,

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.760 align:middle line:84%
are having visual experiences
of geometrical forms.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.476 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, oh, absolutely.

00:19:15.476 --> 00:19:18.100 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: And, of course, the
ancient geometers who just had

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:22.390 align:middle line:84%
a straight edge and the rest
of it understood and curetted

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:24.760 align:middle line:84%
the nature of reality
and geometric forms.

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:26.590 align:middle line:90%
God is a great geometer.

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:29.560 align:middle line:84%
But for them, it was the
idealized forms of triangles

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:32.250 align:middle line:90%
and circles and squares.

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And now we're realizing
through massive amounts

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:37.600 align:middle line:84%
of computer analysis,
that instead

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:40.600 align:middle line:84%
of these idealized forms,
that the makeup of the world

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:42.730 align:middle line:90%
is indeed geometric.

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:44.740 align:middle line:90%
But it's what's called fractals.

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:47.800 align:middle line:10%
So they scale up
and they scale down,

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:50.290 align:middle line:10%
just as idealized geometries do.

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:52.900 align:middle line:10%
But they are the
shapes of clouds.

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:57.280 align:middle line:84%
They are the underpinning
happenings that pervades

00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:00.760 align:middle line:84%
not just the natural
world of ecosystems--

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.170 align:middle line:84%
we have the same
fractal patterns

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:05.480 align:middle line:84%
at the scale of the atom, and
up to 3 billion light years

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:06.280 align:middle line:90%
across.

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:07.400 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: As above, so below.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:08.275 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: Woo-hoo.

00:20:08.275 --> 00:20:09.340 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:12.130 align:middle line:84%
But also through our
so-called man-made patterns.

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:15.520 align:middle line:84%
The way we socially behave
with each other, whether it's

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:22.000 align:middle line:84%
surfing the net, using our
mobile phones, or conflicts,

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.400 align:middle line:84%
their relationships
actually embody

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.790 align:middle line:84%
exactly the same
fractal patterns

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:31.240 align:middle line:84%
as do ecosystems and earthquakes
and galaxies and atoms,

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:32.100 align:middle line:90%
which is amazing.

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.141 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It is amazing
when you think about it.

00:20:34.141 --> 00:20:36.370 align:middle line:84%
How do you get these
different outcomes

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:37.720 align:middle line:90%
from the same geometry?

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.720 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: Einstein
said, as simple as can be,

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:40.870 align:middle line:90%
but no simpler.

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:42.160 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly it.

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:44.350 align:middle line:84%
You get complexity
from simplicity.

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:47.500 align:middle line:84%
But you made the
point about 2D-ness.

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:51.520 align:middle line:84%
I love, that despite
this route of science

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:55.000 align:middle line:84%
really focusing into technology,
that it's actually technology

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.940 align:middle line:84%
that I feel is now
predisposing us

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:01.390 align:middle line:84%
to remember the
interconnectivity and

00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:03.939 align:middle line:90%
relational nature of reality.

00:21:03.939 --> 00:21:05.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Interesting
way to put it.

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:05.740 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:08.156 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: And I think this
is happening through virtual

00:21:08.156 --> 00:21:09.110 align:middle line:90%
realities.

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:10.985 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's happening
through holograms.

00:21:10.985 --> 00:21:14.500 align:middle line:84%
Because I'd like to explain the
2D-ness and the 3D-ness with

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:15.940 align:middle line:90%
holograms.

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:19.850 align:middle line:84%
Because what a hologram does is
it shines a light on an object,

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:20.650 align:middle line:90%
any object.

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:21.730 align:middle line:90%
It could be this cup of tea.

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:22.530 align:middle line:90%
It could be you.

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:23.870 align:middle line:90%
It could be anything.

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:28.150 align:middle line:10%
It captures the information
from that 3D object,

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:31.800 align:middle line:10%
and it projects it on a
two-dimensional film or screen.

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:35.020 align:middle line:10%
So all the data's captured,
but that 3D object is now

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:37.270 align:middle line:10%
captured on a 2D screen.

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:41.020 align:middle line:84%
Then, when a light is shone
through that 2D screen,

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:45.370 align:middle line:84%
the 3D hologram of the
object is projected.

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And we're now coming
to a point where

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:49.130 align:middle line:84%
we can have
immersive holography,

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:51.430 align:middle line:84%
and people can move
around holograms,

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:54.980 align:middle line:84%
and with ultrasonics, can
actually touch holograms.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:59.290 align:middle line:84%
So we're getting more and
more familiar with reality, 3D

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:02.770 align:middle line:90%
reality, through 2D holograms--

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:04.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Being projected.

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:08.320 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: --recreated
as an apparent 3D object.

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:10.720 align:middle line:90%
The universe does it in reverse.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.690 align:middle line:84%
Some years ago, when black holes
were beginning to be studied,

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:15.400 align:middle line:84%
there was a big
debate as to what

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:18.170 align:middle line:84%
happened when a star collapsed
under its own weight.

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And it needed to be a massive
star under its own weight.

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:23.890 align:middle line:84%
The force of gravity
was so strong

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:28.050 align:middle line:84%
that it continued to fall
in on itself beyond a point,

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:31.460 align:middle line:84%
called the event horizon,
where even light could escape--

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:33.240 align:middle line:90%
hence, black hole.

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.960 align:middle line:84%
But the question then was, what
happened to all the information

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.390 align:middle line:90%
in the star?

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And what it was realized, is
that instead of being lost,

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:45.196 align:middle line:84%
it is held on the surface
area of the black hole.

00:22:45.196 --> 00:22:47.570 align:middle line:84%
And the surface area of a
black hole-- think of a sphere,

00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:50.610 align:middle line:84%
think of a black hole as a
sphere in the event horizon--

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:52.970 align:middle line:84%
that all that
information-- garbled,

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:54.980 align:middle line:90%
but all the information--

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:57.630 align:middle line:90%
is held on that surface area.

00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:59.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, what cosmologists
have done is

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:02.750 align:middle line:84%
they've taken that example
and then extended it

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:05.330 align:middle line:84%
to the whole of our
universe to suggest

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:08.630 align:middle line:84%
that the whole of our
universe, essentially,

00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:13.205 align:middle line:84%
is a holographic projection
through its 2D boundary.

00:23:13.205 --> 00:23:14.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:14.930 align:middle line:90%
I see what you're saying.

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:15.730 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:19.310 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: So what we
experience as apparent 3D-ness

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:22.160 align:middle line:84%
is actually a 2D
holographic projection.

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And all the leading edge
theorists trying to do this

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:31.490 align:middle line:84%
reconciliation of quantum theory
and relativity are finding that

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:33.780 align:middle line:84%
they're converging on
the same perspective--

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:36.110 align:middle line:84%
it's called a
holographic principle--

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:40.220 align:middle line:84%
where the appearance of 3D
reality, physical reality,

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:44.530 align:middle line:84%
is actually a projection
of two-dimensional boundary

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:45.890 align:middle line:90%
of spacetime.

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:49.940 align:middle line:84%
And that boundary,
rather like a hologram,

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:53.880 align:middle line:84%
is pixelated with
the information.

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:58.160 align:middle line:10%
But the scale of the pixelation
of spacetime is a trillion,

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:03.620 align:middle line:10%
trillion times smaller
than our finest holograms.

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:06.121 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh my god.

00:24:06.121 --> 00:24:08.120 align:middle line:84%
That is very difficult
to get one's mind around.

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:11.750 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: They're actually
a trillion times smaller.

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:14.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's called
this Planck scale.

00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And with the Planck
scale, when we

00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:19.840 align:middle line:84%
put all the forces of
our universe together,

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:23.420 align:middle line:84%
this Planck scale, this
measure of space and time

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.880 align:middle line:84%
and energy and matter
and temperature,

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:27.620 align:middle line:90%
just naturally fall out.

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:30.050 align:middle line:84%
And they'd fall out whether
we were measuring them here

00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:34.430 align:middle line:84%
on Earth or in a galaxy far, far
away in a long, long time ago.

00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:35.230 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:37.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is just flowing
in out of nowhere.

00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:39.509 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to take a little
side trip for just a moment,

00:24:39.509 --> 00:24:42.680 align:middle line:84%
and then go back into more
of the linear progression

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.850 align:middle line:90%
of this conversation.

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:47.720 align:middle line:84%
I remember years ago-- and I
can't tell you whether it was

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.580 align:middle line:90%
a dream or a crossover state--

00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:52.580 align:middle line:84%
I was looking at information--
information being stored

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:54.230 align:middle line:90%
and where information is.

00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:55.990 align:middle line:90%
And the thing that showed up--

00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:58.850 align:middle line:84%
and at the time, visually, it
made a lot of sense to me--

00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:02.030 align:middle line:84%
is essentially it was a
grid with vector points.

00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:04.160 align:middle line:84%
And there was a certain
resonance at vector points

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:07.790 align:middle line:84%
that would almost grab or
contain pixels of information

00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:12.290 align:middle line:84%
and hold it there to be
stored and then reactivated

00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:13.640 align:middle line:90%
when needed or necessary.

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:16.185 align:middle line:84%
Does that make any sense
within this picture?

00:25:16.185 --> 00:25:17.060 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: It does.

00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:20.870 align:middle line:10%
Because I'm not saying that
the boundary of spacetime

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:24.080 align:middle line:10%
is spherical, but it's
easy to visualize.

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:26.850 align:middle line:10%
My sense is we'll find
that it is a torus.

00:25:26.850 --> 00:25:27.650 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:28.584 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that makes sense.

00:25:28.584 --> 00:25:30.500 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: But let's
look at it as a sphere,

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:32.610 align:middle line:84%
just because it's
easier to visualize.

00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:36.470 align:middle line:84%
The idea of the pixelation of
the information of everything

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:39.980 align:middle line:84%
that is being, that has happened
in our universe till now,

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:42.020 align:middle line:84%
is pixelated at
this Planck scale

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:45.170 align:middle line:84%
with one bit of information
at each Planck scale area.

00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:46.920 align:middle line:84%
And the Planck scale
areas are triangular.

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:48.253 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, it's interesting.

00:25:48.253 --> 00:25:50.327 align:middle line:84%
I was seeing it as a grid,
at these grid points,

00:25:50.327 --> 00:25:51.535 align:middle line:90%
but it's actually triangular.

00:25:51.535 --> 00:25:52.355 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: Yeah,
the pixelation--

00:25:52.355 --> 00:25:53.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But it's
still at the points?

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:54.320 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: Yes.

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:55.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
what I was seeing.

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: Essentially it is.

00:25:57.270 --> 00:26:01.040 align:middle line:84%
So the idea also of the
akasha and the Akashic record

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:02.480 align:middle line:90%
is very much part of that.

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:06.850 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the reasons that
I describe in the book for,

00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:09.410 align:middle line:90%
why does space expand?

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:12.140 align:middle line:84%
If you think of our universe--
again, think of it as spherical

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:13.750 align:middle line:90%
and think of it as a balloon.

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:18.230 align:middle line:84%
So it began 13.8 billion years
ago at its smallest scale,

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:20.900 align:middle line:84%
rather like blowing
up a balloon--

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:22.700 align:middle line:90%
the big breath.

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:25.760 align:middle line:84%
Time flows, because
the flow of time

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:28.275 align:middle line:84%
is the accumulation
of information.

00:26:28.275 --> 00:26:30.410 align:middle line:84%
There was less information
in our universe

00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:33.560 align:middle line:84%
yesterday than there is
today and there is tomorrow.

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:35.660 align:middle line:84%
But all that
information is being

00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:38.210 align:middle line:84%
held at the boundary
of spacetime,

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:39.940 align:middle line:90%
the surface of the balloon.

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:43.610 align:middle line:84%
So space has to expand,
so more and more and more.

00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:45.560 align:middle line:84%
It's not that the
pixels grow bigger--

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:48.870 align:middle line:84%
more and more of them
come into existence.

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:52.400 align:middle line:84%
So what this does is allow
our universe not just

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:54.062 align:middle line:90%
to exist, but to evolve.

00:26:54.062 --> 00:26:55.520 align:middle line:84%
Because it's that
learning process.

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:56.944 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And to expand.

00:26:56.944 --> 00:26:58.610 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: It has
to expand to evolve.

00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:02.460 align:middle line:84%
Because time, the flow of time,
and the expansion of space--

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:05.990 align:middle line:84%
which is why spacetime
have to be put together--

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:10.010 align:middle line:90%
enables our universe to evolve.

00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:12.440 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And there are
logarithmic patterns that play

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:14.720 align:middle line:84%
into this, so let's get
into that part of it.

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.880 align:middle line:84%
Because, again, when we go
to the digital language,

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:18.290 align:middle line:90%
people understand that.

00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:19.250 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: They do.

00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:20.330 align:middle line:90%
They do.

00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:25.735 align:middle line:84%
And logarithms are
musical, in a sense.

00:27:25.735 --> 00:27:27.160 align:middle line:90%
They're frequencies.

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:31.550 align:middle line:84%
They double, they-- whatever
the base of the log is,

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:35.630 align:middle line:84%
you're doubling or you're
increasing at a different rate.

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:41.380 align:middle line:84%
But fractals are innately both
logarithmic and holographic.

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:44.120 align:middle line:84%
And the physics
and the mathematics

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:49.260 align:middle line:84%
of the hologram and fractals
and logarithms is innate.

00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:51.450 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely as one.

00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:54.740 align:middle line:84%
And it does explain and
underpin the laws of physics.

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:57.890 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing, talking
about algorithms and all

00:27:57.890 --> 00:28:01.140 align:middle line:84%
of this, is that the laws
of physics themselves

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:02.030 align:middle line:90%
are algorithms.

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:05.030 align:middle line:84%
They're instructions
to our universe

00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:07.790 align:middle line:90%
as to how to exist and evolve.

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And they, themselves, are
the simplest they could be.

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:13.610 align:middle line:10%
Which is why in the
book, I track these two

00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:16.880 align:middle line:10%
laws of thermodynamics to two
laws of informational info

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:17.900 align:middle line:10%
dynamics.

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:20.240 align:middle line:84%
But in that is the
whole of physics.

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:22.550 align:middle line:90%
In that is the whole of physics.

00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:25.820 align:middle line:84%
Because the first law,
which talks about energy,

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:28.280 align:middle line:84%
we expand it to
energy and matter.

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And it basically ends up saying
that all information expressed

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:36.610 align:middle line:84%
as energy matter in our
universe is conserved.

00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:39.809 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it changes its
form, but it remains the same.

00:28:39.809 --> 00:28:41.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, but it remains.

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:41.330 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:43.040 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: But it's the
second law that's the clincher--

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:44.450 align:middle line:90%
and that's quantum physics.

00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:45.740 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, Yes.

00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:49.220 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: The second law is
really the key or the clincher.

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:51.590 align:middle line:84%
Because the second
law of thermodynamics

00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:54.870 align:middle line:84%
says that the
entropy of a system,

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:57.950 align:middle line:84%
a closed system, always
increases through time.

00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:59.530 align:middle line:90%
Now, 150 years ago--

00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:01.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And explain the
word entropy for people.

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:02.570 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: I will do this now.

00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:04.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because there is
a lot of misunderstanding.

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:05.510 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: Absolutely.

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:06.884 align:middle line:84%
And this is one
of the key things

00:29:06.884 --> 00:29:08.630 align:middle line:90%
that we need to clear up.

00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:12.020 align:middle line:84%
People often think of
entropy as order to disorder.

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:15.170 align:middle line:10%
But actually, when
Ludwig Boltzmann first

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:17.690 align:middle line:10%
looked at this
concept of entropy

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:21.020 align:middle line:10%
in his behavior of gases,
he said, no, no, it's

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:23.430 align:middle line:10%
the microstates of a system.

00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:25.850 align:middle line:10%
In other words, how
many ways can a system

00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:28.020 align:middle line:10%
be organized within itself?

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:30.360 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if I
have a pack of cards,

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:32.480 align:middle line:84%
and I take them out of
the cellophane pack,

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:33.440 align:middle line:90%
they're in order.

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:34.310 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:37.730 align:middle line:84%
Throw them up in the air,
they land all over the place.

00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:41.940 align:middle line:84%
That's not just a disorder, but
it's more states of a system.

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:42.740 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:45.500 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: If I take this
cup, which is quite ordered--

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:48.530 align:middle line:84%
and delicious tea within
it, thank you very much--

00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:51.380 align:middle line:84%
and knock it over-- which
I'm very capable of doing--

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:53.510 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't go from
order to disorder,

00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:56.150 align:middle line:84%
but it actually has more
microstates in that system.

00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:57.920 align:middle line:84%
There's more
environmental connection.

00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:59.150 align:middle line:90%
It spills on the carpet.

00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:00.560 align:middle line:84%
I hope it doesn't
spill on your trousers.

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:02.170 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's
implicated in much more.

00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:03.128 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: Much more.

00:30:03.128 --> 00:30:04.050 align:middle line:90%
Much more.

00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:08.150 align:middle line:84%
But by restating the
entropy of a system

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:12.560 align:middle line:84%
instead of the number of
microstates of it, as in a gas,

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:15.380 align:middle line:84%
more recently
information theorists

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:18.260 align:middle line:84%
have shown the same equation
that Boltzmann came up

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:24.360 align:middle line:84%
with is exactly the
same as that to describe

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:28.170 align:middle line:84%
the informational
content of a system.

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:30.920 align:middle line:84%
So if we think of this cup,
if it was a closed system,

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:34.040 align:middle line:84%
has so much information,
but then spills everywhere,

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:36.440 align:middle line:84%
and we see this room
as a bigger system,

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:40.730 align:middle line:84%
then actually that spilled
cup has more information.

00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And if we were to actually
video that spilling,

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:47.240 align:middle line:84%
we'd know from just
looking at the video which

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.650 align:middle line:90%
way time flowed.

00:30:48.650 --> 00:30:51.650 align:middle line:84%
Because the time will always
flow from less information

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:53.360 align:middle line:90%
content to more information.

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:54.750 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:56.890 align:middle line:84%
I've never heard entropy
explained this way.

00:30:56.890 --> 00:30:58.640 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: And that
is the flow of time.

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's what "The Cosmic
Hologram" is all about.

00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:06.560 align:middle line:84%
It's the flow of time itself
and the expansion of space

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:09.050 align:middle line:84%
when pulled together
in relativity

00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:11.450 align:middle line:84%
that are the second
law when it's

00:31:11.450 --> 00:31:15.170 align:middle line:84%
restated from thermodynamics
to information info dynamics.

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:18.590 align:middle line:84%
So we've got the first law
now as a description-- quantum

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:20.120 align:middle line:90%
theory, energy matter.

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:23.000 align:middle line:84%
You've got the second
law now as a description

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.010 align:middle line:90%
of relativity and spacetime.

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:28.215 align:middle line:84%
But they're both restated
in terms of information.

00:31:28.215 --> 00:31:31.312 align:middle line:90%
And that's the reconciliation.

00:31:31.312 --> 00:31:33.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now, this is another
one of those non-sequiturs,

00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:36.170 align:middle line:84%
in that, when you're
speaking, I'm listening to you

00:31:36.170 --> 00:31:39.140 align:middle line:84%
and feeling this incredible
harmony in the story that

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:40.430 align:middle line:90%
you're putting forward--

00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:42.980 align:middle line:90%
a kind of coherence, right?

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And then I think
of human beings.

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:46.550 align:middle line:90%
And I think, what is it?

00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:49.010 align:middle line:84%
We seem to be living out
of sync with almost all

00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:53.659 align:middle line:84%
of these kind of flows of
information in certain ways.

00:31:53.659 --> 00:31:55.200 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of a
rough way to put it,

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:56.533 align:middle line:90%
but do you know what I'm saying?

00:31:56.533 --> 00:31:59.360 align:middle line:84%
Thus, there's so much disease
and dysfunction and disorder

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:01.830 align:middle line:90%
and lack of harmony.

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:05.590 align:middle line:10%
>> CURRIVAN: I guess part of
my curiosity in life has been

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:06.450 align:middle line:10%
to go back--

00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:08.400 align:middle line:10%
as well as looking forward
and being present--

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:10.680 align:middle line:10%
is to look back as
early as I could--

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:12.390 align:middle line:10%
and perhaps some of
our hidden history.

00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
spiritual traditions,

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:16.590 align:middle line:84%
there are many wisdom
teachings, there

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:19.650 align:middle line:84%
are many metaphysical
teachings that

00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:22.950 align:middle line:84%
suggest that our psyche,
our collective psyche,

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:27.300 align:middle line:84%
goes through cycles of
remembering and dismembering.

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:28.570 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And my sense is that we've
been through a process--

00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:33.300 align:middle line:90%
an exciting process--

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:36.300 align:middle line:84%
of taking our, if you
like, our materialistic

00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:38.760 align:middle line:90%
curiosity to its extreme.

00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:42.150 align:middle line:84%
But as a result, we've been
dismembering our psyche.

00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:46.440 align:middle line:10%
And my sense is that actually,
now, we have the opportunity.

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:48.310 align:middle line:84%
Because so many
threads are converging.

00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:50.160 align:middle line:84%
It's all of this
we're talking about.

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:52.440 align:middle line:84%
There are so many other
threads that are converging.

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:54.360 align:middle line:90%
People are waking up.

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:59.850 align:middle line:84%
And so my sense is that this is
a great time of us remembering

00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:00.822 align:middle line:90%
who we really are.

00:33:00.822 --> 00:33:02.280 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
I agree with that.

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And we'll probably do something
toward that end at the end

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:06.220 align:middle line:90%
of this conversation.

00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:09.930 align:middle line:84%
OK, getting back on track again,
Darwin's theory of evolution

00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:13.620 align:middle line:84%
and the notion of
emergent phenomena

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:15.359 align:middle line:90%
and what inspires that.

00:33:15.359 --> 00:33:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And I will say a couple
of days ago I interviewed

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:19.020 align:middle line:90%
Rupert Sheldrake again--

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:21.870 align:middle line:84%
and the whole notion of
morphogenetic fields.

00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And even going further than
that, what is inspiring

00:33:25.290 --> 00:33:29.430 align:middle line:84%
that passed on memory or
the emergent phenomena

00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:32.705 align:middle line:84%
to create a species
to begin with?

00:33:32.705 --> 00:33:34.580 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: Well, I'm
a great fan of Rupert.

00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:36.913 align:middle line:84%
I think he's a wonderful work
and has been an incredibly

00:33:36.913 --> 00:33:39.540 align:middle line:90%
courageous pioneer of this.

00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:41.100 align:middle line:84%
And you can actually
see what he's

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:44.850 align:middle line:84%
saying in the context,
the bigger picture context

00:33:44.850 --> 00:33:46.590 align:middle line:90%
of "The Cosmic Hologram."

00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:48.990 align:middle line:84%
Because what we
have is a universe

00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:52.260 align:middle line:84%
that exists and evolves
as a unified entity.

00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:56.880 align:middle line:84%
And the accumulation of
the past has been a process

00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:59.280 align:middle line:90%
from simplicity to complexity.

00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:01.680 align:middle line:84%
But the progress of
emergence, I think,

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:03.690 align:middle line:90%
is a really interesting one.

00:34:03.690 --> 00:34:05.490 align:middle line:84%
Because what it's
suggesting is that there

00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:08.820 align:middle line:84%
is a potentiality of
templating for what

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:10.770 align:middle line:90%
is becoming more coherent.

00:34:10.770 --> 00:34:13.679 align:middle line:84%
And there's something
called flickering

00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:19.980 align:middle line:84%
in systems theory, where we look
at how complex systems change.

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:24.239 align:middle line:84%
They exist on the
edge of order chaos.

00:34:24.239 --> 00:34:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And that actually
is very sensible,

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:28.739 align:middle line:84%
because that's their
greatest flexibility.

00:34:28.739 --> 00:34:32.380 align:middle line:84%
It actually gives them a
level of stability, too.

00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:36.690 align:middle line:84%
But the point is that when
a system is being pushed

00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:42.060 align:middle line:84%
by various factors beyond
that edge of stability,

00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:43.500 align:middle line:90%
two things can happen.

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:46.139 align:middle line:84%
It either breaks
down into chaos.

00:34:46.139 --> 00:34:48.780 align:middle line:84%
But even in that chaos,
there's little whirlpools

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:51.370 align:middle line:90%
of potential resurgence.

00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:54.109 align:middle line:84%
But also what happens is
there's another, what's called,

00:34:54.109 --> 00:34:54.909 align:middle line:90%
an attractor.

00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:57.540 align:middle line:84%
Because this is an attractor
basin of that, whatever

00:34:57.540 --> 00:34:59.550 align:middle line:90%
it may be, an ecosystem.

00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:01.750 align:middle line:90%
And it's like a bowl of water.

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:05.100 align:middle line:84%
If the bowl of water is quite
full, but is reasonably stable,

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:07.320 align:middle line:84%
the water doesn't
slosh all over.

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:09.510 align:middle line:84%
But if it becomes
less and less stable,

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:13.530 align:middle line:84%
the water's going everywhere
and it's starting to break down.

00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:16.650 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, what
happens in emergent processes,

00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:22.380 align:middle line:84%
there's a higher level of
possibility being crystallized,

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:23.890 align:middle line:90%
being potentized.

00:35:23.890 --> 00:35:25.950 align:middle line:90%
But not in the physical.

00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:28.893 align:middle line:84%
This is at the level
that's pre-physicalized.

00:35:28.893 --> 00:35:32.430 align:middle line:84%
So what's happening
with us at the moment

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:36.060 align:middle line:84%
is we have all of this
materialistic, duality-based

00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:38.220 align:middle line:84%
perspective and the
behaviors, and we're

00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:41.640 align:middle line:84%
like an ecosystem that's
no longer healthy.

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.920 align:middle line:84%
And yet at the same time,
there are enough people

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:48.680 align:middle line:84%
awakening and becoming aware
and becoming more coherent

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:53.580 align:middle line:84%
that this higher level attractor
is starting to potentize.

00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And then what
happens in emergence

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:59.260 align:middle line:84%
is the systems
flicker between them.

00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:01.440 align:middle line:84%
It's about me trying
to give up chocolate.

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:04.413 align:middle line:84%
I'm really good for a day, and
I'll go to the high level--

00:36:04.413 --> 00:36:07.810 align:middle line:84%
the chocolate-- but then
I'll come back to this level.

00:36:07.810 --> 00:36:08.630 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:10.830 align:middle line:90%
So it's that flickering between.

00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:14.490 align:middle line:84%
But the more this
emergent potential

00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:21.510 align:middle line:84%
is being crystallized, and it's
consciousness, then the more

00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:24.030 align:middle line:84%
that that old system,
instead of breaking down,

00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:25.750 align:middle line:90%
can break through.

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And so what we find
with the emergence

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:30.390 align:middle line:84%
and biological
emergence is that if we

00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:34.890 align:middle line:84%
take the history of Gaia,
our beloved planetary home,

00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:36.390 align:middle line:90%
evolution--

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:39.870 align:middle line:84%
I love evolution-- a bit lazy,
does the least needed, right?

00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:44.850 align:middle line:84%
So in times of real stability,
there's very little evolution.

00:36:44.850 --> 00:36:47.180 align:middle line:84%
But if those changes,
like the natural changes

00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:51.120 align:middle line:84%
in the ice ages, there's
changes in speciation.

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:52.530 align:middle line:90%
But it's slower.

00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:55.950 align:middle line:84%
But then, when there's an
extinction event or something

00:36:55.950 --> 00:36:58.230 align:middle line:84%
absolutely
catastrophic, what we've

00:36:58.230 --> 00:37:01.940 align:middle line:84%
discovered after the five
previous ones is that there's

00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:06.910 align:middle line:84%
this amazing resurgence--
incredible, new emergent

00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:12.700 align:middle line:84%
forms of awareness and
intelligence and evolution.

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:15.150 align:middle line:84%
So evolutionary processes
and emergent processes

00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:18.600 align:middle line:84%
are all aspects of
consciousness, experience,

00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:20.820 align:middle line:90%
and exploring itself.

00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:23.100 align:middle line:84%
But like me on a
day under the duvet,

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:25.462 align:middle line:84%
I ain't going to evolve if
everything's easy-peasy.

00:37:25.462 --> 00:37:28.240 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:30.260 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That is true.

00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:31.250 align:middle line:90%
We need a little push.

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:34.980 align:middle line:84%
We need a little friction
in order to move, generally.

00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:35.780 align:middle line:90%
People do.

00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:36.100 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: And a pull.

00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:37.930 align:middle line:84%
There's that sense
of a pull, as well.

00:37:37.930 --> 00:37:38.730 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:43.890 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's talk about the
impulse behind all of it.

00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:48.480 align:middle line:84%
If we're talking about the
mind behind the mind, if we're

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:51.930 align:middle line:84%
talking about the hidden
logos, an organizing

00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:56.550 align:middle line:84%
principle of thought that
must precede everything

00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:59.520 align:middle line:84%
to create the coherence
that, as you say,

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:03.630 align:middle line:84%
that starts putting energy
into energy or information

00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:04.560 align:middle line:90%
into motion.

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:05.910 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: Exactly.

00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:07.650 align:middle line:10%
What I would say is
everything that I've

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:11.280 align:middle line:10%
experienced all my life, but
certainly the perspective

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:13.640 align:middle line:10%
I'm putting forward in
"The Cosmic Hologram,"

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:16.290 align:middle line:10%
is the past is the past, which
is this whole understanding

00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:19.200 align:middle line:10%
of akasha and space expanding.

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:22.700 align:middle line:84%
So all that is being
is memorialized

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:25.600 align:middle line:90%
is the learning of our universe.

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:27.060 align:middle line:90%
But the future is not fixed.

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:28.620 align:middle line:90%
The future is not deterministic.

00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:30.850 align:middle line:90%
The future is yet to be written.

00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:33.240 align:middle line:84%
But we know that the
experiments that, for example,

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:35.740 align:middle line:84%
a friend and colleague,
Dean Radin, of mine

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:39.890 align:middle line:84%
has done at IONS, and many
others, and precognitive

00:38:39.890 --> 00:38:40.690 align:middle line:90%
experiences--

00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:42.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, I've
been in his workshops.

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:43.020 align:middle line:90%
It's really fun.

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:43.535 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: It's great.

00:38:43.535 --> 00:38:45.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's really
interesting to see how

00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:47.021 align:middle line:84%
functional his
theories actually are.

00:38:47.021 --> 00:38:48.020 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: Absolutely.

00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And he's just given me a lovely
endorsement for the book,

00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:53.580 align:middle line:84%
because he knows
that what this is

00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:57.480 align:middle line:84%
is the emergent bigger picture
framework that absolutely

00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:00.870 align:middle line:84%
validates what he's been
finding, and many, many others.

00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:04.480 align:middle line:84%
So the future is
becoming crystallized

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.850 align:middle line:84%
as it comes to the
present moment.

00:39:06.850 --> 00:39:10.080 align:middle line:84%
But that potentizing,
that potentiality,

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:14.610 align:middle line:84%
those new attractors of
greater coherence of emergence

00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:17.740 align:middle line:84%
are potentizing, and
not in the physical,

00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:21.720 align:middle line:84%
but in this more
foundational realm

00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:26.000 align:middle line:84%
of possibility and experience
and evolutionary impulse.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.960 align:middle line:84%
So as they crystallize,
they come to us

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:35.220 align:middle line:84%
so that that template is there
just before we essentially

00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:36.520 align:middle line:90%
step into it.

00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:37.320 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:42.182 align:middle line:84%
And that would be, so to
speak, a co-creative reality.

00:39:42.182 --> 00:39:43.140 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: Very much.

00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:45.098 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But is there
something that precedes

00:39:45.098 --> 00:39:46.710 align:middle line:90%
the co-creative reality?

00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:50.400 align:middle line:84%
Is there a great mind
within-- or many great minds

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:54.840 align:middle line:84%
within the cosmos that have the
potential of visioning thought

00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:59.040 align:middle line:84%
at a certain level
that's perhaps

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:01.680 align:middle line:84%
beyond our comprehension, a
certain level of creativity?

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:03.270 align:middle line:84%
Just as our level
of creativity would

00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:06.360 align:middle line:90%
be probably foreign to an ant.

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:09.690 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: Yes, I mean,
Einstein talked about cosmic

00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:10.860 align:middle line:90%
mind.

00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's very much
my perspective--

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:14.520 align:middle line:84%
that everything
we call reality--

00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:17.510 align:middle line:84%
and many realities we
have no comprehension of--

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:22.800 align:middle line:84%
but the source of all
being is an infinite

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:27.760 align:middle line:84%
and eternal cosmic mind and that
universes are finite thought

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:28.560 align:middle line:90%
forms.

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:29.640 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, exactly.

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:33.360 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: --in that
infinite eternal mind.

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:38.370 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But that word gets
basically translated into many

00:40:38.370 --> 00:40:41.130 align:middle line:84%
other words, and that's where
science becomes frightened.

00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:42.360 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: Yes.

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:45.660 align:middle line:84%
And my sense is that
science has an opportunity

00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:47.160 align:middle line:84%
to be really part
of the solution.

00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:51.360 align:middle line:84%
Because, for me, this is
so exciting and has so many

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:53.880 align:middle line:84%
opportunities for
science to grow up--

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:56.250 align:middle line:84%
as well as us growing
up, collectively--

00:40:56.250 --> 00:40:59.640 align:middle line:84%
I feel science itself and its
methodologies can grow up.

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:01.500 align:middle line:90%
And there is a way forward.

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.660 align:middle line:10%
Another friend of mine,
Professor Max Velmans,

00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:06.140 align:middle line:10%
wrote a book called
"Understanding Consciousness."

00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:07.590 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote in
that how we could

00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:09.870 align:middle line:84%
expand the scientific
methodology

00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:13.230 align:middle line:84%
to be both the first person
and the third person.

00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:14.880 align:middle line:10%
Because the problem
is that science

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:17.430 align:middle line:10%
has just tried to see
everything from a third person

00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:18.870 align:middle line:10%
perspective.

00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:21.960 align:middle line:84%
But we now realize, as
everything is interconnected

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:24.700 align:middle line:84%
and reality is
essentially unified,

00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:26.850 align:middle line:84%
that we have to
actually bring together

00:41:26.850 --> 00:41:31.984 align:middle line:84%
that first person perspective of
reality with that third person.

00:41:31.984 --> 00:41:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, you and
I could change places.

00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:38.100 align:middle line:84%
If I was a scientist trying to
understand what was going on

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:42.360 align:middle line:84%
within you or how
you see the world,

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:44.490 align:middle line:84%
you would have your
first person perspective,

00:41:44.490 --> 00:41:47.550 align:middle line:84%
I would have the third
person, looking at you

00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:51.020 align:middle line:84%
and measuring you and whatever
I would or hearing your story.

00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:52.470 align:middle line:90%
But we could swap places--

00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:56.130 align:middle line:84%
you could put the white coat on
and I could sit in your jeans.

00:41:56.130 --> 00:41:58.930 align:middle line:84%
And you could be the scientist
saying, oh, I can measure this.

00:41:58.930 --> 00:42:00.265 align:middle line:90%
I can see this.

00:42:00.265 --> 00:42:02.600 align:middle line:10%
Now, Jude, what are
you experiencing?

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:04.070 align:middle line:90%
We need to bring them together.

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And there's a scientific
way of doing that, but it's

00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:08.760 align:middle line:84%
a science that recognizes
that consciousness

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:10.520 align:middle line:84%
isn't what we have, it's what
we in the hard world are.

00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:11.360 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Are.

00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And this has been perturbing
to a lot of scientists,

00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:17.420 align:middle line:90%
because it's a missing element.

00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:20.720 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is the
answer to the solution

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:22.880 align:middle line:84%
they're looking for, but
they will not go there.

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And it almost seems
as though as long

00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:29.514 align:middle line:84%
as we remain within a
materialistic reference--

00:42:29.514 --> 00:42:30.430 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: We can't.

00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:33.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --that you can have
somehow control and mastery

00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:36.530 align:middle line:90%
over the material world.

00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And if you look
to something that

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.480 align:middle line:84%
is far greater in its
thought form capabilities,

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:44.870 align:middle line:84%
you would be reduced
to something less than

00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:47.540 align:middle line:84%
rather than understanding
you're a co-creative part

00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:50.750 align:middle line:84%
of that very thing, and you
can even be more than anything

00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:53.510 align:middle line:84%
the material world
ever had to offer you

00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:55.635 align:middle line:84%
in your systems of
control as a scientist.

00:42:55.635 --> 00:42:56.510 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: Exactly.

00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:59.615 align:middle line:84%
And not just as a scientist, but
as a person, as a human being.

00:42:59.615 --> 00:42:59.900 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And as a person.

00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:00.620 align:middle line:90%
Right, of course.

00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:02.780 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: Because I
think this is exactly that.

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:05.560 align:middle line:90%
This is so empowering.

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:08.094 align:middle line:84%
Materialistic reductionism
and this myth of separation--

00:43:08.094 --> 00:43:09.260 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's so limiting.

00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:10.910 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: --it's so limiting.

00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:14.765 align:middle line:84%
And when we are able to
understand this and experience

00:43:14.765 --> 00:43:16.240 align:middle line:90%
it and embody it--

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:17.360 align:middle line:90%
my goodness.

00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:20.660 align:middle line:84%
I just feel as a
species, we're like when

00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:23.630 align:middle line:84%
you and I were three years old,
and it was first day of school.

00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And we hadn't even
learned about writing,

00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:29.060 align:middle line:90%
let alone joined up writing.

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:33.830 align:middle line:84%
So as a species, we have
gone through these spirals

00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:36.590 align:middle line:90%
of remembering, dismembering.

00:43:36.590 --> 00:43:40.040 align:middle line:84%
And I hope and trust that we're
on this verge of remembering.

00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:44.870 align:middle line:84%
But this remembering, I feel,
is a leap of conscious evolution

00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:47.360 align:middle line:90%
that is--

00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:50.420 align:middle line:84%
I can't even really
imagine what it could be.

00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:52.850 align:middle line:84%
But even to really
become galactic humans,

00:43:52.850 --> 00:43:56.480 align:middle line:84%
universal humans,
actual, conscious,

00:43:56.480 --> 00:44:00.290 align:middle line:84%
microcosmic creators
with our universe's

00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:01.610 align:middle line:90%
evolutionary impulse.

00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:02.720 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And looking at these waves
of consciousness-- expansion,

00:44:06.530 --> 00:44:09.440 align:middle line:84%
contraction, remembering,
dismembering--

00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:13.239 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of years ago, the
scientists were philosophers--

00:44:13.239 --> 00:44:14.530 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: Indeed, they were.

00:44:14.530 --> 00:44:14.990 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --by nature.

00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:16.370 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: They were called
natural philosophers before

00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:17.720 align:middle line:90%
they were called scientists.

00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:21.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so what
that did is it gave context

00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:22.940 align:middle line:90%
to their discoveries.

00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:24.170 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: Yes.

00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:27.622 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that is what's
been lost in modern science.

00:44:27.622 --> 00:44:28.580 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: Very much.

00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:32.300 align:middle line:84%
And the pioneers, both of
relativity and quantum physics,

00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:36.440 align:middle line:84%
were generally
natural philosophers.

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:40.360 align:middle line:84%
Max Planck, for instance,
Einstein, of course,

00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:43.110 align:middle line:90%
and many others--

00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:45.980 align:middle line:84%
Planck talked about
mind being primary.

00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:49.100 align:middle line:84%
I think he absolutely understood
they're not just primary,

00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:50.510 align:middle line:90%
but is, you know?

00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:52.070 align:middle line:90%
Everything is mine.

00:44:52.070 --> 00:44:56.540 align:middle line:84%
John Archibald Wheeler, who
coined the term black holes,

00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:57.930 align:middle line:90%
talked of it.

00:44:57.930 --> 00:45:01.690 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the appearance,
the physical world, from bit--

00:45:01.690 --> 00:45:03.200 align:middle line:90%
from digitized information.

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And now we're realizing
that it is bit.

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:10.280 align:middle line:84%
So there have been
scientists and pioneers

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:15.470 align:middle line:84%
all the way through who have
really not just reconciled,

00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:18.590 align:middle line:84%
but fully integrated
this perspective.

00:45:18.590 --> 00:45:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And yet, I think you're
absolutely right.

00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:22.326 align:middle line:90%
We know this.

00:45:22.326 --> 00:45:24.950 align:middle line:84%
I think the thing that happens,
and certainly over the last few

00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:29.280 align:middle line:84%
generations-- and it was
certainly beginning when I was

00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:31.520 align:middle line:84%
at Oxford back in
the early '70s--

00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:35.990 align:middle line:84%
was this use of science
to support technologies.

00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, scientists became
more and more technologists.

00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:41.480 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
survey done recently

00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:44.780 align:middle line:84%
of quantum physicists asking
what their interest was

00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:46.370 align:middle line:90%
in the nature of reality.

00:45:46.370 --> 00:45:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And a disturbingly
high proportion

00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:50.180 align:middle line:90%
said they didn't care.

00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:51.215 align:middle line:84%
And these are
quantum physicists.

00:45:51.215 --> 00:45:52.010 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Ooh, ooh, ooh.

00:45:52.010 --> 00:45:53.590 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: These are the
geeks of geeks, you know?

00:45:53.590 --> 00:45:54.010 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's dangerous.

00:45:54.010 --> 00:45:55.790 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: And if quantum
physicists don't have

00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:58.520 align:middle line:84%
a curiosity and a willingness
to go where the evidence leads,

00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:00.690 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the
nature of reality,

00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:03.500 align:middle line:84%
the other scientists just
fall off the back of that.

00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:05.130 align:middle line:90%
That is dangerous.

00:46:05.130 --> 00:46:09.260 align:middle line:10%
And I was both saddened
to hear that, but also I

00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:11.720 align:middle line:10%
think the younger physicists--

00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:15.440 align:middle line:10%
physicists and scientists get
in because they are curious.

00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:18.200 align:middle line:84%
But often they're told, and
they're in environments,

00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:21.290 align:middle line:84%
that they're not allowed
to follow the evidence.

00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:22.910 align:middle line:84%
Because it's going
to lead to places

00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:26.640 align:middle line:84%
that the vested interests
and the people with status

00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:29.630 align:middle line:84%
and all the rest of it
don't want it to go.

00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:31.040 align:middle line:90%
And Thomas Kuhn, of course--

00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:35.450 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS]---- who coined the word
paradigm shift talked about

00:46:35.450 --> 00:46:38.870 align:middle line:84%
paradigm shifts progressing
through funerals.

00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:41.730 align:middle line:84%
I hope we don't need to do that,
because this is too urgent.

00:46:41.730 --> 00:46:42.900 align:middle line:90%
This is too important.

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:44.820 align:middle line:90%
This isn't about just science.

00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:46.550 align:middle line:90%
It's about all of us.

00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:48.240 align:middle line:90%
How do we live our lives?

00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:50.667 align:middle line:84%
How do we see ourselves
in each other?

00:46:50.667 --> 00:46:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, I have
great faith in the younger

00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:55.083 align:middle line:84%
generation-- the millennials
and younger, in particular.

00:46:55.083 --> 00:46:56.550 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: Me too.

00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:59.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because they're not
necessarily buying the status

00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:02.124 align:middle line:84%
quo on any level anymore,
and so their minds are free

00:47:02.124 --> 00:47:03.290 align:middle line:90%
to contemplate these things.

00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:07.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it'll take the
death of their forerunners.

00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:09.020 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
go there anyway.

00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:10.160 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: I agree.

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what, for
me, is so exciting, that I'm

00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:13.920 align:middle line:90%
realizing.

00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think we were talking
earlier, there are so many

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:20.330 align:middle line:84%
shoots off this, what I
call, a unity awareness.

00:47:20.330 --> 00:47:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And unity consciousness is
really gaining traction.

00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's look at the
notion that our reality is more

00:47:30.290 --> 00:47:34.040 align:middle line:84%
and more being likened to
a gigantic computer model

00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:38.840 align:middle line:84%
of reality, randomly
generated information,

00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:39.920 align:middle line:90%
as a computer model.

00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:41.711 align:middle line:84%
Because more people
are understanding that,

00:47:41.711 --> 00:47:43.820 align:middle line:90%
that this is a digital reality.

00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:46.010 align:middle line:90%
That it is an illusion.

00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:48.290 align:middle line:84%
That what we see and
experience is an illusion.

00:47:48.290 --> 00:47:50.270 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
difference in the way

00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:53.360 align:middle line:84%
you see that, quote,
"illusion," versus the way

00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:56.360 align:middle line:84%
that the people that are
looking at it in a digital sense

00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:58.490 align:middle line:90%
see that illusion.

00:47:58.490 --> 00:48:01.100 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: Well, first of all,
I'd argue the word illusion.

00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:02.680 align:middle line:84%
Because often
people say the word

00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:05.330 align:middle line:84%
"maya," which is an
ancient Indian word that

00:48:05.330 --> 00:48:07.850 align:middle line:90%
can be translated as illusion.

00:48:07.850 --> 00:48:10.385 align:middle line:84%
It can also be
translated as partial.

00:48:10.385 --> 00:48:11.510 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:11.840 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:12.640 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: Yes.

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And so my sense is that
as we sort of wake up

00:48:15.770 --> 00:48:18.710 align:middle line:84%
to this larger
understanding of reality,

00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:21.920 align:middle line:84%
we realize that the material
realm is just partial.

00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:25.430 align:middle line:84%
It's a realm of consciousness
experiencing itself

00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:28.380 align:middle line:84%
and learning and growing
and all the rest of it.

00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:31.580 align:middle line:84%
So I would not say that the
physical world isn't real--

00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:32.600 align:middle line:90%
it is real.

00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:36.260 align:middle line:84%
What isn't real, what
is truly an illusion,

00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:38.460 align:middle line:90%
is the appearance of separation.

00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:39.260 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:42.410 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: And yet separation
of the appearance of separation

00:48:42.410 --> 00:48:44.750 align:middle line:84%
is also how we learn
from each other.

00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:45.932 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, we have
to learn through some kind

00:48:45.932 --> 00:48:46.500 align:middle line:90%
of contrast.

00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:47.430 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: Exactly.

00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:48.230 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:50.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: If there's
nothing but it and self,

00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:51.984 align:middle line:90%
how would we learn?

00:48:51.984 --> 00:48:54.400 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: I don't know that
we could or can't even have

00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:55.170 align:middle line:90%
a sense.

00:48:55.170 --> 00:48:55.970 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:48:55.970 --> 00:48:58.530 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: So let's not sort
of say, oh, separations are--

00:48:58.530 --> 00:48:59.640 align:middle line:90%
it isn't.

00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:02.610 align:middle line:84%
It's when we get into
a mindset that that's

00:49:02.610 --> 00:49:05.940 align:middle line:84%
all there is and we
really are separate,

00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:09.450 align:middle line:84%
and to get that extreme
materialism so that we

00:49:09.450 --> 00:49:13.660 align:middle line:84%
forget the ultimate
unity and oneness

00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:17.580 align:middle line:84%
and think that the
separation is just the thing,

00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:20.280 align:middle line:84%
then we act from that
place of separation.

00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:23.710 align:middle line:84%
And so, when we
remember the unity,

00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:26.640 align:middle line:84%
but come from a place
of unity and diversity--

00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:31.410 align:middle line:84%
because unity and
consciousness loves diversity.

00:49:31.410 --> 00:49:33.900 align:middle line:84%
Because again, it's
the maximum opportunity

00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:37.830 align:middle line:84%
to experience and learn
and grow and evolve.

00:49:37.830 --> 00:49:40.140 align:middle line:84%
But it's when we mistake
that unity and diversity

00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:42.690 align:middle line:90%
for separation that's the issue.

00:49:42.690 --> 00:49:45.780 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's an interesting
kind of line to play.

00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:49.260 align:middle line:84%
Because on one level,
a lot of people,

00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:51.330 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of people
watching this interview,

00:49:51.330 --> 00:49:56.970 align:middle line:84%
are really looking to go
into the experience of unity,

00:49:56.970 --> 00:50:00.780 align:middle line:84%
of non-separation,
of non-duality

00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:04.290 align:middle line:84%
through meditative practices
and so forth, and visualize

00:50:04.290 --> 00:50:06.990 align:middle line:84%
being a drop in the
ocean that's merging

00:50:06.990 --> 00:50:09.870 align:middle line:84%
with all of the other
drops in the ocean.

00:50:09.870 --> 00:50:16.405 align:middle line:84%
And thus, also shunning our
material physical reality.

00:50:16.405 --> 00:50:17.280 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: Exactly.

00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:18.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And we can't do that.

00:50:18.690 --> 00:50:20.760 align:middle line:84%
This is where we
learn, is through

00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:22.480 align:middle line:90%
the contrast in this reality.

00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:25.530 align:middle line:84%
So I'd love for you to tell
us, on a personal level, how

00:50:25.530 --> 00:50:30.720 align:middle line:84%
you utilize and bridge these
two processes and potentials

00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:34.830 align:middle line:90%
and also gifts of being human.

00:50:34.830 --> 00:50:36.507 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: I
feel this is vital,

00:50:36.507 --> 00:50:37.840 align:middle line:90%
because you're absolutely right.

00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:41.850 align:middle line:84%
We've got one aspect in
our collective psyche

00:50:41.850 --> 00:50:44.310 align:middle line:84%
that is still in the
materialistic appearance

00:50:44.310 --> 00:50:46.350 align:middle line:90%
of separation.

00:50:46.350 --> 00:50:50.310 align:middle line:84%
We've got another growing
aspect of our psyche, which

00:50:50.310 --> 00:50:52.220 align:middle line:90%
is going in that inner sense.

00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And as we go within, we remember
that's our natural connectivity

00:50:59.190 --> 00:51:03.000 align:middle line:90%
with the nature of reality.

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.070 align:middle line:84%
The danger, as well
as the opportunity

00:51:05.070 --> 00:51:09.270 align:middle line:84%
of that in a journey,
is that we pull away

00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:12.460 align:middle line:84%
from the ostensibly
outer journey.

00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:15.720 align:middle line:84%
And so for me, it's how do we
balance the inner and outer?

00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:18.090 align:middle line:84%
Realizing that they are
just different sides

00:51:18.090 --> 00:51:23.610 align:middle line:84%
of the same coin of
overall unified reality.

00:51:23.610 --> 00:51:25.620 align:middle line:10%
And both are vital--

00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:30.570 align:middle line:10%
remembering the oneness of the
ocean, but also appreciating

00:51:30.570 --> 00:51:33.750 align:middle line:10%
and honoring the
individuation of the droplet.

00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:34.560 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:37.770 align:middle line:10%
>> CURRIVAN: And if we went
from a process of nothing is

00:51:37.770 --> 00:51:41.550 align:middle line:10%
accidental, everything is
meaningful and purposeful,

00:51:41.550 --> 00:51:47.050 align:middle line:10%
cosmic mind didn't co-create
the appearance of all of this,

00:51:47.050 --> 00:51:49.270 align:middle line:10%
just so that we could
go into a gray gloop.

00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:50.550 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:51:50.550 --> 00:51:52.850 align:middle line:84%
This is the way I
have always seen it.

00:51:52.850 --> 00:51:55.680 align:middle line:84%
We are still individuated
consciousness, even

00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:56.700 align:middle line:90%
within the ocean.

00:51:56.700 --> 00:51:59.430 align:middle line:84%
We retain our
individuation and integrity

00:51:59.430 --> 00:52:03.085 align:middle line:84%
of the uniqueness that is
our signature, energetically.

00:52:03.085 --> 00:52:03.960 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: Exactly.

00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And that gives us meaning
and purpose, both as

00:52:07.770 --> 00:52:11.850 align:middle line:84%
that individuated
microcosmic co-creator

00:52:11.850 --> 00:52:14.160 align:middle line:84%
of the intelligence
of our universe

00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:16.740 align:middle line:84%
and the infinite
and eternal cosmos.

00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And it also supports and
nurtures our remembering

00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:23.820 align:middle line:90%
of that ultimate unity.

00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:25.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's very much,
how do we turn

00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:31.860 align:middle line:84%
from the collective perspective
of just material separation,

00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:34.420 align:middle line:84%
just turn around and
look the other way?

00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And we, instead of coming
from materialistic separation,

00:52:37.650 --> 00:52:39.660 align:middle line:84%
we come from unity,
but expressed

00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:43.094 align:middle line:84%
through the most incredible
abundance of diversity.

00:52:43.094 --> 00:52:44.010 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:52:44.010 --> 00:52:49.960 align:middle line:84%
Because it is about bringing
harmony between self and other,

00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:55.500 align:middle line:84%
that is the ultimate joy and
should be the ultimate goal

00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:57.820 align:middle line:90%
of being alive and being human.

00:52:57.820 --> 00:53:00.660 align:middle line:84%
Then you're actually
sensing that unity while

00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:02.800 align:middle line:84%
in these individuated
physical forms.

00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:04.290 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: Exactly.

00:53:04.290 --> 00:53:08.190 align:middle line:90%
I talk about me and we and all.

00:53:08.190 --> 00:53:12.840 align:middle line:84%
And this is head, heart,
and hands understanding

00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:16.800 align:middle line:84%
and experiencing, embodying
unity awareness, unity

00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:21.720 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, through exactly
this relational with ourselves,

00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:24.509 align:middle line:84%
with each other, with
our beloved Gaia,

00:53:24.509 --> 00:53:25.425 align:middle line:90%
with the whole cosmos.

00:53:25.425 --> 00:53:28.380 align:middle line:90%


00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:32.340 align:middle line:84%
You started on this-- and this
is where I get very grumpy--

00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:35.580 align:middle line:84%
is this interpretation
as we're a simulation.

00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:36.750 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly, yeah.

00:53:36.750 --> 00:53:37.860 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: I get
really grumpy with that.

00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:40.350 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because people
read all this and say,

00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:41.280 align:middle line:90%
is that what we are?

00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:42.610 align:middle line:90%
Is that all we are, then?

00:53:42.610 --> 00:53:43.410 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:53:43.410 --> 00:53:44.640 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: No.

00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:46.490 align:middle line:84%
I just feel that
, that is again,

00:53:46.490 --> 00:53:49.930 align:middle line:84%
that's a very technological
perspective of duality-based

00:53:49.930 --> 00:53:50.730 align:middle line:90%
awareness.

00:53:50.730 --> 00:53:51.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And very limiting.

00:53:51.130 --> 00:53:53.297 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: It's very
limiting, very disempowering.

00:53:53.297 --> 00:53:54.963 align:middle line:84%
Because it's saying,
not only do you not

00:53:54.963 --> 00:53:56.580 align:middle line:84%
have meaning and
purpose, but you

00:53:56.580 --> 00:54:00.080 align:middle line:84%
are the play thing of some
simulation games player

00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:01.280 align:middle line:90%
somewhere.

00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:04.785 align:middle line:84%
And it's still
very duality-based,

00:54:04.785 --> 00:54:06.910 align:middle line:84%
because you're just kicking
the ball down the road.

00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:10.130 align:middle line:84%
If there's an advanced
species of which we're--

00:54:10.130 --> 00:54:12.950 align:middle line:90%
what about the advanced species?

00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:16.480 align:middle line:90%
Where does the simulation start?

00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:17.970 align:middle line:90%
It never begins.

00:54:17.970 --> 00:54:18.795 align:middle line:90%
It never begins.

00:54:18.795 --> 00:54:19.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thank you.

00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:21.680 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for that,
because people

00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:24.170 align:middle line:84%
are left with that question,
what is creating what?

00:54:24.170 --> 00:54:25.520 align:middle line:90%
Who is creating whom?

00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:26.720 align:middle line:90%
And so forth.

00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:28.970 align:middle line:90%
And I love the way you put it.

00:54:28.970 --> 00:54:32.450 align:middle line:84%
So do people find when
they read your book, do

00:54:32.450 --> 00:54:34.890 align:middle line:90%
they find this work liberating?

00:54:34.890 --> 00:54:38.000 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the first word
that comes to mind for me.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.250 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: Yes, they do.

00:54:40.250 --> 00:54:42.020 align:middle line:90%
The book's a messenger.

00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:44.250 align:middle line:84%
The book's saying,
guys, what we thought--

00:54:44.250 --> 00:54:45.050 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:45.050 --> 00:54:47.810 align:middle line:84%
--what we thought we knew
about the nature of reality

00:54:47.810 --> 00:54:49.270 align:middle line:90%
is not what it is.

00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:53.240 align:middle line:84%
Here's a much bigger and
unifying and empowering

00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:59.090 align:middle line:84%
invitation to join this journey
and homecoming of oneness

00:54:59.090 --> 00:55:00.300 align:middle line:90%
and diversity.

00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:04.460 align:middle line:84%
So the reception
has been phenomenal.

00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:08.420 align:middle line:84%
And interesting enough, we're
sitting across from the place

00:55:08.420 --> 00:55:11.652 align:middle line:84%
where the book was launched
a year ago, which is

00:55:11.652 --> 00:55:12.860 align:middle line:90%
the House of Lords in London.

00:55:12.860 --> 00:55:13.500 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Is that right?

00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:15.833 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: Well, it was
launched at the United Nations

00:55:15.833 --> 00:55:17.570 align:middle line:90%
in New York in May last year.

00:55:17.570 --> 00:55:19.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Tell us about
that launching and why.

00:55:19.570 --> 00:55:21.903 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: Because I felt
that this was much more than

00:55:21.903 --> 00:55:23.045 align:middle line:90%
a scientific revolution.

00:55:23.045 --> 00:55:27.920 align:middle line:84%
That if we came to understand
and experience and embody unity

00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:30.950 align:middle line:84%
awareness in the books-- the
evidence across all scales

00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:33.890 align:middle line:84%
of existence and all
fields of research--

00:55:33.890 --> 00:55:36.749 align:middle line:84%
I hope it's exhaustive,
but not exhausting.

00:55:36.749 --> 00:55:38.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I would say
that's a good description.

00:55:38.790 --> 00:55:39.910 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: Thank you.

00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:41.140 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate that.

00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:42.440 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: At the beginning
you have to get through

00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:42.900 align:middle line:90%
the science.

00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:43.910 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: You have to
get through the science.

00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:45.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And then it starts
really mounting in the more

00:55:45.770 --> 00:55:47.782 align:middle line:84%
consciousness-driven
part of the story.

00:55:47.782 --> 00:55:48.740 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: Very much.

00:55:48.740 --> 00:55:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's just the
first of a trilogy

00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:52.430 align:middle line:84%
that's going to go even
deeper into all of this.

00:55:52.430 --> 00:55:53.720 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, and we're
going to talk about that.

00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:56.012 align:middle line:84%
We just have a few
minutes left, so go ahead.

00:55:56.012 --> 00:55:58.470 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: But because that
it was far more than science,

00:55:58.470 --> 00:56:01.340 align:middle line:84%
that when we understand that
and experience and embody it

00:56:01.340 --> 00:56:03.680 align:middle line:90%
on everyday levels--

00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:05.670 align:middle line:84%
this is the choices we
make in the morning,

00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:08.116 align:middle line:84%
this is the choices we
make of love or fear

00:56:08.116 --> 00:56:09.740 align:middle line:84%
throughout the day,
this is the choices

00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:13.455 align:middle line:84%
we make of connection
or disconnection--

00:56:13.455 --> 00:56:14.330 align:middle line:90%
it affects everybody.

00:56:14.330 --> 00:56:18.440 align:middle line:10%
So launching it here with
many, many key influences

00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:21.980 align:middle line:10%
across many fields
of endeavor, to say,

00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:24.380 align:middle line:10%
guys, if you're
with this, if you'd

00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:26.600 align:middle line:10%
like to answer the
invitation of this,

00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:30.050 align:middle line:10%
can we now link up and
begin to take this forward,

00:56:30.050 --> 00:56:32.810 align:middle line:10%
so that more and more
people become aware of this

00:56:32.810 --> 00:56:35.580 align:middle line:10%
and can start to experience and
embody it in their own lives?

00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:36.580 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Good for you.

00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:39.005 align:middle line:90%
And this is an encouraging note.

00:56:39.005 --> 00:56:40.880 align:middle line:84%
When I was interviewing
Rupert the other day,

00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:43.790 align:middle line:84%
he was saying that
members of parliament

00:56:43.790 --> 00:56:45.590 align:middle line:90%
have actually come together--

00:56:45.590 --> 00:56:46.880 align:middle line:90%
over a hundred of them--

00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:48.440 align:middle line:90%
for group meditation and such.

00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:50.600 align:middle line:84%
So if there was
ever a time for this

00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:52.550 align:middle line:84%
to be seated in the
consciousness of people

00:56:52.550 --> 00:56:54.220 align:middle line:90%
who are influencers--

00:56:54.220 --> 00:56:55.220 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: This is it.

00:56:55.220 --> 00:56:55.910 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: This is it.

00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:57.326 align:middle line:10%
>> CURRIVAN: Well,
to add to that,

00:56:57.326 --> 00:56:59.540 align:middle line:10%
the person who
introduced mindfulness--

00:56:59.540 --> 00:57:05.780 align:middle line:10%
and it's more than 100, it's 250
staff and 150 MPs and peers--

00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:07.650 align:middle line:10%
is my dear friend
and colleague Andrew,

00:57:07.650 --> 00:57:09.440 align:middle line:10%
Lord Stone of Blackheath.

00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And it was Andrew that
hosted the launch of the book

00:57:11.790 --> 00:57:12.590 align:middle line:90%
last year.

00:57:12.590 --> 00:57:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And it was Andrew that got the
book into the House of Lords

00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:16.310 align:middle line:90%
Library.

00:57:16.310 --> 00:57:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's Andrew that I'm working
alongside, and many others,

00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:21.020 align:middle line:90%
to take this forward.

00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:23.240 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, this
makes my heart happy.

00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:26.224 align:middle line:84%
And the world of science, how
are they responding to it?

00:57:26.224 --> 00:57:27.932 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: They're
coming to the party.

00:57:27.932 --> 00:57:29.159 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:57:29.159 --> 00:57:31.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, that means little
by little you're winning one

00:57:31.700 --> 00:57:33.475 align:middle line:84%
or two over here and
there, and it'll grow.

00:57:33.475 --> 00:57:34.020 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: Yeah, yeah.

00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:35.780 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I understand
the resistance to it,

00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:37.863 align:middle line:84%
because the whole model
of reality they're working

00:57:37.863 --> 00:57:40.975 align:middle line:84%
on really comes crashing
down at certain points.

00:57:40.975 --> 00:57:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very
difficult thing

00:57:42.350 --> 00:57:43.910 align:middle line:84%
to let go of after
one has invested

00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:46.005 align:middle line:84%
their life into studying
the material world.

00:57:46.005 --> 00:57:46.880 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: Exactly.

00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:48.800 align:middle line:90%
And this is an opportunity.

00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:51.230 align:middle line:84%
This is an opportunity
for science and scientists

00:57:51.230 --> 00:57:54.440 align:middle line:84%
to take a leap forward with
everybody else, because they

00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:58.250 align:middle line:84%
really can be part of a solution
and open the doors to so,

00:57:58.250 --> 00:57:59.720 align:middle line:90%
so much.

00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:03.020 align:middle line:84%
Or they can stay where
they've been, many of them,

00:58:03.020 --> 00:58:04.880 align:middle line:84%
and it's part of
the general problem

00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:06.950 align:middle line:84%
that we have as a
collective psyche

00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:14.840 align:middle line:84%
within that dis-ease of
extreme materialist separatism.

00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:17.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And I think we can
probably look to the younger

00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:21.800 align:middle line:84%
scientists coming onto the scene
to pick this up, I would think,

00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:22.910 align:middle line:90%
with joy.

00:58:22.910 --> 00:58:25.760 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: Very much, because
scientists are, by nature,

00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:27.290 align:middle line:90%
curious.

00:58:27.290 --> 00:58:29.390 align:middle line:84%
But when they're stymied,
when they're held,

00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:33.477 align:middle line:84%
that curiosity, as it is
for all of us, is limited.

00:58:33.477 --> 00:58:34.310 align:middle line:90%
And that's very sad.

00:58:34.310 --> 00:58:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And this is so
exciting, and it has

00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:38.720 align:middle line:90%
such potential for our species.

00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And not just our species, but
for Gaia and all her children.

00:58:43.250 --> 00:58:46.640 align:middle line:10%
Because we can step into
responsible stewardship

00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:50.700 align:middle line:10%
and service of her and all
her children and the wider

00:58:50.700 --> 00:58:53.534 align:middle line:10%
cosmos if we answer
this invitation.

00:58:53.534 --> 00:58:54.450 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:58:54.450 --> 00:58:58.290 align:middle line:84%
In fact, just a little bit-- we
have just a minute or so left.

00:58:58.290 --> 00:59:01.620 align:middle line:84%
On your next book coming up,
is that "Gaia, Her-Story"?

00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:03.120 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: "Gaia,
Her-Story," yes.

00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:05.310 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Tell us just a
little thumbnail sketch of what

00:59:05.310 --> 00:59:06.360 align:middle line:90%
it's going to be about.

00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:09.130 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: I felt this
trilogy is about head, heart,

00:59:09.130 --> 00:59:10.170 align:middle line:90%
and hands.

00:59:10.170 --> 00:59:13.610 align:middle line:84%
Head is "The Cosmic Hologram",
how do we understand reality?

00:59:13.610 --> 00:59:17.370 align:middle line:90%
"Gaia, Her-Story" is our heart--

00:59:17.370 --> 00:59:21.120 align:middle line:84%
how do we remember our
relationship with Gaia

00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:22.650 align:middle line:90%
and all her children?

00:59:22.650 --> 00:59:25.179 align:middle line:84%
And Gaia is a living being
and a living universe

00:59:25.179 --> 00:59:26.595 align:middle line:84%
with its own
evolutionary impulse.

00:59:26.595 --> 00:59:27.450 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:59:27.450 --> 00:59:28.890 align:middle line:84%
>> CURRIVAN: The third
book is the hands--

00:59:28.890 --> 00:59:29.950 align:middle line:90%
what we do about it?

00:59:29.950 --> 00:59:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's "Many
Voices, One Heart."

00:59:31.850 --> 00:59:32.850 align:middle line:10%
How do we come together?

00:59:32.850 --> 00:59:34.320 align:middle line:10%
What is our opportunity?

00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:37.020 align:middle line:10%
What is our deep hidden history?

00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:38.820 align:middle line:90%
Who are we?

00:59:38.820 --> 00:59:39.750 align:middle line:90%
How do we remember?

00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:41.220 align:middle line:90%
How do we go forward together?

00:59:41.220 --> 00:59:43.590 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Can't wait to do the
interviews with you on the next

00:59:43.590 --> 00:59:44.390 align:middle line:90%
two.

00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:46.017 align:middle line:90%
When will "Gaia" be out?

00:59:46.017 --> 00:59:47.100 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: I don't know.

00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:49.930 align:middle line:10%
Everything is going so quickly
as a result of "The Cosmic

00:59:49.930 --> 00:59:50.730 align:middle line:10%
Hologram."

00:59:50.730 --> 00:59:52.830 align:middle line:84%
I've started to write
"Gaia, Her-Story."

00:59:52.830 --> 00:59:55.917 align:middle line:84%
I'm hoping to complete writing
it by the end of this year.

00:59:55.917 --> 00:59:56.750 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK, good.

00:59:56.750 --> 00:59:57.030 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:59:57.030 --> 00:59:58.620 align:middle line:90%
We have that to look forward to.

00:59:58.620 --> 01:00:01.820 align:middle line:10%
I just thoroughly enjoyed every
moment of the conversation

01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:02.620 align:middle line:10%
with you.

01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:04.530 align:middle line:10%
I love your work
and what your dharma

01:00:04.530 --> 01:00:07.320 align:middle line:10%
is on this planet, what
you're trying to do to bridge

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:09.159 align:middle line:10%
these great fields together.

01:00:09.159 --> 01:00:10.450 align:middle line:90%
>> CURRIVAN: Thank you, Regina.

01:00:10.450 --> 01:00:12.030 align:middle line:90%
It's been absolute joy.

01:00:12.030 --> 01:00:14.160 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for all you do,
and thanks for everybody

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:15.150 align:middle line:90%
who's watching us.

01:00:15.150 --> 01:00:18.794 align:middle line:10%
And they can reach me,
and let's link up and just

01:00:18.794 --> 01:00:19.710 align:middle line:10%
move forward together.

01:00:19.710 --> 01:00:20.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:21.870 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Jude.

01:00:21.870 --> 01:00:25.170 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Jude Currivan, an incredible
amount of original thought

01:00:25.170 --> 01:00:27.390 align:middle line:84%
has gone into her work,
as you have just seen.

01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:29.854 align:middle line:10%
Again, the book is titled
"The Cosmic Hologram."

01:00:29.854 --> 01:00:31.770 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

01:00:31.770 --> 01:00:33.690 align:middle line:10%
in London for "Open Minds."

01:00:33.690 --> 01:00:35.840 align:middle line:90%
