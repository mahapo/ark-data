>> REGINA MEREDITH: For those
who doubt that we're creating

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.370 align:middle line:10%
everything we
experience in our world,

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.210 align:middle line:10%
the work of Paul Levy might
convince you otherwise.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.880 align:middle line:10%
Our quantum reality is
more than theoretical.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.610 align:middle line:84%
It's the basis of
everything we experience.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.370 align:middle line:84%
Paul Levy is here with us
today to share his synthesis

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.970 align:middle line:90%
of this unseen world.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.090 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to "Open Minds."

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to say I
love this subject of quantum

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.614 align:middle line:84%
mechanics and quantum physics,
and I'll just toss this out.

00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:49.530 align:middle line:84%
When the first-- when
the book first came out,

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.620 align:middle line:90%
almost 30 years ago--

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:51.420 align:middle line:90%
I guess.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.740 align:middle line:90%
It's been quite a while now.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.470 align:middle line:10%
The book, it was by Michael
Talbot, "Beyond the Quantum."

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.270 align:middle line:10%
That was the first
time I engaged

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.640 align:middle line:10%
with the world of
quantum physics in it.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.770 align:middle line:84%
When you first
engage with it, it

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.410 align:middle line:84%
opens up a field of
possibility that you had never

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.030 align:middle line:90%
conceived of before.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.860 align:middle line:84%
And so for some people
that are watching

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.359 align:middle line:84%
this that might be
new to Gaia, they

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:13.200 align:middle line:84%
have never encountered
this process of every--

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.970 align:middle line:84%
the creation of and the
way to view reality.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.020 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to say,
let's have fun with it

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.460 align:middle line:84%
for beginners and those
who've been in it for a while.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And what was your
initial introduction

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.989 align:middle line:84%
and fascinate-- into and
fascination with this world

00:01:26.989 --> 00:01:28.530 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to
be talking about?

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.980 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL LEVY: Oh great.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:29.280 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.730 align:middle line:90%
That's a great question.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.620 align:middle line:10%
Well, in 1981 I had
a spiritual awakening

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.430 align:middle line:10%
that came out of just intense
suffering based on a trauma

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.630 align:middle line:10%
I had.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't understand
it then, but I now

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.370 align:middle line:84%
have the language to see
that I was experiencing--

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.690 align:middle line:84%
I was encountering
the quantum realm,

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.780 align:middle line:90%
and it totally blew my mind.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.240 align:middle line:84%
Basically, it got me
in a lot of trouble,

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.070 align:middle line:84%
because I wasn't in
a container, so I

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.620 align:middle line:84%
was so enthusiastic and
excited about what I

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.465 align:middle line:90%
was realizing that--

00:02:00.465 --> 00:02:02.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You alienated
everyone in your life.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.170 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Oh.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.936 align:middle line:90%
Well, totally.

00:02:03.936 --> 00:02:04.720 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No, I'm
just teasing you--

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.370 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: No, but that's--

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --but that's
usually what follows.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.828 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: That's
absolutely what happened.

00:02:07.828 --> 00:02:10.830 align:middle line:84%
Within 24 hours, I got
locked up, and diagnosed,

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.180 align:middle line:84%
and hospitalized, I was
medicated, and it was intense.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.066 align:middle line:84%
And during that
next 18 months, I

00:02:17.066 --> 00:02:19.440 align:middle line:84%
was probably hospitalized
about four or five other times.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And every single
time, I was guaranteed

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.159 align:middle line:84%
that I had this mental illness,
this chemical imbalance,

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:26.700 align:middle line:84%
that I would have
to be on medication

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.850 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of my life.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that, you
know, these doctors

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.120 align:middle line:84%
had no idea what they were
talking about, because--

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.150 align:middle line:84%
and the thing is
that's what saved me,

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.010 align:middle line:84%
that inner knowing,
because it was, you know,

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.650 align:middle line:84%
subjectively my
experience was it

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.340 align:middle line:84%
was really clear
that I was having

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.290 align:middle line:84%
some form of spiritual
awakening that couldn't

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.540 align:middle line:90%
have been more obvious to me.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.910 align:middle line:84%
It's been made very clear
to me by my inner guidance

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.810 align:middle line:84%
to not talk about a
lot of the experiences.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.890 align:middle line:84%
But there was one experience
that I have sort of been given

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.700 align:middle line:84%
permission to talk about
from my inner guidance,

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.470 align:middle line:84%
and it happened within
the first minute

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.410 align:middle line:84%
of being put in the first
psychiatric hospital.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.560 align:middle line:84%
So here I was having this
full blown awakening.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.390 align:middle line:84%
I was I was
recognizing that this

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.220 align:middle line:84%
is a collective
dream, that we're all

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.610 align:middle line:84%
dream characters in
each other's dreams,

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.900 align:middle line:84%
and that we're all
interconnected and

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.880 align:middle line:84%
interdependent, and
all those things.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.055 align:middle line:84%
And I was so enthusiastic
that I got put in an ambulance

00:03:22.055 --> 00:03:23.430 align:middle line:84%
and brought to
Highland Hospital.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: How did your
enthusiasm show itself that got

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:26.550 align:middle line:90%
you locked up?

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.290 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: Well, in
the sense that--

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.199 align:middle line:90%
I was with a friend.

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:31.740 align:middle line:84%
I was living in the Bay Area
and a friend from the East Coast

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.490 align:middle line:84%
was visiting me, and he
knew a particular Paul that

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.610 align:middle line:84%
is very stable and
conditioned, and sort

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.840 align:middle line:84%
of this kind of like a
particular habitual Paul

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.950 align:middle line:90%
that he knew.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And it was like I had
this radical personality

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.637 align:middle line:84%
change overnight, and he had
never seen anything like it.

00:03:50.637 --> 00:03:53.220 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you shifted from
what to-- show us what it would

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.980 align:middle line:90%
look like.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:54.480 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Yeah, just from--

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.271 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You were
conditioned and normal.

00:03:56.271 --> 00:03:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: I was just like normal,
ordinary sense of identity

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.280 align:middle line:90%
to just being filled--

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.720 align:middle line:90%
it was like being this--

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.120 align:middle line:84%
a light bulb that went from
75 watts to a trillion watts

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.920 align:middle line:90%
just like that.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:08.880 align:middle line:90%
[SNAPPING FINGERS]

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.690 align:middle line:84%
And the energy coming through
me was so over the top and--

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Manic beyond--

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.020 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Well, it just--

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.829 align:middle line:84%
from the outside, it
appeared, you know,

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.380 align:middle line:84%
because I now
understand, you know, oh,

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.420 align:middle line:84%
it looked just like
somebody in a manic episode.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.305 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: But to get to the
experience that one experience

00:04:24.305 --> 00:04:27.090 align:middle line:84%
that happens, so that's
why I was in the airport,

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.640 align:middle line:84%
I was flying up to Seattle
from San Francisco.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.449 align:middle line:84%
We never made it on
the air-- on the plane,

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:34.240 align:middle line:84%
because the police got
called and I got put

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.870 align:middle line:84%
in an ambulance to
Highland Hospital.

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And then within the first minute
of entering Highland Hospital--

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.520 align:middle line:84%
I'll never forget this, it
radically changed my life--

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.250 align:middle line:84%
they bring me into
this lounge which

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.640 align:middle line:84%
is where the psychiatric
patients were all hanging out,

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.340 align:middle line:84%
and I'm in this
complete altered state.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And right away, I see this
woman and she's an older woman,

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.370 align:middle line:84%
and her eyes-- you know,
she can't see, she's blind.

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:02.730 align:middle line:90%
Her eyes are opaque.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.010 align:middle line:90%
It's very obvious.

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.660 align:middle line:84%
And without even thinking
about what to do or say,

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.210 align:middle line:84%
I feel really drawn to her
and I go right up to her,

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.670 align:middle line:90%
and I just stare in her eyes.

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And out of my mouth, as if
I was given a script to say,

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.260 align:middle line:84%
came the words, all you have
to do to see is open your eyes

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.440 align:middle line:90%
and look.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.530 align:middle line:84%
And I kept on saying
those words over and over,

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.570 align:middle line:90%
kept on getting closer to her.

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.660 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing took maybe,
you know, one minute,

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.150 align:middle line:84%
and then by the
end of that minute,

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.220 align:middle line:90%
she had regained her sight.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And it was as if it was this
choreography at that moment

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.940 align:middle line:84%
they took me and they
strapped me up on a bed

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.340 align:middle line:90%
where I spent the night.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.540 align:middle line:84%
And it was a little bit of
a weird night to put it--

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Well, yeah.

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:44.940 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: I didn't
exactly get to sleep.

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:45.550 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.050 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: But then what happened,
just to complete the story,

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.410 align:middle line:84%
then the next morning they
unstrapped me and they put me

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.350 align:middle line:84%
in this room with
this woman, the same--

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.080 align:middle line:84%
she's now ex-- an
ex-blind woman.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And she's staring
at me-- not staring,

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.210 align:middle line:84%
but she's smiling
from ear to ear at me

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:02.860 align:middle line:90%
and she's not saying a word.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just sitting
there with her

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.340 align:middle line:84%
and, all of a sudden,
my heart chakra

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.490 align:middle line:84%
just blossomed, and I had never
had that experience before,

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.680 align:middle line:84%
but it was like this
lotus petal, the 1,000

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.150 align:middle line:90%
petal lotus just blossomed.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And then I understood,
oh, I get it.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.180 align:middle line:84%
Her eyes were physically
fine, but psychologically,

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.230 align:middle line:90%
she wasn't--

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.870 align:middle line:84%
you know, she was just
not letting herself look.

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.200 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, I kind of,
whatever, psychically or

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.780 align:middle line:84%
clairvoyantly saw
that, and it was

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:33.160 align:middle line:84%
if I was the person sent
by, you know, casting, the,

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.300 align:middle line:84%
you know, whatever just
to say those lines,

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.510 align:middle line:84%
because she was ready to heal
her hysterical blindness.

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:44.350 align:middle line:84%
And I saw that, oh, that's what
happened that night before.

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And then she says to me, the
only words she ever said to me,

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.420 align:middle line:84%
she goes, aren't you going
to answer the phone call from

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.910 align:middle line:84%
and she mentions
my father's name.

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And then within seconds, the
nurse comes into the room

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.190 align:middle line:84%
and says, Paul, your
father's on the phone,

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:58.930 align:middle line:84%
because my parents
had just gotten word

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.390 align:middle line:84%
that I had a psychotic
break and was hospitalized.

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:04.840 align:middle line:84%
And so I got out of that
hospital after three days,

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.240 align:middle line:84%
because the doctor in
charge, he convinced me

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.490 align:middle line:84%
I had to prove to him
that I wasn't crazy.

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:13.490 align:middle line:84%
And so I heard that, and I just
immediately forced myself down

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:14.290 align:middle line:90%
and began talking--

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:15.400 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: To your
normal Paul position.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.540 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: To my normal Paul.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:17.350 align:middle line:90%
my--

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:18.730 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Tell them
what they need to hear.

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:19.688 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: The repressed.

00:07:19.688 --> 00:07:22.120 align:middle line:84%
Talking about my problems,
my guilt, my neuroses.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.420 align:middle line:84%
And he says, oh, you're
totally normal, you can go.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:25.220 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:28.060 align:middle line:84%
And I got together with him,
you know, one week after.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.790 align:middle line:84%
I called him up
and we had a meal.

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:32.920 align:middle line:84%
And I told him about
the blind woman,

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.660 align:middle line:84%
and he got very uncomfortable
to talk about it.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.330 align:middle line:84%
But he said to me
the fact that I

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:40.750 align:middle line:84%
was able to have the
fluidity between the states

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.970 align:middle line:84%
and just step right into
being normal like that,

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:45.860 align:middle line:84%
that was proof to him
that I wasn't crazy.

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:49.330 align:middle line:84%
And the one final
thing, within a few days

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:50.950 align:middle line:84%
of getting out of
that hospital, I

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:54.490 align:middle line:84%
knew something totally
over the top was happening.

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:57.120 align:middle line:84%
So I found out about there
was a monk in San Francisco,

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.780 align:middle line:84%
this Buddhist monk from Myanmar
is what it's called now,

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.247 align:middle line:90%
you know, the old Burma.

00:08:03.247 --> 00:08:05.080 align:middle line:84%
Told him what happened
with the blind woman.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.455 align:middle line:84%
He says, oh, you're in luck,
the greatest Buddhist master

00:08:07.455 --> 00:08:09.120 align:middle line:84%
of all of Burma
has just arrived,

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.150 align:middle line:90%
this 85-year-old master.

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:12.322 align:middle line:84%
I went, and within
like a few days

00:08:12.322 --> 00:08:13.780 align:middle line:84%
of getting out of
the hospital, I'm

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:16.090 align:middle line:84%
sitting at the feet of
the greatest Buddhist

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:19.240 align:middle line:84%
master of Burma and
getting his blessings.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And so my life was
never the same.

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:22.510 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Clearly.

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:22.897 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Yeah.

00:08:22.897 --> 00:08:25.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So now that
experience is loaded with all

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.140 align:middle line:90%
kinds of stuff.

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:30.280 align:middle line:84%
Number one, you're being
was in trauma and suffering.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:31.240 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Right.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.220 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And
some aspect of you,

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:36.760 align:middle line:84%
combined with some
aspect of universe,

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:41.520 align:middle line:84%
stepped in, coalesced an
energy to blast through you

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.960 align:middle line:84%
at an incredible wattage to
show you another reality.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:45.760 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Right.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.440 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: To relieve
your suffering.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.250 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Right.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:49.120 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.578 align:middle line:84%
And if I could,
just one commentary

00:08:50.578 --> 00:08:54.029 align:middle line:84%
is that when I contemplate that
experience as if it was a dream

00:08:54.029 --> 00:08:55.820 align:middle line:84%
and understood-- just
like you have a dream

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:58.870 align:middle line:84%
and you can contemplate
symbolically what does it mean,

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:00.810 align:middle line:84%
it was clear to me
that, oh, but we can all

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:02.060 align:middle line:90%
play that role for each other.

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:04.480 align:middle line:84%
We all potentially
are cast in the role

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:08.490 align:middle line:84%
of helping each other to awaken,
because the thing about the--

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:10.300 align:middle line:84%
you know, with
quantum physics, it's

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.040 align:middle line:84%
expanding the realm
of the possible.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.170 align:middle line:84%
We've been entrained
and programmed

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:16.330 align:middle line:84%
to believe that certain
things are possible

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:17.830 align:middle line:84%
and certain things
are not possible.

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:18.030 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:18.130 align:middle line:90%
Mhm.

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:19.010 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: And I
should-- you know,

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:21.670 align:middle line:84%
the thing I want to point
out, that was not like totally

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:23.320 align:middle line:90%
impossible what happened.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:27.250 align:middle line:84%
It was highly improbable,
but it was still--

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:29.609 align:middle line:84%
it was an auspicious
coincidence of factors.

00:09:29.609 --> 00:09:31.900 align:middle line:84%
The fact that I happened to
be there and say the words,

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.250 align:middle line:90%
and when she was ready to heal.

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:35.290 align:middle line:90%
But what I began having was--

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:38.830 align:middle line:84%
were experiences that were
completely impossible from what

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:42.310 align:middle line:84%
I had been taught, and I was
really directly experiencing

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:44.860 align:middle line:84%
the, you know, that
whole point of view

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:48.230 align:middle line:84%
of what's possible and not
just had been totally exploded.

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, oh yeah,
we've been conditioned

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:53.680 align:middle line:84%
to think that certain
things are possible

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.440 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll evoke evidence
to confirm, you know,

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:59.320 align:middle line:84%
what's not possible
and stuff, and then

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.190 align:middle line:84%
we become-- we've entrained
ourselves by our own mind.

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:04.040 align:middle line:90%
That's what I saw.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:04.840 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:08.560 align:middle line:90%
And so you're filled with this.

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:13.870 align:middle line:84%
This is like-- it's almost like
a psycho spiritual electricity

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:14.750 align:middle line:90%
running through you.

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:14.960 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Right.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I mean, because
it sounds like it has

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.410 align:middle line:90%
an electrical component.

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:17.845 align:middle line:90%
And oftentimes--

00:10:17.845 --> 00:10:18.130 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Oh, definitely.

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:19.330 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --when you
map a person's brain,

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:21.050 align:middle line:90%
it'll show electrical activity.

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:23.552 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard another
stories, even if you're

00:10:23.552 --> 00:10:26.010 align:middle line:84%
looking at some of the spooky
ghost stories, the dark stuff

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:28.150 align:middle line:84%
where entities that
come in, in that case,

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:30.220 align:middle line:84%
to interfere with
people, draw down

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:32.540 align:middle line:84%
on their actual electrical
grid in the house.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:34.900 align:middle line:84%
They're manifesting
through electricity.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.660 align:middle line:84%
So the miss-- the
lack of understanding

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:42.460 align:middle line:84%
between the psychic phenomena,
the other world, consciousness,

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:45.680 align:middle line:84%
and electricity sounds like
it's part of this story.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.350 align:middle line:84%
That it came-- it
blasted through

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:50.890 align:middle line:84%
with imagery and knowledge,
but such high wattage,

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:54.910 align:middle line:84%
you literally had enough
wattage to spill into you

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:56.270 align:middle line:90%
and affect other human beings.

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:57.070 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Yeah.

00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:58.120 align:middle line:90%
It almost killed me.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:58.420 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:10:58.420 --> 00:10:59.110 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, I believe that.

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:00.070 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: I was aware of that.

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:01.610 align:middle line:84%
I was aware of that, you
know, when I contemplated it.

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:02.590 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Like being
struck by lightning.

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:03.160 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: That-- no.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.034 align:middle line:84%
Well, I had gotten hit
by lightning the night

00:11:05.034 --> 00:11:06.250 align:middle line:90%
before, that was the thing.

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:06.570 align:middle line:90%
I was sitting--

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:07.180 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, wait, wait, wait.

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:07.420 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:08.600 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Yeah, yeah, right.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now what I'm saying
is starting to make sense.

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:11.186 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Right, right.

00:11:11.186 --> 00:11:14.230 align:middle line:84%
No, I've been doing intense
inside meditation just watching

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:17.691 align:middle line:84%
my mind for almost two years,
and the night before, I

00:11:17.691 --> 00:11:19.690 align:middle line:84%
got hit by a bolt of
lightning just in my brain.

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:20.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, Yeah.

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:20.730 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: It wasn't outside.

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:21.250 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, it was--

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:21.870 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: It just ignited--

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:22.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:24.880 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: --and then that
initiated the extreme state

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.487 align:middle line:84%
of having the
recognition, oh my God,

00:11:26.487 --> 00:11:27.820 align:middle line:90%
we're having a collective dream.

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:28.240 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.040 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Yeah.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.705 align:middle line:84%
No, so that's definitely
what happened.

00:11:30.705 --> 00:11:32.080 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So
that's interesting.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.040 align:middle line:84%
That gives people
a lot to jaw over.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:37.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think, you know, you
can really do a lot of research

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:40.180 align:middle line:84%
just looking at how the other
world consciousness, you can

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:43.240 align:middle line:84%
say our guides or
our own higher self,

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.430 align:middle line:84%
working from these
high frequency waves

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:47.890 align:middle line:84%
can use electricity
in an electrical way

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:52.090 align:middle line:84%
infect us with that enthusiasm,
that joy, that understanding,

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:53.260 align:middle line:90%
which is beautiful.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:54.610 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Mhm, totally.

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:56.860 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So this other
woman was open and receptive.

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:58.630 align:middle line:84%
But that-- did that
leave you to question

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:00.680 align:middle line:84%
some of the other people
that are in there?

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:01.480 align:middle line:90%
How open was she?

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.950 align:middle line:90%
She knew your dad was calling.

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:03.650 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Totally, totally.

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:04.170 align:middle line:90%
No, it was clear to me--

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:05.380 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And how
are we misdiagnosing?

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:08.110 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: It was clear to me
that so many people who were

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:10.960 align:middle line:84%
diagnosed and hospitalized, and
medicated maybe for their whole

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:17.290 align:middle line:84%
lives, are having spiritual
emergences that aren't being,

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:20.690 align:middle line:84%
you know, seen as such,
and on the contrary,

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:22.790 align:middle line:90%
are being pathologized.

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And you know, because
what happened to me--

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:28.000 align:middle line:84%
so I got out of that
hospital, but like I said,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.270 align:middle line:84%
there were maybe four or five
of these other hospitalizations,

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:34.270 align:middle line:84%
and by the last one,
I was-- you know,

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:35.740 align:middle line:84%
it was court ordered
that I needed

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:38.330 align:middle line:84%
to be on medication for the
rest of my life and you know.

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:41.980 align:middle line:84%
And I just-- very quickly
I was able to figure out

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:44.382 align:middle line:84%
how to act normal in
consensus reality.

00:12:44.382 --> 00:12:46.090 align:middle line:84%
So I just took myself
off the medication.

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:47.500 align:middle line:90%
It's been over 35 years.

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.840 align:middle line:84%
I haven't had any of
these, you know, whatever--

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.420 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Over what period of
time did these events occur?

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:55.310 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: These events happened
between 1981 and 1982.

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:56.110 align:middle line:90%
So it was really--

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:57.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So it was all--

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:58.588 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: It was
really-- that was--

00:12:58.588 --> 00:13:00.070 align:middle line:90%
there were so many of them.

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And that one with a blind woman,
that was the only one really

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:05.800 align:middle line:84%
that I talk about, and that's
sort of a minor one compared

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.499 align:middle line:90%
to what else was happening.

00:13:07.499 --> 00:13:09.040 align:middle line:84%
And-- but yeah, you
know, I just want

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:10.690 align:middle line:90%
to really highlight your point.

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:12.580 align:middle line:84%
My feeling, I have
no doubt about this,

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:15.280 align:middle line:84%
that so many people
who are pathologized

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:19.230 align:middle line:84%
and in mental hospitals
and on medication

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:23.110 align:middle line:84%
are having some form of
this spiritual awakening

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:24.190 align:middle line:90%
that, you know--

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:26.230 align:middle line:84%
because I saw for
me, as soon as I

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:29.380 align:middle line:84%
got really in the
psychiatric community,

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:31.630 align:middle line:84%
and they were diagnosing
me and medicating me,

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:33.216 align:middle line:90%
then I became sicker.

00:13:33.216 --> 00:13:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And then the more
sick I became--

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:35.200 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Of course.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.741 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: --the more evidence
the psychiatrist had that, well,

00:13:37.741 --> 00:13:39.040 align:middle line:90%
our diagnosis is correct.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.470 align:middle line:84%
So then they saw me
more as being sick.

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And the more they concretized
me that way, the more I

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:45.495 align:middle line:90%
became-- the sicker I became.

00:13:45.495 --> 00:13:46.370 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Of course.

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:48.100 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: You know, so
it was a feedback loop.

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:49.016 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:13:49.016 --> 00:13:52.450 align:middle line:84%
And you know, this brings
to mind another person who,

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:56.080 align:middle line:84%
you know, controversial figure,
but very high profile person

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.420 align:middle line:84%
who had the similar
thing happened to him

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:00.790 align:middle line:90%
when he was in Peru.

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, like
a lightning bolt, feet

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.850 align:middle line:84%
nailed to the ground, right,
and suddenly all of reality

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:08.655 align:middle line:84%
started becoming
crystal clear to him.

00:14:08.655 --> 00:14:10.030 align:middle line:10%
And because he
was high profile--

00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:12.820 align:middle line:10%
this is David Icke-- because he
was high profile at the time,

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:16.180 align:middle line:10%
he went on TV in a
turquoise tracksuit

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:19.060 align:middle line:10%
after being a
national sportscaster

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:21.550 align:middle line:10%
and talked about this
experience of this

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:25.380 align:middle line:10%
all-- everything being connected
and the frequency of color,

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:26.180 align:middle line:10%
and all this.

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:28.480 align:middle line:84%
And recently, there was a lot
of stuff going on the web.

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:29.950 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's like,
oh, he's a bad guy.

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:30.760 align:middle line:90%
Oh, he's a savior.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:31.690 align:middle line:90%
Oh, he's a bad guy.

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:33.370 align:middle line:84%
You know, back and
forth stuff going.

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:33.730 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Right.

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:35.646 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And then I
thought, you know what--

00:14:35.646 --> 00:14:36.580 align:middle line:90%
and I know David well.

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:38.663 align:middle line:84%
I thought, you know, I'm
going to go back and look

00:14:38.663 --> 00:14:41.710 align:middle line:84%
at that original video and
see what did he actually

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:46.270 align:middle line:84%
say that alienated him from
everybody in his life for 30

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:47.230 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:49.430 align:middle line:84%
It was very similar to
what you're talking about.

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:50.010 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:51.370 align:middle line:90%
No, and we're not the only ones.

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:53.210 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, there
was so many people.

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:54.619 align:middle line:90%
And for me, I was fortunate--

00:14:54.619 --> 00:14:57.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, first off, there was a
tragic element to it in that--

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:57.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:59.770 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: --it totally destroyed
my family, both my parents.

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:00.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm the only child.

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:03.220 align:middle line:84%
They both died
completely convinced

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:05.477 align:middle line:84%
that their son has a
chemical imbalance.

00:15:05.477 --> 00:15:07.810 align:middle line:84%
Because you know, the DSM III
had just come out the year

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:09.120 align:middle line:90%
before, you know--

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:09.920 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:10.570 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: And--

00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:12.010 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so
you were diagnosed.

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:14.384 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: And so every single
psychiatrist was saying, oh,

00:15:14.384 --> 00:15:17.866 align:middle line:84%
you have this new thing that
we've just discovered called

00:15:17.866 --> 00:15:18.740 align:middle line:90%
a chemical imbalance.

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:21.110 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it's now come
out that that's completely

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:23.270 align:middle line:84%
this made up thing
that was made up

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:25.550 align:middle line:84%
by the pharmaceutical
companies to sell more drugs

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:27.080 align:middle line:90%
to make more money.

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And-- but I was
fortunate in that I

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:31.910 align:middle line:84%
was able to really quickly
extricate myself and continue

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:35.180 align:middle line:84%
my awakening, and find my
teachers and discover my whole,

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:37.970 align:middle line:84%
you know, with my
books and my work

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:40.380 align:middle line:90%
to discover what I'm here to do.

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And-- but it just-- you
know, my parents both died.

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:45.590 align:middle line:84%
I absolutely-- I mean,
my mother on her deathbed

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:47.630 align:middle line:84%
was saying to me, Paul--
because at that point,

00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:50.810 align:middle line:84%
I had already been teaching
and having groups and writing

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:53.532 align:middle line:84%
articles-- and she says, Paul,
that's all your hallucination.

00:15:53.532 --> 00:15:54.332 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Aw.

00:15:54.332 --> 00:15:54.670 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:55.790 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: It was
so-- it was tragic.

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:57.081 align:middle line:90%
And I've had to deal with that.

00:15:57.081 --> 00:15:59.030 align:middle line:90%
You know, I feel it every day.

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:00.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But you
know she still lives.

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:01.510 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Yeah.

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:02.344 align:middle line:90%
Well, I know in my--

00:16:02.344 --> 00:16:03.143 align:middle line:90%
absolutely.

00:16:03.143 --> 00:16:04.080 align:middle line:90%
In my heart, for sure.

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:04.880 align:middle line:90%
Totally.

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:05.680 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And so when-- you talked a
little bit ago about that was--

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:13.130 align:middle line:84%
that what happened with
a woman and her blindness

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:14.840 align:middle line:84%
was within a realm
of possibility.

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:15.290 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Right.

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:17.540 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But you said, other
events happen that were not

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:18.290 align:middle line:90%
in the realm of possibility.

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:18.590 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Right, right.

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:19.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They were impossible.

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:20.420 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Right, right.

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:22.010 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: And you
know, we could go and go

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:24.140 align:middle line:10%
into the mechanics of
quantum physics and all that,

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:26.300 align:middle line:10%
like you do in your book,
and down that route,

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:28.670 align:middle line:10%
but I'm having so much fun
with this part of the topic.

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:30.710 align:middle line:84%
Do you mind if we just
go into it more so people

00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:32.040 align:middle line:90%
understand what's possible?

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:32.840 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Sure.

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, keep in mind that I can't
talk about the experiences.

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:37.550 align:middle line:84%
That's just not--
you know, that's

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:39.620 align:middle line:90%
been made really clear to me.

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:45.290 align:middle line:10%
But what was-- one way of
talking about it is that we

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:48.320 align:middle line:10%
have been, like I was
saying before, you know,

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:54.770 align:middle line:10%
sort of entrained by the
propaganda organs of our world

00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:59.870 align:middle line:10%
and by each of us has to the
extent that we've fallen asleep

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:02.895 align:middle line:10%
and believe that we're
this limited, you know,

00:17:02.895 --> 00:17:05.750 align:middle line:10%
skin encapsulated ego to coin--

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:09.319 align:middle line:10%
not to coin a phrase, but it's
a famous phrase by Alan Watts.

00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And to the extent-- you see,
one way of understanding this

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:14.270 align:middle line:84%
is if you go-- if
you think about,

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:16.569 align:middle line:84%
through your imagination,
being in a night dream.

00:17:16.569 --> 00:17:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm in a
night dream and if I

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:21.230 align:middle line:84%
hold a particular perspective
in that night dream.

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:24.119 align:middle line:84%
Now, what is the night
dream, but it's a reflection,

00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:27.290 align:middle line:84%
it's a projection
of my own mind.

00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:30.140 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm holding a particular
point of view in that night

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:32.990 align:middle line:84%
dream, the night
dream has no choice

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:36.080 align:middle line:84%
but to just
instantaneously shape shift

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:37.821 align:middle line:90%
and reflect back my viewpoint.

00:17:37.821 --> 00:17:39.320 align:middle line:84%
As soon as that
happens, then I have

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:42.330 align:middle line:84%
evidence that my viewpoint
is objectively true.

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:44.510 align:middle line:84%
So as soon as I have
that evidence, then

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:48.620 align:middle line:84%
I get even more fixed into
that concretized viewpoint.

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:50.820 align:middle line:84%
And then the more, you
know, I get solidified

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:54.634 align:middle line:84%
in that viewpoint, the
more the actual, you know,

00:17:54.634 --> 00:17:56.890 align:middle line:90%
dream will offer--

00:17:56.890 --> 00:17:59.050 align:middle line:84%
will confirm and give
me all the evidence.

00:17:59.050 --> 00:17:59.840 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Beacon to reality.

00:17:59.840 --> 00:17:59.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:02.273 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: And it's a feedback
loop that happens both over

00:18:02.273 --> 00:18:03.800 align:middle line:90%
time and outside of time.

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:07.340 align:middle line:84%
It happens in zero time,
and that's, you know,

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:09.930 align:middle line:84%
that's an articulation of
what happens in a night dream.

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:12.080 align:middle line:84%
But what I was realizing
and what so many people

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.820 align:middle line:84%
are understanding
now is that that's

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:16.100 align:middle line:90%
the nature of this waking dream.

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:17.780 align:middle line:84%
That to the extent
that whatever--

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:21.530 align:middle line:84%
when we hold a particular
fixed point of view,

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:26.120 align:middle line:84%
we then will like actually evoke
evidence confirming our point

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.444 align:middle line:84%
of view, which then just
feeds back into itself--

00:18:28.444 --> 00:18:29.360 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:30.651 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: --and then we become--

00:18:30.651 --> 00:18:32.300 align:middle line:84%
and we become
entrained into that's

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:35.070 align:middle line:84%
being objective, that's
the objective reality.

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And when a whole number of us,
say 7 and 1/2 billion of us,

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:42.290 align:middle line:84%
are doing that, we
then have created

00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:45.410 align:middle line:84%
this seemingly objective
world that's concretized,

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:49.730 align:middle line:84%
and that's the medicine
that quantum physics is here

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:50.720 align:middle line:90%
to dissolve.

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I agree with that.

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.520 align:middle line:10%
Tom Campbell calls that our
collectively rendered as

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.830 align:middle line:10%
in an editing term in editing.

00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:00.320 align:middle line:84%
When you take pixels and
they finally come together

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.990 align:middle line:84%
to coalesce into a solid
image are collectively

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:04.370 align:middle line:90%
rendered reality.

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:05.310 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Right.

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:07.340 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that's exactly
the way you described it just

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:08.390 align:middle line:90%
brought that to mind.

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:08.810 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Right right.

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:11.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And a couple other
things are popping into mind.

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:13.340 align:middle line:84%
Because again, I'm
fascinated with this,

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:15.282 align:middle line:84%
because you have
this high wattage,

00:19:15.282 --> 00:19:16.490 align:middle line:90%
and this happens with people.

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:18.230 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I think they
call it a Kundalini

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.950 align:middle line:90%
blow out or awakening.

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:20.080 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: Yeah, it was
definitely a Kundalini.

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:22.038 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You know, they
call it that as well.

00:19:22.038 --> 00:19:23.630 align:middle line:10%
But we're talking
about a force that--

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:27.890 align:middle line:10%
I asked the physicist Patrick
Flanagan one time, I said,

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:29.180 align:middle line:10%
Patrick, we're--

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:30.920 align:middle line:10%
literally, I asked him at lunch.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.007 align:middle line:84%
I said, no one understands
what electricity is.

00:19:34.007 --> 00:19:35.840 align:middle line:84%
You know, people keep
trying to describe it,

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.160 align:middle line:84%
but they don't seem
to be describing it.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what's
electricity, just casually.

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:43.640 align:middle line:84%
I was getting ready to do
an interview with him a week

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.850 align:middle line:90%
or two in the future.

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:48.470 align:middle line:84%
He said-- very casually
he said, electricity

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:52.130 align:middle line:84%
is the flow of electrons from
a higher potential to a lower

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:54.080 align:middle line:90%
one.

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.900 align:middle line:84%
I thought, you're
talking electricity

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:58.760 align:middle line:90%
is multidimensional.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:01.500 align:middle line:84%
You're saying it's flowing in
from one dimension to another.

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:03.500 align:middle line:90%
And he said, well, yes.

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:08.180 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm looking at
that of how this aspect

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:13.250 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness attaches itself
from dimensions flowing through

00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:16.730 align:middle line:84%
and creating realities through
this kind of electrical effect

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:19.200 align:middle line:84%
into the-- because we're in
an electromagnetic world--

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.360 align:middle line:84%
from one reality to
another, but it's

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:23.400 align:middle line:84%
being structured by
your own consciousness.

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:24.233 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Yeah, yeah.

00:20:24.233 --> 00:20:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's one way
of really starting

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.520 align:middle line:84%
to articulate what, you
know, what quantum physics

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.230 align:middle line:90%
is beginning to show.

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:34.311 align:middle line:84%
Because you know, it sounds
so intimidating-- the thing

00:20:34.311 --> 00:20:35.310 align:middle line:90%
I should just point out.

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:36.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a physicist.

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:37.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I know.

00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:38.460 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: And I'm not--

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:41.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how to do like
the mathematics of physics,

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.070 align:middle line:84%
or you know, to do
physics, but I'm just

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:47.110 align:middle line:90%
this curious person who--

00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:50.100 align:middle line:84%
all the founding fathers
of quantum physics,

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:53.580 align:middle line:84%
they were astounded by
what they had, you know,

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:55.320 align:middle line:90%
what they had stumbled onto.

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And what they were saying was
that this universe is a quantum

00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:59.940 align:middle line:84%
universe through and
through, including us,

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:01.148 align:middle line:90%
that we are quantum entities.

00:21:01.148 --> 00:21:02.340 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:05.940 align:middle line:10%
>> PAUL: And that it really--
it so is behooving us

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:09.540 align:middle line:10%
to understand--
like even, you know,

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:13.470 align:middle line:10%
Albert Einstein himself said,
and there's a quote pretty

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:18.420 align:middle line:10%
much, that quantum physics is
so uncommonly important that it

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:20.330 align:middle line:10%
should be everyone's concern.

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:21.840 align:middle line:84%
Now the thing with
quantum physics,

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:24.720 align:middle line:84%
it freaked out Einstein so much,
he could never get his mind

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:27.344 align:middle line:84%
around it, because
one of the things--

00:21:27.344 --> 00:21:29.760 align:middle line:84%
one way of understanding what
quantum physics was pointing

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:33.600 align:middle line:84%
at was that before
quantum physics,

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.430 align:middle line:84%
physics thought they were
studying an objective world--

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:37.230 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:40.050 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: --and they were just
passive observers and studying

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:42.960 align:middle line:84%
this universe that was
separate from themselves.

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:45.870 align:middle line:84%
Quantum physics has
just absolutely just

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:48.120 align:middle line:84%
destroyed that notion
and saying no, no.

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.880 align:middle line:84%
By the act of observing
even something as

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:55.230 align:middle line:84%
minuscule as an electron,
we change the electron,

00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:58.320 align:middle line:84%
we change ourselves, and we
change the whole universe

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:01.140 align:middle line:90%
simply by that act of observing.

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And so just one final
thing, the physicists

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:06.450 align:middle line:84%
are saying it's an
incredible pity that not more

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:10.740 align:middle line:84%
people understand what is
emerging from quantum physics,

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:13.620 align:middle line:84%
because it has everything
to do with who we are,

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:17.070 align:middle line:84%
with our ordinary life,
and its unleashing the most

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:20.290 align:middle line:84%
incredible creative force
that we can imagine.

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:21.090 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Indeed.

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:22.320 align:middle line:90%
And you call it--

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:25.810 align:middle line:84%
you say that, collectively,
we have an objective reality

00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:26.610 align:middle line:90%
hangover.

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:27.240 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Right.

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So share
about that a little bit.

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:29.310 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You just
hinted to it, but yeah.

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:31.560 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: No, sure.

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:36.090 align:middle line:84%
Because you know,
we for so long,

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:40.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for centuries,
we've been entrained

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:44.810 align:middle line:84%
to think that this
world is objective,

00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:48.450 align:middle line:84%
and like I was trying to
describe with like in a dream,

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:51.390 align:middle line:84%
if you hold a viewpoint,
then this world

00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:55.390 align:middle line:84%
will give you all the evidence
to confirm that perspective.

00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:59.880 align:middle line:84%
And then so what happens
you like react to the world

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.830 align:middle line:84%
as if it's objective and
you become programmed

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:06.600 align:middle line:84%
in a condition state by your
reaction in a feedback loop

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:11.490 align:middle line:84%
where you've taken this infinite
creative potential that's

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:14.520 align:middle line:84%
inside of all of us and
you've just scaled it down

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:16.380 align:middle line:90%
to such a minuscule--

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:19.320 align:middle line:84%
it's like in a little
point of your pinky.

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And so what quantum
physics is showing us

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:26.210 align:middle line:84%
is that-- you see,
that inside that there

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:29.800 align:middle line:84%
is no objective
world, in my book,

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.380 align:middle line:84%
I go into that as deeply
as I possibly can,

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:33.610 align:middle line:90%
because that's the key.

00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:34.410 align:middle line:90%
That's the key.

00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:38.610 align:middle line:84%
When you really understand
that, it brings into question,

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:41.460 align:middle line:84%
wait a second, if there is
no objective world, then

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:43.620 align:middle line:90%
who am I as a subject?

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:46.020 align:middle line:84%
I can only be a
subject if I'm having

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:47.880 align:middle line:90%
relationship to an object.

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And if there's no object,
all of a sudden, who am I?

00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:53.646 align:middle line:84%
So you see, that's
where, in my book,

00:23:53.646 --> 00:23:55.020 align:middle line:84%
I point out that
quantum physics,

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:57.970 align:middle line:84%
it's actually like this--
it's like a spiritual path.

00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:00.720 align:middle line:84%
It's not like a spiritual
path, it is a spiritual path.

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:03.990 align:middle line:84%
It's actually promoting
itself to be a spiritual path.

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:06.240 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, in a sense,
I suppose you're your own

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:09.840 align:middle line:84%
creation, but that your own
part is heavily influenced

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:11.320 align:middle line:84%
by everything
that's come before.

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:12.120 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Yeah.

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:14.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's like we're
our own creation.

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:19.740 align:middle line:84%
We're like dreaming up ourselves
while the universe is dreaming

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:23.010 align:middle line:84%
us up at the same time, and it's
like this feedback loop that's

00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:26.170 align:middle line:84%
not linear, but it's like
this circular feedback loop.

00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:30.190 align:middle line:84%
It's acausal and atemporal,
it doesn't exist in time.

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:34.500 align:middle line:84%
But the point is when you
begin to see that, all

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:37.210 align:middle line:90%
of a sudden, you know, things--

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:38.880 align:middle line:84%
you begin to realize,
wait a second,

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.290 align:middle line:84%
things aren't
quite as they seem.

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:44.970 align:middle line:84%
They appear really flatland
and sort of in this normal way,

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:47.280 align:middle line:84%
like ordinary reality,
then you begin

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:50.040 align:middle line:84%
to realize, wait a second, there
is like, you know, this field,

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:53.730 align:middle line:84%
this non-local field which
physics talks about that

00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:57.720 align:middle line:84%
actually contains and expresses
itself through everything

00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:58.600 align:middle line:90%
that's happening.

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And in that field, matter and
our minds are not separate.

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:07.170 align:middle line:84%
Because quantum physics
discovered that consciousness

00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:08.930 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden entered
their equations.

00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:11.130 align:middle line:90%
It entered the laboratory.

00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:13.890 align:middle line:84%
And this isn't what the
typical physicist had,

00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:16.830 align:middle line:84%
you know, had trained for,
had signed up for, and--

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:18.630 align:middle line:84%
but they couldn't
get away from it.

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:22.440 align:middle line:84%
And so that's one of the major
points of quantum physics

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:27.210 align:middle line:84%
is that how do you factor in
consciousness into the equation

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:29.156 align:middle line:90%
of the world and who we are?

00:25:29.156 --> 00:25:31.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Consciousness says--
all these physicists say,

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:32.690 align:middle line:90%
is fundamental.

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:33.490 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Mhm.

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:36.720 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You know, you have
the notion of prima materia,

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:40.210 align:middle line:84%
the soup, that's not in any
particular organized fashion.

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:41.010 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Right.

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:41.843 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: The soup.

00:25:41.843 --> 00:25:43.590 align:middle line:90%
The chaos.

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:46.890 align:middle line:84%
But consciousness has to be
applied to the chaos in order

00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:48.984 align:middle line:90%
for any creation.

00:25:48.984 --> 00:25:50.400 align:middle line:84%
And we're just an
example of that.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.108 align:middle line:84%
Everything we are,
everything we're doing

00:25:52.108 --> 00:25:55.230 align:middle line:84%
is just part of
that macro process.

00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:57.330 align:middle line:84%
Literally with every
thought of every day,

00:25:57.330 --> 00:25:59.887 align:middle line:84%
we're part of the
creative process, right?

00:25:59.887 --> 00:26:00.720 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Yeah, yeah.

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:02.511 align:middle line:84%
Well, the thing is--
so what you're saying,

00:26:02.511 --> 00:26:05.840 align:middle line:84%
what it brings to mind, from the
quantum physics point of view--

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:07.380 align:middle line:84%
and keep in mind,
quantum physics,

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:13.050 align:middle line:84%
it's being called the
greatest discovery in history,

00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:15.180 align:middle line:84%
in all of science,
and it's never

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:17.520 align:middle line:90%
been proven wrong in one iota.

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And what quantum
physics is saying

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:27.240 align:middle line:84%
is that so this world exists
in a state of potentiality

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:31.290 align:middle line:84%
that any possible way this
world can manifest actually

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:33.930 align:middle line:90%
exists in the potential state.

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And the moment that
any-- and it's unclear

00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:40.200 align:middle line:84%
who the observer is, a person,
or what about an insect,

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.280 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, that's a
whole other question.

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:46.200 align:middle line:84%
But at the moment
that it's observed,

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:48.960 align:middle line:84%
those infinite
potentialities collapse

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:53.850 align:middle line:84%
into particular, actual
manifestation of the 3D world.

00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And we're actually, you
know, moment by moment

00:26:57.390 --> 00:27:01.050 align:middle line:84%
playing a part in that process,
but we-- and we're always

00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:03.300 align:middle line:84%
doing it, and we've
always been doing it,

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:06.480 align:middle line:84%
but we have been doing
it unconsciously.

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:08.910 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm saying,
you see, you know,

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:12.210 align:middle line:84%
in quantum physics,
the typical physicist,

00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:13.440 align:middle line:90%
they're not interested.

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:16.224 align:middle line:84%
They don't-- if you say to them,
well, what about consciousness,

00:27:16.224 --> 00:27:18.390 align:middle line:84%
the typical thing is they'll
just respond by saying,

00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:19.850 align:middle line:90%
shut up and calculate.

00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:20.650 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:21.775 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: That's the phrase.

00:27:21.775 --> 00:27:24.300 align:middle line:84%
But so here's me, who's just
like a really curious person,

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:27.570 align:middle line:84%
who's spiritually interested,
and I'm really wanting

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:29.680 align:middle line:84%
to understand,
well, wait a second,

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:32.820 align:middle line:84%
here's this thing that sort
of fell from the heavens

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:35.670 align:middle line:84%
that's-- and we're developing
unbelievable technology.

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:38.160 align:middle line:84%
It's changed the course
of human history.

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And the physicists who are the
real cutting edge physicists

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:44.280 align:middle line:84%
are saying that's just
the low hanging fruit.

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:48.450 align:middle line:84%
That's just like 0.001%
of what it's showing us.

00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:51.040 align:middle line:84%
And so here's me
who's saying, well,

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:53.940 align:middle line:84%
wait a second, what is
the meaning of the fact

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:58.320 align:middle line:84%
that this quantum has all of
a sudden come into our world?

00:27:58.320 --> 00:27:59.730 align:middle line:90%
What is that showing us?

00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And I guess one other thing
I want to say about that,

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:05.730 align:middle line:84%
one very famous quantum
physics says, oh, well,

00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:08.040 align:middle line:84%
the thing with-- he's
a very philosophical.

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:10.200 align:middle line:84%
He says, well, philosophy
is too important

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:12.360 align:middle line:90%
to be left to the philosophers.

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:14.730 align:middle line:84%
And so he's very
philosophical in his

00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:16.530 align:middle line:84%
trying to understand
quantum physics.

00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:17.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, I want to
say to him, yeah,

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:20.510 align:middle line:84%
but physics is too important
to be left to the physicists.

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:21.310 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It is.

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:22.684 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: That we
need to really--

00:28:22.684 --> 00:28:23.500 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It is.

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:25.920 align:middle line:10%
And I think that's why I love
Michael Talbot's work so much.

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:26.760 align:middle line:10%
He died young.

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:27.560 align:middle line:10%
>> PAUL: Right.

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:31.080 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: But he understood
where consciousness and physics

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:32.862 align:middle line:10%
meet in the world
of quantum physics.

00:28:32.862 --> 00:28:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And that was my
first introduction,

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:37.140 align:middle line:84%
so I never got into it in
a classical point of view.

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:40.770 align:middle line:84%
I was only brought into
it once the first books

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:46.020 align:middle line:84%
of the modern era started
emerging on the con--

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:49.000 align:middle line:84%
I guess the marriage of
consciousness and physics,

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.780 align:middle line:84%
the marriage of, as
you say, the logos

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:54.720 align:middle line:84%
and the chaos or prima
materia from which

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.160 align:middle line:90%
all things are created.

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And I found-- I
mean, it was-- to me,

00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:00.750 align:middle line:84%
it was really a mind
altering experience to read

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:01.980 align:middle line:90%
that book the first time.

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:02.550 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Right, right.

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:05.008 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And then of course,
from that point on, once you

00:29:05.008 --> 00:29:08.350 align:middle line:84%
know that, every single thing in
your life has to be run through

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:09.150 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:12.450 align:middle line:84%
Every decision you make is
run through the understanding

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:14.520 align:middle line:84%
that there is a
responsibility at the end

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:18.000 align:middle line:84%
of every single thought,
every word, every emotion.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.310 align:middle line:84%
And even though it's
happening-- it plays out

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:22.800 align:middle line:84%
in this dense reality in
a little slower fashion

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:26.130 align:middle line:84%
than that, the truth is, it
is happening that fast and all

00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:26.940 align:middle line:90%
of our lives.

00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:27.180 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Yeah.

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:29.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, the thing about
quantum physics-- two things.

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:33.210 align:middle line:84%
On the one hand,
it pervades our day

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:36.617 align:middle line:84%
to day everyday, you know, just
existence, just ordinary life.

00:29:36.617 --> 00:29:37.950 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's the basis of it.

00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:38.783 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Absolutely.

00:29:38.783 --> 00:29:40.860 align:middle line:84%
So it's not some sort
of esoteric thing

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:44.100 align:middle line:84%
that's, oh, this higher
dimensional abstract, you know,

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:45.130 align:middle line:90%
contemplation.

00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:48.690 align:middle line:84%
It's something that is informing
every moment of our lives.

00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:50.880 align:middle line:84%
The thing I want to
not forget to say,

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:55.240 align:middle line:84%
and it feels really important
to say, these two other things.

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:58.860 align:middle line:84%
One is quantum
physics is showing us

00:29:58.860 --> 00:29:59.910 align:middle line:90%
that this is a dream.

00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:02.460 align:middle line:84%
It's showing us the dreamlike
nature of this reality,

00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:03.940 align:middle line:84%
and that's what
the book is about.

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:06.090 align:middle line:84%
The second thing is
that quantum physics,

00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:08.995 align:middle line:84%
and really this
is an edge, but it

00:30:08.995 --> 00:30:10.620 align:middle line:84%
feels really important
to say quantum--

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:15.870 align:middle line:84%
what quantum physics is actually
pointing at and it's actually,

00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:19.440 align:middle line:84%
you know, revealing to
us it's the solution

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:22.710 align:middle line:84%
for the world for the
multiple crises in our world.

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:24.300 align:middle line:84%
If people-- if more
and more people

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:28.450 align:middle line:84%
understand what quantum physics
is actually pointing at,

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:30.000 align:middle line:90%
it can change the world.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.700 align:middle line:84%
But the thing about
its insights is

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:34.800 align:middle line:84%
that say if, you
know, the two of us

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:36.570 align:middle line:84%
or a few people,
if we understand--

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:38.430 align:middle line:84%
and even to use
the word understand

00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:41.250 align:middle line:84%
is not the right word, because
it's not like we can understand

00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:43.090 align:middle line:90%
it in the normal way.

00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:46.230 align:middle line:84%
But say if there's one person
who really understands quantum

00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:47.940 align:middle line:90%
physics, well, that doesn't--

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:49.200 align:middle line:90%
that-- so what.

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.730 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't make
any difference.

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:52.500 align:middle line:90%
The point is it only--

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:56.040 align:middle line:84%
when we're able to share it and
turn each other on to what it's

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:59.010 align:middle line:84%
revealing to us,
then it can propagate

00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:03.150 align:middle line:84%
through the collective
unconscious of our species

00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:04.290 align:middle line:90%
in this totally--

00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:09.270 align:middle line:84%
this viral way that can
ignite a spiritual awakening

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:11.040 align:middle line:84%
in our species that
we haven't even been

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:13.200 align:middle line:90%
able to imagine up until now.

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.610 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No, I
agree with that.

00:31:14.610 --> 00:31:16.530 align:middle line:84%
Instead, we have
bumper stickers,

00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:18.780 align:middle line:90%
you create your own reality.

00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:20.322 align:middle line:84%
It's been reduced
to bumper stickers.

00:31:20.322 --> 00:31:21.121 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Right.

00:31:21.121 --> 00:31:23.610 align:middle line:84%
And that I want to say I
have such an edge around that

00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:27.180 align:middle line:84%
because so many of these new
age people will talk about that

00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:30.100 align:middle line:84%
and they're conflating
and confusing the ego.

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:30.900 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:34.100 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: Oh, I as an ego create
my own reality, and that,

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:35.100 align:middle line:90%
that's delusion.

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:39.002 align:middle line:84%
That's not who's the I
who's creating the reality.

00:31:39.002 --> 00:31:40.710 align:middle line:84%
Like I was saying
before, quantum physics

00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:43.710 align:middle line:84%
is really shedding
light on who are we.

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:46.950 align:middle line:84%
It's, you know, through showing
that the objective world

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:49.170 align:middle line:84%
doesn't exist in the way
we've been imagining.

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:53.080 align:middle line:84%
It's actually giving us
insight into our own nature.

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:53.880 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And I think another
misunderstanding is the word

00:31:56.970 --> 00:31:59.640 align:middle line:84%
ego, actually, and
this comes up a lot.

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And there are so many
different understandings

00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:03.420 align:middle line:90%
of what the ego is.

00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:05.640 align:middle line:84%
But I think people
are understanding

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:09.060 align:middle line:84%
what you mean in the common
sense of the part of us

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:14.040 align:middle line:84%
that has imbalance in it,
tries to project itself

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:15.270 align:middle line:90%
on other things.

00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:17.020 align:middle line:84%
My understanding of
the ego is different.

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:19.110 align:middle line:84%
It's more of a
collective of everything

00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:23.370 align:middle line:84%
that's ever been in you, your
own experience throughout time.

00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And so in that sense,
it wouldn't be the ego,

00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:27.720 align:middle line:84%
but in the sense
you're talking about,

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:30.210 align:middle line:84%
this imbalanced
aspect of self that

00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:32.850 align:middle line:84%
is trying to control,
predict, prove,

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:34.830 align:middle line:90%
and so forth in the world.

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:37.260 align:middle line:84%
That part that's
called ego in that way

00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:38.550 align:middle line:90%
is what you're speaking of.

00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:38.870 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Yeah.

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:39.690 align:middle line:90%
And the thing--

00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:41.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm so glad that
you brought that up,

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:45.480 align:middle line:84%
because one of the main points
that I talk about in the book--

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:49.080 align:middle line:84%
for example, in
Tibetan Buddhism there

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:55.380 align:middle line:84%
is this idea of these
hidden treasures

00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:59.160 align:middle line:84%
that the great guru kind
of planted in the universe,

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:04.140 align:middle line:84%
in the Earth, in the sky, in
water, in oceans, in our minds,

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:06.750 align:middle line:84%
these treasures that
were time released

00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:09.660 align:middle line:84%
to be discovered at
exactly the right moment

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:12.990 align:middle line:84%
by the person whose fate it was
to discover those treasures.

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:15.420 align:middle line:84%
And it was to
compensate this one

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:19.620 align:middle line:84%
sidedness that was happening
at that moment in history.

00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:22.279 align:middle line:84%
And you know what, it's
a historical thing,

00:33:22.279 --> 00:33:23.820 align:middle line:84%
it's not just some
sort of fairytale.

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:26.400 align:middle line:84%
Like scholars study
this tradition.

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:30.210 align:middle line:10%
It's actually--
it's called terma,

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:33.090 align:middle line:10%
and the terma tradition is
the hidden treasure tradition.

00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:37.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm pointing out
that quantum physics is--

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:41.760 align:middle line:84%
now, I'm not authorized to be
saying, oh, this is a terma

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:43.230 align:middle line:90%
or that's a terma.

00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:47.670 align:middle line:84%
But from everything I know about
terma, that quantum physics,

00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:50.280 align:middle line:84%
it fits the bill as being
this modern day terma,

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:52.620 align:middle line:84%
that we as a species
have literally

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:58.290 align:middle line:84%
dreamed up quantum physics to
help us to remember who we are,

00:33:58.290 --> 00:34:01.230 align:middle line:90%
if seen in its proper way.

00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:03.900 align:middle line:90%
And I think that that--

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:06.600 align:middle line:84%
I honestly feel that
that's really true.

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And if you see quantum
physics in that way,

00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:11.460 align:middle line:84%
then by the nature of
this being a dream, that's

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:13.614 align:middle line:84%
the way it'll manifest, it
will help us to wake up.

00:34:13.614 --> 00:34:15.780 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So that's a part
of Buddhism for you that

00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:18.960 align:middle line:84%
intersects with quantum physics
and where it all makes sense.

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:22.739 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: I point out in the
book that when the Buddha--

00:34:22.739 --> 00:34:26.535 align:middle line:84%
when he had his
enlightenment experience that

00:34:26.535 --> 00:34:29.550 align:middle line:84%
that's-- in essence, that's
equivalent to the discovery

00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:30.420 align:middle line:90%
of the quantum.

00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:33.837 align:middle line:84%
It's the same
experience of having,

00:34:33.837 --> 00:34:38.909 align:middle line:84%
you know, of really having the
experience of the true nature,

00:34:38.909 --> 00:34:40.750 align:middle line:90%
but via the medium of science.

00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:42.179 align:middle line:90%
So the thing about quantum--

00:34:42.179 --> 00:34:44.639 align:middle line:84%
you know, the
quantum is that it's

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:47.580 align:middle line:84%
both it's both pointing
at the dreamlike nature

00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:50.489 align:middle line:84%
and it's an
expression of which it

00:34:50.489 --> 00:34:54.600 align:middle line:84%
is pointing at the same time,
which is to say it's a symbol.

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And symbols, when you
try to figure out,

00:34:57.790 --> 00:34:59.190 align:middle line:90%
oh, how do I work with dreams?

00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:01.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, dreams speak the
language of symbols.

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:04.290 align:middle line:84%
You know, the symbols
are its language.

00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And so quantum physics
is a symbolic procedure.

00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And so the thing
I'm trying to say

00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:12.480 align:middle line:84%
is that quantum
physics, it's actually,

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:15.000 align:middle line:84%
by pointing out the
dreamlike nature,

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.840 align:middle line:84%
when we begin to contemplate
this world and our lives

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:20.550 align:middle line:84%
as if it's a dream
and understand

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:24.210 align:middle line:84%
what is it symbolically
showing us, all of a sudden

00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:26.120 align:middle line:84%
we're having an expansion
of consciousness.

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:26.920 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: We are.

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And in some of the
ancient mysteries,

00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:32.700 align:middle line:84%
it talks about the various
people who incarnated as what

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:35.250 align:middle line:84%
we call the great masters
throughout history, right,

00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:38.280 align:middle line:90%
and they're-- you can study--

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:40.290 align:middle line:84%
anyone can research
this themselves.

00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:44.160 align:middle line:84%
But it would be as though
the same motivating force

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:46.860 align:middle line:84%
or motivating uber
entity even is

00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:50.100 align:middle line:84%
coming in incarnating at
these key periods of times

00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:52.170 align:middle line:84%
through this lineage
of individuals, Buddha

00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:53.380 align:middle line:90%
being one of them.

00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:54.180 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Right.

00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:55.150 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mithra.

00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:55.950 align:middle line:90%
Jesus.

00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:56.992 align:middle line:90%
Many, many, many of them.

00:35:56.992 --> 00:35:57.908 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Right, right.

00:35:57.908 --> 00:36:00.330 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: At key periods of
time where society is ready

00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:02.677 align:middle line:84%
to be seated with something
that's going to change

00:36:02.677 --> 00:36:04.260 align:middle line:84%
their thoughts,
uplift their thoughts,

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:05.470 align:middle line:90%
or change their destiny.

00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:06.270 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Right.

00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:07.895 align:middle line:84%
That's absolutely
true, and the thing--

00:36:07.895 --> 00:36:10.350 align:middle line:84%
what that brings to mind for
me is, with quantum physics,

00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:12.840 align:middle line:84%
all the founding
fathers who were saying

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:15.842 align:middle line:84%
that the real change in
quantum physics that it's

00:36:15.842 --> 00:36:17.800 align:middle line:84%
going to bring in the
world is in our thinking,

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:18.790 align:middle line:90%
is in our mind.

00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:19.260 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:21.093 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: And that, like
I was saying before,

00:36:21.093 --> 00:36:23.760 align:middle line:84%
all the technology and,
you know, it's created,

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:26.250 align:middle line:84%
according to these quantum
physicists, this is this epoch.

00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:29.220 align:middle line:84%
This is a new epoch
because of quantum physics.

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:32.520 align:middle line:84%
It's that radical
of a discovery.

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:36.000 align:middle line:84%
But it's actually,
you know, what

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.200 align:middle line:84%
we've done with it so far is
so minuscule compared to what

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:41.310 align:middle line:90%
it's actually showing us.

00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:41.670 align:middle line:90%
And what it's showing us--

00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:42.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, it's
just the beginning.

00:36:42.490 --> 00:36:43.323 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Yeah, yeah.

00:36:43.323 --> 00:36:45.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, because it's such
an over-the-top discovery,

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:48.870 align:middle line:84%
and when we have discoveries
like this in history,

00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:51.390 align:middle line:84%
they typically take
years and years for us

00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:53.040 align:middle line:84%
to unpack, what is
the meaning of this?

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We're coming
out of the industrial age,

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:55.380 align:middle line:90%
for heaven's sake--

00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:55.680 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Right.

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --with soot
covered kids, you know?

00:36:57.530 --> 00:36:58.260 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Right.

00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:00.551 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So yeah, it is
going to take a little while.

00:37:00.551 --> 00:37:03.450 align:middle line:84%
But there is a
particular individual

00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:05.790 align:middle line:84%
that you have great
respect for in this way.

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:08.040 align:middle line:10%
When we're talking about
great enlightened master

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:10.650 align:middle line:10%
entities that come to the Earth
to drop certain information

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:14.000 align:middle line:10%
at a certain time and
shift society's direction,

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.010 align:middle line:10%
might John Archibald
Wheeler be that for you?

00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:18.140 align:middle line:10%
>> PAUL: Oh, totally.

00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:19.120 align:middle line:90%
He really is.

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:22.560 align:middle line:84%
And I actually-- when I
was a freshman in college,

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:24.990 align:middle line:84%
I went to visit my best
friend at Princeton

00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:28.290 align:middle line:84%
and he was studying physics,
and I went to his physics,

00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:30.230 align:middle line:84%
you know, the intro
physics class.

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:33.510 align:middle line:84%
And right before it started, he
leaned over to me and he said,

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:36.660 align:middle line:84%
(WHISPERING) John Wheeler
is sitting right behind you.

00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And I had no idea
who John Wheeler was.

00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:41.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I could have touched
him, he was that close.

00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of make a joke now
that, yeah, our wave functions

00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:46.410 align:middle line:84%
got face entangled
in that moment.

00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:50.230 align:middle line:84%
But he was a colleague
of Bohr and Einstein,

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:53.710 align:middle line:84%
and he was so amazing and
such an inspiration to me.

00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:56.410 align:middle line:10%
I mean, he-- you know, with
my new book, he's the one

00:37:56.410 --> 00:37:57.210 align:middle line:10%
I dedicated it to.

00:37:57.210 --> 00:37:57.730 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:37:57.730 --> 00:37:58.530 align:middle line:10%
>> PAUL: Yeah.

00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:01.080 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: I mean, not only a
quantum physicist, but a poet.

00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:03.690 align:middle line:84%
He was a thinker of a much
larger nature where he saw

00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:05.305 align:middle line:90%
how all of this came together.

00:38:05.305 --> 00:38:06.180 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Oh, totally.

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:08.220 align:middle line:90%
And he was open--

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:10.500 align:middle line:84%
he opened himself to
a lot of criticism

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:14.160 align:middle line:84%
from the straight physicists
who thought, oh, why

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:16.200 align:middle line:84%
is he spending so much
time in this really

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:18.480 align:middle line:90%
out there, this speculation?

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:20.430 align:middle line:84%
But he was really
trying to understand

00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:23.580 align:middle line:84%
what is the meaning of
the quantum, you know?

00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And so he was like this poet
and a philosopher who really

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:32.850 align:middle line:84%
brought in, you know,
that deeper point

00:38:32.850 --> 00:38:35.820 align:middle line:84%
of view of trying to understand
the philosophical meaning

00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:39.790 align:middle line:84%
of things in a way that
deeply, deeply it speaks to me.

00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:42.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So if someone
is wanting to dive into it,

00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:43.827 align:middle line:90%
John Archibald Wheeler?

00:38:43.827 --> 00:38:44.910 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:45.060 align:middle line:90%
Totally.

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:45.450 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Go there.

00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:45.945 align:middle line:90%
Go there.

00:38:45.945 --> 00:38:46.778 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Absolutely.

00:38:46.778 --> 00:38:49.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And what inspired you
to do your life's work as well.

00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:52.410 align:middle line:84%
And so within this whole
soup of understanding,

00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:54.600 align:middle line:84%
you've come to believe,
you say, that art

00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:56.670 align:middle line:90%
is the queen of all sciences.

00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:59.790 align:middle line:84%
So what is it in the
creative world of art that--

00:38:59.790 --> 00:39:00.610 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Right.

00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:01.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:04.240 align:middle line:90%
Well, the thing is that--

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:07.740 align:middle line:84%
so here I am not a scientist,
and yet, for decades, I've

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:10.860 align:middle line:84%
been really just so
fascinated by quantum physics.

00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And the more I began to
study quantum physics

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:15.660 align:middle line:84%
and the more I began to
study the physicists who

00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:18.090 align:middle line:84%
were the founders
of quantum physics,

00:39:18.090 --> 00:39:20.460 align:middle line:84%
the more I began to
understand, oh, they

00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:21.990 align:middle line:84%
were like artists
in that they were

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:24.390 align:middle line:90%
incredibly creative people.

00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And it was through
having an imagination

00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:29.310 align:middle line:84%
and the creative
imagination, which

00:39:29.310 --> 00:39:33.750 align:middle line:84%
is really hooked in to not
just our conscious ego,

00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:36.270 align:middle line:84%
but some higher dimensional
part of ourselves,

00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:38.040 align:middle line:84%
whether you call
it God or whatever,

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:40.290 align:middle line:84%
that it was through the
creative imagination

00:39:40.290 --> 00:39:43.770 align:middle line:84%
that the greatest discoveries
in physics were being made.

00:39:43.770 --> 00:39:46.590 align:middle line:84%
And so then I began
to realize, well,

00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:50.850 align:middle line:84%
art and science, which typically
are seen to be opposites,

00:39:50.850 --> 00:39:56.460 align:middle line:84%
actually are really so
kind of these complements

00:39:56.460 --> 00:40:00.300 align:middle line:84%
and interrelated
in that they feed--

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:01.660 align:middle line:90%
they feed each other.

00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:02.460 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They do.

00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And there's also
another component to art

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:06.720 align:middle line:90%
that science does not possess.

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And as you say, desire
is what drives us forward

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:10.690 align:middle line:90%
into our creation, right?

00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:11.490 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Mhm.

00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:12.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And
this is something--

00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:14.730 align:middle line:84%
and this is where it sometimes
can come into conflict with

00:40:14.730 --> 00:40:15.530 align:middle line:90%
Buddhism.

00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:18.400 align:middle line:84%
Desire is the root of all
suffering is one axiom, right?

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:21.430 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand,
desire's what moves us forward

00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:24.400 align:middle line:84%
into everything we create
on one level or another.

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:28.060 align:middle line:84%
Art can create an
incredible kind of desire

00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:29.232 align:middle line:90%
within for experience.

00:40:29.232 --> 00:40:31.690 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: And I think that that
contradiction with Buddhism,

00:40:31.690 --> 00:40:35.320 align:middle line:84%
that's just a question of like
semantics in the sense that,

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:38.180 align:middle line:90%
for me, you know, for--

00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:41.080 align:middle line:84%
if somebody who's
not a physicist,

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:42.850 align:middle line:84%
they wanna understand
what is the takeaway

00:40:42.850 --> 00:40:45.400 align:middle line:84%
from this conversation
or from my book,

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:51.070 align:middle line:84%
is that we are these
incredibly creative beings.

00:40:51.070 --> 00:40:55.390 align:middle line:84%
And what most of us
unfortunately have done

00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:58.250 align:middle line:90%
is we've been entrained--

00:40:58.250 --> 00:41:02.080 align:middle line:84%
we've actually, in a
way, hypnotized ourselves

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:06.010 align:middle line:84%
so that our creativity turns
against us in a way that's

00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:09.580 align:middle line:84%
like this limiting way
that's basically killing us,

00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:12.550 align:middle line:84%
and that's actually
playing out in the body

00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:13.434 align:middle line:90%
politic of the world.

00:41:13.434 --> 00:41:14.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:41:14.350 --> 00:41:14.680 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: You know?

00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:16.055 align:middle line:84%
And when you see
this as a dream,

00:41:16.055 --> 00:41:18.880 align:middle line:84%
you understand that
what's playing out there

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:20.680 align:middle line:84%
in the external
dimension is actually

00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:23.170 align:middle line:84%
a reflection, just
like a dream, of what's

00:41:23.170 --> 00:41:25.810 align:middle line:90%
happening inside of our psyche.

00:41:25.810 --> 00:41:29.140 align:middle line:84%
And so yeah, so the thing
about quantum physics

00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:32.110 align:middle line:84%
is that it's really
not just pointing

00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:35.680 align:middle line:84%
at that we're creative beings,
but when you begin to really go

00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:37.750 align:middle line:84%
down the rabbit hole
of quantum physics,

00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:41.380 align:middle line:84%
it actually unlocks
that infinite creativity

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:44.680 align:middle line:84%
that we have access to
each and every moment,

00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:48.050 align:middle line:84%
but like I was saying before,
we're just unconscious of that.

00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:51.330 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And going back,
I'm a big one on desire,

00:41:51.330 --> 00:41:54.817 align:middle line:84%
that these kinds of heartfelt,
gut felt generated desires,

00:41:54.817 --> 00:41:57.400 align:middle line:84%
even on the part of the artist,
that's what pulls them forward

00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:00.080 align:middle line:84%
into their creation, it's what
pulls us forward into our own

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:00.880 align:middle line:90%
creation.

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:01.270 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Right.

00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:03.610 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Sometimes it
can be incredibly beautiful

00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:04.450 align:middle line:90%
and fruitful.

00:42:04.450 --> 00:42:06.400 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it can be
very destructive.

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:09.730 align:middle line:84%
Either way, it has a very
powerful effect of drawing out

00:42:09.730 --> 00:42:13.090 align:middle line:84%
a creation, and one of them
is prediction and control

00:42:13.090 --> 00:42:17.260 align:middle line:84%
that we're seeing really
as the illness in society

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:18.700 align:middle line:90%
today on a lot of levels.

00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:21.500 align:middle line:84%
But you say, in general,
prediction and control is dead,

00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:22.300 align:middle line:90%
in your book.

00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:22.640 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:23.800 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's talk about
what do you mean by that.

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:24.600 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Totally.

00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:27.040 align:middle line:84%
What I meant by that is
that, before quantum physics,

00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:30.400 align:middle line:84%
physicists thought that if
they had enough information,

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:33.760 align:middle line:84%
they could predict the future,
and that it was deterministic,

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:36.850 align:middle line:90%
it was this mechanistic system.

00:42:36.850 --> 00:42:41.350 align:middle line:84%
And-- but quantum physics
has shown that, no, no, no,

00:42:41.350 --> 00:42:45.610 align:middle line:84%
you know, the idea of prediction
that that's an old idea that

00:42:45.610 --> 00:42:48.670 align:middle line:84%
everything is in a state
you can actually predict

00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:51.310 align:middle line:84%
the probability of,
well, this is, you know,

00:42:51.310 --> 00:42:53.950 align:middle line:84%
99% probable that
this will happen,

00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:56.200 align:middle line:90%
but you can't say for sure--

00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:58.940 align:middle line:84%
for sure, for definite
sure that what,

00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:00.430 align:middle line:84%
you know, what's
going to happen.

00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And that opens up
vistas of possibilities.

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:06.670 align:middle line:84%
Because say if,
for example, there

00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:10.990 align:middle line:84%
is a minutely small possibility
that we, as a species,

00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:13.150 align:middle line:84%
might wake up, right,
and might wake up

00:43:13.150 --> 00:43:16.377 align:middle line:84%
and connect with each other
and change this waking dream.

00:43:16.377 --> 00:43:17.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, quantum physics
is saying, well,

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:20.350 align:middle line:84%
wait a second, that's
a possibility, right?

00:43:20.350 --> 00:43:23.220 align:middle line:84%
That means that that
actually could manifest.

00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:24.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:26.350 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: And that,
all of a sudden--

00:43:26.350 --> 00:43:28.930 align:middle line:84%
you see, because if we hold
like this pessimistic viewpoint

00:43:28.930 --> 00:43:30.250 align:middle line:90%
of like, oh, no, no, no--

00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:31.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's going to
hell in a hand basket.

00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:33.054 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: It's going to
hell in a hand basket.

00:43:33.054 --> 00:43:35.290 align:middle line:84%
Well then, by that
pessimistic viewpoint,

00:43:35.290 --> 00:43:39.460 align:middle line:84%
we're unwittingly-- we're
feeding that very dream

00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:41.260 align:middle line:84%
to manifest, to
prove our viewpoint,

00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:44.110 align:middle line:84%
so therefore, we're
complicit in the evil that's

00:43:44.110 --> 00:43:45.490 align:middle line:90%
playing out in the world.

00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:46.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: We are.

00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's very hard
not to be if you

00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:51.320 align:middle line:84%
have any entanglement
with the media, especially

00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:52.120 align:middle line:90%
mainstream media.

00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:52.440 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Oh, totally.

00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:52.940 align:middle line:90%
With the propaganda.

00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:53.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: For example--

00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:54.250 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Yeah, yeah, totally.

00:43:54.250 --> 00:43:55.720 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --the Propaganda.

00:43:55.720 --> 00:44:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And so our mass psychology has
become from a top down level,

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:03.280 align:middle line:84%
from governments,
militaries, and so forth,

00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:04.600 align:middle line:90%
predict and control.

00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:07.430 align:middle line:84%
Very old-- dysfunctional
patriarchal attitude--

00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:08.230 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Right.

00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:11.500 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --that has really
gained a lot of stickiness

00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:13.777 align:middle line:84%
for thousands of years
and become concretized.

00:44:13.777 --> 00:44:14.860 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's where like
these physicists--

00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:19.690 align:middle line:84%
you see, it's so interesting
for me, as a non physicist,

00:44:19.690 --> 00:44:21.700 align:middle line:84%
to study what these
guys are saying.

00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And not just guys,
there are also women.

00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:26.470 align:middle line:84%
But the idea-- what
they're-- one of the things

00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:30.580 align:middle line:84%
they're saying is that the
importance of don't take

00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:33.280 align:middle line:90%
anybody else's word for it.

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:35.210 align:middle line:84%
Take-- you know,
think for yourself.

00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:36.010 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:44:36.010 --> 00:44:36.850 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Do the experiments.

00:44:36.850 --> 00:44:39.484 align:middle line:84%
Just like the Buddha said, the
Buddha was giving teachings

00:44:39.484 --> 00:44:41.650 align:middle line:84%
and he said to-- he literally
said to his disciples,

00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:42.850 align:middle line:90%
don't take my word for it--

00:44:42.850 --> 00:44:43.360 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:45.070 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: --do the
experiment yourself.

00:44:45.070 --> 00:44:47.330 align:middle line:84%
Go within and see if
what I'm saying is true.

00:44:47.330 --> 00:44:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly what the
quantum physicists are saying.

00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:52.870 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: As all great
teachers, from kindergarten up,

00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:53.890 align:middle line:90%
will do.

00:44:53.890 --> 00:44:54.870 align:middle line:90%
Try it.

00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:56.840 align:middle line:90%
See-- see what you can do.

00:44:56.840 --> 00:45:01.030 align:middle line:84%
See where your mind can
do and create for you.

00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:03.490 align:middle line:84%
That's the mark of a
responsible, real teacher,

00:45:03.490 --> 00:45:06.430 align:middle line:84%
whether it's on a universal
level or in kindergarten.

00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes,
instead we're being

00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:10.450 align:middle line:84%
stuffed with what's right,
what's wrong, you know,

00:45:10.450 --> 00:45:11.870 align:middle line:90%
memorization, and so forth.

00:45:11.870 --> 00:45:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And this is, again, an extension
of that old industrial age

00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:15.550 align:middle line:90%
remnant--

00:45:15.550 --> 00:45:20.010 align:middle line:84%
dying remnant of what we would
call a patriarchal overlay

00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:21.090 align:middle line:90%
to our psychology.

00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:22.030 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: Oh, that's
definitely true.

00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:23.946 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is is what
you were just saying,

00:45:23.946 --> 00:45:26.280 align:middle line:84%
it made me think
that this other thing

00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:28.230 align:middle line:84%
that these great
physics are saying,

00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:30.180 align:middle line:84%
they're saying
way more important

00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:34.304 align:middle line:84%
than finding the right answer
is asking the right question.

00:45:34.304 --> 00:45:35.220 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:36.830 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: And that,
when I read that--

00:45:36.830 --> 00:45:38.670 align:middle line:84%
and they were also
saying, oh yeah,

00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:40.890 align:middle line:84%
we don't take any expert's
word for anything.

00:45:40.890 --> 00:45:43.060 align:middle line:84%
Experts are meaningless,
from our point of view.

00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:43.960 align:middle line:90%
We're all amateurs.

00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:44.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:47.430 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: And that
point of view--

00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:49.830 align:middle line:84%
and they say how they
define an expert.

00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:52.590 align:middle line:84%
An expert, like
this real expert,

00:45:52.590 --> 00:45:54.420 align:middle line:84%
they say there is
somebody who knows

00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:55.770 align:middle line:90%
where all the mistakes are--

00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:56.040 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:56.670 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: --because
they've made them.

00:45:56.670 --> 00:45:56.990 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:45:56.990 --> 00:45:58.470 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: And that
really spoke to me.

00:45:58.470 --> 00:45:59.010 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:45:59.010 --> 00:45:59.970 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:45:59.970 --> 00:46:04.200 align:middle line:84%
You talk about, in this
process, of finding

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:05.670 align:middle line:90%
our own capabilities.

00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:07.560 align:middle line:84%
You talk about
polishing the jewel.

00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:08.360 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:09.193 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Yeah, yeah.

00:46:09.193 --> 00:46:12.810 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So I'm assuming this
is something to do with going

00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:15.450 align:middle line:84%
into engagement with the
higher part of consciousness

00:46:15.450 --> 00:46:16.620 align:middle line:90%
in the creative process?

00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:17.420 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:18.750 align:middle line:84%
What does it actually
mean according

00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:19.730 align:middle line:90%
to what you're saying?

00:46:19.730 --> 00:46:20.670 align:middle line:90%
This is what I'm perceiving.

00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:21.470 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Right.

00:46:21.470 --> 00:46:24.480 align:middle line:84%
So the polishing,
you know, that--

00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:26.040 align:middle line:84%
you know, that
precious jewel, it's

00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:29.390 align:middle line:84%
like there's a metaphor in
spiritual traditions of Indra's

00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:30.190 align:middle line:90%
net.

00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:34.560 align:middle line:10%
And Indra's net is this net
of these polished-- like these

00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:37.470 align:middle line:10%
gemstones, these
jewels at each them,

00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:40.740 align:middle line:10%
where all where the threads
intersect, and they all

00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:43.270 align:middle line:10%
are-- they reflect each other.

00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:45.480 align:middle line:84%
So in any jewel, all
the other jewels,

00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:47.680 align:middle line:84%
which goes on to
infinity, are reflected.

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:48.480 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: And-- but the
point is, so those--

00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:54.210 align:middle line:84%
each of those jewels, you
know, one could think of them

00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:56.160 align:middle line:84%
as being, oh, they're
each one of us.

00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:58.380 align:middle line:84%
They're like this
consciousness that's

00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:03.810 align:middle line:84%
in time and space like us, which
means that when any one of us

00:47:03.810 --> 00:47:06.900 align:middle line:84%
self reflects and owns our
shadow or wakes up to whatever

00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:11.700 align:middle line:84%
degree, we add that much
light to our own consciousness

00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:15.180 align:middle line:84%
and that non-locally,
outside of space and time,

00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:17.860 align:middle line:84%
gets invested into
the whole universe,

00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:23.830 align:middle line:84%
or the whole universe lights up
via our act of self reflection.

00:47:23.830 --> 00:47:26.870 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And on that
note, you say individuality

00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:30.970 align:middle line:84%
or individuation is part of
the process of becoming whole.

00:47:30.970 --> 00:47:31.770 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Right.

00:47:31.770 --> 00:47:34.680 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Most people
see them as either/or,

00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:36.250 align:middle line:90%
together or separate, right?

00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:37.050 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Yeah.

00:47:37.050 --> 00:47:39.720 align:middle line:84%
The way to make change
in this universe

00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:43.380 align:middle line:84%
is-- yeah, it would be great
if the whole collectivity could

00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:47.130 align:middle line:84%
wake up, but is through the
individual, that any one of us

00:47:47.130 --> 00:47:50.610 align:middle line:84%
actually like having the
recognition of our nature,

00:47:50.610 --> 00:47:53.220 align:middle line:90%
of our true nature.

00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:55.590 align:middle line:84%
You know, like I was
saying, you know,

00:47:55.590 --> 00:47:58.500 align:middle line:84%
that immediately
the [INAUDIBLE],,

00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:01.290 align:middle line:90%
it informs the whole world.

00:48:01.290 --> 00:48:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And the thing which is
so interesting about that

00:48:05.070 --> 00:48:08.880 align:middle line:84%
is that one thought form
that's really inspiring

00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:11.490 align:middle line:84%
is that say if you have
this glass of water

00:48:11.490 --> 00:48:13.890 align:middle line:84%
and you put like a grain of
sugar in the glass of water,

00:48:13.890 --> 00:48:14.850 align:middle line:90%
it will just dissolve.

00:48:14.850 --> 00:48:16.225 align:middle line:84%
And you put a
second grain, it'll

00:48:16.225 --> 00:48:19.080 align:middle line:84%
just dissolve, and
on and on, until you

00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:21.150 align:middle line:90%
reach the point of saturation.

00:48:21.150 --> 00:48:24.030 align:middle line:84%
And once you reach
that saturation point,

00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:27.780 align:middle line:84%
you add one more grain of sugar
and a crystal will emerge.

00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And the point is is
that any one of us,

00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:34.770 align:middle line:84%
at even at this
moment, if we actually

00:48:34.770 --> 00:48:36.690 align:middle line:84%
have the recognition
of our nature,

00:48:36.690 --> 00:48:39.360 align:middle line:84%
we might be that
grain of sugar that

00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:43.200 align:middle line:84%
crystallizes a whole
awakening in our species.

00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:44.400 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's very true.

00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And as you say, the
process of being

00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:49.290 align:middle line:84%
able to honor that in one
another, make ourselves whole,

00:48:49.290 --> 00:48:52.380 align:middle line:84%
see the wholeness in others
actually reinforces itself,

00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:55.590 align:middle line:84%
just like in a dream, to make
the whole-- to make each of us

00:48:55.590 --> 00:48:57.007 align:middle line:90%
whole in this process.

00:48:57.007 --> 00:48:57.840 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Yeah, yeah.

00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:01.530 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is we can only
see the wholeness in each other.

00:49:01.530 --> 00:49:02.721 align:middle line:90%
You see, I have a big--

00:49:02.721 --> 00:49:05.220 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the biggest chapter
in the whole book about how

00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:07.570 align:middle line:84%
quantum physics informs
our everyday relationships.

00:49:07.570 --> 00:49:08.370 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:49:08.370 --> 00:49:12.420 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: And to the extent that
if I see like say, for example,

00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:14.580 align:middle line:84%
with us, if I'm seeing
a shadow part of you

00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:16.740 align:middle line:84%
and I'm concretizing
that part of you, well,

00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:19.800 align:middle line:84%
then that's making it-- it's not
causing you to manifest in that

00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:22.770 align:middle line:84%
shadow element, but it's
more probable that you will.

00:49:22.770 --> 00:49:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you do manifest
in the shadow element,

00:49:24.990 --> 00:49:27.750 align:middle line:84%
then it confirms my point of
view that you really are--

00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:29.460 align:middle line:84%
and you know, that
shadowy figure--

00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:29.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:31.176 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: --you
know, ad infinitum.

00:49:31.176 --> 00:49:33.240 align:middle line:84%
But the point is
that if I, instead

00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:36.750 align:middle line:84%
of being caught by that like
one little aspect of you,

00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:39.570 align:middle line:84%
which is the
shadow, if I see you

00:49:39.570 --> 00:49:41.670 align:middle line:84%
in your true nature
in your wholeness--

00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:44.410 align:middle line:84%
and I can only do that if I'm
in touch with my own wholeness.

00:49:44.410 --> 00:49:45.210 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:49:45.210 --> 00:49:47.760 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: Then if I see
your wholeness in that way,

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:50.760 align:middle line:84%
it actually creates a
bridge for you to more step

00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:51.960 align:middle line:90%
into your wholeness.

00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:54.570 align:middle line:84%
And then the more you are able
to step into your wholeness,

00:49:54.570 --> 00:49:58.170 align:middle line:84%
you see me more in my wholeness,
so you actually help me.

00:49:58.170 --> 00:49:59.630 align:middle line:90%
And it becomes a feedback loop--

00:49:59.630 --> 00:50:00.030 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:02.196 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: --that's actually
a positive feedback loop.

00:50:02.196 --> 00:50:05.010 align:middle line:84%
We're actually-- we're
like helping each other.

00:50:05.010 --> 00:50:07.950 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And yet, almost
every person gets some kind

00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:10.890 align:middle line:84%
of private little glee
in holding an attitude

00:50:10.890 --> 00:50:15.030 align:middle line:84%
of superiority over another
person or separation with other

00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:17.990 align:middle line:84%
people on some level because
of this stickiness we've been

00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:20.240 align:middle line:90%
through for thousands of years.

00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:22.760 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: Right, but that's
the one way of understanding

00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:25.400 align:middle line:84%
quantum physics is that it's
like shedding a light on that,

00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:28.080 align:middle line:84%
because it's showing that
there's no separation.

00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:28.880 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:32.010 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: That the universe is a
singularity, it's a wholeness.

00:50:32.010 --> 00:50:35.750 align:middle line:84%
There's no-- you know, the
non locality of the universe

00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:40.610 align:middle line:84%
that every part of the
universe is interconnected

00:50:40.610 --> 00:50:42.110 align:middle line:90%
with every other part.

00:50:42.110 --> 00:50:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And so what that means
is that, wait a second,

00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:49.040 align:middle line:84%
if I'm helping you, it helps me,
and we're all in this together

00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:50.250 align:middle line:90%
and we depend on each other.

00:50:50.250 --> 00:50:51.690 align:middle line:90%
We're interdependent.

00:50:51.690 --> 00:50:54.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of why when
I was having-- going back

00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:58.130 align:middle line:84%
to 1981, when I was having
that whole awakening,

00:50:58.130 --> 00:51:00.620 align:middle line:84%
I was having the realization,
oh my God, as artists,

00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:05.630 align:middle line:84%
we can create an art
happening, and you can call it

00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:10.130 align:middle line:84%
sort of this global
awakening in which we're all

00:51:10.130 --> 00:51:13.320 align:middle line:84%
helping each other to
awaken, in other words,

00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:16.130 align:middle line:84%
what I call to dream
ourselves awake.

00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:17.720 align:middle line:90%
To-- it's a conspiracy theory.

00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:20.330 align:middle line:84%
We are conspiring to
co-inspire each other.

00:51:20.330 --> 00:51:22.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's this authentic
conspiracy theory

00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:26.330 align:middle line:84%
that we're activating the
genius, the collective genius,

00:51:26.330 --> 00:51:28.730 align:middle line:84%
in each other, and
that's evolutionary

00:51:28.730 --> 00:51:31.850 align:middle line:84%
and that's what's available
to us as a species.

00:51:31.850 --> 00:51:35.870 align:middle line:84%
And quantum physics is actually
pointing exactly at that,

00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:38.010 align:middle line:90%
if we interpret it correctly.

00:51:38.010 --> 00:51:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's pointing out, well,
we have it within our creative

00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:44.730 align:middle line:84%
genius, within our power to
actually change the world,

00:51:44.730 --> 00:51:47.201 align:middle line:84%
and not just in sort of new
agey, abstract, woo-woo way--

00:51:47.201 --> 00:51:48.200 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No, it's not.

00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:50.120 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: --but in
real-- in a real way.

00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:51.440 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Very much so.

00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:55.130 align:middle line:84%
It is the-- it's
the validation, you

00:51:55.130 --> 00:51:59.300 align:middle line:84%
know, that humanity is
looking for to have-- well,

00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:03.950 align:middle line:84%
the reason to give
up the grudges,

00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:07.520 align:middle line:84%
because there is a price
to pay for the grudges

00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:11.720 align:middle line:84%
that humanity at large
holds against their past,

00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:14.770 align:middle line:84%
against others, against
themselves, guilt, shame,

00:52:14.770 --> 00:52:15.570 align:middle line:90%
all of it.

00:52:15.570 --> 00:52:15.740 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Oh, totally.

00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:16.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:52:16.070 --> 00:52:17.300 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Every bit of this.

00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:21.140 align:middle line:84%
There is a comfort that humanity
has with it at this point,

00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:23.460 align:middle line:84%
because we haven't
evolved out of it yet.

00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:24.260 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Yeah.

00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:26.930 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we're at that
crossing point where that

00:52:26.930 --> 00:52:29.580 align:middle line:84%
comfort that, you know,
so-and-so did this and I'm--

00:52:29.580 --> 00:52:30.380 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Right.

00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:32.630 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --and you know, this
self-righteous feeling which

00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:34.760 align:middle line:84%
gives you this little kind
of boost or something,

00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:38.580 align:middle line:84%
whatever it gives a
person inside, right?

00:52:38.580 --> 00:52:41.030 align:middle line:84%
We have to have a
very clear reason

00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:43.930 align:middle line:84%
to understand it's
time to give it up.

00:52:43.930 --> 00:52:44.730 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Yeah.

00:52:44.730 --> 00:52:45.140 align:middle line:90%
Well, what you're--

00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:46.250 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's hurting you.

00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:46.670 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:48.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, what you're
describing to the extent

00:52:48.770 --> 00:52:50.680 align:middle line:84%
that if I'm not in touch
with like, you know,

00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:54.200 align:middle line:84%
the evil inside of me, my own
darkness, the shadow inside

00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:55.974 align:middle line:84%
of me, not just
personal, but archetypal,

00:52:55.974 --> 00:52:57.890 align:middle line:84%
well then, you know, I'm
going to-- of course,

00:52:57.890 --> 00:52:58.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to project it out.

00:52:58.910 --> 00:53:00.493 align:middle line:84%
And just like a
dream, if I project it

00:53:00.493 --> 00:53:03.680 align:middle line:84%
out and into the dream, into
this world comes somebody

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:06.710 align:middle line:84%
who will carry my own
shadow and they're

00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:08.830 align:middle line:84%
going to embody it, which
then confirms to me,

00:53:08.830 --> 00:53:10.240 align:middle line:84%
oh, the evil really
is out there.

00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:11.040 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:12.890 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: So then I'm even more
entrenched in that viewpoint,

00:53:12.890 --> 00:53:15.390 align:middle line:84%
and of course, they're
doing the same thing to me.

00:53:15.390 --> 00:53:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, you
know, in the ultimate sense,

00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:22.400 align:middle line:84%
I try to kill the person who
is embodying my own darkness,

00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:24.590 align:middle line:84%
and in doing that, I'm
literally possessed

00:53:24.590 --> 00:53:28.070 align:middle line:84%
by the very evil I'm trying
to destroy, which is madness.

00:53:28.070 --> 00:53:31.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's playing out in
the body politic of the world.

00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:34.640 align:middle line:84%
But the point is that if
we have the recognition

00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:37.080 align:middle line:84%
that the darkness we're
seeing out there in the world,

00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:40.760 align:middle line:84%
the evil we're seeing out there,
that it's actually reflecting

00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:43.550 align:middle line:84%
that darkness in us,
that's the point where

00:53:43.550 --> 00:53:45.550 align:middle line:90%
we can begin to wake up.

00:53:45.550 --> 00:53:46.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I agree.

00:53:46.350 --> 00:53:47.725 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's
something that needs

00:53:47.725 --> 00:53:51.260 align:middle line:84%
to be taught in preschool,
in kindergarten.

00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:54.110 align:middle line:84%
Everything you do,
everything you think

00:53:54.110 --> 00:53:56.250 align:middle line:90%
is going to come back to you.

00:53:56.250 --> 00:53:59.325 align:middle line:84%
So make it beautiful, make
it good, make it happy.

00:53:59.325 --> 00:54:00.125 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Right.

00:54:00.125 --> 00:54:00.925 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:54:00.925 --> 00:54:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And that-- and it
involves that we

00:54:02.660 --> 00:54:07.789 align:middle line:84%
as co-dreamers of this waking
dream have a responsibility.

00:54:07.789 --> 00:54:08.705 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:54:08.705 --> 00:54:10.538 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: You know,
there's no one out there.

00:54:10.538 --> 00:54:12.170 align:middle line:90%
There's no one to blame.

00:54:12.170 --> 00:54:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I think that's
one of the reasons why it's

00:54:16.610 --> 00:54:18.620 align:middle line:84%
such an edge for
people to really to see

00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:20.750 align:middle line:84%
this type of stuff,
because it involves

00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:23.390 align:middle line:84%
them having the realization,
oh my God, if I'm responsible,

00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:27.580 align:middle line:84%
then I've been colluding with
these sort of darker forces.

00:54:27.580 --> 00:54:28.380 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:28.580 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:54:28.580 --> 00:54:30.500 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: And it's so
traumatizing to see that,

00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:32.870 align:middle line:84%
that many people don't have
the courage or the strength

00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:34.950 align:middle line:84%
to actually be able
to go through that.

00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:35.750 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:38.060 align:middle line:84%
And this darkness
you're speaking about

00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:40.430 align:middle line:84%
is so inculcated with,
not only within ourselves,

00:54:40.430 --> 00:54:41.601 align:middle line:90%
but into society and such.

00:54:41.601 --> 00:54:43.100 align:middle line:84%
It's just part of
the fabric of what

00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:45.840 align:middle line:84%
we are as a species
at this point in time.

00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:49.190 align:middle line:84%
Which is why I say, to
me, the greatest hope--

00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:50.680 align:middle line:84%
so it carries
guilt. So we think,

00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:53.651 align:middle line:84%
oh God, now that I know
about quantum physics,

00:54:53.651 --> 00:54:54.650 align:middle line:90%
I can't do this anymore.

00:54:54.650 --> 00:54:56.340 align:middle line:90%
I have to do better than that.

00:54:56.340 --> 00:54:57.860 align:middle line:84%
So you're using
it as a discipline

00:54:57.860 --> 00:55:01.340 align:middle line:84%
to try to draw yourself
into a higher behavior,

00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:05.120 align:middle line:84%
but you still have this
sticky stuff around in you

00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:06.590 align:middle line:90%
and around you.

00:55:06.590 --> 00:55:08.240 align:middle line:84%
Whereas with children,
they don't have

00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:10.590 align:middle line:90%
that same programming just yet.

00:55:10.590 --> 00:55:11.660 align:middle line:90%
They can do it with--

00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:13.696 align:middle line:84%
they can create
with a sense of joy.

00:55:13.696 --> 00:55:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're seeing more
of these little beings that

00:55:16.070 --> 00:55:19.870 align:middle line:84%
inherently came in knowing
this period of time,

00:55:19.870 --> 00:55:21.930 align:middle line:84%
this great understanding
would be coming through

00:55:21.930 --> 00:55:25.560 align:middle line:84%
as our prime reality, and they
can embrace it with more joy

00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:27.559 align:middle line:90%
and infect their families even.

00:55:27.559 --> 00:55:29.850 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: Oh yeah, yeah, and
that's in Tibetan Buddhism.

00:55:29.850 --> 00:55:33.000 align:middle line:84%
To feel that joy, that's
one of the foundations

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.120 align:middle line:90%
of enlightenment, you know?

00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:36.660 align:middle line:90%
And so that's really--

00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:38.770 align:middle line:84%
that's like so
profoundly important,

00:55:38.770 --> 00:55:40.540 align:middle line:90%
and yeah I couldn't agree more.

00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:41.340 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:44.070 align:middle line:84%
And so you make
a differentiation

00:55:44.070 --> 00:55:47.257 align:middle line:84%
between our personal
creation and fantasy, right?

00:55:47.257 --> 00:55:48.340 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:50.707 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So can you talk
about that a little bit?

00:55:50.707 --> 00:55:51.540 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Yeah, sure.

00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:53.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, on the one-- you
know, it's not me--

00:55:53.740 --> 00:55:55.080 align:middle line:90%
it's not just me who does that.

00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:56.996 align:middle line:84%
Like when I think about--
because in the book,

00:55:56.996 --> 00:56:01.080 align:middle line:84%
I'll talk about these ancient
sort of like teachings.

00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:04.530 align:middle line:84%
Like the alchemists,
for example, they'll

00:56:04.530 --> 00:56:06.990 align:middle line:84%
make a distinction between
the false imagination

00:56:06.990 --> 00:56:08.940 align:middle line:90%
and the authentic imagination.

00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And the authentic-- so
the false imagination

00:56:11.130 --> 00:56:13.880 align:middle line:84%
is oh just self soothing
and it's feeding the ego,

00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:16.440 align:middle line:84%
and it's really getting
away from the pain

00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:17.280 align:middle line:90%
that we're feeling.

00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:19.350 align:middle line:90%
That's the false imagination.

00:56:19.350 --> 00:56:21.750 align:middle line:84%
But what the authentic
imagination is,

00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:24.960 align:middle line:84%
that's the part of us that's
interfacing with the higher

00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:28.650 align:middle line:84%
dimension, we could say with
like whether you call it,

00:56:28.650 --> 00:56:30.200 align:middle line:90%
you know, with God or who--

00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:31.620 align:middle line:90%
whatever, whoever.

00:56:31.620 --> 00:56:34.020 align:middle line:84%
And that that's the
part of us that's

00:56:34.020 --> 00:56:39.120 align:middle line:84%
actually co-dreaming this waking
dream into materialization.

00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:41.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's, in essence, what
the whole opus of alchemy

00:56:41.580 --> 00:56:43.890 align:middle line:84%
was about, it was
consciously connecting

00:56:43.890 --> 00:56:47.520 align:middle line:84%
with the real authentic
imagination in a way

00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:51.920 align:middle line:84%
where we can change, not
just one person's life,

00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:53.520 align:middle line:90%
but really, change the world.

00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:56.070 align:middle line:84%
You see, because one way of
understanding quantum physics

00:56:56.070 --> 00:56:59.040 align:middle line:84%
is that it's like,
just like a dream,

00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:02.730 align:middle line:84%
when you have like a one
sidedness and unconsciousness,

00:57:02.730 --> 00:57:05.250 align:middle line:84%
well what does the
unconscious do?

00:57:05.250 --> 00:57:06.060 align:middle line:90%
It compensates.

00:57:06.060 --> 00:57:07.860 align:middle line:84%
If you're in too
much this way, it'll

00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:09.750 align:middle line:84%
send you dreams to get
you more in balance.

00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's like what I was
saying before about quantum

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:13.810 align:middle line:90%
physics, it's a treasure.

00:57:13.810 --> 00:57:17.130 align:middle line:84%
This terma, it's actually
showing us, oh look,

00:57:17.130 --> 00:57:21.300 align:middle line:84%
you've gotten too absorbed
in the materialistic point

00:57:21.300 --> 00:57:26.690 align:middle line:84%
of view, and actually, this
world is imbued with spirit who

00:57:26.690 --> 00:57:27.710 align:middle line:90%
with--

00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:30.960 align:middle line:84%
and that spirit is not separate
from you, from your own mind,

00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:32.220 align:middle line:90%
from consciousness.

00:57:32.220 --> 00:57:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And when you begin
to realize that,

00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:37.380 align:middle line:84%
it's just-- not only
is it really inspiring,

00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:41.070 align:middle line:84%
and it also cultivates
this incredible compassion.

00:57:41.070 --> 00:57:44.070 align:middle line:84%
But it also really
activates, you know,

00:57:44.070 --> 00:57:46.590 align:middle line:84%
our-- that whole impulse
of being creative,

00:57:46.590 --> 00:57:48.820 align:middle line:84%
because we're realizing,
wait a second,

00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:52.680 align:middle line:84%
we are creating our
experience of our world

00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:54.720 align:middle line:84%
and our place in it
moment by moment.

00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:57.390 align:middle line:84%
That's, in essence,
is an encapsulation

00:57:57.390 --> 00:58:00.330 align:middle line:84%
of what quantum physics
is actually teaching us.

00:58:00.330 --> 00:58:05.430 align:middle line:84%
We are actually responsible
for creating our experience

00:58:05.430 --> 00:58:07.490 align:middle line:90%
of the world and of ourselves.

00:58:07.490 --> 00:58:10.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So we just have
to truly make a very simple

00:58:10.050 --> 00:58:11.040 align:middle line:90%
decision.

00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:13.110 align:middle line:90%
How do we want our day to flow?

00:58:13.110 --> 00:58:15.030 align:middle line:84%
How do we want our
reality to flow.

00:58:15.030 --> 00:58:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And then we can consciously
choose our thoughts.

00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:18.623 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to
go down a dark road

00:58:18.623 --> 00:58:20.940 align:middle line:84%
and hold a grudge,
what not, and just say,

00:58:20.940 --> 00:58:24.680 align:middle line:84%
that is not the direction I want
this day, this moment to flow.

00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And we-- till we get used
to it, till we reprogram,

00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:29.020 align:middle line:90%
you make conscious decisions.

00:58:29.020 --> 00:58:29.820 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Right.

00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And what you were just
saying, it's so right on,

00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:35.220 align:middle line:84%
but I have the thought, oh yeah,
but that's not just like a one

00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:36.710 align:middle line:90%
time decision, that's what--

00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:37.140 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's every moment.

00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:38.370 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: --you know, I
do spiritual practice,

00:58:38.370 --> 00:58:40.620 align:middle line:84%
like many of us do, and
it's like every moment,

00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:43.830 align:middle line:84%
you have to get in the habit
of really cultivating that new

00:58:43.830 --> 00:58:47.130 align:middle line:84%
habit pattern of instead
of just oh falling.

00:58:47.130 --> 00:58:50.505 align:middle line:84%
Because it's so seductive to
fall into a negative point

00:58:50.505 --> 00:58:52.350 align:middle line:84%
of view, and we can
draw all the evidence

00:58:52.350 --> 00:58:53.490 align:middle line:90%
to confirm our viewpoint.

00:58:53.490 --> 00:58:54.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's sticky.

00:58:54.130 --> 00:58:54.730 align:middle line:90%
It's heavy.

00:58:54.730 --> 00:58:55.290 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:58:55.290 --> 00:58:55.545 align:middle line:90%
Totally.

00:58:55.545 --> 00:58:55.800 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's visceral.

00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:56.760 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Exactly.

00:58:56.760 --> 00:59:01.410 align:middle line:84%
But the idea that we actually
more cultivate, you know,

00:59:01.410 --> 00:59:06.000 align:middle line:84%
that ability and the
courage to really just know,

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually the
one who's creating

00:59:08.070 --> 00:59:10.800 align:middle line:84%
how I interpret
what meaning I place

00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:12.640 align:middle line:84%
on the inkblot of
the waking dream.

00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:14.220 align:middle line:84%
There's no one else
who's doing that.

00:59:14.220 --> 00:59:15.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing that.

00:59:15.060 --> 00:59:16.260 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's right.

00:59:16.260 --> 00:59:19.350 align:middle line:84%
And so in your book you
say it's your greatest

00:59:19.350 --> 00:59:24.030 align:middle line:84%
desire to experience en
masse, and I'm sure privately,

00:59:24.030 --> 00:59:25.800 align:middle line:90%
this union of opposites.

00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:27.840 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:31.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: When you had your
breakthrough experience,

00:59:31.020 --> 00:59:34.470 align:middle line:84%
is it fair to say you
were suffering in a place

00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:37.065 align:middle line:90%
of opposites, of isolation?

00:59:37.065 --> 00:59:38.220 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Oh, totally.

00:59:38.220 --> 00:59:38.600 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I was--

00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:38.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Of aloneness.

00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:39.870 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: I was--

00:59:39.870 --> 00:59:42.286 align:middle line:84%
they were saying-- you know,
without going into the story,

00:59:42.286 --> 00:59:44.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my father
was a very sick man

00:59:44.190 --> 00:59:46.890 align:middle line:84%
from the emotional point of
view and I was the only child,

00:59:46.890 --> 00:59:49.830 align:middle line:84%
and he acted out his abuse,
like any parent does, you know,

00:59:49.830 --> 00:59:51.090 align:middle line:90%
unconscious abuse.

00:59:51.090 --> 00:59:54.030 align:middle line:84%
You just pass it on
to the next of kin.

00:59:54.030 --> 00:59:56.860 align:middle line:84%
And I was just, like every
kid, just very sensitive,

00:59:56.860 --> 01:00:00.150 align:middle line:84%
and so it created this
enormous wound and suffering.

01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:03.000 align:middle line:84%
And one could say, yeah,
I was very split off

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.480 align:middle line:84%
from a certain part,
because when there's trauma,

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:08.650 align:middle line:84%
by definition, you know,
you can't integrate it.

01:00:08.650 --> 01:00:09.450 align:middle line:90%
So what do you do?

01:00:09.450 --> 01:00:10.870 align:middle line:90%
You disassociate, you split.

01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:11.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:14.253 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: And it was because the
suffering was so intense and I

01:00:14.253 --> 01:00:17.430 align:middle line:84%
couldn't even go about my life,
it was stopping me from living

01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:19.370 align:middle line:84%
my life, it was
that overwhelming,

01:00:19.370 --> 01:00:23.100 align:middle line:84%
that was what was the
inspiration for me to do

01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:26.280 align:middle line:84%
the Vippasana, for me to do
the meditation hours and hours

01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:29.070 align:middle line:84%
and hours, probably four hours
a day for close to two years,

01:00:29.070 --> 01:00:31.890 align:middle line:84%
till that lightning
bolt happened, you know?

01:00:31.890 --> 01:00:34.440 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so quantum
physics turns out to be

01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:38.760 align:middle line:84%
the pathway to, not only your
wholeness and coming together

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:42.150 align:middle line:84%
and uniting those
oppositions within,

01:00:42.150 --> 01:00:46.530 align:middle line:84%
to on a global scale assisting
others to understand life

01:00:46.530 --> 01:00:47.760 align:middle line:90%
through this lens.

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:48.060 align:middle line:90%
>> PAUL: Yeah.

01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:49.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, the thing about
quantum physics,

01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:51.810 align:middle line:84%
one way of understanding it
is that it's bringing together

01:00:51.810 --> 01:00:52.740 align:middle line:90%
the opposites.

01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:55.350 align:middle line:84%
On the one hand, here is like
the physical world and here is

01:00:55.350 --> 01:00:57.540 align:middle line:84%
spirit, and quantum
physics is saying,

01:00:57.540 --> 01:00:59.670 align:middle line:90%
the two are not separate.

01:00:59.670 --> 01:01:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And the idea, just the archetype
of a healer who has a wound,

01:01:02.730 --> 01:01:06.330 align:middle line:84%
yeah I like kind of embody
that in that I was so wounded.

01:01:06.330 --> 01:01:08.670 align:middle line:84%
And I'm still processing
and going through my wound,

01:01:08.670 --> 01:01:10.680 align:middle line:84%
but I'm not caught by it
in the way that I was,

01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:12.720 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not identifying with it.

01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:15.750 align:middle line:84%
And the archetype of the
healer who is wounded

01:01:15.750 --> 01:01:17.880 align:middle line:84%
is that it's by going
through the wound

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:19.560 align:middle line:84%
and consciously
experiencing that pain

01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:22.410 align:middle line:84%
instead of trying to avoid
it that you get your gift.

01:01:22.410 --> 01:01:25.800 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it's perfect that here
I am now for a number of years,

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:27.780 align:middle line:84%
and with this
quantum physics book,

01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:31.175 align:middle line:84%
in a position to really,
hopefully, help people.

01:01:31.175 --> 01:01:33.300 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, I think
I've done a beautiful job.

01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:35.646 align:middle line:84%
You've laid out a really good
case there for everybody,

01:01:35.646 --> 01:01:37.020 align:middle line:84%
and I thank you
for your efforts.

01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:38.860 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL: Well, I can't
thank you enough.

01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:40.549 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, really.

01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:42.840 align:middle line:10%
