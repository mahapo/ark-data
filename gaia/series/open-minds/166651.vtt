00:00:27.817 --> 00:00:30.150 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Like many
people I've had on my show,

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.270 align:middle line:10%
John St. Augustine's story
started with losing it all.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And even after he thought
he had lost it all,

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.350 align:middle line:90%
a time came to give more--

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.090 align:middle line:90%
his kidney to his daughter.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.770 align:middle line:90%
This is a story of redemption.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And he and many others
have brought themselves

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.690 align:middle line:84%
back into wholeness
after feeling broken.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.970 align:middle line:84%
We're going to hear that
story and how it's played out

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.370 align:middle line:84%
for you, and as an
inspirational speaker how

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.800 align:middle line:84%
you infect others with,
I think, a story of hope

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.270 align:middle line:90%
on a lot of levels.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.590 align:middle line:10%
>>JOHN ST. AUGUSTINE:
Well, I think

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.360 align:middle line:10%
that the most important
part of our lives

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.226 align:middle line:10%
is the everyday stuff.

00:00:59.226 --> 00:01:00.600 align:middle line:10%
And it's great to
go to seminars,

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.060 align:middle line:10%
and I've written books, and
that's wonderful to read that.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.720 align:middle line:84%
But that should push us all
to practical applications

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.520 align:middle line:90%
in our lives.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.210 align:middle line:84%
So in many ways, I'm the
most least likely person

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.010 align:middle line:90%
to be doing this.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.610 align:middle line:84%
My best grades in school,
they were lunch and gym.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:14.410 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:15.960 align:middle line:10%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: And I
really was pretty much

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.501 align:middle line:10%
of a knuckle dragger
most of my life.

00:01:17.501 --> 00:01:21.180 align:middle line:84%
And until I found myself in
a position at the age of 37

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.594 align:middle line:90%
where I had a college degree.

00:01:22.594 --> 00:01:23.760 align:middle line:90%
I knew all the right people.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.426 align:middle line:84%
I played golf with
all the right people.

00:01:25.426 --> 00:01:26.525 align:middle line:90%
I did everything correct.

00:01:26.525 --> 00:01:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And I still ended up living
in a motel in upper Michigan.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.170 align:middle line:90%
And it didn't line up for me.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about when
you showed all this potential,

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.840 align:middle line:84%
when you had all the
advantages available to you.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.120 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the story of
how you ended up going really

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.000 align:middle line:84%
onto a darker path for
a while, a path that

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.740 align:middle line:90%
was disempowered at the least.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: You mean when
I was like a bouncer in a bar

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.300 align:middle line:84%
and bending people
over fire hydrants?

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is the part of
the story that we came for.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:54.070 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Yes.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.321 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I want to hear
about just how low it can go.

00:01:56.321 --> 00:01:58.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Yeah, you
know, growing up in Chicago

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:59.860 align:middle line:90%
has its own set of energies.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:00.660 align:middle line:90%
I believe that.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And growing up as young men
there, and going to high school

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.230 align:middle line:84%
and all like that, you know,
I started falling into what

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.150 align:middle line:90%
I thought it meant to be a man.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.370 align:middle line:84%
And that was usually beer,
fighting, beer, fighting,

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.170 align:middle line:90%
and beer.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, wait a minute,
I didn't hear football.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.500 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Well,
that comes in later.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.500 align:middle line:90%
That was when I was ten.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.010 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no, I'm kidding.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.000 align:middle line:84%
But I played high school
football, college football,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.960 align:middle line:90%
semi-pro football.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And all of those things
fed the beasties in me.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And I had not learned
how to turn those yet.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.400 align:middle line:90%
They were just being fed.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.687 align:middle line:84%
And the more you feed
that, the bigger it gets--

00:02:31.687 --> 00:02:32.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE:
--with everything.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:33.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's satisfying.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:34.280 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: It is.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.460 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.210 align:middle line:84%
And it was the only way I
could legally hurt people.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:37.220 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.178 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Right?

00:02:38.178 --> 00:02:41.320 align:middle line:84%
So at one time in my life,
I had played high school,

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.120 align:middle line:90%
like I said.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And I thought the Chicago
Bears were going to take me.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.230 align:middle line:84%
And I hurt my knee in the
last play of my last game

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.940 align:middle line:90%
as a senior.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.340 align:middle line:84%
This AstroTurf stuff
they thought was so great

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.790 align:middle line:90%
wasn't so great.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And all my college offers
went out the window.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.700 align:middle line:90%
So there's the first curveball.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.890 align:middle line:84%
The second curveball
came not much longer

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.350 align:middle line:84%
after that I got a
partial scholarship

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.480 align:middle line:84%
at Northeastern
Illinois University

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.980 align:middle line:90%
where they used to have sports.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.105 align:middle line:84%
And they don't have any
more, which is interesting.

00:03:07.105 --> 00:03:08.940 align:middle line:84%
But I got a partial
scholarship there.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.050 align:middle line:84%
And in order to
fulfill my scholarship,

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.850 align:middle line:90%
I also had to work.

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:12.510 align:middle line:90%
What a concept.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:13.350 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.550 align:middle line:90%
That's not what I planned.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.770 align:middle line:84%
I planned to go to Kansas
and get a free ride.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.830 align:middle line:84%
And so this is how
it's going to go.

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.350 align:middle line:84%
Not often do expectation
and reality lineup.

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.430 align:middle line:84%
19 years old, I get electrocuted
at an Osco drugstore

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.060 align:middle line:90%
in Chicago.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.940 align:middle line:84%
There's still some of
those in the Midwest.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.910 align:middle line:90%
And it was January 28, 1979.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.470 align:middle line:84%
And this machine I was
working on malfunctioned.

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:36.270 align:middle line:90%
I was gone.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.290 align:middle line:90%
I was done.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.998 align:middle line:84%
And the only reason
I was able to survive

00:03:38.998 --> 00:03:41.970 align:middle line:84%
that was my size
and the pharmacist

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.890 align:middle line:84%
happened to stay
late that night.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.300 align:middle line:90%
He never stays late.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.470 align:middle line:90%
Mike never stayed late.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.410 align:middle line:84%
Mike was the first
guy out the door.

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.520 align:middle line:84%
But he'd been a medic in Vietnam
10 years earlier in 1969.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.400 align:middle line:90%
And he saved my life.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.290 align:middle line:84%
I woke up with him getting
my heart started again.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.370 align:middle line:84%
So that was a curveball, but
not enough to me to listen.

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:00.170 align:middle line:90%
So

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.910 align:middle line:90%
So, so far spirit is speaking.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:03.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE:
I'm not listening.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.618 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Blew your knee out.

00:04:04.618 --> 00:04:06.240 align:middle line:84%
You're not playing
football, honey.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And then the second one is
it's not your time to die.

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:09.290 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Right.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:10.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: But
I'm still not listening.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:11.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.150 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: I'm 19.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.555 align:middle line:90%
I'm bulletproof.

00:04:12.555 --> 00:04:13.080 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.976 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: So for about
six weeks I kind of thought,

00:04:15.976 --> 00:04:18.089 align:middle line:84%
this is interesting,
but nah, so what.

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:22.380 align:middle line:84%
And I got enough money out
of the settlement from Osco

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.612 align:middle line:90%
to buy a car.

00:04:23.612 --> 00:04:24.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, wheels.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:25.434 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: It's worth it.

00:04:25.434 --> 00:04:26.298 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What more
does a 19-year old need?

00:04:26.298 --> 00:04:27.839 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE:
Yeah, I almost died.

00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:29.500 align:middle line:90%
Who cares.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.675 align:middle line:90%
And then I could not write.

00:04:30.675 --> 00:04:32.550 align:middle line:84%
So I had already played
high school football.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.940 align:middle line:90%
That didn't work out.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:33.740 align:middle line:90%
I got electrocuted.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.200 align:middle line:90%
Could not write for a year.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What do you
mean you couldn't write?

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Well, my hand
was just so burned and mangled

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.555 align:middle line:90%
that I literally couldn't--

00:04:39.555 --> 00:04:41.190 align:middle line:84%
I remember the
plastic surgeon saying

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.330 align:middle line:84%
do you want straight
fingers or do you

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.496 align:middle line:90%
want to be able to use them?

00:04:43.496 --> 00:04:46.407 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, can I put
a beer can in there?

00:04:46.407 --> 00:04:47.490 align:middle line:90%
If I could put a beer can.

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Practical.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:50.040 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: 19.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And so they took skin from the
different folds of my body.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And they were able to make
my hand work pretty good.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.160 align:middle line:90%
And so I couldn't write.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.480 align:middle line:84%
So football's done
at that point.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.280 align:middle line:90%
Can't write.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.029 align:middle line:84%
And so I went back to
working construction

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:06.420 align:middle line:90%
because that's what you do.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Blue collar
job was out at the time.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Absolutely.

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:10.570 align:middle line:90%
Because no dexterity.

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.170 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: I
mean, that was it.

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:14.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, excuse
me, a white-collar job.

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.580 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: White collar.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:15.540 align:middle line:90%
Uh huh.

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:16.110 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: OK.

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.352 align:middle line:84%
There was no white collar
in my future at that point.

00:05:18.352 --> 00:05:19.310 align:middle line:90%
Certainly, not writing.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.392 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, not reading
and doing those things.

00:05:23.392 --> 00:05:25.350 align:middle line:84%
And I got a phone call
one night from a guy who

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:26.474 align:middle line:90%
I had gone to college with.

00:05:26.474 --> 00:05:28.474 align:middle line:84%
We called him the
senator for some reason.

00:05:28.474 --> 00:05:29.890 align:middle line:84%
And he had joined
the Coast Guard.

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.709 align:middle line:84%
And he called me at midnight
from Kodiak, Alaska.

00:05:32.709 --> 00:05:34.250 align:middle line:84%
And he said, hey,
what are you doing?

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.155 align:middle line:84%
Like he knew I hadn't talked
to this guy in two years.

00:05:37.155 --> 00:05:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And like he knew I wasn't doing
anything except drinking beer

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.270 align:middle line:90%
and working and whatever.

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you know,
you ready now to join?

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:45.310 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, oh sure, makes sense.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:47.730 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.064 align:middle line:84%
Next day, down at the recruiter,
they looked at me, sure

00:05:50.064 --> 00:05:50.863 align:middle line:90%
you're in.

00:05:50.863 --> 00:05:51.970 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.130 align:middle line:84%
And eight weeks later,
I went off to boot camp.

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.160 align:middle line:84%
And all those things-- the
football, the boot camp,

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.640 align:middle line:90%
that hard knuckled stuff--

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.210 align:middle line:84%
that fed me to the n-th degree
because that's how I grew up.

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And I just carried
along with that.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And I spent four years in
the Coast Guard in aviation.

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.133 align:middle line:84%
I was one of the people
that helped people get out

00:06:15.133 --> 00:06:16.930 align:middle line:90%
of the water with helicopters.

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:18.060 align:middle line:90%
And I loved it.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.930 align:middle line:90%
And I came out of that.

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:21.555 align:middle line:90%
And now what?

00:06:21.555 --> 00:06:21.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, how old
are you by this point?

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.030 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: I'm only 26.

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:23.315 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 26.

00:06:23.315 --> 00:06:23.870 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE:
Yeah, I mean, come on.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.930 align:middle line:84%
In just between the
time I left high school

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.870 align:middle line:84%
and now, it's already
been pretty full.

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And I started looking
back on things.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:32.670 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:34.419 align:middle line:84%
I started to see a
little bit of a connect

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:38.460 align:middle line:84%
the dots when I was coherent
enough to understand them.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.410 align:middle line:84%
And I would see, well,
this led to this.

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:42.326 align:middle line:84%
And because I didn't do
this, this meant this.

00:06:42.326 --> 00:06:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And this guy called
me, and here's this.

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:46.830 align:middle line:84%
But again, I'm still pretty
rudimentary at the time

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.690 align:middle line:90%
and not really understanding it.

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.690 align:middle line:90%
And I got married in 1986.

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:54.450 align:middle line:10%
Two weeks after we were
married, we went out

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:56.520 align:middle line:10%
to get our wedding pictures.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.560 align:middle line:10%
And I worked in the
village at the time

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.912 align:middle line:10%
where the photographer was.

00:07:01.912 --> 00:07:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And we get hit by a drunk
driver, 75 miles an hour

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:08.300 align:middle line:90%
on my left side.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And I was driving a 1983
Pontiac Firebird, small car.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And this guy was
driving a Cadillac.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.980 align:middle line:90%
And it just obliterated the car.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And this was my second
you're not listening call.

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:21.900 align:middle line:90%
Covered up.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.030 align:middle line:90%
Cut me out of the car.

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:24.800 align:middle line:90%
No pulse, no nothing.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.962 align:middle line:84%
The guys that I worked
with, the firemen and such

00:07:27.962 --> 00:07:30.170 align:middle line:84%
that I worked with during
the day and all these guys,

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:33.252 align:middle line:84%
I played softball with, they
were surrounding the car.

00:07:33.252 --> 00:07:34.460 align:middle line:90%
And they knew I was in there.

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:35.501 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't get me out.

00:07:35.501 --> 00:07:36.251 align:middle line:90%


00:07:36.251 --> 00:07:38.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was your
wife in there with you?

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:38.240 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Yeah.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.020 align:middle line:90%
She was able to get out.

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:39.810 align:middle line:90%
The door flew open.

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:40.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, good.

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:40.750 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: She
was able to get out.

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:41.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So she got free.

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:42.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: She got free.

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:43.730 align:middle line:90%
The car was t-boned.

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:47.370 align:middle line:84%
I was bent and you know, I
didn't do yoga at the time.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:50.870 align:middle line:84%
So they were forcing me
into some yoga positions.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:53.699 align:middle line:84%
And I had this
out-of-body experience

00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:54.740 align:middle line:90%
that I could not explain.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:55.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was just
going to ask you that.

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:56.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.416 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE:
Didn't understand

00:07:57.416 --> 00:07:59.900 align:middle line:84%
what it was called
at the time, except I

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:03.760 align:middle line:84%
had this overwhelming
sense of everything.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And I could almost feel the
emotions of these guys that

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:07.380 align:middle line:90%
are trying so hard.

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And I felt worse for
them than I did for me.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.190 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.920 align:middle line:10%
I even had empathy for
the guy that was driving.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.980 align:middle line:10%
And I could almost
like see everything.

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:18.440 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to explain.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.850 align:middle line:90%
I didn't physically see it.

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:22.330 align:middle line:90%
But I felt it like a movie.

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.580 align:middle line:84%
I could smell the gasoline
on the hot concrete.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.547 align:middle line:84%
Actually, a woman-- I'll
never forget her name,

00:08:26.547 --> 00:08:28.130 align:middle line:84%
Cassie White-- was
a nurse, came over.

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:29.800 align:middle line:90%
She just happened to be there.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.637 align:middle line:90%
And she came over.

00:08:30.637 --> 00:08:32.470 align:middle line:84%
And my hand had gone
through the windshield.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.878 align:middle line:84%
And she stopped the
bleeding on the main artery.

00:08:34.878 --> 00:08:36.919 align:middle line:84%
And she whispered, I think
you're going to be OK.

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:38.830 align:middle line:84%
But if you're not,
I'll pray for you.

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:39.630 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:40.360 align:middle line:90%
Well, thanks.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:40.900 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:41.480 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for that.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, when you're
out of your body, what

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.430 align:middle line:84%
did you see about the
driver of the other car?

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And what happened
to that person?

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:47.746 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Yeah.

00:08:47.746 --> 00:08:50.080 align:middle line:84%
So what I saw this--
it was so strange.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.480 align:middle line:84%
And no one's ever asked
me that, so thank you.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:57.040 align:middle line:84%
I saw like a kid,
like a child driving.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.180 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a kid, obviously.

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And later on, what would come to
be is this guy's had five DUIs.

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:06.200 align:middle line:84%
He owned a string of dry
cleaners outside of Chicago.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.572 align:middle line:84%
And this is the fifth
time this has happened.

00:09:08.572 --> 00:09:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And they've let
them off each time.

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:12.512 align:middle line:84%
And I kept thinking,
that pushed me

00:09:12.512 --> 00:09:13.720 align:middle line:90%
into a whole other direction.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.910 align:middle line:84%
But at that time, I
saw there was this kid.

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't understand
what that meant.

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:21.420 align:middle line:84%
I got home that
night out of that.

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.396 align:middle line:84%
Amazingly, when they
got the car open

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:25.270 align:middle line:84%
and opened it up, and
got me out, I stood up.

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:26.561 align:middle line:90%
I said, I'm going to walk home.

00:09:26.561 --> 00:09:29.124 align:middle line:84%
It's 30 miles, but I'm
going to walk home.

00:09:29.124 --> 00:09:30.290 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't let me walk.

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:30.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:31.810 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: They
put me in the hospital.

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:33.018 align:middle line:90%
But I did go home that night.

00:09:33.018 --> 00:09:34.934 align:middle line:84%
And I was shocked
that physically,

00:09:34.934 --> 00:09:36.850 align:middle line:84%
because I was a really
good shape at the time,

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:39.490 align:middle line:90%
I was not hurt worse.

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I
think I'm supposed

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.310 align:middle line:90%
to listen to something.

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:44.860 align:middle line:10%
And I'm not hearing it.

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:47.920 align:middle line:84%
So in the space of just
a decade all this stuff

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:52.250 align:middle line:84%
has happened-- electrocuted,
helicopters, car accidents,

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:53.800 align:middle line:90%
knees blown out.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:54.680 align:middle line:90%
What's going on here?

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:55.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.680 align:middle line:10%
Finish up what you saw.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.060 align:middle line:10%
You saw a kid, that
other guy as a kid.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:58.976 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Yeah.

00:09:58.976 --> 00:10:02.830 align:middle line:84%
So six weeks later, eight
weeks later, we go to court.

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:04.330 align:middle line:10%
His lawyer called
two days later.

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:05.685 align:middle line:10%
He left the scene.

00:10:05.685 --> 00:10:07.060 align:middle line:10%
His lawyer called
two days later.

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:08.065 align:middle line:10%
Well, he'll be at court.

00:10:08.065 --> 00:10:09.940 align:middle line:10%
And that's when they
find out all this stuff,

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:11.440 align:middle line:10%
he'd done this before.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.540 align:middle line:10%
When I got to the
courtroom, it's hot.

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:14.380 align:middle line:10%
I don't wear ties.

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.180 align:middle line:10%
I wore a tie.

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:16.930 align:middle line:10%
It was not my element.

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:19.010 align:middle line:10%
And the state's attorney
came up and said,

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:22.090 align:middle line:10%
all you need for him to
do is admit he was wrong.

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:22.980 align:middle line:10%
And you can sue him.

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:25.120 align:middle line:10%
We need admission
of guilt. It was

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.770 align:middle line:10%
the last case on the docket.

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:28.450 align:middle line:90%
It's 90 degrees in there.

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:29.950 align:middle line:84%
The guy walks in
with his attorney.

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:30.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm sitting there.

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:31.634 align:middle line:90%
He's standing there.

00:10:31.634 --> 00:10:32.800 align:middle line:90%
And he says, I plead guilty.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And the judge says $25
fine, end of the day.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: $25 fine?

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.287 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE:
Running a red light.

00:10:40.287 --> 00:10:41.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How does that compute?

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:42.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Well,
that was my point.

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:43.740 align:middle line:90%
Wait, wait.

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:44.760 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.860 align:middle line:84%
So the state-- well, you got him
admitting he ran a red light.

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:48.570 align:middle line:84%
Now you can go after
him civilly and sue.

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:49.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: That's it?

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:52.020 align:middle line:90%
That's it?

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:53.280 align:middle line:90%
That's it?

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: After five incidences?

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.174 align:middle line:84%
No, I see, could you get
back out of your body

00:10:58.174 --> 00:11:00.090 align:middle line:84%
and look at what the
judge was thinking there?

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:00.420 align:middle line:90%
I mean.

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:02.253 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Yeah,
he wanted to go home.

00:11:02.253 --> 00:11:03.470 align:middle line:90%
He didn't care.

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And what happened
that night was one

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:11.550 align:middle line:84%
of the most powerful, scary,
difficult, challenging things

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:14.160 align:middle line:84%
that ever happened in my
short time on the planet.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.320 align:middle line:84%
I got home that night
and everything that

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.330 align:middle line:84%
had been happening
for years had been

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:21.960 align:middle line:90%
locked down or bolted back.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.420 align:middle line:10%
And it all came up.

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:26.850 align:middle line:90%
It was like Mount Vesuvius.

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:29.130 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what PTSD was.

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:32.400 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
panic attacks were.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And you know, my
wife at the time

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:36.980 align:middle line:84%
had to call the cops
because she thought

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:38.310 align:middle line:90%
was going to hurt somebody.

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:39.600 align:middle line:90%
They hauled me off.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:40.560 align:middle line:90%
Put me in handcuffs.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.300 align:middle line:10%
They think I'm whacked out.

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:46.160 align:middle line:10%
And all this is pushing on what
already shouldn't be pushed on.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:47.910 align:middle line:84%
I ended up in a place
called Sheridan Road

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:50.837 align:middle line:84%
Hospital in Chicago, which
at the time was, I mean,

00:11:50.837 --> 00:11:52.670 align:middle line:84%
it's like "One Flew
Over the Cuckoo's Nest".

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:53.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:54.310 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: How
did I end up here?

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:54.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:55.480 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: I have a job.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.850 align:middle line:90%
My name's over my shirt pocket.

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:58.380 align:middle line:90%
I have a job.

00:11:58.380 --> 00:11:59.650 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And you lost it.

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:00.490 align:middle line:10%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: I totally lost.

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:00.990 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: The injustice
of that event--

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:01.980 align:middle line:10%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE:
Totally lost it.

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:02.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --was the final straw.

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:04.288 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: It
was the pinprick that

00:12:04.288 --> 00:12:07.690 align:middle line:84%
opened up the Hindenburg
of "are you kidding me?"

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:10.602 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
walking into a room,

00:12:10.602 --> 00:12:11.810 align:middle line:90%
and there was a guy in there.

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:13.030 align:middle line:84%
This is your roommate
for the night.

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:14.550 align:middle line:84%
It was midnight by the
time I got in there.

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:15.841 align:middle line:90%
Totally on my knees on the bed.

00:12:15.841 --> 00:12:17.520 align:middle line:84%
Just I don't even
know what's going on.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:18.760 align:middle line:90%
I can't control it.

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:21.000 align:middle line:84%
It was like the old TV
show with Lou Ferrigno,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.770 align:middle line:84%
"The Hulk," all of a sudden this
energy would just take over me.

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:26.079 align:middle line:90%
And I never hurt anybody.

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And I got to this
room with this guy.

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:28.200 align:middle line:90%
And he looked totally normal.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, well, this will be OK.

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:32.910 align:middle line:84%
Until he started talking to
the chair like it was a dog.

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:35.070 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, oh boy.

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:35.961 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Where am I?

00:12:35.961 --> 00:12:37.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: What
do you want from me?

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:39.147 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:39.147 --> 00:12:40.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: What
am I not listening to?

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:42.510 align:middle line:84%
Next day they put
me in a big room.

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And they figured out
I don't belong there.

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:46.920 align:middle line:90%
They come take me out.

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.500 align:middle line:84%
The only funny part of this
was these two huge guys

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.170 align:middle line:84%
are taking me up in an elevator
to go talk to the docs.

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And the guy says to me, he
goes, do you hear voices?

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:57.030 align:middle line:90%
And I wanted to say, oh, yeah.

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.830 align:middle line:90%
Don't you?

00:12:57.830 --> 00:12:59.788 align:middle line:84%
I know I'd never get out
of there if I said it.

00:12:59.788 --> 00:13:00.662 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:13:00.662 --> 00:13:03.120 align:middle line:84%
But come to find out I started
learning about the mind body

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:03.920 align:middle line:90%
connection.

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:07.740 align:middle line:84%
And before that, didn't
even exist to me.

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:10.770 align:middle line:84%
And the guy's like, here's all
the things that have happened.

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And here's what you
didn't take care of.

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.080 align:middle line:90%
And here's how it comes out.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:13.950 align:middle line:90%
Simple.

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:14.970 align:middle line:90%
Take these Xanax.

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:16.650 align:middle line:90%
You'll feel better.

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:17.910 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:19.050 align:middle line:90%
Can I take it with beer?

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:21.690 align:middle line:90%
You know, what's the deal here?

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And I learned shortly that
was not going to help me.

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:26.231 align:middle line:90%
That was just going to defer.

00:13:26.231 --> 00:13:27.480 align:middle line:90%
And I got to get to the cause.

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.990 align:middle line:90%
This was the effects.

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And so I started, at the time,
it was a really rough time.

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:37.980 align:middle line:84%
For a year my wife and
I slept with the lights

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:39.585 align:middle line:90%
on in the living room.

00:13:39.585 --> 00:13:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And every night had
to pull out the bed

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:44.640 align:middle line:84%
and put it in the living room
and watch "Back to the Future".

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.590 align:middle line:84%
I had to watch the
same thing over.

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:48.330 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you
why with that movie.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:51.460 align:middle line:90%
And it had to have this rhythm.

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And I started to be
able to work my way

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:55.800 align:middle line:84%
through these energetic
cycles is what I call them.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.620 align:middle line:84%
And I was working overnight
at a hotel, security.

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:00.260 align:middle line:84%
So I was up all
night, which was good.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.262 align:middle line:90%
I was walking.

00:14:02.262 --> 00:14:03.720 align:middle line:84%
But when it would
come on me, I was

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.820 align:middle line:84%
able to start visualizing
things in my head.

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:09.000 align:middle line:84%
Like I would take the weight bar
that we use on the bench press,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.400 align:middle line:90%
and I would bend it in my head.

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.200 align:middle line:90%
And then unbend it.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And then bend it mentally
until the feeling left.

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:20.130 align:middle line:84%
So I started to learn there's
a lot I don't know about me

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:21.090 align:middle line:90%
and what's going on.

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:22.650 align:middle line:90%
And what else is there.

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:24.780 align:middle line:84%
So that kind of
set me on a course.

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:28.054 align:middle line:84%
And then, I'll never forget
this, I was working overnight,

00:14:28.054 --> 00:14:29.970 align:middle line:84%
and there was some big
bar fight at the hotel.

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:30.690 align:middle line:90%
Broke everything up.

00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:31.490 align:middle line:90%
Came back.

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:33.930 align:middle line:84%
And a book fell out
of this guy's pocket.

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:36.920 align:middle line:84%
Why this guy would have
this book is beyond me.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:38.570 align:middle line:84%
It's called "The
Road Less Traveled".

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:39.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was he
in the bar-fight?

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:40.751 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: He
was in the fight.

00:14:40.751 --> 00:14:42.810 align:middle line:90%
I threw him out of the bar.

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And this book falls
out of his pocket,

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:47.400 align:middle line:84%
"The Road Less Traveled"
by M. Scott Peck.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.080 align:middle line:10%
I think I'm supposed
to read this.

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.584 align:middle line:10%
And as you probably
well know, it

00:14:50.584 --> 00:14:53.250 align:middle line:10%
started to dig in more of how we
are and all that kind of stuff.

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:55.580 align:middle line:90%
So more connect the dots for me.

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And there is there's a chapter
in my second book called

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.510 align:middle line:90%
"No More Mr. Bad Guy."

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:02.940 align:middle line:84%
When I worked at a bar, when
I was on the football field,

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:05.130 align:middle line:84%
in other places I
inflicted pain on people

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:06.640 align:middle line:90%
because I was in pain.

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:09.420 align:middle line:84%
I didn't understand why,
nor did I question it.

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:10.310 align:middle line:90%
It just am.

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:12.660 align:middle line:84%
I never looked at what
the sources of that were.

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:13.885 align:middle line:90%
And so I was totally valid.

00:15:13.885 --> 00:15:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And when I read this book and
started doing other things,

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.170 align:middle line:84%
I started thinking maybe
there's something I'm missing.

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:21.060 align:middle line:84%
And I sort of learned
how important questions

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:23.460 align:middle line:90%
were to ourselves.

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:24.900 align:middle line:84%
And that really,
in so many ways,

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:26.858 align:middle line:84%
started the ball rolling
with all that follows.

00:15:26.858 --> 00:15:29.790 align:middle line:84%
And then some amazing
things happened after that.

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:31.050 align:middle line:90%
Events took place.

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:31.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, the firewalker.

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:32.650 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Yeah.

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:32.822 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:15:32.822 --> 00:15:35.850 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about-- get yourself
up to that part of the story

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:38.244 align:middle line:84%
with the mystic giving
you the message.

00:15:38.244 --> 00:15:39.160 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Yeah.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.634 align:middle line:84%
So after all that
happened, I was

00:15:42.634 --> 00:15:44.550 align:middle line:84%
pretty convinced I needed
to go back to school

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:46.530 align:middle line:90%
and finish my college degree.

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:47.930 align:middle line:84%
And being a veteran,
it was free.

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:48.550 align:middle line:90%
So it was great.

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:49.350 align:middle line:90%
And I went back.

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:50.820 align:middle line:84%
And I was convinced,
even then, I'm

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:52.860 align:middle line:84%
going to be a football
coach and play football

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:54.000 align:middle line:90%
and be a gym teacher.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:54.900 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:56.010 align:middle line:90%
That's the extent of it.

00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:57.495 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't even close.

00:15:57.495 --> 00:16:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And when I went back to school,
it got more and more difficult.

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.040 align:middle line:84%
Kids were coming into our lives
and all that kind of stuff

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.840 align:middle line:84%
so I had to take
alternative courses.

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:05.400 align:middle line:90%
And I finally got my degree.

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:08.220 align:middle line:84%
I think the first year
I went there was 1977.

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:11.010 align:middle line:84%
I was out of there by '79
with an "Animal House"

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:14.610 align:middle line:84%
grade point average of nothing
because of beer and football

00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:15.712 align:middle line:90%
and getting hurt.

00:16:15.712 --> 00:16:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And when I went back, I
didn't finish till '92.

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:18.780 align:middle line:90%
I started like in '88.

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:19.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:21.028 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: So
I was able to finish.

00:16:21.028 --> 00:16:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And I had a sense of pride about
that that was unfamiliar to me.

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:27.750 align:middle line:84%
I had accomplished something
that didn't involve

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:29.287 align:middle line:90%
knocking somebody's teeth out.

00:16:29.287 --> 00:16:30.382 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:30.382 --> 00:16:31.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: That's good.

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:32.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:34.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think that that
self-validation, nothing

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:38.850 align:middle line:84%
can replace that feeling of
our own understanding of we

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:40.196 align:middle line:90%
showed up for ourselves.

00:16:40.196 --> 00:16:41.070 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Yes.

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:42.480 align:middle line:90%
And I think it's in disguise.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:45.097 align:middle line:84%
For most of my life,
it's been in disguise.

00:16:45.097 --> 00:16:46.680 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was
this but, I lifted up

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:48.450 align:middle line:84%
the curtain, and
voila, there is this.

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:51.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, really,
that was in there?

00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:52.750 align:middle line:90%
Just as a point.

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:55.490 align:middle line:84%
I was at the dentist
recently, and I

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:58.410 align:middle line:84%
had left a copy of my
second book with the dentist

00:16:58.410 --> 00:16:59.430 align:middle line:90%
because she's great.

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And I signed it to
her and everything.

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:01.993 align:middle line:84%
And thanks for no
pain because no pain

00:17:01.993 --> 00:17:03.450 align:middle line:90%
isn't always gain or something.

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And she says you don't
look like a writer.

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.710 align:middle line:90%
You don't sound like a writer.

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:08.950 align:middle line:90%
And you fooled me.

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:09.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:11.880 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: And
I think I realized it

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:15.300 align:middle line:90%
works for me because of that.

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:16.440 align:middle line:90%
Those are tools.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.599 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So in a way you
kind of fooled yourself.

00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:19.473 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Yes.

00:17:19.473 --> 00:17:21.569 align:middle line:84%
It was like that was
all put in place for me

00:17:21.569 --> 00:17:23.819 align:middle line:90%
to be able to pull it off later.

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:27.000 align:middle line:84%
It's a never ending
wake-up call.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.540 align:middle line:84%
So anyway we went
through all that.

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:31.380 align:middle line:84%
And again, things
started changing.

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:33.690 align:middle line:90%
And then in 1990--

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:38.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm guessing it was
like 1994, 1995,

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:39.590 align:middle line:84%
I was giving a talk
at Northeastern,

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:41.390 align:middle line:90%
where I had graduated from.

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And these people
walked into the room.

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out they
were in the wrong room.

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:50.520 align:middle line:84%
They thought I was in talk about
like the Geological Survey of I

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:51.320 align:middle line:90%
don't know what.

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:52.120 align:middle line:90%
And I wasn't.

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:54.354 align:middle line:84%
I was talking about
sports stuff at the time.

00:17:54.354 --> 00:17:55.520 align:middle line:90%
And they come up afterwards.

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:58.490 align:middle line:84%
And they asked if I would speak
at their son's commencement

00:17:58.490 --> 00:17:59.430 align:middle line:90%
address.

00:17:59.430 --> 00:17:59.930 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:00.570 align:middle line:90%
Where is it?

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:01.610 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's in upper Michigan.

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:02.410 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:03.390 align:middle line:90%
Where is that?

00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:04.190 align:middle line:90%
Near Canada.

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:05.140 align:middle line:90%
Oh, OK.

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:05.940 align:middle line:90%
It's north.

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:06.860 align:middle line:90%
OK, I can do that.

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:08.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you
were compelling whatever

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:08.450 align:middle line:90%
the subject.

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:09.080 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE:
Yeah, whatever it was.

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:09.990 align:middle line:84%
I thought well sure
I could do that you.

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:10.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
good storyteller.

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:10.340 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:11.965 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE:
Yeah, whatever it was.

00:18:11.965 --> 00:18:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And a few months later, maybe
six, eight months later,

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:17.150 align:middle line:84%
we started driving up
north and eventually--

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:22.170 align:middle line:84%
I'd never been past Milwaukee
or Appleton, Wisconsin--

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:23.240 align:middle line:90%
get up there.

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And get into the rooms
at 9:00 and 10:00

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:28.240 align:middle line:84%
at the Hillcrest
Motel on US highway 2.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.360 align:middle line:90%
Where's Andy and Barney?

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.580 align:middle line:84%
Because there's
nothing going on here.

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:32.780 align:middle line:90%
I go back to the school.

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:33.320 align:middle line:90%
I'll never forget this.

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:34.250 align:middle line:90%
I go back to school.

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And there's a janitor
cleaning the floor

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:39.350 align:middle line:84%
in the auditorium or the gym,
pulling out the bleachers.

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:41.930 align:middle line:84%
And I said I need to find the
supervisor because I'm here

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:42.730 align:middle line:90%
to speak with.

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:44.237 align:middle line:84%
He goes, well, I'm
the supervisor.

00:18:44.237 --> 00:18:45.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And the janitor.

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:47.695 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Yeah, not
where I come from, you're not.

00:18:47.695 --> 00:18:48.550 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:49.430 align:middle line:90%
It was turning again.

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:50.305 align:middle line:90%
It was turning again.

00:18:50.305 --> 00:18:52.096 align:middle line:84%
So all these things
were being shown to me,

00:18:52.096 --> 00:18:55.679 align:middle line:84%
and I was able to see them this
time without the wake-up call

00:18:55.679 --> 00:18:56.720 align:middle line:90%
that I'd had in the past.

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.660 align:middle line:84%
So they held up the
talk for a track

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:02.060 align:middle line:84%
meet because one of the
kids wasn't there yet.

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:05.070 align:middle line:84%
500 people came to
watch 27 kids graduate.

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:05.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Not
where I come from.

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:07.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, no.

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:07.770 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Right?

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:08.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:09.830 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Turns again.

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:11.219 align:middle line:90%
And I went back to Chicago.

00:19:11.219 --> 00:19:13.010 align:middle line:84%
I was in a business
deal with a couple of--

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:13.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: By this
time, you're probably

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:15.600 align:middle line:84%
thinking two dozen people
are going to show up.

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:16.460 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:17.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: I don't
even know why I drove here.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:19.040 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: I'm
not getting paid for it.

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:19.840 align:middle line:90%
Somebody asked me.

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:20.820 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:21.620 align:middle line:90%
It was fascinating.

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, I
was asked to go to dinner.

00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:23.840 align:middle line:90%
And you want to go fishing.

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:24.673 align:middle line:90%
And it was all nice.

00:19:24.673 --> 00:19:27.350 align:middle line:84%
But I went back to Chicago,
was in the middle of a business

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:28.800 align:middle line:84%
deal with a couple
of pro-athletes

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:30.380 align:middle line:90%
that I had met at the time.

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And something told me
this is not a good thing.

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:36.230 align:middle line:90%
In the past, I'd ignored it.

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:38.700 align:middle line:90%
I'd have just blown it off.

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:39.510 align:middle line:90%
Kept it to myself.

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:42.130 align:middle line:84%
Two weeks later, we go back for
a wedding to upper Michigan.

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:43.130 align:middle line:90%
We had met some friends.

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:44.100 align:middle line:90%
Go back to a wedding.

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.330 align:middle line:84%
We're floating down
the Whitefish River.

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:47.220 align:middle line:84%
We stop off to the side,
do a little fishing.

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:48.720 align:middle line:84%
Guy walks out, hey,
you want a beer?

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:49.770 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:51.630 align:middle line:90%
Start talking to the guy.

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:53.250 align:middle line:90%
Go into his garage.

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:55.294 align:middle line:84%
And he's got all these
hats in the garage.

00:19:55.294 --> 00:19:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And the company we were
involved with or going

00:19:57.210 --> 00:19:59.964 align:middle line:84%
to be involved with was 3M
in Minnesota, big company.

00:19:59.964 --> 00:20:01.380 align:middle line:84%
And I asked the
guy about the hat.

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:02.130 align:middle line:90%
What's with the hat?

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:04.220 align:middle line:84%
And he says, oh, I used to do
a lot of printing for them.

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:04.890 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:05.820 align:middle line:90%
Let me give you a scenario.

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:07.569 align:middle line:84%
And I laid out this
business scenario that

00:20:07.569 --> 00:20:08.940 align:middle line:90%
was giving me so much trouble.

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:11.260 align:middle line:84%
And all he said was, do you have
a lot of lawyers on your team?

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:11.670 align:middle line:90%
I said, no.

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:13.410 align:middle line:84%
He goes, well, you're
going to need them

00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:15.750 align:middle line:90%
if you continue doing this.

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:17.280 align:middle line:90%
Are you going to listen, John?

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.190 align:middle line:90%
I listened.

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:18.990 align:middle line:90%
Pulled out.

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:20.400 align:middle line:90%
Lost everything I put in.

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:25.050 align:middle line:84%
And the domino effect from that
at the time I thought was I

00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:26.880 align:middle line:90%
could not survive it.

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.730 align:middle line:84%
I had a big townhouse on the
Northwest side of the city.

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:31.890 align:middle line:84%
Walter Payton was dropping
me off in a limousine.

00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:34.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm going golfing with
all the right people.

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:36.894 align:middle line:84%
And now, I can't get
a phone call returned.

00:20:36.894 --> 00:20:38.560 align:middle line:84%
John doesn't have
what it takes anymore.

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.860 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't have the
killer instinct.

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And for a guy who spent
his life having that,

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:47.720 align:middle line:84%
that was difficult. And it
was almost like the universe--

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:50.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What did
that do to your family?

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:51.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, did it shred
your whole life?

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:52.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Well,
my kids were little

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.630 align:middle line:84%
so they didn't really
know much about it.

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:55.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But your wife had been
through a lot with you already.

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:56.460 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Already.

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:57.260 align:middle line:90%
And at the time.

00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And so back then it was
very, very difficult.

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And yet, there started to
be, especially these people

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.900 align:middle line:84%
in upper Michigan,
Native American folks,

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:10.080 align:middle line:84%
very tied into things
I am not tied into.

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:12.490 align:middle line:84%
So their words were
very encouraging

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:16.720 align:middle line:84%
like you need to
kind of listen more.

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:17.520 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:21.000 align:middle line:84%
So while it was difficult, and
I mean everybody in our family

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.880 align:middle line:84%
thought we're nuts, I
couldn't pay the rent anymore

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.170 align:middle line:90%
on this house even.

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:26.890 align:middle line:90%
Every door closed.

00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:27.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:28.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: The
hallway got smaller

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.100 align:middle line:90%
and narrower and narrower.

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:31.890 align:middle line:84%
And I remember calling this
fellow Bruce Hardwick who

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:33.181 align:middle line:90%
is still my friend to this day.

00:21:33.181 --> 00:21:36.240 align:middle line:84%
Muktatha is his name, his
Native American Ojibwa name.

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And he said, why don't
you come live up here?

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:41.430 align:middle line:90%
Where we stayed in the motel.

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:44.940 align:middle line:84%
I said, what the hell
would I do up there?

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And he said, what the hell are
you going to do down there?

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:49.540 align:middle line:90%
Couldn't argue with it.

00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:52.260 align:middle line:84%
A couple of days later, he
pulls up with a horse trailer.

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:53.610 align:middle line:90%
And a couple other trucks.

00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:55.859 align:middle line:84%
And everything we own with
these people we barely knew

00:21:55.859 --> 00:21:57.150 align:middle line:90%
went in his horse trailer.

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:58.777 align:middle line:90%
And we headed north.

00:21:58.777 --> 00:21:59.860 align:middle line:90%
Put everything in storage.

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:01.693 align:middle line:84%
Moved back in the same
two rooms where I was

00:22:01.693 --> 00:22:03.960 align:middle line:90%
Mr. Successful a year earlier.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:05.220 align:middle line:90%
And didn't know what happened.

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:09.390 align:middle line:84%
But the most prominent thing
through all this period that--

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:12.360 align:middle line:84%
and you know, I really got
to just say this right here--

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:14.702 align:middle line:84%
I recount this
story often, but not

00:22:14.702 --> 00:22:16.410 align:middle line:84%
as much as I used to
because it's getting

00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:17.800 align:middle line:90%
further and further away.

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:20.910 align:middle line:84%
But sitting with you today,
I'm like reliving it at levels

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:23.270 align:middle line:90%
that are needed for me today.

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:24.420 align:middle line:90%
So I appreciate that.

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:26.700 align:middle line:84%
You're asking me questions
that aren't normally asked,

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:28.991 align:middle line:84%
and then I get to dredge that
up and feel a little bit.

00:22:28.991 --> 00:22:30.201 align:middle line:90%
My kids are 29 and 27.

00:22:30.201 --> 00:22:31.200 align:middle line:90%
And they're doing great.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:34.500 align:middle line:84%
But back then the priorities
were very different

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.730 align:middle line:90%
as a young father.

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:38.580 align:middle line:84%
But through that
whole time I would

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:40.890 align:middle line:90%
have this recurring dream.

00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:42.570 align:middle line:90%
And it wouldn't leave me alone.

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:45.180 align:middle line:84%
And it would be right before I
woke up every other day or so.

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:46.596 align:middle line:84%
And I would see
myself on the side

00:22:46.596 --> 00:22:49.309 align:middle line:84%
of the road with a
backpack on, with a beard,

00:22:49.309 --> 00:22:51.600 align:middle line:84%
with the sun on my left and
a stick in my hand walking.

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:52.980 align:middle line:90%
And then I'd wake up.

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And it was the same thing
over and over and over again.

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:58.830 align:middle line:84%
So we move all the
way to Michigan.

00:22:58.830 --> 00:22:59.700 align:middle line:90%
I go to this man.

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:01.380 align:middle line:90%
I said, how can I thank you?

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:03.780 align:middle line:84%
He's like, you'll
know when it's time.

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:04.620 align:middle line:90%
Who talks like that?

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:05.536 align:middle line:90%
Not where I come from.

00:23:05.536 --> 00:23:06.340 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And maybe two weeks after moved
there I had that dream again.

00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:11.315 align:middle line:90%
And I went to him.

00:23:11.315 --> 00:23:14.610 align:middle line:90%
And he starts crying.

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:16.100 align:middle line:84%
We walked back of
his place, he's

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:18.190 align:middle line:84%
got this huge lodge
on his property.

00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:19.650 align:middle line:90%
And he takes my hand.

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:22.380 align:middle line:84%
This little guy is about 5'9"
with a flowing white hair.

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And just as wide as
he is tall and just

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:26.220 align:middle line:90%
a wonderful human being.

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And he says you've
been given a choice.

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:30.120 align:middle line:90%
Most people aren't.

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:31.870 align:middle line:84%
Actually, they are,
but they don't listen.

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:34.230 align:middle line:90%
You're starting to listen.

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:36.140 align:middle line:84%
You're having what
we call a vision.

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:37.105 align:middle line:90%
Not where I come from.

00:23:37.105 --> 00:23:38.562 align:middle line:90%
We don't have those.

00:23:38.562 --> 00:23:40.395 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Only if You've
had too many beers.

00:23:40.395 --> 00:23:40.690 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Right.

00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:42.939 align:middle line:84%
Then you start seeing things
that aren't really there.

00:23:42.939 --> 00:23:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you've
been given a choice.

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.270 align:middle line:84%
You can go back
the way you came.

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:47.890 align:middle line:90%
And I'll never forget his words.

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:50.050 align:middle line:84%
You can see what the
mystery has for you.

00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:52.049 align:middle line:90%
Like this is door number two.

00:23:52.049 --> 00:23:53.590 align:middle line:84%
So I already know
door number one is.

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:55.450 align:middle line:90%
I came from there.

00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And Regina, as soon as I said
that, I'll take door number

00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:03.171 align:middle line:90%
two, everything shifted.

00:24:03.171 --> 00:24:04.420 align:middle line:90%
Must have been the same night.

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:06.680 align:middle line:84%
He strikes the big
fire in his lodge.

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And all these people show
up that I barely know.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:11.147 align:middle line:84%
One guy, Duane Kinard,
he helped move.

00:24:11.147 --> 00:24:12.730 align:middle line:84%
He's got white hair
down the back too.

00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:15.430 align:middle line:84%
And I get up and
I say I think I'm

00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:21.520 align:middle line:84%
supposed to walk from here
to Chicago where I just left.

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.102 align:middle line:90%
Makes no sense.

00:24:23.102 --> 00:24:25.060 align:middle line:84%
And Duane stands up and
he says, yeah, it does.

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:25.520 align:middle line:90%
I'll go with you.

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:26.603 align:middle line:90%
I've been waiting for you.

00:24:26.603 --> 00:24:29.170 align:middle line:90%


00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:33.520 align:middle line:84%
So in short form, so
much came together.

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:36.430 align:middle line:84%
All I saw was my piece of
the puzzle, this little blink

00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:37.600 align:middle line:90%
I was getting of this dream.

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.130 align:middle line:90%
And I acted on it.

00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:40.380 align:middle line:90%
But he had a piece.

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:44.060 align:middle line:84%
And a week later Joe Johnson,
20 years old, he hears about it.

00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:44.860 align:middle line:90%
Lives in Detroit.

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:46.818 align:middle line:84%
The people-- Bruce and
Pat-- who own the motel,

00:24:46.818 --> 00:24:49.570 align:middle line:90%
it's her brother's wife's son.

00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:50.560 align:middle line:90%
I got to go with him.

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:52.420 align:middle line:90%
I've never met him in my life.

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:54.870 align:middle line:90%
He comes up.

00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:57.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, I got to
ask you at this point, now

00:24:57.130 --> 00:24:58.380 align:middle line:84%
what's your wife
thinking at this point?

00:24:58.380 --> 00:24:59.463 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: I'm nuts.

00:24:59.463 --> 00:25:01.064 align:middle line:90%
You know, and I don't blame her.

00:25:01.064 --> 00:25:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And matter of fact, we're
not married anymore.

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:04.605 align:middle line:84%
We haven't seen each
other for a while.

00:25:04.605 --> 00:25:06.670 align:middle line:84%
But back then, I know for
a fact her parents were

00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:07.330 align:middle line:90%
like just leave.

00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:08.650 align:middle line:90%
We'll take you back to Chicago.

00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:09.370 align:middle line:90%
Let him figure it out.

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:10.290 align:middle line:90%
We'll take you and the kids.

00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:11.080 align:middle line:90%
And I wouldn't have blamed her.

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:11.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:12.090 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:13.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: But
there was something

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:16.660 align:middle line:84%
she knew about was going on,
that even though she didn't

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:18.552 align:middle line:84%
get it, she knew
she was safe there.

00:25:18.552 --> 00:25:19.510 align:middle line:90%
These were good people.

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:21.200 align:middle line:90%
The kids were in school.

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.000 align:middle line:90%
They're OK.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.166 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So she stayed put.

00:25:23.166 --> 00:25:27.124 align:middle line:84%
And you've assembled,
unconsciously--

00:25:27.124 --> 00:25:28.415 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Unconsciously.

00:25:28.415 --> 00:25:30.745 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --assembled
this little group of men.

00:25:30.745 --> 00:25:31.000 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:31.300 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Yeah.

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:31.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:32.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How many
were there finally?

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:33.670 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Well,
just the three of us.

00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:34.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The three of us.

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:34.450 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:35.530 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: My
father-in-law at the time,

00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:37.000 align:middle line:90%
he drove part of the way.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.702 align:middle line:10%
And he went just to make sure
I didn't bug out I'm sure.

00:25:39.702 --> 00:25:40.910 align:middle line:10%
But he got so much out of it.

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:45.070 align:middle line:10%
So the first day we went
from this lodge 19 miles

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:46.170 align:middle line:10%
to Escanaba, Michigan.

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:47.860 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't get out
of bed the next day.

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:48.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm not training for this.

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:48.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:51.880 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: And you can't
walk straight on the highways.

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:53.020 align:middle line:90%
They'll arrest you.

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:57.935 align:middle line:84%
So it's about 450 miles to
Chicago zigzagging ahead of us.

00:25:57.935 --> 00:26:00.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You had to go on
little country lanes and just?

00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:01.375 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE:
Yeah, back roads.

00:26:01.375 --> 00:26:01.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, back roads.

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:03.941 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: You can't
walk on the main drag.

00:26:03.941 --> 00:26:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And the people we met and
the things that we saw, oh,

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:10.210 align:middle line:90%
just astonishing to me.

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And to this day, Duane always
says the walk never ended.

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:16.900 align:middle line:90%
Never ended, John.

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:18.789 align:middle line:84%
So we get all the
way to Chicago.

00:26:18.789 --> 00:26:20.830 align:middle line:84%
We could spend five hours
just on that walk part.

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:22.246 align:middle line:84%
But we get all the
way to Chicago.

00:26:22.246 --> 00:26:23.330 align:middle line:90%
All the families come.

00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:24.130 align:middle line:90%
Ta-da!

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:24.520 align:middle line:90%
We did it.

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:25.180 align:middle line:90%
This is a great thing.

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:27.760 align:middle line:84%
There was a fire in the lodge
up there that they had struck.

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And there was a fire in
Chicago at Northeastern

00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:33.910 align:middle line:84%
where I was at school
10 years earlier.

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:35.500 align:middle line:90%
Hello, Johnny.

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.090 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And then it comes to me
that I have to walk back.

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:43.150 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see that
on the way down.

00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:44.410 align:middle line:90%
And so Joe leaves.

00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:45.310 align:middle line:90%
And Duane leaves.

00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:47.410 align:middle line:90%
And I started back alone.

00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:49.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the
shit hit the fan

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:52.570 align:middle line:84%
because that's when the first
time in my life by myself

00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:58.240 align:middle line:84%
really without the accouterments
that I had grown up with that

00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.650 align:middle line:90%
defined me.

00:26:59.650 --> 00:27:00.760 align:middle line:90%
And I was just walking.

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:02.200 align:middle line:90%
I had a rudimentary cell phone.

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:04.200 align:middle line:84%
Every three days somebody
knew where I would be.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.320 align:middle line:90%
And they'd check on me.

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:06.790 align:middle line:84%
On the way down,
it was a big deal.

00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:09.880 align:middle line:84%
Newspapers, television,
reporters, free hotels,

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:10.680 align:middle line:90%
free food.

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:11.290 align:middle line:90%
It was a big deal.

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:12.370 align:middle line:90%
On the way back, nothing.

00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:12.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Nothing.

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:13.330 align:middle line:90%
You're on your own.

00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:14.830 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE:
You're on your own.

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:15.910 align:middle line:90%
Here's this.

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:16.930 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's this.

00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:18.100 align:middle line:90%
Are you willing to do both?

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:19.870 align:middle line:90%
Can't have this without this.

00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:21.640 align:middle line:90%
So I started walking back.

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:26.140 align:middle line:90%
And I got to the top of--

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:28.360 align:middle line:84%
oh, it was state
park in Wisconsin.

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:30.010 align:middle line:90%
And I hit the top.

00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:34.460 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought I am not
the guy I used to be anymore.

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:36.300 align:middle line:90%
It's like peeling layers back.

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:38.010 align:middle line:90%
And how far down you want to go.

00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:40.136 align:middle line:84%
And I literally got to
Kettle Moraine State Park.

00:27:40.136 --> 00:27:41.010 align:middle line:90%
And I got to the top.

00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:42.450 align:middle line:90%
And I dumped this bag out.

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:44.250 align:middle line:90%
This was a huge lesson for me.

00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:47.220 align:middle line:84%
I was carrying this
65-pound pack on my back.

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think I've
opened it four times.

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:50.850 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know
what was in it.

00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:52.710 align:middle line:90%
You might need this someday.

00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:54.120 align:middle line:90%
I dump it all out.

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And about 3/4 of it,
it was well-meaning,

00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:59.100 align:middle line:84%
given to me well-meaning,
you may need this.

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:01.101 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, how many cans
of Spam can you carry?

00:28:01.101 --> 00:28:01.900 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:02.950 align:middle line:90%
And why would you?

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:05.940 align:middle line:90%
But anyway, I dumped it all out.

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:08.490 align:middle line:84%
And I had the realization
that my whole life

00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:11.790 align:middle line:84%
I had been carrying a pack that
other people had packed for me.

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:14.960 align:middle line:90%
And it was revolutionary.

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.250 align:middle line:90%
And it was heavy.

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:17.050 align:middle line:90%
It was heavy.

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:18.040 align:middle line:90%
It's other people's stuff.

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:18.820 align:middle line:90%
It isn't my stuff.

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:19.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:19.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:21.021 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE:
And we drag it along

00:28:21.021 --> 00:28:24.660 align:middle line:84%
and it gets heavier and heavier
and heavier through life.

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:26.930 align:middle line:10%
And so it's kind of
almost like that chain

00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:29.380 align:middle line:10%
in "The Christmas Carol".

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:31.690 align:middle line:10%
You forge that chain
and you drag it.

00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:33.114 align:middle line:10%
And so this bag was on me.

00:28:33.114 --> 00:28:34.280 align:middle line:90%
And I dumped everything out.

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And I decided for the
first time in my life

00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:37.660 align:middle line:90%
what I was going to carry.

00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:38.260 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:38.980 align:middle line:90%
Nobody else.

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:40.550 align:middle line:84%
You're not allowed
to put stuff in here.

00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:41.591 align:middle line:90%
You carry your own stuff.

00:28:41.591 --> 00:28:43.210 align:middle line:90%
Just keep it away from me.

00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:45.190 align:middle line:90%
So dumped it all out.

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:46.630 align:middle line:90%
Whatever it was I put back in.

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:47.980 align:middle line:90%
And I burned stuff.

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:49.120 align:middle line:90%
I just had a little dance.

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:50.050 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:50.470 align:middle line:90%
And I left.

00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:51.595 align:middle line:90%
And I started walking down.

00:28:51.595 --> 00:28:54.482 align:middle line:84%
And you can imagine
just that weight lifted,

00:28:54.482 --> 00:28:55.440 align:middle line:90%
metaphorically as well.

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:56.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:58.750 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: And
but the big ah-ha

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:02.200 align:middle line:84%
came outside of
Oconomowoc, Wisconsin,

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:04.860 align:middle line:84%
the bustling
metropolis Oconomowoc.

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:08.500 align:middle line:84%
Came around the lake
and stopped in my tracks

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:11.890 align:middle line:84%
because I was standing
in the same dream

00:29:11.890 --> 00:29:15.340 align:middle line:84%
that I had seen every other
day for almost a year.

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:19.390 align:middle line:84%
Side of the road, backpack
on, beard, sun's on my left.

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:21.700 align:middle line:90%
How could that be?

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:23.100 align:middle line:90%
Every circuit I had blew up.

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:24.726 align:middle line:90%
Whatever is left.

00:29:24.726 --> 00:29:26.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in Chicago,
we don't even

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:27.850 align:middle line:90%
put ketchup on our hot dogs.

00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:29.620 align:middle line:90%
So you're asking a lot here.

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:31.160 align:middle line:90%
You're asking me to what?

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:33.070 align:middle line:90%
How could this be?

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And it was the clearest
moment of my life.

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:42.424 align:middle line:84%
I was weightless, effortless,
clear, translucent,

00:29:42.424 --> 00:29:43.840 align:middle line:84%
you can call it
anything you want.

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And I was like a
part of everything

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:47.790 align:middle line:90%
without being anything.

00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:49.064 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot for me.

00:29:49.064 --> 00:29:50.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
a lot for anyone.

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:50.860 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Sure it is.

00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:52.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you had
the courage to do it.

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:53.450 align:middle line:90%
You did finally listen.

00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:53.775 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: I did.

00:29:53.775 --> 00:29:54.100 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:54.900 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And that voice said, clear as
a bell, John, go on the radio.

00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:01.020 align:middle line:90%
What was that?

00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:01.952 align:middle line:90%
Go on the radio.

00:30:01.952 --> 00:30:03.660 align:middle line:84%
I had never been on
the radio in my life.

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:05.950 align:middle line:90%
Didn't care.

00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:08.680 align:middle line:84%
A wind finally came, moved
me a few feet forward,

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:09.620 align:middle line:90%
and all that left me.

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:09.770 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:10.600 align:middle line:90%
I got heavy again.

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:12.017 align:middle line:90%
Get back at it.

00:30:12.017 --> 00:30:13.600 align:middle line:84%
And I got down to
the end of the road.

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:15.225 align:middle line:84%
And this friend of
mine was watching me

00:30:15.225 --> 00:30:17.140 align:middle line:90%
or she waited for me, Molly.

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:19.634 align:middle line:84%
She was a ranger at the
Horicon Wildlife Refuge.

00:30:19.634 --> 00:30:21.550 align:middle line:84%
These are all vivid
details coming back to me.

00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:22.937 align:middle line:90%
So it's astonishing.

00:30:22.937 --> 00:30:23.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:24.687 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for sharing.

00:30:24.687 --> 00:30:27.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: It's like I'm
seeing the movie again, which I

00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:28.715 align:middle line:90%
haven't watched in a long time.

00:30:28.715 --> 00:30:29.590 align:middle line:90%
And I got in her car.

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And there was a guy named Barry
Farber was on the radio, talk

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:33.050 align:middle line:90%
show host out of New York.

00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:35.720 align:middle line:84%
And I said Molly, Molly, I'm
going to do what this guy does.

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:37.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to talk
about our lives.

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:40.420 align:middle line:84%
37, college degree,
motel, politics and sports

00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:41.586 align:middle line:90%
aren't going to save me.

00:30:41.586 --> 00:30:42.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:44.145 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: And
she said, you just

00:30:44.145 --> 00:30:47.050 align:middle line:84%
need to shot a Wild
turkey and a hot shower.

00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:48.135 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:48.135 --> 00:30:49.870 align:middle line:90%
Did all that.

00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:50.750 align:middle line:90%
Finished the walk.

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:51.550 align:middle line:90%
Jumped way ahead.

00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:55.339 align:middle line:84%
Finished the walk a day
before Thanksgiving in '96.

00:30:55.339 --> 00:30:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And my friend Bruce came
to get me for the last--

00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:02.260 align:middle line:84%
boy, oh boy-- he came
to get me on the road.

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:03.895 align:middle line:90%
This big guy, he come to get me.

00:31:03.895 --> 00:31:05.270 align:middle line:84%
He said, I helped
you start this.

00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:06.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to help you finish it.

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:07.350 align:middle line:90%
Couldn't walk.

00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:08.440 align:middle line:90%
He was too heavy to walk.

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:10.090 align:middle line:90%
But he got in his car.

00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:11.710 align:middle line:90%
And he followed me.

00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:14.280 align:middle line:84%
It gets dark at 3:00
in the afternoon.

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:16.960 align:middle line:84%
He followed behind me,
turned his headlights on so I

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:18.280 align:middle line:90%
could see where to walk.

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And when I would
stop, he would stop.

00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:21.430 align:middle line:90%
He kept that pace.

00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:23.560 align:middle line:90%
And that thought came again.

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:25.060 align:middle line:90%
When I stop, the light stops.

00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:27.100 align:middle line:90%
You got to keep moving.

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:28.410 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:29.370 align:middle line:90%
Finished the walk.

00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:32.920 align:middle line:84%
Collapsed, slept for a
week, thought it would all

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:33.720 align:middle line:90%
change immediately.

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:34.930 align:middle line:90%
It didn't.

00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:37.037 align:middle line:84%
And in April of '97,
I woke up one day

00:31:37.037 --> 00:31:38.620 align:middle line:84%
and started calling
radio stations out

00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:41.050 align:middle line:90%
of a phone book in my underwear.

00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And I said here's why
I want to talk about.

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:45.011 align:middle line:84%
I don't care about
sports anymore.

00:31:45.011 --> 00:31:46.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't care about
politics anymore.

00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:47.440 align:middle line:90%
It's doing nothing.

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:48.730 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing there.

00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:50.064 align:middle line:90%
We need to talk about our lives.

00:31:50.064 --> 00:31:51.730 align:middle line:84%
We need to talk about
what are you going

00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:52.940 align:middle line:90%
to do at the end of the day.

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:55.190 align:middle line:84%
You we're going to talk about
I've never seen Democrat

00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:56.440 align:middle line:90%
or Republican on a headstone.

00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:58.750 align:middle line:84%
What are you going
to do in between?

00:31:58.750 --> 00:31:59.729 align:middle line:90%
You're nuts.

00:31:59.729 --> 00:32:01.020 align:middle line:90%
No one will ever listen to you.

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:02.590 align:middle line:90%
27 radio stations.

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:04.270 align:middle line:84%
Got to the last one
in the phone book,

00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:08.170 align:middle line:84%
and the woman had read about me
in a newspaper when I walked,

00:32:08.170 --> 00:32:09.540 align:middle line:90%
Ella Sabucco.

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And she said, oh, you're
that nut job that walked.

00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:13.870 align:middle line:90%
But we'll give you a shot.

00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:15.970 align:middle line:84%
Long and short of it
was I got five hours

00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:18.270 align:middle line:84%
to do a show, an hour
a week for five weeks.

00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:20.700 align:middle line:84%
And I somehow skated
through it all.

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:21.814 align:middle line:90%
Got five more, five more.

00:32:21.814 --> 00:32:23.980 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the year, I
thought I was Paul Harvey.

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:25.188 align:middle line:90%
I was doing two hours a week.

00:32:25.188 --> 00:32:26.660 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea what I was doing.

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:29.450 align:middle line:84%
At 9:00 AM on a
5,000-watt CBS affiliate.

00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:33.040 align:middle line:84%
And the long and short of
it was it went from there.

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:35.250 align:middle line:84%
All these things
started happening.

00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:36.830 align:middle line:90%
All I did was kept showing up.

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:37.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:39.275 align:middle line:84%
You were being
your authentic self

00:32:39.275 --> 00:32:41.460 align:middle line:84%
and listening to your
own higher spirit.

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:42.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Is
that what that's called?

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You were
being authentic.

00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:44.720 align:middle line:90%
You were listening to yourself.

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.136 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE:
Most of my life I

00:32:46.136 --> 00:32:48.170 align:middle line:84%
was being inauthentic
with this other part.

00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:50.510 align:middle line:90%
And once that clicked in.

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:52.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How many stations
did you end up with?

00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:53.634 align:middle line:90%
What was the reach finally?

00:32:53.634 --> 00:32:57.084 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Oh, so at one
point, Charter Communications,

00:32:57.084 --> 00:32:59.500 align:middle line:84%
which wasn't even a company
hardly then comes in, and they

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:00.510 align:middle line:90%
said--

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:02.662 align:middle line:84%
that started in '97
was my first show--

00:33:02.662 --> 00:33:04.120 align:middle line:84%
two years later
they came and said,

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:06.160 align:middle line:84%
we're going to put a
camera in your studio

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:07.510 align:middle line:84%
because we think people
would like to watch.

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:09.468 align:middle line:84%
I thought, who the heck's
going to watch people

00:33:09.468 --> 00:33:10.430 align:middle line:90%
on radio on television?

00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:11.230 align:middle line:90%
You know this.

00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:12.790 align:middle line:90%
We have similar backgrounds.

00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:14.140 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere now.

00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:16.630 align:middle line:84%
But that one move
put me in 80 markets.

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And then things got
bigger and bigger.

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:21.217 align:middle line:10%
And I know we're going to
of the kidney thing, which

00:33:21.217 --> 00:33:23.800 align:middle line:10%
I took a break from, but by the
time it was all said and done,

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:27.460 align:middle line:10%
I ended up designing Oprah's
radio channel for Sirius XM,

00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:29.560 align:middle line:10%
doing the Oprah thing
for four years back

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:30.820 align:middle line:10%
and forth to Chicago.

00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:33.280 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Oz's senior producer,
Jean Chatzky, Bob Green,

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:34.390 align:middle line:90%
Nate Berkus.

00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:37.230 align:middle line:84%
And I would sit-in
these meetings going,

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:40.420 align:middle line:84%
you know, I already know
all this because I'm

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:41.770 align:middle line:90%
being authentic, as you say.

00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:42.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:43.840 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: I
know how to do this.

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.030 align:middle line:90%
I can build all this.

00:33:45.030 --> 00:33:47.530 align:middle line:84%
I didn't need master's degrees,
all this kind of stuff.

00:33:47.530 --> 00:33:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And so it went from starting
an hour on a Wednesday morning

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.310 align:middle line:90%
to the Oprah thing, my own show.

00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:56.790 align:middle line:84%
I had 3.5 million
listeners on Saturdays.

00:33:56.790 --> 00:33:58.990 align:middle line:84%
Then I left that, went
to WGN in Chicago.

00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:01.120 align:middle line:90%
Talked to the whole Midwest.

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:02.900 align:middle line:90%
And have gone on from there.

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And I've never been in radio
in my life, but here you go.

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:11.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I mean,
it's a remarkable story.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's one I think that
brings tears to people's eyes.

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:13.739 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE:
Definitely mine.

00:34:13.739 --> 00:34:16.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because they can
see pieces of themselves

00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:17.810 align:middle line:84%
where they've
abandoned themselves,

00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:18.960 align:middle line:90%
where they didn't listen.

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:19.360 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Yes.

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:20.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You know?

00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And then, again, this
whole redemptive part.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:22.360 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Yes.

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:24.068 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so now
it comes to the part

00:34:24.068 --> 00:34:25.370 align:middle line:90%
when your daughter's in need.

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:27.170 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: You're
going to get me on this one.

00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:27.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm sure.

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:28.941 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Oh, boy.

00:34:28.941 --> 00:34:31.459 align:middle line:90%


00:34:31.459 --> 00:34:32.500 align:middle line:90%
Her birthday's coming up.

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:33.300 align:middle line:90%
She'll be 29.

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:36.010 align:middle line:84%
She was born in
September of '88.

00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:39.261 align:middle line:84%
And when she was born, she
had a very long clinical name

00:34:39.261 --> 00:34:40.719 align:middle line:84%
of something I
can't even remember.

00:34:40.719 --> 00:34:42.469 align:middle line:90%
Basically, it's kidney reflux.

00:34:42.469 --> 00:34:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And when she would urinate, it
would go out and come back in

00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:46.550 align:middle line:90%
and sit in her kidney.

00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:47.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:49.120 align:middle line:84%
It's just a constant
toxic back and forth.

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:52.170 align:middle line:90%
And we had no idea.

00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:53.510 align:middle line:90%
It was fairly common.

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:54.730 align:middle line:90%
And kids grow out of it.

00:34:54.730 --> 00:34:55.000 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.150 align:middle line:90%
So we'll wait and see.

00:34:56.150 --> 00:34:59.260 align:middle line:84%
So in the meantime, high
fevers and vomiting.

00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:00.710 align:middle line:90%
And she's just a baby.

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:01.750 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:03.340 align:middle line:90%
And we go through all this.

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:06.940 align:middle line:84%
And right before
her fifth birthday

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:10.540 align:middle line:84%
they figure out that it's
not going to reverse itself.

00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:11.840 align:middle line:90%
I could have told you that.

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:13.450 align:middle line:90%
But we played the game.

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:15.065 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
go in and fix that.

00:35:15.065 --> 00:35:17.440 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go re-implant
the ureter into the bladder.

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:18.520 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:20.590 align:middle line:84%
So at the time, we were
at Children's Hospital

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:22.990 align:middle line:84%
in Chicago, Children's
Memorial, was a teaching school.

00:35:22.990 --> 00:35:24.940 align:middle line:90%
They rotate doctors.

00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:27.320 align:middle line:90%
And get got phone call one day.

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:30.130 align:middle line:84%
I was up for job at
some computer company

00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:31.990 align:middle line:84%
doing whatever,
I can't remember.

00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And call waiting
had just come out.

00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And I clicked over,
and the guy was

00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:39.050 align:middle line:84%
calling from the hospital
the day before the surgery.

00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:41.079 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I got
good news and bad news.

00:35:41.079 --> 00:35:43.120 align:middle line:84%
The good news is we can
definitely do the surgery

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:44.690 align:middle line:84%
and she won't have
reflux anymore.

00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:47.100 align:middle line:84%
The bad news is that reflux
has damaged her right kidney.

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:49.142 align:middle line:90%
We have to take it out.

00:35:49.142 --> 00:35:50.350 align:middle line:90%
And then he told me his name.

00:35:50.350 --> 00:35:51.725 align:middle line:84%
And I knew it was
going to be OK.

00:35:51.725 --> 00:35:53.540 align:middle line:90%
His name was Dr. Kevin Gandhi.

00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:55.160 align:middle line:90%
I was good.

00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:55.960 align:middle line:90%
Didn't like it.

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:57.110 align:middle line:90%
Knees on the floor.

00:35:57.110 --> 00:35:57.910 align:middle line:90%
Felt like puking.

00:35:57.910 --> 00:36:00.790 align:middle line:84%
But I thought in the back
of my head this is OK.

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:02.250 align:middle line:90%
This guy's here on time.

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:04.880 align:middle line:90%
They did the whole surgery.

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:06.130 align:middle line:90%
Long haul for mom and dad.

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And it was very difficult
to sit in the waiting

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:09.340 align:middle line:84%
room with all these
other parents who

00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:10.440 align:middle line:90%
you can't help your kids.

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:13.760 align:middle line:84%
You're just totally--
you can't really

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:16.070 align:middle line:84%
control much any way in life,
but for sure right there.

00:36:16.070 --> 00:36:17.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's down to skill
and grace at that point.

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:17.970 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:18.880 align:middle line:90%
You just sit there.

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:19.790 align:middle line:90%
You just sit.

00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:20.670 align:middle line:90%
And I watched.

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:24.150 align:middle line:84%
All the parents, I just
remember, we just sit.

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:25.690 align:middle line:90%
That's hell.

00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:27.730 align:middle line:90%
You just sit.

00:36:27.730 --> 00:36:29.800 align:middle line:90%
Came in afterwards.

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.750 align:middle line:90%
And tubes and the whole thing.

00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:33.220 align:middle line:90%
And I remember talking with her.

00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And not 10 minutes
after, maybe later, I

00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:38.500 align:middle line:84%
can't remember how long
the time frame was,

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:40.170 align:middle line:84%
but this whole team
of doctors comes in,

00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:41.660 align:middle line:90%
the clipboards and the bow ties.

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:44.455 align:middle line:84%
And no offense to any of the
docs watching because I get it.

00:36:44.455 --> 00:36:46.330 align:middle line:84%
But you really got to
work on bedside manner.

00:36:46.330 --> 00:36:48.820 align:middle line:84%
Don't come within six hours
of a major and say here's

00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:50.020 align:middle line:90%
how things are.

00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And they came in and basically
pronounced that within a year

00:36:51.850 --> 00:36:54.308 align:middle line:84%
she'd need dialysis, transplant,
all these horrible things,

00:36:54.308 --> 00:36:55.280 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't grow right.

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:56.080 align:middle line:90%
And they left.

00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:58.750 align:middle line:90%


00:36:58.750 --> 00:37:00.040 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:02.700 align:middle line:90%
And something clicked.

00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:05.944 align:middle line:84%
And I asked her, I
said, Amanda, maybe we

00:37:05.944 --> 00:37:07.110 align:middle line:90%
can try something different.

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:07.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How old
is she at this time?

00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:08.310 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Five.

00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:08.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:10.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Maybe we
could try something different,

00:37:10.330 --> 00:37:12.550 align:middle line:84%
which means her belief
system's not in place totally.

00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:14.800 align:middle line:84%
She's open to anything,
especially from dad.

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:15.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:16.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Right?

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:18.880 align:middle line:84%
And I said maybe we can
do something different.

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:19.736 align:middle line:90%
OK, Dad.

00:37:19.736 --> 00:37:20.860 align:middle line:90%
Because we don't want that.

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:21.340 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:22.120 align:middle line:90%
No, Dad.

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:22.480 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:23.771 align:middle line:90%
Well, we'll see what we can do.

00:37:23.771 --> 00:37:27.050 align:middle line:84%
You got to remember I'm still
dragging knuckles now and then

00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:27.850 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:37:27.850 --> 00:37:29.808 align:middle line:84%
But I had learned enough
from my own experience

00:37:29.808 --> 00:37:32.680 align:middle line:84%
to go if I can access something
and information and energy

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:35.080 align:middle line:84%
that I don't have, maybe
things can be different.

00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:37.670 align:middle line:84%
So I started asking
her questions.

00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:38.990 align:middle line:90%
What are we going to be today?

00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:40.084 align:middle line:90%
How you feeling today?

00:37:40.084 --> 00:37:41.000 align:middle line:90%
What's going on today?

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:41.760 align:middle line:90%
And she'd always answer me.

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:42.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm great.

00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:43.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm this.

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:45.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm that, all these
wonderful things.

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And she went
through that process

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:54.280 align:middle line:84%
of losing her kidney record
time got out of there,

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:55.610 align:middle line:90%
doing somersaults on the floor.

00:37:55.610 --> 00:37:56.410 align:middle line:90%
Please don't move.

00:37:56.410 --> 00:37:58.850 align:middle line:84%
She's doing everything
she's not supposed to do.

00:37:58.850 --> 00:38:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And she went eight years
before she needed transplant.

00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:07.390 align:middle line:84%
We saw a Chinese herbalist at
that time and Western medicine

00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:08.530 align:middle line:90%
and Eastern together.

00:38:08.530 --> 00:38:09.940 align:middle line:90%
And both played a role.

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:11.780 align:middle line:84%
At one point, they
called all these docs

00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:13.450 align:middle line:90%
in when we'd go to our checkups.

00:38:13.450 --> 00:38:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And they said this is
called compensatory growth

00:38:15.850 --> 00:38:16.720 align:middle line:90%
in an organ.

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:20.500 align:middle line:84%
We've never seen this
in a girl this age.

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:21.390 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:22.190 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing?

00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:23.350 align:middle line:90%
None of your business.

00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:25.058 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't want
to spreading it out.

00:38:25.058 --> 00:38:25.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:30.247 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: So we got to
the point where she was 13.

00:38:30.247 --> 00:38:32.080 align:middle line:84%
Her body was starting
to give up on that one

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:32.955 align:middle line:90%
kidney that was left.

00:38:32.955 --> 00:38:34.660 align:middle line:84%
She had gone as far
as she could go.

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And you're going
to get me on this.

00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:37.630 align:middle line:90%
Boy.

00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:42.200 align:middle line:90%


00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:43.960 align:middle line:84%
So we're living
in upper Michigan.

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And my father and
grandfather both died

00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:48.590 align:middle line:90%
of polycystic kidney disease.

00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:49.802 align:middle line:90%
It's not what she had.

00:38:49.802 --> 00:38:51.010 align:middle line:90%
But my sister didn't have it.

00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:51.940 align:middle line:90%
It's hereditary.

00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:53.570 align:middle line:90%
I should have it.

00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:54.957 align:middle line:90%
And I'd never gotten tested.

00:38:54.957 --> 00:38:56.290 align:middle line:90%
Didn't want to put energy on it.

00:38:56.290 --> 00:38:57.160 align:middle line:90%
Didn't want to think about it.

00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:59.290 align:middle line:84%
Might have been denial,
but I'm not going there.

00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:00.915 align:middle line:84%
And my dad was still
alive at the time,

00:39:00.915 --> 00:39:04.480 align:middle line:84%
but that's what was
his problem at the end.

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.890 align:middle line:90%
So we all get tested.

00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:10.070 align:middle line:84%
At the time, it was blood tests
to see who was most compatible.

00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:12.700 align:middle line:84%
And it was me and my
father-in-law at the time.

00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:15.065 align:middle line:84%
And since he had far more
Manhattans than I'd ever had,

00:39:15.065 --> 00:39:16.815 align:middle line:84%
and I was a lot younger
and better shape--

00:39:16.815 --> 00:39:17.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:19.440 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: --yeah, they
picked me, which is great.

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:21.200 align:middle line:84%
So I went through
all these tests.

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:21.616 align:middle line:90%
Everything was perfect.

00:39:21.616 --> 00:39:22.416 align:middle line:90%
I was 43.

00:39:22.416 --> 00:39:24.500 align:middle line:84%
I was in great
shape, except, one,

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:25.792 align:middle line:90%
you have to have an ultrasound.

00:39:25.792 --> 00:39:28.250 align:middle line:84%
The only way you can tell if
you have cysts on your kidneys

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:30.910 align:middle line:84%
because it you have cysts,
it's not going to happen.

00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:34.310 align:middle line:84%
So one morning on
a Saturday morning

00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:37.220 align:middle line:84%
I walk into the lodge where so
much had happened in our lives.

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And Bruce was in there
doing a naming ceremony

00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:41.150 align:middle line:90%
with two people from Chicago.

00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And a naming is like a baptism
for the Native Americans.

00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:47.200 align:middle line:84%
And Duane, my brother Duane,
was sitting in the West,

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:49.670 align:middle line:84%
and a woman named Sandy
was sitting in the east.

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:50.660 align:middle line:90%
Bruce was in the south.

00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:52.368 align:middle line:84%
The two people were
standing next to him.

00:39:52.368 --> 00:39:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And the chair in
the North was open.

00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:56.420 align:middle line:84%
So I went and sat
in the north chair.

00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And he's talking
and doing his thing.

00:39:57.990 --> 00:39:59.829 align:middle line:84%
And it's a beautiful
Saturday morning.

00:39:59.829 --> 00:40:01.370 align:middle line:84%
And I have a test
scheduled, I think,

00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:03.380 align:middle line:84%
later that week for
this ultrasound.

00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:05.374 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just minding
my own business.

00:40:05.374 --> 00:40:06.290 align:middle line:90%
Happened to wander in.

00:40:06.290 --> 00:40:08.537 align:middle line:84%
I'm sitting there, no
shoes on, and shorts,

00:40:08.537 --> 00:40:09.370 align:middle line:90%
playing in the sand.

00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:14.110 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
there's this force.

00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:17.576 align:middle line:84%
There's like an ocean coming,
a wave coming at me from out--

00:40:17.576 --> 00:40:18.700 align:middle line:90%
and Bruce is still talking.

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:19.642 align:middle line:90%
Like what is this?

00:40:19.642 --> 00:40:21.100 align:middle line:84%
I could feel it
from the other side

00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:23.500 align:middle line:90%
of the lodge, which is canvas.

00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:27.760 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden I have
my third you're out of here

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:29.139 align:middle line:90%
out of the body experience.

00:40:29.139 --> 00:40:30.430 align:middle line:90%
The first one get electrocuted.

00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:32.320 align:middle line:84%
The second one was
getting the car.

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And this one I'm
sitting in this chair,

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.172 align:middle line:84%
but now I'm standing behind
me sitting in the chair.

00:40:38.172 --> 00:40:39.130 align:middle line:90%
I could see it clearly.

00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:40.600 align:middle line:90%
Everything's still happening.

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:42.920 align:middle line:90%
Clear as a bell like a movie.

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:43.950 align:middle line:90%
Bruce is talking.

00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:45.580 align:middle line:84%
Duane is sitting
there meditating.

00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:47.140 align:middle line:84%
The flies are still
moving around.

00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:48.520 align:middle line:90%
And there's this force coming.

00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:51.580 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden through
this wall of this lodge a man

00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:53.800 align:middle line:90%
walks in.

00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And he has blue eyes, red
hair, a big red beard,

00:40:58.450 --> 00:41:00.400 align:middle line:84%
like a burlap
tunic kind of thing

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:04.826 align:middle line:84%
on with a big knotted belt.
And just he's on a mission.

00:41:04.826 --> 00:41:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And he comes walking in and
walks right through the fire.

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:08.325 align:middle line:90%
And Bruce is still talking.

00:41:08.325 --> 00:41:09.770 align:middle line:90%
He walks up to my body.

00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:12.480 align:middle line:84%
And he grabs my body as
I'm sitting in a chair

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:13.280 align:middle line:90%
much like this one.

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:16.040 align:middle line:84%
He grabs it, puts it
right my lower back,

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:18.670 align:middle line:90%
and shakes me, this big guy.

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:20.879 align:middle line:84%
And he pulls his
hands up and he goes,

00:41:20.879 --> 00:41:22.045 align:middle line:90%
you don't need this anymore.

00:41:22.045 --> 00:41:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's dripping with
tar, like black tar.

00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as he says that, I
go, oh, that's the Jesus man.

00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:29.970 align:middle line:90%
I don't even go to church.

00:41:29.970 --> 00:41:30.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:32.960 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Apparently,
it didn't matter.

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:34.570 align:middle line:90%
This is the Jesus man.

00:41:34.570 --> 00:41:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And you don't need this
tar on you anymore.

00:41:36.490 --> 00:41:39.400 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing you know
I was right back in my body.

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:41.420 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like nobody saw this.

00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:43.620 align:middle line:90%
How can nobody see this?

00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:44.582 align:middle line:90%
And I left.

00:41:44.582 --> 00:41:46.290 align:middle line:84%
I went down and told
my wife at the time,

00:41:46.290 --> 00:41:48.640 align:middle line:84%
I said, nope, I got
to tell someone.

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:50.900 align:middle line:90%
No one is going to believe this.

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:52.700 align:middle line:90%
Didn't say a word.

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:56.370 align:middle line:84%
Four or five days later
we go to this test.

00:41:56.370 --> 00:41:57.620 align:middle line:90%
And they do the wand on there.

00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:58.510 align:middle line:90%
We knew the tech.

00:41:58.510 --> 00:42:00.272 align:middle line:90%
We'd gone camping together.

00:42:00.272 --> 00:42:02.355 align:middle line:84%
And you know I was supposed
to wait for the doctor

00:42:02.355 --> 00:42:03.630 align:middle line:90%
to read it all out.

00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And she says, what
happened to you?

00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:07.810 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:42:07.810 --> 00:42:09.460 align:middle line:84%
She said, well, there's
scarring on your kidney.

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:10.990 align:middle line:84%
Something was there,
but it's not there now.

00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:12.130 align:middle line:90%
What happened to you?

00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:13.286 align:middle line:90%
I just lost it.

00:42:13.286 --> 00:42:14.150 align:middle line:90%
Lost it.

00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The tar.

00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:15.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE:
The tar is gone.

00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:16.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You don't
need this anymore.

00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:17.608 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE:
Whatever that was,

00:42:17.608 --> 00:42:21.850 align:middle line:84%
whatever the remnants were of my
DNA download from all the past

00:42:21.850 --> 00:42:25.365 align:middle line:84%
people and all of that stuff
that lodged itself in there--

00:42:25.365 --> 00:42:26.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Was healed.

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:27.406 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: --was gone.

00:42:27.406 --> 00:42:31.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you now
had a kidney to donate.

00:42:31.050 --> 00:42:33.354 align:middle line:84%
And is that when you
made the decision?

00:42:33.354 --> 00:42:34.270 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Yeah.

00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:35.890 align:middle line:84%
Because without that,
I couldn't do it.

00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:36.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:42:36.130 --> 00:42:36.250 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:42:36.250 --> 00:42:36.370 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:42:36.370 --> 00:42:37.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: She'd
be looking for a cadaver.

00:42:37.330 --> 00:42:37.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:38.950 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Yeah.

00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:40.880 align:middle line:90%
So we went in.

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:42.720 align:middle line:90%
She has two birthdays.

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:43.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:44.520 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Right?

00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:46.770 align:middle line:84%
At one point, she's 29,
but she's also only 15

00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:48.670 align:middle line:90%
because it's been 15 years.

00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And we went in Medicine
Children's Hospital, Dr. Hans

00:42:52.830 --> 00:42:54.659 align:middle line:90%
Solinger just a miracle worker.

00:42:54.659 --> 00:42:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And you know, your kidney
is as big as your fist.

00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:58.950 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, she's only
13, and she's straight.

00:42:58.950 --> 00:43:03.060 align:middle line:84%
So they had to put some WD-40
on there and shove my kidney in.

00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:07.980 align:middle line:84%
And the next day, my son
wheeled me up to her room.

00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:10.131 align:middle line:84%
And she's sitting on
the bed cross-legged.

00:43:10.131 --> 00:43:13.420 align:middle line:90%


00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:14.220 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:15.457 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Born again.

00:43:15.457 --> 00:43:16.415 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Whole.

00:43:16.415 --> 00:43:18.600 align:middle line:90%
Hi, Dad.

00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And ever since it's never
stopped, all these 15 years.

00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:26.010 align:middle line:84%
So getting a chance to talk
about this again and go

00:43:26.010 --> 00:43:29.040 align:middle line:84%
through this-- to her,
it's no big deal anymore.

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:31.830 align:middle line:84%
But we came to a conclusion
over many, many conversations

00:43:31.830 --> 00:43:34.922 align:middle line:84%
that this was preordained
somewhere, set up.

00:43:34.922 --> 00:43:36.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The souls
agreed upon it.

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:37.390 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: There
was an agreement.

00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:38.080 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:38.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:40.630 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: And I
used to kid her, I'd say,

00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:42.860 align:middle line:84%
you know, you ever heard
of organ memory retention?

00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:43.660 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:46.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's where like if you
get a heart and somebody liked

00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:46.960 align:middle line:90%
French fries.

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:49.130 align:middle line:84%
I said, I know when
you're on a date.

00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:50.170 align:middle line:90%
I know what's going on.

00:43:50.170 --> 00:43:51.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I was going to ask you.

00:43:51.310 --> 00:43:51.745 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Yeah.

00:43:51.745 --> 00:43:52.015 align:middle line:90%
I kind of kid her.

00:43:52.015 --> 00:43:52.950 align:middle line:90%
And she goes, yeah, OK, Dad.

00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:53.810 align:middle line:90%
You know, whatever.

00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:57.220 align:middle line:84%
But we have a, obviously,
very close relationship.

00:43:57.220 --> 00:44:01.104 align:middle line:84%
And everybody, our family,
everybody played their role.

00:44:01.104 --> 00:44:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And one of the big things I've
learned over the years that

00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:05.895 align:middle line:84%
connect the dots is you only
get to see what's happened,

00:44:05.895 --> 00:44:07.020 align:middle line:90%
not what's going to happen.

00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:07.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:08.950 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: And we
often don't take time,

00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:10.991 align:middle line:84%
as you mentioned before
about people bailing out,

00:44:10.991 --> 00:44:13.120 align:middle line:84%
to really to see where
this is all headed.

00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:16.060 align:middle line:84%
To give it the providence
that it deserves.

00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:18.250 align:middle line:84%
To wait for these
things to come forward.

00:44:18.250 --> 00:44:22.220 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want any
more wake-up calls.

00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:23.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm good.

00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:23.740 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:25.270 align:middle line:84%
Now I get to talk about
it, write about it,

00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:26.103 align:middle line:90%
and do other things.

00:44:26.103 --> 00:44:28.970 align:middle line:90%
But it's been a journey.

00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:31.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now,
getting through that part

00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:34.640 align:middle line:84%
of the journey you gave your
daughter her second life.

00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And you picked back
up with your career.

00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:38.020 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: I did.

00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:41.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so when
you're speaking to people,

00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:43.360 align:middle line:84%
because just your story, if
you just told your story,

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:44.590 align:middle line:84%
you're already
doing the healing.

00:44:44.590 --> 00:44:45.506 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Yeah.

00:44:45.506 --> 00:44:47.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So beyond
your story, what

00:44:47.770 --> 00:44:49.840 align:middle line:84%
are the most
important things you

00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:54.610 align:middle line:84%
try to impart to people about
just living their lives?

00:44:54.610 --> 00:44:56.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: I
think that it's so easy,

00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:58.660 align:middle line:84%
and both of us with
a news or sports

00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:02.110 align:middle line:84%
broadcasting background, so
easy to get sucked into that.

00:45:02.110 --> 00:45:03.467 align:middle line:90%
And that's not real life.

00:45:03.467 --> 00:45:04.550 align:middle line:90%
It's only a keyhole of it.

00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:06.175 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I got
that when I was 26.

00:45:06.175 --> 00:45:07.546 align:middle line:90%
I realized it was a false life.

00:45:07.546 --> 00:45:09.670 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: But you
know, unless you're in it,

00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:12.260 align:middle line:90%
you see it from the back side.

00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:14.750 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I love those
people on whatever.

00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:16.947 align:middle line:84%
They're paid to
talk a certain way.

00:45:16.947 --> 00:45:18.530 align:middle line:84%
But the masses really
don't know that.

00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:21.667 align:middle line:84%
So part of my job has
been to say humanity

00:45:21.667 --> 00:45:23.750 align:middle line:84%
has such a difficult time
figuring out what's real

00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:26.420 align:middle line:84%
and what's not, what's produced
reality versus reality.

00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And your own reality is
the best reality show.

00:45:29.570 --> 00:45:31.730 align:middle line:90%
That's where it matters most.

00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And when you keep
getting your energies

00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:35.360 align:middle line:84%
going into these
other things, you

00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:37.370 align:middle line:84%
know we're in a
position where you

00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:41.780 align:middle line:84%
have to have a disclaimer that
says real people not actors

00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:42.650 align:middle line:90%
on a commercial.

00:45:42.650 --> 00:45:43.355 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:43.355 --> 00:45:44.155 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:45:44.155 --> 00:45:46.910 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE:
So my kind of stump

00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:51.334 align:middle line:84%
has been really two
things as waking people

00:45:51.334 --> 00:45:52.250 align:middle line:90%
up if at all possible.

00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:53.490 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
wake up sleepwalkers.

00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:54.660 align:middle line:90%
It just pisses them off.

00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:57.654 align:middle line:84%
However, if you tell your story
and you can relate to people.

00:45:57.654 --> 00:46:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And I've been lucky enough to do
so many different things-- been

00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:02.180 align:middle line:84%
in the service,
played football, been

00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:03.490 align:middle line:90%
in broadcasting, written books.

00:46:03.490 --> 00:46:05.573 align:middle line:84%
I've done all this stuff
that allows me to connect

00:46:05.573 --> 00:46:07.170 align:middle line:90%
with different demographics.

00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:09.132 align:middle line:90%
And I can say I get it.

00:46:09.132 --> 00:46:11.090 align:middle line:84%
I understand what's like
to be on unemployment.

00:46:11.090 --> 00:46:12.332 align:middle line:90%
I know that.

00:46:12.332 --> 00:46:14.040 align:middle line:84%
I know what it's like
to live in a motel.

00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:16.850 align:middle line:84%
I know what it's like to make
more money than my dad would

00:46:16.850 --> 00:46:18.360 align:middle line:90%
ever imagine.

00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:19.280 align:middle line:90%
And then to lose it.

00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:19.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And to have
an emotional breakdown.

00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:20.330 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Yeah.

00:46:20.330 --> 00:46:20.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Lose it.

00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:21.115 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Exactly.

00:46:21.115 --> 00:46:22.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Give, sacrifice.

00:46:22.070 --> 00:46:22.720 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Yeah.

00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:23.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Recover.

00:46:23.250 --> 00:46:24.166 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Yeah.

00:46:24.166 --> 00:46:27.050 align:middle line:84%
So whatever I signed up for,
I'm fulfilling the bill here.

00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And I thought if I
just keep it to myself

00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:30.816 align:middle line:84%
I'm not doing it justice
to what I've been

00:46:30.816 --> 00:46:31.940 align:middle line:90%
asked to do while I'm here.

00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:32.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:34.814 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: So I
think that connecting

00:46:34.814 --> 00:46:36.980 align:middle line:84%
with people and that is to
say right where you're at

00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:38.960 align:middle line:84%
is where this
stuff matters most.

00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:40.650 align:middle line:90%
And that's where you apply it.

00:46:40.650 --> 00:46:42.890 align:middle line:84%
It's our lives are
our own curriculum.

00:46:42.890 --> 00:46:45.320 align:middle line:84%
I believe there's a set
up behind all of it,

00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:47.840 align:middle line:84%
even the worst of
it is a set up.

00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:51.560 align:middle line:84%
But if all you see is what's
presented to you on the news,

00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:53.750 align:middle line:84%
you're missing the
whole ballgame.

00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:54.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:46:54.650 --> 00:46:56.510 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Thank you.

00:46:56.510 --> 00:47:00.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know how well that's
manipulated having been there.

00:47:00.410 --> 00:47:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And another thing
that you notice

00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:05.090 align:middle line:84%
as you mingle with
people throughout life

00:47:05.090 --> 00:47:07.610 align:middle line:84%
is there is this general
sense among people

00:47:07.610 --> 00:47:09.549 align:middle line:90%
that they somehow don't belong.

00:47:09.549 --> 00:47:10.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Oh, boy.

00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:11.450 align:middle line:90%
Listen.

00:47:11.450 --> 00:47:12.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's ubiquitous.

00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:12.672 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: It is.

00:47:12.672 --> 00:47:13.472 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:47:13.472 --> 00:47:15.385 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Most people
feel on some level,

00:47:15.385 --> 00:47:16.260 align:middle line:90%
what am I doing here.

00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:17.240 align:middle line:90%
I don't really belong.

00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:19.160 align:middle line:84%
How could everyone be
having that experience.

00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:20.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE:
That's a pile of crap.

00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:21.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's a pile of crap.

00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:21.770 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE:
It's a pile of crap.

00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:22.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But why is everyone
having that experience?

00:47:22.850 --> 00:47:23.808 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Right.

00:47:23.808 --> 00:47:25.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me say
a couple things.

00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:29.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'll tell you why, I
think in the history of humanity

00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:31.070 align:middle line:84%
since we started
counting, they figure out

00:47:31.070 --> 00:47:32.870 align:middle line:84%
there's been about
70 billion of us

00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:34.984 align:middle line:84%
since they started I
don't know who did it,

00:47:34.984 --> 00:47:35.900 align:middle line:90%
but that's the number.

00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:36.635 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
their calculation.

00:47:36.635 --> 00:47:37.040 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Yeah.

00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:37.956 align:middle line:90%
And now there's seven.

00:47:37.956 --> 00:47:40.490 align:middle line:90%
So we're not staying very long.

00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:44.270 align:middle line:84%
So when you think about
the odds of being born

00:47:44.270 --> 00:47:45.790 align:middle line:90%
are I can't calculate them.

00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:46.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm pretty good at math.

00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:47.870 align:middle line:90%
I can't calculate them.

00:47:47.870 --> 00:47:49.760 align:middle line:84%
If you take a look at your
parents and their parents

00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:51.230 align:middle line:84%
and their parents
and their parents

00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:53.810 align:middle line:84%
and all the little friends
they had and the dates and all

00:47:53.810 --> 00:47:56.570 align:middle line:84%
the other stuff they were doing,
the odds of you being born you

00:47:56.570 --> 00:47:58.590 align:middle line:84%
won the lottery the
minute you got here.

00:47:58.590 --> 00:47:59.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:47:59.390 --> 00:48:01.040 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: The
very second you came in.

00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
my husband always says.

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:02.426 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Right.

00:48:02.426 --> 00:48:02.870 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:03.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:04.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Everybody's
out trying to win the Powerball.

00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:05.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:06.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: You
already won the Powerball.

00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:07.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're here.

00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:10.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: So
reinforcing that with people I

00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:14.307 align:middle line:84%
think offsets the erosion that
the news and this other stuff.

00:48:14.307 --> 00:48:16.890 align:middle line:84%
Look, if you turn on the TV, and
you know, your breath stinks.

00:48:16.890 --> 00:48:17.750 align:middle line:90%
You got the wrong pants.

00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:18.666 align:middle line:90%
You got the wrong car.

00:48:18.666 --> 00:48:19.770 align:middle line:90%
You got the wrong person.

00:48:19.770 --> 00:48:22.061 align:middle line:84%
Everything tells you you're
wrong and you don't belong.

00:48:22.061 --> 00:48:23.850 align:middle line:84%
But if you buy our
stuff, you will belong.

00:48:23.850 --> 00:48:24.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:26.380 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: And I think
getting that turned around

00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:28.920 align:middle line:84%
is critically important because
we're not here very long.

00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:31.800 align:middle line:84%
There's more guarantees--
well, maybe not our cell phone,

00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:33.960 align:middle line:84%
but there's more guarantees
in the products we buy

00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:35.325 align:middle line:90%
than our time on the planet.

00:48:35.325 --> 00:48:35.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:37.205 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: And
while you're here,

00:48:37.205 --> 00:48:38.850 align:middle line:90%
there's something to be done.

00:48:38.850 --> 00:48:42.970 align:middle line:84%
Just to take up space and
not pay for that in some way,

00:48:42.970 --> 00:48:46.430 align:middle line:84%
shape, or form to me just
pushes all the providence back

00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:47.230 align:middle line:90%
that got you here.

00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:48.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So is it
fair to say, having

00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:53.700 align:middle line:84%
been through this
journey, that life

00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:56.940 align:middle line:84%
is about listening to
those whispers of the soul?

00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:59.100 align:middle line:84%
Wherever you are,
whatever you're doing,

00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:00.012 align:middle line:90%
it's about listening.

00:49:00.012 --> 00:49:00.970 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: It is.

00:49:00.970 --> 00:49:02.460 align:middle line:90%
In a world of talk radio--

00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:04.335 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not that kind
of listening, per se,

00:49:04.335 --> 00:49:04.490 align:middle line:90%
but you know what I mean.

00:49:04.490 --> 00:49:06.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: --I understand,
but even that's listening.

00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:06.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:49:06.690 --> 00:49:08.550 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: So the
point is that's the key.

00:49:08.550 --> 00:49:09.510 align:middle line:90%
The key is not talking.

00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:09.970 align:middle line:90%
It's listening.

00:49:09.970 --> 00:49:11.178 align:middle line:90%
And I wish I had invented it.

00:49:11.178 --> 00:49:12.040 align:middle line:90%
But it's not.

00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:12.660 align:middle line:90%
I didn't.

00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:13.460 align:middle line:90%
It is listening.

00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:15.090 align:middle line:84%
And we all know if
you don't listen,

00:49:15.090 --> 00:49:17.220 align:middle line:84%
the knocks get louder
and louder and louder.

00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:19.890 align:middle line:84%
And instead of thinking
things are happening to you,

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:22.110 align:middle line:84%
see them as something
happening through you.

00:49:22.110 --> 00:49:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And when they go through
you, you have value to them.

00:49:24.450 --> 00:49:25.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:25.770 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE:
They're an experience

00:49:25.770 --> 00:49:27.220 align:middle line:90%
just for you to grow.

00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:29.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if we're
looking at this,

00:49:29.490 --> 00:49:31.920 align:middle line:84%
you bring a bag of tools
to the table or perceptions

00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:33.430 align:middle line:90%
to the table.

00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:35.100 align:middle line:84%
What are some of
the primary tools

00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:37.590 align:middle line:84%
that you put out
there or suggest

00:49:37.590 --> 00:49:39.450 align:middle line:84%
that people use
to be able to get

00:49:39.450 --> 00:49:42.450 align:middle line:84%
in touch with this direct
communication with self that's

00:49:42.450 --> 00:49:44.640 align:middle line:84%
going to guide your life
to its fullest potential?

00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:46.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: When
in doubt, write it out.

00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:47.324 align:middle line:90%
That's my number one thing.

00:49:47.324 --> 00:49:49.590 align:middle line:90%
When you've got doubt--

00:49:49.590 --> 00:49:54.910 align:middle line:84%
our ancient brainstem is not
set up to handle all this stuff.

00:49:54.910 --> 00:49:56.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm convinced of that.

00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:58.734 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how can you
go from whether it's

00:49:58.734 --> 00:50:00.400 align:middle line:84%
the news or anything
else on television,

00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:03.030 align:middle line:84%
or even our cell phones, to
process that much information

00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:04.410 align:middle line:90%
is near impossible.

00:50:04.410 --> 00:50:07.230 align:middle line:84%
So it gets to be
all tied in a knot.

00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And the things that
we are here to do,

00:50:09.150 --> 00:50:11.544 align:middle line:84%
those are floating
somewhere inside.

00:50:11.544 --> 00:50:12.960 align:middle line:84%
But the only way
to access them is

00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:15.090 align:middle line:84%
to push the other stuff
aside and just start

00:50:15.090 --> 00:50:16.620 align:middle line:90%
what I call automatic writing.

00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:18.289 align:middle line:84%
I always tell people,
you don't even

00:50:18.289 --> 00:50:19.830 align:middle line:84%
know what your story
is yet until you

00:50:19.830 --> 00:50:23.640 align:middle line:84%
say once upon a time Regina
did this and just let it go.

00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:24.957 align:middle line:90%
You may write for a week.

00:50:24.957 --> 00:50:26.540 align:middle line:84%
But it's got to break
open the logjam.

00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:28.290 align:middle line:84%
So that's my first thing is
when in doubt, write it out.

00:50:28.290 --> 00:50:30.090 align:middle line:84%
Most people walk
around a doubt all day.

00:50:30.090 --> 00:50:30.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:50:30.450 --> 00:50:31.620 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: So
turn the tube off.

00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:32.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:50:32.190 --> 00:50:34.320 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: And start
just writing your story.

00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:35.153 align:middle line:90%
And you'd be amazed.

00:50:35.153 --> 00:50:37.470 align:middle line:84%
While mine is unique to
me, yours is unique to you.

00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:38.700 align:middle line:90%
The folks behind the camera.

00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:39.784 align:middle line:90%
Everybody has this.

00:50:39.784 --> 00:50:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And when you start
writing it out,

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.926 align:middle line:84%
it's amazing what
starts coming in.

00:50:42.926 --> 00:50:44.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely,
because it starts

00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:46.910 align:middle line:84%
coming in from the subconscious,
the superconscious.

00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:48.360 align:middle line:90%
It all pours out together.

00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:49.440 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: It's
like Hoover Dam opens up.

00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:50.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:50:50.190 --> 00:50:50.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE:
And then you got

00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:52.478 align:middle line:84%
to be able to deal with
the second thing I tell

00:50:52.478 --> 00:50:56.040 align:middle line:84%
people that I think is nothing
new but important to remember

00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:57.870 align:middle line:90%
is that your voice matters.

00:50:57.870 --> 00:50:59.730 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't
think that they counter

00:50:59.730 --> 00:51:01.650 align:middle line:90%
their voice-- it matters.

00:51:01.650 --> 00:51:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And you never know
what the straw that

00:51:04.170 --> 00:51:06.210 align:middle line:84%
breaks the camel's back
or the word that's said

00:51:06.210 --> 00:51:08.293 align:middle line:84%
at the right time when you
shouldn't have said it.

00:51:08.293 --> 00:51:10.944 align:middle line:84%
I was on the tram at the
airport coming out this way.

00:51:10.944 --> 00:51:12.360 align:middle line:84%
And when you get
on the tram to go

00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:14.160 align:middle line:84%
to the main terminal it
takes a big jerking off,

00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:15.417 align:middle line:90%
you go to 50 miles an hour.

00:51:15.417 --> 00:51:17.250 align:middle line:84%
And there was a little
woman standing there.

00:51:17.250 --> 00:51:21.160 align:middle line:84%
And I said, do you want
to hold onto the pole,

00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:22.290 align:middle line:90%
because I was in the way.

00:51:22.290 --> 00:51:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't speak English,
but the guy next to her

00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:26.156 align:middle line:84%
spoke whatever she was
speaking and translated

00:51:26.156 --> 00:51:27.120 align:middle line:90%
and she said thank you.

00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:29.100 align:middle line:84%
But if I hadn't said anything,
she'd be on the floor.

00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:29.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:31.110 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: It's kind
of a metaphorical thing here,

00:51:31.110 --> 00:51:33.660 align:middle line:84%
but you never know where
your voice matters the most.

00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:35.730 align:middle line:90%
So stop using it the least.

00:51:35.730 --> 00:51:36.550 align:middle line:90%
Put it out there.

00:51:36.550 --> 00:51:37.350 align:middle line:90%
Very important.

00:51:37.350 --> 00:51:38.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And don't be afraid
to share the things that

00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:41.030 align:middle line:84%
are vulnerable and authentic
because that's usually

00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:42.750 align:middle line:84%
where the deepest truths
and connections come from.

00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:43.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Listen.

00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:45.420 align:middle line:84%
Do you know what it's like
for me all these years later

00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:48.411 align:middle line:84%
the guys I played football
with that read my books?

00:51:48.411 --> 00:51:50.160 align:middle line:84%
I went to a lunch with
a guy, and he says,

00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:51.409 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know you could write.

00:51:51.409 --> 00:51:53.180 align:middle line:84%
I said, I didn't
know you could read.

00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:54.940 align:middle line:90%
So we're even.

00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:57.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it is
interesting because in truth we

00:51:57.480 --> 00:52:01.344 align:middle line:84%
watch all these movies,
shows, read all these books,

00:52:01.344 --> 00:52:02.760 align:middle line:84%
and the people
that win our hearts

00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:05.494 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that are usually
left the most vulnerable.

00:52:05.494 --> 00:52:06.660 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Absolutely.

00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:07.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And not to
be afraid of that.

00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:10.860 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Yes, I've had
people tell me that very often.

00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:12.520 align:middle line:90%
Put these walls up does nothing.

00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:14.370 align:middle line:84%
You can come off as
an expert at whatever.

00:52:14.370 --> 00:52:15.570 align:middle line:84%
But when you share
your pain with people,

00:52:15.570 --> 00:52:17.100 align:middle line:84%
there's always gain
in that for everybody.

00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:17.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:18.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE:
Even like today.

00:52:18.090 --> 00:52:19.260 align:middle line:84%
Look, I didn't know what
you were going to ask me.

00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:20.910 align:middle line:84%
I know we had a bunch
of stuff to cover.

00:52:20.910 --> 00:52:22.746 align:middle line:10%
But you zeroed in on the things
that were the most important

00:52:22.746 --> 00:52:23.060 align:middle line:10%
to me.

00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:24.810 align:middle line:10%
I could come up with
all kinds of theories

00:52:24.810 --> 00:52:26.470 align:middle line:10%
and all that stuff
I've written about.

00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:27.960 align:middle line:84%
But at the basis,
the foundation of it,

00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:29.460 align:middle line:84%
the curricula of
my life, the things

00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:32.230 align:middle line:84%
that have changed me the
most usually hurt the most.

00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:33.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:34.290 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: But I was
able to transform them.

00:52:34.290 --> 00:52:35.650 align:middle line:90%
So don't stop at the pain.

00:52:35.650 --> 00:52:36.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:52:36.450 --> 00:52:37.408 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Right?

00:52:37.408 --> 00:52:40.100 align:middle line:10%
When I got electrocuted,
I had a nurse tell me--

00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:42.990 align:middle line:10%
and she was beautiful
blond, scrubbing my wounds,

00:52:42.990 --> 00:52:45.520 align:middle line:10%
you could do that for five
years for all I care--

00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:48.600 align:middle line:10%
until you take ownership
of the pain you don't heal.

00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:52.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's a
very good point to end on.

00:52:52.050 --> 00:52:54.220 align:middle line:84%
Don't stop at the pain,
keep moving through it.

00:52:54.220 --> 00:52:55.020 align:middle line:90%
It has a message.

00:52:55.020 --> 00:52:55.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Absolutely.

00:52:55.980 --> 00:52:57.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's going to take
you somewhere more beautiful.

00:52:57.690 --> 00:52:58.305 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Agreed.

00:52:58.305 --> 00:52:59.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: John,
thank you so much.

00:52:59.390 --> 00:53:00.280 align:middle line:90%
It's a beautiful story.

00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:01.571 align:middle line:90%
You're a wonderful storyteller.

00:53:01.571 --> 00:53:02.970 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: Ah, thank you.

00:53:02.970 --> 00:53:04.720 align:middle line:10%
