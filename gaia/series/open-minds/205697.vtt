00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: We have a
whole stack of divination toys,

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:12.920 align:middle line:90%
which is great.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.587 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN SLATTER: What
we're talking about

00:00:14.587 --> 00:00:17.600 align:middle line:84%
here is discovering who
you are and how you create.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.770 align:middle line:84%
We can ask higher guidance, is
there a meaning to this event?

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.168 align:middle line:90%
Is it germane to my life's path?

00:00:23.168 --> 00:00:25.460 align:middle line:84%
Higher guidance told me
something I've never forgotten.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.240 align:middle line:84%
We are here on a journey
of discovery of two things.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.000 align:middle line:84%
The very thing that
might be vexing you-- why

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.150 align:middle line:84%
is it that I attract the
same man into my life

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.080 align:middle line:90%
over and over again?

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.150 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that I have
the same money issues?

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.430 align:middle line:84%
We say it must be
because there's

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.880 align:middle line:84%
something wrong with me, but
I'd like to flip that around.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.770 align:middle line:84%
In our interview
here, later on, I'm

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.052 align:middle line:90%
going to reveal a handy tool.

00:00:48.052 --> 00:00:49.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know,
we're going to do that.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.540 align:middle line:90%


00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.240 align:middle line:10%
Master Dowser Jean
Slatter is back with us

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.420 align:middle line:10%
again to help us build
our divination toolkit.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.670 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're going to be
talking about the big one.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.710 align:middle line:90%
What is this lifetime all about?

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.040 align:middle line:84%
This is the most often asked
question among her clients.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.470 align:middle line:84%
Seems reasonable, but how
do we go about devining

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.300 align:middle line:90%
such profound information?

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.250 align:middle line:84%
This is not a does he
love me, does he not?

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.480 align:middle line:90%
Good to have you back, Jean.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Thank you, Regina.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.042 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Everyone
loves having tools

00:01:20.042 --> 00:01:22.715 align:middle line:10%
they can use, tools they
can use and go home with

00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:24.090 align:middle line:10%
and you're just
the best as this.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.340 align:middle line:10%
>>SLATTER: We've got
some great ones to share.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We do.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.370 align:middle line:84%
We have a whole stack of
divination toys, which

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.600 align:middle line:84%
is great, and a
book here that I've

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.930 align:middle line:84%
turned many people on to
after you turned me on to.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.030 align:middle line:90%
We'll share that with everyone.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.710 align:middle line:84%
But first of all, this is
the big question right here.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.030 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think it is that
human beings generally don't

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.580 align:middle line:90%
know their life's purpose?

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.920 align:middle line:84%
You'd think that would be
kind of baked into the cake.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.630 align:middle line:90%
Like, even at 5, 6.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.730 align:middle line:84%
We kind of know
what we're here for

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.540 align:middle line:84%
and what we're interested
in and want to take on,

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.440 align:middle line:84%
but most people have
no clue, admittedly.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.890 align:middle line:84%
They will say, I don't
know what I'm here for.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.100 align:middle line:90%
What's your take on that?

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Well, the
interesting thing about that

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.259 align:middle line:84%
is at least we have
the awareness that we

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:09.820 align:middle line:90%
have a purpose.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, not everybody.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.540 align:middle line:84%
That's only a small
percentage of the population.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Know that
there is a purpose

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.680 align:middle line:84%
even if we don't know
what it is, but we're

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.020 align:middle line:84%
longing to discover
about that is, right?

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why we're
asking these questions like,

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.190 align:middle line:90%
what am I here to do?

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.010 align:middle line:10%
And why does this keep
happening to me over and over?

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.320 align:middle line:10%
And what was the meaning
of this event, and what

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.610 align:middle line:10%
was the meaning of that event?

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.560 align:middle line:84%
And so we're asking
these questions

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.290 align:middle line:84%
because we intuitively know
there must be a meaning.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.210 align:middle line:90%
There must be a purpose.

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.990 align:middle line:10%
And so when I asked my
higher guidance about this,

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.090 align:middle line:10%
and it was about 20 years ago.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.680 align:middle line:84%
Higher guidance told me
something I've never forgotten.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.220 align:middle line:84%
Higher guidance said
that we are here

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.480 align:middle line:84%
on a journey of discovery
of two things always.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.670 align:middle line:84%
All roads lead to understanding
who you are and how you create.

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And so everything that
we encounter in our lives

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.280 align:middle line:84%
and all of our life experiences
are informing us of who we are

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.050 align:middle line:90%
and how we create.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.320 align:middle line:84%
And the really cool
thing is that we

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.760 align:middle line:84%
are on this journey of self
discovery, and we have a guide.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.400 align:middle line:90%
And that is our higher guidance.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And that could be your angels,
your guide, your higher self,

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.250 align:middle line:84%
God, whatever term
you want to put to it.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.460 align:middle line:84%
But you actually have a
guide that knows everything

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.030 align:middle line:84%
about you, knows the path that
you're on, knows your purpose,

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.470 align:middle line:84%
and is here to assist you in
answering those questions.

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.640 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, we do have that
innate wisdom and awareness

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.080 align:middle line:90%
that we have a purpose.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.080 align:middle line:84%
Just don't exactly know
how to put words to it yet.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.280 align:middle line:90%
That is true.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.610 align:middle line:84%
And honestly, if you look
at the global population,

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.830 align:middle line:84%
most people don't know
they have a guide,

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.020 align:middle line:84%
and most people
actually don't even

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.490 align:middle line:84%
have time to
consider that there's

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.950 align:middle line:84%
higher guidance because
they're in survival mode.

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.200 align:middle line:84%
Anyone watching
this show has gotten

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.170 align:middle line:84%
to a point in their reality
where they have the time

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.960 align:middle line:90%
to contemplate such things.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And so we have-- so this is a
portion of the population that

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:09.830 align:middle line:90%
is primed for it.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.430 align:middle line:84%
And others still
waiting to, I guess,

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.149 align:middle line:84%
to maybe be seen or something
or have someone just put

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:17.649 align:middle line:90%
the idea out there.

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:20.019 align:middle line:84%
There is more to life than
just making a paycheck

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.459 align:middle line:90%
and trying to feed your kids.

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And we're-- I'm
just saying this,

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.860 align:middle line:84%
because we are very
lucky, all of us,

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.040 align:middle line:84%
and everyone watching the
show, we have time to even

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.015 align:middle line:90%
contemplate this.

00:04:28.015 --> 00:04:29.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: This is true.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So there we are.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And one thing you talk
about, which I think

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.430 align:middle line:84%
is very true, that when we're
looking at the challenges

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.750 align:middle line:84%
and we're looking at the
blocks that we encounter,

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.400 align:middle line:84%
a lot of our ability to
engage with it has to do with,

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.110 align:middle line:90%
you call it soul strength.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.060 align:middle line:84%
First of all, explain
what you mean by that.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Well,
the very thing that

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.390 align:middle line:84%
might be vexing you, the
thing that you encounter

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.080 align:middle line:84%
over and over, why
is it that I attract

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.540 align:middle line:84%
the same man into my
life over and over again?

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.580 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that I
have the same money

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.270 align:middle line:90%
issues over and over again?

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.450 align:middle line:84%
The things that we
encounter over and over

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.090 align:middle line:84%
again are the things that
we look at and we say,

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.590 align:middle line:84%
it must be because there's
something wrong with me.

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm deficient in something.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.520 align:middle line:84%
I just can't overcome this, or
there's something that I just

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.820 align:middle line:90%
am not learning my lesson.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.280 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with me?

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.640 align:middle line:84%
But I'd like to flip that
around and have people

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.540 align:middle line:90%
look at it in a different way.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And what if the very thing that
you encounter over and over

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.550 align:middle line:84%
is revealing to you
and informing you

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.890 align:middle line:84%
that that is actually
a soul super strength?

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:42.880 align:middle line:84%
It's like before
we incarnate, we

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.160 align:middle line:84%
want to know something
about ourselves.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, how are we going to
know something and like,

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:53.830 align:middle line:84%
for an example, if I say before
I incarnate that I want to know

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.860 align:middle line:90%
that I can stand up for myself.

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, how will I know
that unless I put myself

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.630 align:middle line:84%
in that same situation over
and over and over again

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:04.430 align:middle line:90%
to validate.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.513 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And master that.

00:06:05.513 --> 00:06:08.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: And master it and
to prove to myself that, yes,

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.000 align:middle line:90%
I can stand up for myself.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.630 align:middle line:84%
So the very things that we
find we are encountering

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:17.440 align:middle line:84%
over and over could possibly
be revealing our soul

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.190 align:middle line:84%
super strength, that thing that
we're actually very good at.

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And I liken it to weightlifting,
which I enjoy going to the gym.

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:32.950 align:middle line:84%
But can you imagine if my
intention in going to the gym

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:37.540 align:middle line:90%
was to lift three feathers?

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And tomorrow, I'm
going to lift four

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.990 align:middle line:90%
and the next day, maybe five.

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't go to the
gym to lift feathers.

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:46.880 align:middle line:90%
I go to the gym to get stronger.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.150 align:middle line:84%
And so I look at the
weights, and I say to myself,

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:50.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to start
with a low weight

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.600 align:middle line:90%
and I'm going to work my way up.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.820 align:middle line:84%
And I want to validate
and prove to myself

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:58.100 align:middle line:84%
that, yes, I can get strong, and
I can strengthen that muscle.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And so it is with the themes,
these subthemes in our lives,

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.940 align:middle line:84%
that are occurring
over and over again,

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.940 align:middle line:84%
we're just lifting weights,
lifting weights in our life.

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually revealing
to us, you're good at this.

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:11.650 align:middle line:90%
You can.

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:15.220 align:middle line:84%
So rather than feeling
deflated and defeated

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:19.840 align:middle line:84%
when you think to yourself,
why can't I get over this?

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And why is this happening
over and over again?

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:25.840 align:middle line:84%
Instead, flip it around
and say this is actually

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.830 align:middle line:84%
showing me I have everything
within me to overcome this.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:32.480 align:middle line:84%
I have everything
within me to get strong.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:36.400 align:middle line:84%
I have everything within me
to show and prove and validate

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.628 align:middle line:84%
to myself that I
am good at this.

00:07:39.628 --> 00:07:41.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
absolutely true.

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:42.730 align:middle line:90%
We do have that within us.

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:47.890 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of times, our lenses
get kind of, mm, fogged over

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:51.160 align:middle line:84%
with habitual
thinking or perhaps

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.920 align:middle line:84%
subconscious memory,
subconscious trauma

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:54.760 align:middle line:90%
and desires.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.940 align:middle line:84%
And so probably the one
that dogs a lot of people

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.470 align:middle line:84%
is money, the
perception of money.

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:04.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, the idea in the
past, in ancient times,

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:08.230 align:middle line:90%
was more do I have enough food?

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:10.210 align:middle line:84%
Am I able to produce
or trade enough

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:12.520 align:middle line:84%
that I have food for
my family, and can we

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.080 align:middle line:90%
sleep peacefully at night?

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.720 align:middle line:90%
And that was considered wealth.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:20.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, what we consider
wealth is almost ludicrous.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:23.270 align:middle line:90%
We want so much stuff, you know.

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And the material, the way we've
been sold the material world

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:29.440 align:middle line:84%
has created some really
distorted lenses,

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.580 align:middle line:90%
in my opinion.

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.110 align:middle line:84%
And so people are
asking for what

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:33.953 align:middle line:84%
they see comparatively
other people have.

00:08:33.953 --> 00:08:35.620 align:middle line:84%
Is that what's going
to make them happy?

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:37.179 align:middle line:90%
The soul knows best.

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:39.610 align:middle line:84%
It's like, nah, that's
not the thing that's

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:43.299 align:middle line:84%
going to make you the
happiest right now, but let's

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:44.848 align:middle line:84%
work on it in a
little different way.

00:08:44.848 --> 00:08:46.390 align:middle line:84%
You know what I'm
saying, because you

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:48.057 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of clients
to deal with this.

00:08:48.057 --> 00:08:49.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: I do.

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're talking about
here is discovering who you are

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:55.330 align:middle line:90%
and how you create.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:58.390 align:middle line:84%
There's the major theme,
like the big question, what's

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:01.330 align:middle line:84%
my soul mission and my
purpose, and then there's

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:03.190 align:middle line:90%
all these subthemes.

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:06.940 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot of
distractions, as well.

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:10.930 align:middle line:84%
Like money issues may not even
be part of your soul mission

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:12.520 align:middle line:90%
and have nothing to do with it.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.353 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When you're
spending all your time

00:09:14.353 --> 00:09:16.205 align:middle line:84%
kind of begging your
gods for more money.

00:09:16.205 --> 00:09:17.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: So who do
we ask about that?

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:19.000 align:middle line:90%
We ask our higher guidance.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.980 align:middle line:84%
Is this something that is
germane to my sole purpose,

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:26.530 align:middle line:84%
or am I just distracting
myself and worrying myself

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:28.510 align:middle line:84%
about something that
isn't even purposeful?

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:30.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or just comparing
yourself to other people

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:32.662 align:middle line:84%
or what you've been sold
through media and social media

00:09:32.662 --> 00:09:34.387 align:middle line:90%
that you should attain.

00:09:34.387 --> 00:09:36.220 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that's
a really important one

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:37.540 align:middle line:90%
to start disconnecting from.

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps one of
the first questions,

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:41.860 align:middle line:90%
and that's where you start--

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:44.650 align:middle line:84%
what is germane to
my sole purpose?

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:46.330 align:middle line:90%
Where am I distracting myself?

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:48.460 align:middle line:84%
So let's do-- we're
going to start playing

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:49.960 align:middle line:90%
with some of the toys here.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:50.770 align:middle line:90%
I love them.

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:52.340 align:middle line:84%
You have three
different Oracle sets.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:53.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yes.

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:54.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, at
home you have--

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:55.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: 90.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 90 Oracle sets.

00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:00.400 align:middle line:84%
Now I've seen I've seen a
lot more of your Oracle sets,

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.950 align:middle line:84%
but you chose three of
them to work with today.

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And this it starts, right, with
the first question of which one

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.210 align:middle line:84%
do I even start
working with, right?

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:10.835 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Right, so
when you're trying

00:10:10.835 --> 00:10:14.160 align:middle line:84%
to get a message from
higher guidance, by far,

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.410 align:middle line:84%
the most useful
tool, in my opinion,

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:18.420 align:middle line:84%
is learning how
to pendulum dowse.

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:23.080 align:middle line:84%
All right, and so use your
pendulum to ask, first of all,

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.590 align:middle line:84%
do I have an Oracle
here that will give me

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:27.540 align:middle line:90%
a message about my question.

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And if your pendulum says
yes, then say, OK, which one?

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.030 align:middle line:90%
Be guided to the Oracle.

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:35.910 align:middle line:84%
Let's just say
it's this one here.

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:39.270 align:middle line:84%
When you pick the Oracle,
what we're trying to do

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:42.900 align:middle line:84%
is we're trying to get higher
guidance to come and talk

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.410 align:middle line:90%
to us with words.

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:47.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm not interested
really in what

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:52.110 align:middle line:84%
the Oracle is about and even
what the intended message is

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:53.100 align:middle line:90%
on the card.

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:55.720 align:middle line:84%
What I'm interested
in is the words.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:11:00.250 align:middle line:84%
So the way that I do it
is I shuffle the cards

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:01.200 align:middle line:90%
and lay them out.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't roll my hand across
and go, OK, which one?

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.060 align:middle line:90%
Where do I feel the vibe?

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:08.460 align:middle line:90%
Instead, I just pick a card.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.790 align:middle line:84%
First one, I'll dowse and
ask, is this the right card?

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:13.310 align:middle line:90%
Before even looking at it.

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:16.050 align:middle line:84%
If it says yes, I turn
it over, I don't even

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:19.710 align:middle line:84%
read it until I ask my
guidance through the pendulum,

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:23.370 align:middle line:84%
am I supposed to read this
or the message in the book.

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And if it says in
the book, then I

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.600 align:middle line:84%
don't even read that
until I get to which

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.740 align:middle line:90%
paragraph am I to read?

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:33.330 align:middle line:84%
And that way I narrow it
down to just the words.

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:35.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's an invitation
for higher guidance

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:38.190 align:middle line:84%
to come and sit beside you
and talk to you with words,

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:40.030 align:middle line:84%
and that's what we're
trying to get to.

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:42.240 align:middle line:84%
So that's how I
play with Oracles

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.430 align:middle line:84%
and get higher
guidance to talk to me.

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:46.920 align:middle line:84%
And again, you can
have any sources.

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.050 align:middle line:90%
It could be angel cards, Tarot.

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:51.030 align:middle line:84%
It could be like, I
have a couple of things

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:53.370 align:middle line:90%
here that I just love.

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:57.690 align:middle line:84%
This one here is a book of
flower essences, which has

00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:59.370 align:middle line:90%
to do with emotional issues.

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:01.860 align:middle line:84%
And so emotional
issues reveal a lot

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:05.640 align:middle line:84%
about what's going on
with any particular issue,

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.410 align:middle line:84%
but again, I'm
looking for the words.

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:09.150 align:middle line:10%
I love this book--

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:11.520 align:middle line:10%
"Messages From the
Body" tells you

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.860 align:middle line:10%
everything down to when
you break your fingernail,

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.327 align:middle line:10%
what does that mean?

00:12:15.327 --> 00:12:16.410 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:18.180 align:middle line:10%
>>SLATTER: Yeah,
and so what I do

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:22.290 align:middle line:10%
to find a message in this
huge book is use my pendulum.

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:26.010 align:middle line:90%
Is it page 1 to 400, 400 to 600?

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And narrow it down very
quickly to get the page.

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:31.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Odd, even and
all those questions, yeah.

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:32.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Turn to the page.

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:35.100 align:middle line:84%
Then again, I don't read
anything till I say, is it

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:36.570 align:middle line:90%
from here, here?

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:37.800 align:middle line:90%
Is it in this paragraph?

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And you finally narrow
it down to the paragraph

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:42.280 align:middle line:90%
that you are to read.

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.404 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that,
I'm telling you Regina,

00:12:45.404 --> 00:12:51.300 align:middle line:84%
the Oracles that come across
will oftentimes repeat verbatim

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:52.750 align:middle line:90%
what the question was.

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:54.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, do you
want to do an-- we

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:55.462 align:middle line:90%
weren't going to do this.

00:12:55.462 --> 00:12:57.083 align:middle line:84%
I have something
that will be fun.

00:12:57.083 --> 00:12:58.500 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't fun for
me, but it could

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:02.460 align:middle line:84%
be a fun little experiment in
how you would narrow this down.

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:03.360 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to do it?

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.550 align:middle line:84%
I have a question that
would come out of this book.

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:06.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: OK, let's try it.

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:07.837 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why have
I cut off three

00:13:07.837 --> 00:13:11.130 align:middle line:90%
fingers on my dominant hand?

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:12.570 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I've cut the pad off.

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:13.740 align:middle line:90%
I cut the whole finger off.

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:15.690 align:middle line:84%
Top of this finger
was chopped off.

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:19.590 align:middle line:84%
Serious damage to all three
fingers on my right hand.

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:20.702 align:middle line:90%
What in the world--

00:13:20.702 --> 00:13:21.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Is going on?

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:22.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --is going on?

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:26.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: OK, so I
love your question

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:29.100 align:middle line:84%
but there are a whole
lot of other questions

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.418 align:middle line:84%
I would ask before I would
ever go to that book.

00:13:31.418 --> 00:13:33.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how would
you go about dowsing that,

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:34.000 align:middle line:90%
for example?

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.570 align:middle line:84%
So people can start
playing at home.

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:37.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: In our
interview here later on,

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.483 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to reveal
a handy tool.

00:13:39.483 --> 00:13:41.775 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know we're going
to do that, which is cool.

00:13:41.775 --> 00:13:43.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: And
that will show you

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.710 align:middle line:84%
how I would begin asking
all those questions.

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:48.252 align:middle line:84%
So maybe we'll even
bring it back in.

00:13:48.252 --> 00:13:50.627 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's just bring
that because because it's also

00:13:50.627 --> 00:13:51.497 align:middle line:90%
related to the hand.

00:13:51.497 --> 00:13:52.297 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah.

00:13:52.297 --> 00:13:55.170 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Yeah, absolutely.

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, we've
talked about these pendulum

00:13:58.450 --> 00:13:59.250 align:middle line:90%
charts here.

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:01.500 align:middle line:10%
And they're amazing,
and I love this.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:04.170 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK, this one
is Dale Olson, right?

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:05.670 align:middle line:10%
Dale W. Olson.

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:07.860 align:middle line:84%
But what I've heard
from people recently

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:10.327 align:middle line:84%
is that he's done away
with the spiral binding.

00:14:10.327 --> 00:14:11.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Oh, darn.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:11.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And so if you can find it,
like, on eBay or something,

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:17.520 align:middle line:84%
try to find it before
they're all gone.

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:20.010 align:middle line:84%
Because people will go looking
for it after this interview.

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:22.560 align:middle line:90%
But this has everything in it.

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: It has
so much, even down

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:26.640 align:middle line:90%
to diagnosing your car engine.

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:30.510 align:middle line:84%
But the chart that I use so much
that it's memorized in my head

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:32.010 align:middle line:90%
is the percentage chart.

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And we've talked
about that before,

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:37.170 align:middle line:84%
how important it is to
avoid those yes/no questions

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:42.210 align:middle line:84%
and to actually base it on
how strongly something is

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:44.190 align:middle line:90%
either beneficial or negative.

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:48.117 align:middle line:84%
Like, for an example, if I were
in a grocery store or a health

00:14:48.117 --> 00:14:49.950 align:middle line:84%
food store and I said,
is there a supplement

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:53.430 align:middle line:84%
here that would be beneficial
for me on this shelf?

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:57.300 align:middle line:84%
Even if one supplement
was 1% beneficial,

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.890 align:middle line:90%
what can my guidance answer?

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:00.150 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you know?

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:02.610 align:middle line:84%
So that's not really the
question I want to ask.

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:05.260 align:middle line:84%
I want to ask is how beneficial
would one of these supplements

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:06.060 align:middle line:90%
be?

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:09.350 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking or something
that is at least 70%

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:10.910 align:middle line:90%
or above in benefit.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:17.230 align:middle line:84%
So that's the chart that
is burned in my mind.

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:18.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
incredibly useful.

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:22.270 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now, one of
the things, and you'll

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:25.120 align:middle line:84%
get some blowback on this one,
I think, with some of the people

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.050 align:middle line:90%
in the audience.

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:28.420 align:middle line:84%
Is you're saying
about half of all

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:32.830 align:middle line:84%
that happens to us in our
lives is actually accidental.

00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:34.750 align:middle line:84%
Because we tend to think
it's all for purpose.

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:38.440 align:middle line:84%
Each thing that happens,
it's our soul speaking to us.

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.780 align:middle line:84%
You're saying, no,
maybe only half.

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:44.140 align:middle line:84%
So tell us how you came
to that, and why you

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:45.460 align:middle line:90%
believe that to be the case.

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:48.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: That actually
came from a client

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:51.040 align:middle line:84%
and from this book,
"Messages From the Body."

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.320 align:middle line:84%
And it was years
ago, I had a client

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:56.500 align:middle line:84%
that came in and had gone
through a very traumatic event.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.210 align:middle line:90%
She had been raped.

00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:03.810 align:middle line:84%
She had spent years
afterwards trying to uncover

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:05.710 align:middle line:90%
why that had happened to her.

00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:09.430 align:middle line:84%
She felt, at some
level, that she--

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:10.470 align:middle line:90%
it was her fault.

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:12.762 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She deserved it,
she karmically or something.

00:16:12.762 --> 00:16:13.562 align:middle line:90%
It was all on her.

00:16:13.562 --> 00:16:15.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: She attracted
it on some level, you know?

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:19.710 align:middle line:84%
And that in some way
this was her creation

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:22.020 align:middle line:84%
and that if she
didn't figure it out,

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:25.140 align:middle line:84%
then she would run
the risk of something

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:27.130 align:middle line:90%
like that happening again.

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And so she wanted to
know why did I attract

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:32.350 align:middle line:90%
that event into my life?

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:36.330 align:middle line:84%
So in this case, when
I asked higher guidance

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:37.780 align:middle line:90%
where can we get a clue?

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:40.380 align:middle line:84%
I was taken to this book,
"Messages From the Body."

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:42.640 align:middle line:90%
And there is a section on rape.

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And there's several
paragraphs in there.

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:47.980 align:middle line:84%
And the paragraphs say, well,
it could be this reason.

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:49.120 align:middle line:90%
It could be this reason.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:49.950 align:middle line:90%
It could mean this.

00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:51.240 align:middle line:90%
It could mean that.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:55.890 align:middle line:84%
And the very last paragraph
was the one that I was to read.

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:57.250 align:middle line:90%
And it was startling.

00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:58.890 align:middle line:90%
It says stuff happens.

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:00.550 align:middle line:90%
It actually didn't say stuff--

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:01.350 align:middle line:90%
it says--

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:02.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Things happen.

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:04.012 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Yeah, things
happen, and then it

00:17:04.012 --> 00:17:07.440 align:middle line:84%
talked about the
randomness of the universe.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:12.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, for her, this
was a huge relief.

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:14.720 align:middle line:84%
it was comforting to
just think that maybe I

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:18.800 align:middle line:84%
was just in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And I can let this go, and there
wasn't any more meaning to it.

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:26.230 align:middle line:90%
And it was a huge relief.

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:29.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, but for me, it
started a whole line

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:33.832 align:middle line:84%
of questioning with
my higher guidance.

00:17:33.832 --> 00:17:36.190 align:middle line:90%
I said, I don't understand.

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:38.260 align:middle line:84%
I thought everything
has meaning.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:42.040 align:middle line:84%
I thought there
are no accidents.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:45.250 align:middle line:84%
So can you explain to
me this whole thing

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:47.270 align:middle line:90%
about the randomness?

00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:49.160 align:middle line:84%
And then what higher
guidance explained

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:54.980 align:middle line:84%
is something actually that is
logical and that science knows.

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:58.130 align:middle line:84%
The whole universe exists
on this very fine line

00:17:58.130 --> 00:17:59.990 align:middle line:90%
between chaos and order.

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And we know this, and
we live in duality.

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And you cannot have a
one-sided coin, right?

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:11.420 align:middle line:84%
So if you are going to
have order and meaning,

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:15.602 align:middle line:84%
then you are also going to
have complete randomness.

00:18:15.602 --> 00:18:17.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That is
true, Jean, and I

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:20.060 align:middle line:84%
mean, I've thought about
this a fair amount as well.

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:23.690 align:middle line:84%
And I always tend to think
that there tends to be order.

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:26.840 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is when you
look at individual situations

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.820 align:middle line:90%
and people say, I don't get it.

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:31.220 align:middle line:84%
This psychic told me
this was going to happen.

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:33.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm the one arguing,
wait a minute.

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:35.990 align:middle line:84%
Did it involve another
human being or more than one

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:37.370 align:middle line:90%
other human being?

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:40.430 align:middle line:84%
So they're dealing with all
of their impulses, everything

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:42.980 align:middle line:84%
that's guiding them,
everything they're ignoring

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:44.960 align:middle line:84%
and what's happening
to their lives.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And you're dependent
on that for an outcome?

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:50.510 align:middle line:84%
We can-- it's hard
to even to predict

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:54.202 align:middle line:84%
your own kind of
future, so to speak,

00:18:54.202 --> 00:18:55.910 align:middle line:84%
even if it doesn't
involve another human,

00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:58.220 align:middle line:84%
even with will and
desire and everything.

00:18:58.220 --> 00:18:59.990 align:middle line:84%
So when you put
all these elements

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:01.550 align:middle line:84%
and then you put
the factor of time

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:07.490 align:middle line:84%
into it and the factor of our
own lack of self-knowledge,

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:10.790 align:middle line:84%
right, which we often
have, how could I

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:15.020 align:middle line:84%
have ever thought that
this was a world that

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:18.230 align:middle line:90%
was based on coherence?

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:19.370 align:middle line:90%
It's not coherent.

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:22.430 align:middle line:84%
It can have coherence, and you
can create it to an extent.

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:25.090 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of it is incoherent
or chaotic, as you say.

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:26.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: That's right.

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And so you're walking
down the sidewalk,

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:29.960 align:middle line:84%
and you see a
feather, and you think

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:34.070 align:middle line:84%
to yourself, that's my deceased
grandmother speaking to me.

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it might
be, and sometimes it

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.882 align:middle line:90%
might just be a feather.

00:19:38.882 --> 00:19:40.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
and you know what?

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:41.548 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad you brought that up.

00:19:41.548 --> 00:19:44.750 align:middle line:84%
I think it's important to know,
and that freeing part, too.

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:49.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's not to say that
is to absolve ourselves

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:52.220 align:middle line:84%
of any kind of karmic
kind of challenge

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:54.110 align:middle line:84%
we may have brought
forward, because you

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:57.140 align:middle line:84%
know, those things we know
through our own feelings

00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:59.120 align:middle line:84%
and perceptions,
whether or not there's

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:02.120 align:middle line:84%
a buzz around a
particular area of life.

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:06.560 align:middle line:84%
So I think that looking at it
in the way you bring forward

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:10.700 align:middle line:84%
is more balanced it's an
important point to bring up.

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:12.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Well, I
think that that's

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:16.970 align:middle line:84%
why we need access to
higher guidance, because we

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:20.840 align:middle line:84%
can ask higher guidance is
there a meaning to this event?

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.780 align:middle line:90%
Is it germane to my life's path?

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And it surprises me sometimes
when I ask that question,

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.920 align:middle line:84%
because some of the most
seemingly inconsequential

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:34.190 align:middle line:84%
things can, oftentimes,
have meaning.

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:35.540 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes they don't.

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:40.190 align:middle line:10%
I had a client one time
that said that he wanted

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:44.970 align:middle line:10%
to give his employee a bonus.

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted to
ask higher guidance

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:47.950 align:middle line:90%
if this was a good idea or not.

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:49.700 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
this is a silly thing

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:51.090 align:middle line:90%
to ask higher guidance about.

00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:52.172 align:middle line:90%
I mean, give him a bonus.

00:20:52.172 --> 00:20:53.130 align:middle line:90%
Don't give him a bonus.

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:53.930 align:middle line:90%
Who cares?

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:56.405 align:middle line:84%
You know, higher guidance
isn't going to have an opinion.

00:20:56.405 --> 00:20:57.780 align:middle line:84%
But when I asked,
higher guidance

00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:00.000 align:middle line:90%
did, indeed, have an opinion.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And the answer was no,
don't give him the bonus.

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:07.020 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't really know
why, but months later,

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:09.787 align:middle line:84%
what he found out was that
the employee was actually

00:21:09.787 --> 00:21:10.870 align:middle line:90%
embezzling money from him.

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:12.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:13.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:18.330 align:middle line:84%
This was kind of a message
to him, to the boss,

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:24.640 align:middle line:84%
to draw some boundaries on
his trusting and his openness

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:25.440 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:30.000 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, sometimes what
seems to be inconsequential

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.210 align:middle line:90%
can actually have a meaning.

00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:32.160 align:middle line:90%
So who knows?

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:33.833 align:middle line:90%
Your higher guidance knows.

00:21:33.833 --> 00:21:36.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But one thing
higher guidance doesn't know

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.570 align:middle line:84%
and nobody knows, because
of the very factor

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:41.700 align:middle line:84%
I brought up earlier, which
is when you're working

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:43.740 align:middle line:84%
in a dynamic that
has other people

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:47.250 align:middle line:84%
and their whole soul
trajectory, everything going on

00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:49.980 align:middle line:84%
in their lives, is
the timing of things.

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:51.540 align:middle line:90%
That is the one--

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:55.320 align:middle line:84%
and so many people ask that
very question, when am I going

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:56.930 align:middle line:90%
to meet, when am I going to do?

00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:58.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, that's
one thing higher guidance

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:01.440 align:middle line:84%
can't answer because it's
a living dynamic that's

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:02.970 align:middle line:90%
operating every second.

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:05.490 align:middle line:84%
One person pulls
out of the dynamic,

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:06.990 align:middle line:84%
and boom, the whole
thing is kind of

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:08.490 align:middle line:90%
scuttled for the time being.

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:10.960 align:middle line:84%
It may take more
time to recover.

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:15.180 align:middle line:84%
So I think this whole
notion of just learning, A,

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:16.710 align:middle line:90%
to be patient with life.

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:19.410 align:middle line:90%
It will come to us.

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:21.060 align:middle line:90%
It will show itself.

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:23.748 align:middle line:84%
And not try to ask your guidance
and pressure them on when.

00:22:23.748 --> 00:22:26.040 align:middle line:84%
That's just not going to
work, because they don't know.

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:27.498 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: I would
agree with that.

00:22:27.498 --> 00:22:30.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah I'm
glad, because time

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:31.950 align:middle line:84%
seems to be the
enemy of humanity

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:34.710 align:middle line:84%
in this time-space
continuum we're in.

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And if we could just
relax a little bit

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:38.850 align:middle line:84%
and know just because it
doesn't happen, quote, on time,

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:40.470 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean it's
not going to happen.

00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:41.845 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Yeah,
it's like what's

00:22:41.845 --> 00:22:43.012 align:middle line:90%
the definition of "soon?"

00:22:43.012 --> 00:22:44.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, what is soon?

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:47.820 align:middle line:84%
In our guides', in our
higher selves' perspective,

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:50.030 align:middle line:90%
it could be 1,000 years.

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:50.830 align:middle line:90%
Soon.

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:51.630 align:middle line:90%
Soon.

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:53.380 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I just
wanted to bring that up.

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:55.213 align:middle line:84%
Don't be so hard on
ourselves and our guides

00:22:55.213 --> 00:22:56.160 align:middle line:90%
when it comes to time.

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:57.810 align:middle line:84%
OK, one thing we're
going to do here

00:22:57.810 --> 00:22:59.610 align:middle line:84%
today is a new
mode of divination

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:02.820 align:middle line:84%
that you haven't shown us before
and you mentioned it a bit ago.

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:04.560 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with
fingers, and I want

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:05.820 align:middle line:90%
to make sure we get this in.

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:08.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: OK, so
in past interviews,

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:12.190 align:middle line:84%
we've talked about how
to ask good questions.

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:14.760 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about how to
interpret the messages you

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:15.780 align:middle line:90%
get from guidance.

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:17.680 align:middle line:84%
This is going to be a
little bit different.

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:22.890 align:middle line:10%
This is going to be a
handy tool to allow higher

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:26.670 align:middle line:10%
guidance to take you by
the hand and lead you

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:28.680 align:middle line:10%
on a path of inquiry.

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:31.890 align:middle line:84%
So what I mean by
that is that there

00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:33.630 align:middle line:84%
are a whole lot of
questions you can

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:35.460 align:middle line:90%
ask about everything, right?

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:38.640 align:middle line:84%
But you want higher
guidance actually leading

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:43.470 align:middle line:84%
the questioning so that
you get to the message

00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:45.888 align:middle line:84%
that higher guidance is
wanting to give to you.

00:23:45.888 --> 00:23:47.430 align:middle line:84%
So I'll go through
them real quickly,

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:51.720 align:middle line:84%
and then we will go back
and give examples about it.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.820 align:middle line:90%
So the first one is your thumb.

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:57.030 align:middle line:84%
So that is the
broadest finger, right?

00:23:57.030 --> 00:24:01.050 align:middle line:84%
So start with the broadest
question possible, all right?

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:02.010 align:middle line:90%
Simple enough.

00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:03.510 align:middle line:90%
Second, your pointer finger--

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:06.270 align:middle line:84%
get pointed in the
right direction.

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:08.430 align:middle line:90%
Third-- it's your middle finger.

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:10.960 align:middle line:84%
So it can go this way or that
way, right in the middle.

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:14.890 align:middle line:84%
So this is a way to ask it in a
positive and in a negative way,

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:16.710 align:middle line:90%
and we'll go over that in a bit.

00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:19.583 align:middle line:84%
Your ring finger is your
relationship finger.

00:24:19.583 --> 00:24:21.000 align:middle line:84%
This is where we
want to make sure

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.480 align:middle line:84%
that we have understood what
higher guidance has had to say.

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And then the little finger,
is there any little bit

00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:29.640 align:middle line:90%
more information that I need?

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:32.490 align:middle line:84%
All right, so
here's how it works.

00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:35.130 align:middle line:84%
Starting with the
broadest question--

00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:37.830 align:middle line:84%
one day I was watching
my son, and he

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:42.570 align:middle line:84%
was going through a list on
Amazon of all these books

00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:47.790 align:middle line:84%
that he had set aside
for the wish list area.

00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:51.570 align:middle line:84%
And he was using his pendulum
to dowse which of these books

00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:53.580 align:middle line:90%
he should go ahead and buy now.

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:55.620 align:middle line:84%
And he kept getting
no, no, no, no, no.

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:58.950 align:middle line:84%
And I knew the list was long,
and I kept hearing the no.

00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And I said, wait a
minute, wait a minute.

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:01.620 align:middle line:90%
Pull back.

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:03.420 align:middle line:84%
You didn't ask the
broader question.

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:05.760 align:middle line:84%
The broader question
is, is there

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:09.000 align:middle line:84%
a book on this list that
your guidance wants you--

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.910 align:middle line:84%
so it's like pulling back and
starting with the broadest

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:13.050 align:middle line:90%
question.

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:14.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So for
example, if someone

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:17.070 align:middle line:84%
says they're having
challenges or concerns

00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:20.430 align:middle line:84%
or have anxiety
around relationships,

00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:22.310 align:middle line:84%
so how would you
pose the question?

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:24.060 align:middle line:84%
Because there will be
people watching this

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:25.710 align:middle line:84%
that have that
issue, for example.

00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:28.770 align:middle line:84%
How would you pose the
question in the broadest sense,

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:30.962 align:middle line:84%
before you start drilling
down on your relationship?

00:25:30.962 --> 00:25:32.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: The first
question I would ask

00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:34.503 align:middle line:84%
is, is there a message
higher guidance wants

00:25:34.503 --> 00:25:36.030 align:middle line:90%
to give me about this?

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:38.640 align:middle line:84%
Because it might not
even be something

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:40.800 align:middle line:84%
that guidance wants to
give you advice about.

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:44.030 align:middle line:84%
So that would be the broadest
question to start with, yeah.

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And you know, higher
guidance is really good.

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:50.330 align:middle line:84%
As I've done this
through the years,

00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:52.790 align:middle line:84%
higher guidance has been
really good at getting

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:57.740 align:middle line:84%
to what is the most important
question to focus in on.

00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:02.510 align:middle line:84%
One of my clients was calling
because she was considering

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:05.790 align:middle line:90%
restructuring her business.

00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:08.493 align:middle line:84%
She went on and on for
at least 10 minutes,

00:26:08.493 --> 00:26:10.410 align:middle line:84%
going through all the
different possibilities.

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:13.520 align:middle line:84%
What do I do with these new
partners that are coming in?

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.740 align:middle line:84%
What do I do with the
employees that I have?

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:17.160 align:middle line:84%
How do I structure
this business?

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:18.160 align:middle line:90%
What are the legalities?

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.060 align:middle line:84%
Do I even want to do
this, blah, blah, blah?

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:21.620 align:middle line:90%
What if I want to retire?

00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:23.150 align:middle line:90%
It just went on and on and on.

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:25.100 align:middle line:90%
And I said, let's just stop.

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And we asked the big
question, first of all.

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:30.110 align:middle line:84%
Does guidance want to give
you information on this?

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:31.340 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:36.680 align:middle line:84%
All right, guidance said
pull way back, and zoom out

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:39.350 align:middle line:90%
and answer two questions first.

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And if you can answer
these two questions,

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:45.470 align:middle line:84%
everything else that you want
to know will fit into this.

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And the two questions
that came up I thought

00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:49.520 align:middle line:84%
were absolutely
brilliant, and I think

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:53.670 align:middle line:84%
they're worthy to share
for anybody to ask.

00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And the two questions
were, what makes me happy,

00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:02.010 align:middle line:84%
and how do I want
to spend my time?

00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:05.910 align:middle line:84%
So we use divination tools
to answer those questions.

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:07.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was she at all
in alignment with what

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:09.240 align:middle line:90%
the answers to those questions.

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Well, she had
to get the answer first.

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And so we used the divination
tools, and the answer

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.320 align:middle line:90%
to what makes me happy--

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:19.710 align:middle line:84%
the card that came
up was called Spark.

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And it talked about
that spark of life,

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:25.080 align:middle line:84%
when you feel engaged
and interested

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.510 align:middle line:84%
and involved in
participating in life.

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:29.970 align:middle line:84%
The opposite of that
would be numbed out

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:33.670 align:middle line:90%
and zoning out and escaping.

00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:35.950 align:middle line:84%
She did want that
feeling and she

00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:40.640 align:middle line:84%
realized that she wasn't
getting it at work anymore,

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:41.840 align:middle line:90%
had lost it.

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:45.050 align:middle line:84%
And what was giving
her this spark

00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:47.990 align:middle line:84%
was spending time
with her grandkids

00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:50.610 align:middle line:84%
and her family
and her community,

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:52.790 align:middle line:84%
and that's what was
giving her the spark.

00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And so now, she's looking
at all those questions

00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:58.230 align:middle line:84%
she had about restructuring
her business and saying,

00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:59.030 align:middle line:90%
wait a minute.

00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:01.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't actually even
want to be there.

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:04.370 align:middle line:84%
Then the second question, how
do you want to spend your time?

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:08.640 align:middle line:84%
Again, we used divination tools
to get the answer for that.

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And the answer was to have
freedom of choice with what she

00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:15.410 align:middle line:90%
does with their time.

00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:20.630 align:middle line:84%
How many business owners do you
know of who started a business

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:22.190 align:middle line:90%
they were crazy about it.

00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:24.650 align:middle line:84%
They had so much
passion for it, and then

00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:26.900 align:middle line:84%
the business took on
a life of its own,

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:29.050 align:middle line:84%
and they became a
slave to it right.

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:30.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, typical.

00:28:30.050 --> 00:28:32.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Yeah, and they had
no choice, no freedom of time,

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:35.750 align:middle line:84%
because they were slave
to their own creation.

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And that is actually what
had happened for her.

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:40.970 align:middle line:84%
So through this process,
by understanding

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:43.190 align:middle line:84%
the two big questions she
needed to ask herself--

00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:45.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She had to
say, who's the boss here?

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Who's the boss,
that business or me?

00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:51.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: She realized that
she actually wanted to retire.

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:53.420 align:middle line:84%
So that's-- it
changed everything.

00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:54.930 align:middle line:90%
It changed all the focus.

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:58.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Interesting, but see,
that's where the courage really

00:28:58.130 --> 00:28:58.970 align:middle line:90%
comes in.

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:01.220 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to do
this, you should not

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:04.510 align:middle line:90%
do it as a plaything.

00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:07.750 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you're going
to really get into dowsing

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:09.730 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to
really use it properly,

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:14.170 align:middle line:84%
you need to have the courage
to stand up to the answers.

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:15.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Yeah
and I will also--

00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:17.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
still have choice.

00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:19.990 align:middle line:84%
You can say, OK, I hear you,
but I'm not going to do it.

00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:21.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Right,
but I would also

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:24.320 align:middle line:84%
say that you'll save
yourself a lot of heartache.

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:25.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Boy, yes, it's true.

00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:26.987 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: A lot
of time and a lot

00:29:26.987 --> 00:29:30.010 align:middle line:84%
of heartache, a lot of money
if you go with higher guidance.

00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:32.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely, but
I watch people suffer all

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:36.370 align:middle line:84%
the time, because they'll want
an answer that's going to make

00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:37.210 align:middle line:90%
things--

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:39.280 align:middle line:84%
put a Band-Aid on it,
make it easier for them

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:40.930 align:middle line:84%
without making
the big decisions.

00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And taking, like your friend,
the big step, which is,

00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:45.200 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to do this anymore.

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And that has
implications, you know?

00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:49.840 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm just
saying, I think we

00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:52.540 align:middle line:84%
have to have a certain amount
of reverence and respect

00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:55.300 align:middle line:84%
if we're going to
genuinely inquire.

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't
agree with you more.

00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:59.020 align:middle line:84%
By following higher
guidance, life

00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:01.787 align:middle line:84%
is just so much more
beautiful and fulfilling.

00:30:01.787 --> 00:30:02.620 align:middle line:90%
There's no question.

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:04.162 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Not to
say that you aren't

00:30:04.162 --> 00:30:06.360 align:middle line:84%
going to face
challenges, because you

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:07.610 align:middle line:90%
want to do your weightlifting.

00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:08.743 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:30:08.743 --> 00:30:10.910 align:middle line:84%
OK, now so we've talked
about the broadest question.

00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:12.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: The
broad-- that actually

00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:14.650 align:middle line:84%
was getting pointed in
the right direction,

00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:17.020 align:middle line:84%
because when you start with
that broad question, what

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:18.100 align:middle line:90%
makes me happy?

00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:20.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's 101 things
that make me happy.

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:22.460 align:middle line:84%
A warm cup of coffee in
the morning makes me happy,

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:23.290 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:26.057 align:middle line:84%
But that's really not the
answer we're looking for, right?

00:30:26.057 --> 00:30:28.640 align:middle line:84%
Here, so now you've got to get
pointed in the right direction.

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:32.635 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we use divination
tools to say, OK, well

00:30:32.635 --> 00:30:35.380 align:middle line:84%
what kind of happiness
are we talking about here?

00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:37.900 align:middle line:84%
Kind of get me pointed
in the right direction,

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:41.980 align:middle line:84%
because otherwise, we could
go off in 100 different ways,

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:42.820 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:44.980 align:middle line:84%
And same with how do I
want to spend my time?

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:48.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, I want to spend my time
taking naps on the couch,

00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:50.360 align:middle line:90%
but that's not the answer.

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.930 align:middle line:84%
So by getting pointed
in the right direction

00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:58.450 align:middle line:84%
to what question to ask,
use your divination tools

00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:00.490 align:middle line:90%
to get to answer that.

00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:02.650 align:middle line:84%
Then we come to
the middle finger,

00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:07.840 align:middle line:84%
which is a excellent way
of uncovering assumptions.

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:09.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about that.

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:11.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: It's a
way of verifying

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:17.740 align:middle line:84%
how well do you understand what
you think you're being told.

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:19.720 align:middle line:84%
So I'll give you
just an obvious one.

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:23.350 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you're asking, do
I need to eliminate sugars

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:26.080 align:middle line:84%
in order to control
my blood sugar?

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:27.490 align:middle line:90%
And you get a yes.

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:31.880 align:middle line:84%
All right, now ask
it in the negative.

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:35.990 align:middle line:84%
Is it true that I don't
need to eliminate sugars

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:37.460 align:middle line:90%
to control my blood sugar?

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:39.900 align:middle line:84%
So you've asked it in the
positive and the negative.

00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And if the first answer is
actually the full answer,

00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:46.520 align:middle line:90%
you'll get no, that's not true.

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:50.170 align:middle line:84%
But if you get a second
yes, it is revealing to you

00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:52.060 align:middle line:84%
you've made an
assumption and probably

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:53.860 align:middle line:90%
an assumption about sugars.

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:56.260 align:middle line:84%
And so then you would
do some more questioning

00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:58.240 align:middle line:84%
and maybe you'd
find out that, oh,

00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:01.300 align:middle line:84%
all I have to really eliminate
is high fructose corn

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:03.130 align:middle line:90%
syrup, right?

00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And fruit sugars
are fine, you know?

00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:07.420 align:middle line:84%
So it would be
something like that.

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:12.220 align:middle line:84%
My daughter did this after she
was graduating from college.

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:14.620 align:middle line:84%
She had known since
she was in high school

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:16.810 align:middle line:84%
that she had wanted
to be a healer.

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And we had actually pulled
some life purpose cards,

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:21.310 align:middle line:84%
and sure enough,
it all came back

00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:23.020 align:middle line:90%
that she was to be a doctor.

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
she focused on when

00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:27.130 align:middle line:84%
she was in college--
biology and then

00:32:27.130 --> 00:32:29.440 align:middle line:84%
she was going to go
on to med school.

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:34.390 align:middle line:84%
But when that time came, then
we used that middle finger

00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:36.940 align:middle line:84%
to verify, all right, do we
understand this correctly,

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:39.230 align:middle line:84%
or are we making
an assumption here?

00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:40.990 align:middle line:84%
So we asked, is it
true that you are

00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:43.100 align:middle line:90%
to go on to become a doctor.

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:44.930 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:50.030 align:middle line:84%
Is it true that you are not
to go on to become a doctor,

00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:52.190 align:middle line:90%
and we also got yes.

00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:55.370 align:middle line:90%
So that gave us an indication.

00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:59.150 align:middle line:84%
We had a major assumption
here about what kind of doctor

00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:00.230 align:middle line:90%
she was going to be.

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:03.680 align:middle line:84%
She was assuming she was
going to become a med doctor,

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:06.110 align:middle line:84%
but what guidance
finally revealed to her

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:10.240 align:middle line:84%
is no, you just need to get your
doctorate in the healing arts.

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:11.865 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And she's
in research and has

00:33:11.865 --> 00:33:13.730 align:middle line:90%
an amazing brain for research.

00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:17.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Yes, and so once
that was revealed to her,

00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:19.463 align:middle line:90%
she could feel the truth of it.

00:33:19.463 --> 00:33:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what prompted
the question in the first place

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:23.505 align:middle line:84%
is because she
was, like, feeling

00:33:23.505 --> 00:33:27.080 align:middle line:84%
some resistance about going
on to med school and wanted--

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:30.110 align:middle line:84%
but guidance told me I'm
to be a doctor you know?

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:34.070 align:middle line:84%
So by asking it in the
positive and in the negative,

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:36.985 align:middle line:84%
we were able to reveal that
assumption that was there.

00:33:36.985 --> 00:33:38.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
that's important,

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:41.330 align:middle line:84%
because we're all prepackaged
with assumptions and filters.

00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:42.130 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:42.130 --> 00:33:42.462 align:middle line:90%


00:33:42.462 --> 00:33:44.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: All right,
now relationship finger--

00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:48.350 align:middle line:84%
what's the most important
thing in a relationship?

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:50.480 align:middle line:84%
The most important thing
in any relationship

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:53.660 align:middle line:84%
is that you actually
understand each other.

00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:58.550 align:middle line:84%
Like, when you are being told
something by your partner,

00:33:58.550 --> 00:34:01.470 align:middle line:84%
you want to make sure did
I understand you correctly?

00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:03.290 align:middle line:90%
Is this how you feel about it?

00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:06.890 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise, you can be
operating on misconceptions,

00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:07.790 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:10.560 align:middle line:84%
So here's your higher guidance
explaining something to you.

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:13.250 align:middle line:84%
You want to make sure that
you've understood this.

00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:16.556 align:middle line:84%
Well, with my client
that wanted to,

00:34:16.556 --> 00:34:18.139 align:middle line:84%
now she figured out
she actually wants

00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:22.780 align:middle line:84%
to retire and give
up her business,

00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:24.050 align:middle line:90%
a fear came up in her.

00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:26.330 align:middle line:90%
She said, oh, but wait a minute.

00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:29.360 align:middle line:90%
What if I end up being bored.

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:31.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm a couch potato.

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:34.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm sitting, you know, watching
one Netflix show after another,

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:36.905 align:middle line:84%
eating bonbons,
and gain 30 pounds.

00:34:36.905 --> 00:34:38.280 align:middle line:90%
It would be horrifying.

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:40.380 align:middle line:90%
I don't want that to happen.

00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:44.179 align:middle line:84%
And so we drew a card to
answer that question for her,

00:34:44.179 --> 00:34:48.409 align:middle line:84%
and the card said very sweetly,
be confident in who you are.

00:34:48.409 --> 00:34:51.010 align:middle line:84%
And we thought to ourselves,
what a great message.

00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:53.603 align:middle line:84%
It's just saying,
hey, you know you.

00:34:53.603 --> 00:34:54.770 align:middle line:90%
You're not going to do that.

00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:56.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're not going to
be out of control and someone

00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:56.750 align:middle line:90%
else.

00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:57.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: You're not
going to be out of control.

00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:58.920 align:middle line:90%
You're going to be fine.

00:34:58.920 --> 00:34:59.880 align:middle line:90%
Be confident in that.

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And we thought it
was a great message.

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:04.730 align:middle line:84%
So then I asked, how well,
on a scale of 1 to 100

00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:07.580 align:middle line:84%
do we understand the
message of that card.

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:09.990 align:middle line:90%
0%.

00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:12.210 align:middle line:90%
We didn't get it at all.

00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:14.630 align:middle line:84%
And so and because
it was zero, I

00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:16.490 align:middle line:90%
knew it was just the opposite.

00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:21.920 align:middle line:84%
The message to her was to be
comfortable in the discovery

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:25.790 align:middle line:84%
of who you are in this
phase of your life.

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:28.970 align:middle line:90%
And you know, think about it.

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:34.700 align:middle line:84%
That's what ends up happening
to high-powered executives who

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:35.720 align:middle line:90%
retire.

00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:38.840 align:middle line:90%
They lose their identity, right?

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:41.420 align:middle line:84%
And I remember this
happened to my father.

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:43.850 align:middle line:84%
When he retired, that was
the day he began to die.

00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And it was just because he
just had lost his identity.

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:51.440 align:middle line:84%
When you are boxed
in with an identity

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:54.020 align:middle line:84%
that you used to have in
that phase of your life

00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:58.100 align:middle line:84%
and you try to bring it now
to this phase of retirement,

00:35:58.100 --> 00:35:59.910 align:middle line:90%
it's not going to work.

00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:01.610 align:middle line:84%
And so what guidance
was saying was

00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:04.280 align:middle line:84%
be comfortable with
the discovery of who

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:06.350 align:middle line:84%
you are in every
phase of your life

00:36:06.350 --> 00:36:08.762 align:middle line:84%
and joyfully go
about that journey.

00:36:08.762 --> 00:36:10.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And not have to
have it prepackaged and all

00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:12.553 align:middle line:84%
the blanks filled
in before you start.

00:36:12.553 --> 00:36:15.830 align:middle line:84%
Because I think for some of the
women watching this show right

00:36:15.830 --> 00:36:19.520 align:middle line:84%
now, you're going to be talking
about, say, empty nester

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:20.780 align:middle line:90%
syndrome.

00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:21.590 align:middle line:90%
Like, oh, my God.

00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:22.550 align:middle line:90%
I need to--

00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:24.080 align:middle line:90%
I need to get back to work.

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:26.750 align:middle line:84%
I have to, maybe, develop
a second phase career.

00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:28.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Another
great example, that is.

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
yeah and where you

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:31.790 align:middle line:84%
might take some
time for reflection

00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:34.100 align:middle line:84%
and see what the
soul really desires

00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:37.535 align:middle line:84%
to start just exploring, a
wonderful time for exploration.

00:36:37.535 --> 00:36:39.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Be in the discovery.

00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:39.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So let's talk about--

00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:40.370 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Little finger.

00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:41.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --baby finger.

00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:43.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Then once
you've gotten this--

00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:45.290 align:middle line:84%
so here's your higher
guidance has led you

00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:48.225 align:middle line:84%
through this inquiry
here so that you

00:36:48.225 --> 00:36:50.100 align:middle line:84%
can get to the message,
Now, you want to say,

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:53.360 align:middle line:84%
OK, is there anything more
I need to know, you know?

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:56.790 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, we
get the whole puzzle.

00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:58.910 align:middle line:84%
You know, we get
the big picture.

00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:01.670 align:middle line:84%
We get the whole thing, right
then and there, and it's great,

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:03.440 align:middle line:90%
and we're off.

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:05.060 align:middle line:90%
We can be on our way.

00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And other times, we've only
gotten a piece of the puzzle.

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:09.668 align:middle line:84%
And guidance says, no,
there's more you need to know.

00:37:09.668 --> 00:37:11.315 align:middle line:84%
And so go back in
and start again

00:37:11.315 --> 00:37:13.940 align:middle line:84%
with the broadest question, and
then go through the whole thing

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:15.050 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And if you feel frustrated,
like, I'm just not getting it.

00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:20.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm just, like, I
can't figure this out.

00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:23.630 align:middle line:90%


00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:26.790 align:middle line:84%
Guidance has given me messages,
but I still don't get it.

00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:30.680 align:middle line:84%
Um, walk away, and let
it marinate for a while.

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:32.450 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you
how many times that

00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:35.540 align:middle line:84%
I've done this where I've asked
higher guidance something.

00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:38.810 align:middle line:84%
I write down verbatim
what the message is.

00:37:38.810 --> 00:37:42.830 align:middle line:84%
And I'll look at it, scratching
my head, saying I don't get it.

00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:44.920 align:middle line:90%
It makes no sense to me.

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And if I get to that place, then
I do, I go do something else.

00:37:48.730 --> 00:37:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And it may be a
few minutes later.

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:54.030 align:middle line:84%
It might be a few hours later
or days or months later,

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:56.610 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden, it's
like a light bulb goes off.

00:37:56.610 --> 00:37:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And you get it, and you
go back and you read it.

00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And you go, how come
I didn't see that?

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:02.220 align:middle line:90%
It was so obvious.

00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right and
perhaps, on some level,

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:07.510 align:middle line:84%
you weren't ready to
see that at that time.

00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And so certainly the
big one has always

00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:12.780 align:middle line:84%
been when people
are doing the does

00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:16.050 align:middle line:84%
he love me, love me not, you
know, picking the daisy thing,

00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:18.720 align:middle line:84%
is that we're
loaded with desire.

00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:22.380 align:middle line:84%
We're loaded with these
filters and assumptions,

00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:26.120 align:middle line:90%
and people can trick themselves.

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:28.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
what's really beautiful,

00:38:28.290 --> 00:38:30.930 align:middle line:84%
well, A, I know how
vigilant you are about this.

00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:33.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you
teach in your courses is

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.880 align:middle line:84%
how to do this
responsibly, vigilantly,

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:37.930 align:middle line:84%
so that you can't
lie to yourself.

00:38:37.930 --> 00:38:40.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I think
the middle finger seems

00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:43.830 align:middle line:84%
to really come in, in this part
of the process of evaluation.

00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:46.710 align:middle line:84%
Is asking it from the
positive and the negative

00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:50.160 align:middle line:84%
and seeing where there's
not congruence, right?

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And so in short, for people
who are going to dabble but not

00:38:54.750 --> 00:39:00.820 align:middle line:84%
go as seriously into it because
of lack of patience or will,

00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:05.540 align:middle line:84%
what would you say to the
average person dowsing

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:08.870 align:middle line:84%
to work your way around
those filters of deception,

00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:11.330 align:middle line:84%
where you're just telling
yourself what you want to hear?

00:39:11.330 --> 00:39:15.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Great,
I have, I think,

00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:18.290 align:middle line:84%
a very useful
suggestion for this.

00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:22.280 align:middle line:10%
So one, it is something that
you do have to practice.

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:28.340 align:middle line:84%
But what I say is that prior
to doing your devinations

00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:30.440 align:middle line:84%
or asking questions,
do a little meditation.

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:33.140 align:middle line:84%
Get yourself
centered and imagine

00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:37.520 align:middle line:84%
seeing a clear channel being
created for higher guidance

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:39.410 align:middle line:84%
to come and speak
to you directly.

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:43.010 align:middle line:84%
Imagine taking your logic
mind off to the side,

00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:49.190 align:middle line:84%
willingly, and looking on with
curiosity, without censoring,

00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:51.125 align:middle line:90%
interference, or agenda.

00:39:51.125 --> 00:39:53.630 align:middle line:84%
It's this skill of
being able to listen,

00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:55.610 align:middle line:84%
and it's no different
than when you're

00:39:55.610 --> 00:39:56.780 align:middle line:90%
listening to your partner.

00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:59.480 align:middle line:84%
That skill of just
being able to listen

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:03.200 align:middle line:84%
to what they're saying without
thinking to yourself, you know,

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:05.400 align:middle line:84%
and wanting to
interject all the time.

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:07.070 align:middle line:90%
So to have your--

00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:09.560 align:middle line:84%
ask your mind to
willingly step aside

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:12.350 align:middle line:90%
and look on from curiosity.

00:40:12.350 --> 00:40:14.270 align:middle line:84%
But now, here's the
important part--

00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:18.540 align:middle line:84%
allow your mind to
have its own opinion.

00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:22.010 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so here, your mind's
over here going, well,

00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:24.330 align:middle line:90%
I know what I think about this.

00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:27.830 align:middle line:84%
But I'm curious, what does
higher guidance have to say?

00:40:27.830 --> 00:40:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And then listen for
higher guidance response.

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And allow even for
arguing to take place.

00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:35.820 align:middle line:84%
I argue all the time
with my higher guidance.

00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:39.590 align:middle line:84%
But what this is an invitation
to discuss something.

00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:41.120 align:middle line:90%
Like, explain this to me.

00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:43.400 align:middle line:90%
I don't agree.

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:46.527 align:middle line:84%
You have to go deeper and
give me the background

00:40:46.527 --> 00:40:48.110 align:middle line:84%
or give me some
information about this

00:40:48.110 --> 00:40:50.630 align:middle line:84%
so I can have a greater
understanding of what you're

00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:51.580 align:middle line:90%
saying.

00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:54.440 align:middle line:84%
So allow your mind to
have its own opinion

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:57.380 align:middle line:84%
and create that clear
channel for higher guidance.

00:40:57.380 --> 00:41:01.310 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that, it
doesn't take too long before you

00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:03.117 align:middle line:90%
notice those two voices.

00:41:03.117 --> 00:41:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you know
you're not loading the answers,

00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:08.750 align:middle line:84%
because the higher
guidance response to you,

00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:10.730 align:middle line:84%
it will tell you something
that you would not

00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:13.840 align:middle line:84%
have come up with on your own,
and you will disagree with.

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:16.108 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I do
that, and I think

00:41:16.108 --> 00:41:18.650 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned this in one other,
and I'll keep it really brief.

00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:21.830 align:middle line:84%
Remember the time I talked
about France, buying the ticket,

00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:23.590 align:middle line:90%
airline ticket to France.

00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:25.430 align:middle line:84%
I was going to France,
and I'm meditating.

00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:26.763 align:middle line:90%
And they said, you're not going.

00:41:26.763 --> 00:41:27.900 align:middle line:90%
I said, yes I am.

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:29.108 align:middle line:90%
And they said, no you're not.

00:41:29.108 --> 00:41:30.100 align:middle line:90%
I said, watch me.

00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:31.280 align:middle line:90%
I bought the ticket.

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:34.053 align:middle line:84%
The day came to get on
the airplane and I--

00:41:34.053 --> 00:41:35.970 align:middle line:84%
please forgive me, anybody
that's heard this--

00:41:35.970 --> 00:41:39.140 align:middle line:90%
I mentioned it in another show.

00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:43.100 align:middle line:84%
I got this, out-of-the-blue,
horrid urinary tract infection,

00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:46.130 align:middle line:84%
where I couldn't even go more
than a minute or two without

00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:49.700 align:middle line:84%
having to run to the bathroom,
and I couldn't make it

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:50.630 align:middle line:90%
to the airport.

00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:53.690 align:middle line:90%
I thought, oh, my God.

00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And it was a non-refundable
ticket, right?

00:41:56.210 --> 00:41:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And so after, so I went took
a little vitamin C drink,

00:41:58.720 --> 00:41:59.520 align:middle line:90%
some water.

00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:01.010 align:middle line:90%
It was gone in hours.

00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:03.095 align:middle line:90%
and I said, what was that about?

00:42:03.095 --> 00:42:04.970 align:middle line:84%
They said, we told you,
you weren't going in.

00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:08.360 align:middle line:84%
And there was a whole reason
why I shouldn't go to that place

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:11.390 align:middle line:84%
at that time that was
astounding in itself.

00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:13.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the answer
was amazing, and it

00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:15.200 align:middle line:90%
had to do with speaking French.

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:16.890 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to
do this anymore.

00:42:16.890 --> 00:42:20.392 align:middle line:84%
And so the point being, you can
go back and forth and argue,

00:42:20.392 --> 00:42:22.850 align:middle line:84%
and you can even say, well,
I'm not going to listen to you.

00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:26.570 align:middle line:84%
But beware, there
may be consequences.

00:42:26.570 --> 00:42:28.790 align:middle line:84%
Jean, any final thoughts
before we sign off here.

00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:30.270 align:middle line:90%
This has been very helpful.

00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:34.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: OK, well, just
remember, you are on, each

00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:38.130 align:middle line:84%
and every one of us is on
a journey of self-discovery

00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:40.410 align:middle line:84%
knowing who we are
and how we create.

00:42:40.410 --> 00:42:46.890 align:middle line:84%
And all of our life events
could be informing us of that.

00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:48.810 align:middle line:10%
Take a look at the
challenges that

00:42:48.810 --> 00:42:51.870 align:middle line:10%
come up on a recurring
basis and just recognize

00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:55.290 align:middle line:10%
that that actually might be
revealing to me a soul strength

00:42:55.290 --> 00:42:56.790 align:middle line:10%
that I have.

00:42:56.790 --> 00:43:02.850 align:middle line:10%
So welcome that and ask higher
guidance, as you go along,

00:43:02.850 --> 00:43:06.150 align:middle line:10%
is this something that
is germane to my purpose?

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:09.820 align:middle line:84%
Is this something that is
germane to my life lessons

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:10.620 align:middle line:90%
here?

00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And if it isn't,
then just let it go.

00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:17.153 align:middle line:84%
It's incidental, and it
doesn't really mean much.

00:43:17.153 --> 00:43:19.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is where
non-attachment comes in.

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:21.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Unattachment,
yeah, and just to let it go.

00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:22.950 align:middle line:84%
So you're on this
fantastic journey

00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:24.730 align:middle line:90%
that actually lasts a lifetime.

00:43:24.730 --> 00:43:25.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:25.530 --> 00:43:25.860 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:26.943 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: It doesn't end.

00:43:26.943 --> 00:43:27.790 align:middle line:90%
It lasts a lifetime.

00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:29.123 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, and that's true.

00:43:29.123 --> 00:43:31.500 align:middle line:84%
One friend once said to
me that his father always

00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:34.140 align:middle line:90%
told him, son, life is long.

00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:36.330 align:middle line:84%
Because he wanted something
now, now, you know?

00:43:36.330 --> 00:43:37.720 align:middle line:90%
And why is it not happening?

00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:38.520 align:middle line:10%
It's long.

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:41.970 align:middle line:10%
There's plenty of opportunity
to adjust and create.

00:43:41.970 --> 00:43:44.490 align:middle line:10%
So Jean, as always, it's
wonderful having you here.

00:43:44.490 --> 00:43:46.160 align:middle line:84%
Everybody loves
these conversations,

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:48.660 align:middle line:84%
because there's always something
they can take home and use.

00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:50.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Great, thank you.

00:43:50.430 --> 00:43:52.350 align:middle line:10%
