>>REGINA MEREDITH: For a man
who holds his cards pretty

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.760 align:middle line:10%
close to his chest,
Billy Carson and I

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.190 align:middle line:10%
had a pretty
freewheeling conversation

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.110 align:middle line:10%
about his years
growing up and what

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.260 align:middle line:10%
influenced him to be so dogged
in his pursuit of truth.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.910 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're going
to dive even deeper

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.030 align:middle line:84%
into his family's backstory,
which we did not have time

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.800 align:middle line:90%
to do in the last conversation.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.920 align:middle line:84%
It is not your normal
family history.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.820 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back, Billy.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY CARSON:
Thanks for having me.

>>REGINA: We just started
talking after the show,

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.260 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, oh my god,
why couldn't we get to that?

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.100 align:middle line:84%
So now, you're a
representative of a bloodline

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.845 align:middle line:84%
of people that's been tapped
in a really interesting way.

00:00:56.845 --> 00:00:57.645 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes.

00:00:57.645 --> 00:01:02.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And first of all,
let's do a tiny little recap.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.990 align:middle line:84%
In our last conversation, you
initially grew up in New York,

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.790 align:middle line:90%
as I recall?

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:08.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Mm-hm.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.465 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And a
background of poverty?

00:01:09.465 --> 00:01:10.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Poverty.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.850 align:middle line:84%
And you ended up
moving to Florida.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And just a quick little
recap, but you're

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.750 align:middle line:90%
a very ingenious man.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.890 align:middle line:84%
And you're an entrepreneur,
and you figured out

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.070 align:middle line:84%
a way to make life work
for you and, really,

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.600 align:middle line:90%
with stunning results.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.610 align:middle line:10%
Maybe just give a
little recap for us

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.710 align:middle line:10%
before we start going back
to grandma and grandpa.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.170 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: Sure, I'll
give you a quick summary.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.430 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.150 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: Basically, I was
born in New York City in Queens

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.130 align:middle line:10%
at Queens General Hospital.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.010 align:middle line:10%
I lived in New York in
Cambria Heights Queens

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.480 align:middle line:10%
just from the age of birth
until about seven years old,

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.370 align:middle line:10%
moved to Miami, Florida.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.530 align:middle line:84%
In Miami, Florida, we
lived in Opa-locka,

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.470 align:middle line:84%
which is a very
impoverished city, still

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.400 align:middle line:90%
to this current day.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I just went there a
few weeks ago to check on the--

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.220 align:middle line:84%
just memory sake, kind
of go down memory lane,

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.230 align:middle line:84%
and I was like, wow,
this is pretty bad.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How long since
you had been there?

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Probably, I would
say, about three or four years.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:02.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.148 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And every time
I go back, it's worse.

00:02:04.148 --> 00:02:08.100 align:middle line:84%
This time, I saw a
12-foot barbed wire gate

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.680 align:middle line:84%
around the elementary
school that I went to,

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.930 align:middle line:84%
where I started my
research and investigation

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.910 align:middle line:90%
with the encyclopedias.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.280 align:middle line:84%
But at that house
that we were renting

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.890 align:middle line:84%
there is where I saw a
UFO in my backyard-- fly

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.240 align:middle line:90%
over my backyard.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.510 align:middle line:84%
We lived close to an airport,
so I knew it wasn't an airplane.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And that triggered my
research and investigation

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.267 align:middle line:90%
into aerospace.

00:02:28.267 --> 00:02:30.600 align:middle line:84%
So I would go to Rainbow Park
Elementary to the library,

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.100 align:middle line:84%
and I literally would take down
the Encyclopedia Britannicas

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.530 align:middle line:90%
and start researching aerospace.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.400 align:middle line:90%
I started back then.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.510 align:middle line:90%
It was like 1977.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You were how old?

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:38.880 align:middle line:90%
About eight, or--

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.000 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Seven years old.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Seven.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.670 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:41.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah, seven years old.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.550 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And just also, as
a little prehistory to that,

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.240 align:middle line:10%
your dad was kind of taking
you out proud to show you off

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.980 align:middle line:10%
when you were like two to the
bar to read out of the Bible

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.390 align:middle line:10%
to his friends.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.830 align:middle line:10%
Look at how smart my kid is.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.813 align:middle line:84%
And he saw to it that your
family became very literate.

00:02:58.813 --> 00:02:59.730 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes, he did.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.782 align:middle line:84%
That's one thing I've got
to give him the credit for,

00:03:02.782 --> 00:03:04.740 align:middle line:84%
even though it was a
weird experience going out

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:05.610 align:middle line:90%
to these bars.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.670 align:middle line:84%
And then, he'd come home and
watch my mom clobber him.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.237 align:middle line:84%
But I was reading novels
at the age of one.

00:03:11.237 --> 00:03:13.070 align:middle line:84%
I was reading children's
books at 10 months,

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:14.112 align:middle line:90%
novels at the age of one.

00:03:14.112 --> 00:03:16.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That
sounds like a myth.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.970 align:middle line:84%
It's like, how can you even
process information at one

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.210 align:middle line:84%
unless the way you came in was
already wired developmentally

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.142 align:middle line:84%
completely differently
than your normal human.

00:03:26.142 --> 00:03:27.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I was a
little different.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.030 align:middle line:84%
From early on, I knew that I
was a little bit different, just

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.560 align:middle line:84%
because of the things
that I would retain,

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.985 align:middle line:84%
and how I would
know information,

00:03:32.985 --> 00:03:34.110 align:middle line:90%
and how I would see things.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.420 align:middle line:84%
And other kids that
I would interact with

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.550 align:middle line:84%
didn't have the same
concepts that I had

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:39.950 align:middle line:90%
or perceptions that I had.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.515 align:middle line:84%
And I realized early on that
in some kind of way in my mind

00:03:42.515 --> 00:03:43.890 align:middle line:84%
they were a little
bit behind me,

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.350 align:middle line:84%
but I was just actually a
little bit ahead of them.

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.940 align:middle line:84%
When I got to Rainbow
Park Elementary,

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.630 align:middle line:84%
more verifiable information,
they asked my mom if I wanted

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.597 align:middle line:84%
to go to kindergarten and
just be in kindergarten--

00:03:54.597 --> 00:03:56.430 align:middle line:84%
because I hadn't been
to school yet at all--

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.290 align:middle line:84%
or if I wanted to go
to the second grade.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.300 align:middle line:84%
And she said, just put
him in the first grade.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.640 align:middle line:84%
Give him a chance to acclimate
with the kids and everything

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.190 align:middle line:90%
else.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.100 align:middle line:84%
But I could've went straight
to the second grade.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.510 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well, that
makes sense because,

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.140 align:middle line:10%
well, you probably
could have gone

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.020 align:middle line:10%
to the fifth or sixth
grade academically.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.820 align:middle line:84%
But socially, you'd
have been way out

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.250 align:middle line:84%
of sync and under
influences of older kids.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.040 align:middle line:10%
So then as you started
becoming a young man,

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.310 align:middle line:10%
you became involved in
and fascinated with--

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.010 align:middle line:10%
was it digital that was
coming up at the time?

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah,
digital car stereo.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.780 align:middle line:84%
So in my dad's car, he
had 8-track players.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.480 align:middle line:84%
One was a junker that
we had in the yard

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.810 align:middle line:84%
that we would take apart and
put back together for fun.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:32.610 align:middle line:90%
The other one--

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:33.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Never thought of that.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.880 align:middle line:84%
That's a great way to learn
mechanical engineering, right?

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:36.540 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Absolutely.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:37.340 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.140 align:middle line:84%
And the other one was his car,
which worked from time to time,

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.580 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] but it had an 8-track.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.955 align:middle line:84%
With 8-tracks, as you know,
anybody who knows about them,

00:04:43.955 --> 00:04:45.300 align:middle line:90%
you can't rewind.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.820 align:middle line:84%
It's always listen till the
end, then it starts over.

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:47.625 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It goes one direction.

00:04:47.625 --> 00:04:49.080 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: One direction.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.790 align:middle line:84%
And I started
researching you know

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.218 align:middle line:90%
into what's coming up next.

00:04:52.218 --> 00:04:53.760 align:middle line:84%
I knew this couldn't
persist forever.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And how old
were you at this point?

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.220 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: I was 12 years old.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:57.845 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah,
And I was selling

00:04:57.845 --> 00:04:59.307 align:middle line:90%
newspapers for the Miami news.

00:04:59.307 --> 00:05:01.890 align:middle line:84%
So I would take the money that
I was making from my commission

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.290 align:middle line:84%
from selling subscriptions
and I found a company called

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:05.813 align:middle line:90%
"Galaxy Electronics."

00:05:05.813 --> 00:05:07.230 align:middle line:84%
They were inside
and, still today,

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.030 align:middle line:84%
are inside of the
Opportunity magazine

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.240 align:middle line:84%
that you can get in
the grocery store.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.930 align:middle line:84%
Mine was at Winn-Dixie grocery
store right around the corner.

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:14.730 align:middle line:90%
I would go there.

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.450 align:middle line:90%
I got the Opportunity book.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:17.850 align:middle line:90%
And I found this company.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.280 align:middle line:84%
I started looking at all the
radios they were coming out

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.390 align:middle line:90%
with and electronics.

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.340 align:middle line:84%
I started buying
digital car radios

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.150 align:middle line:84%
with cassette decks and also
EQ boosters and, even then,

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.860 align:middle line:90%
eventually subwoofers.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.112 align:middle line:84%
And I had, eventually, the
largest electronics company

00:05:32.112 --> 00:05:33.570 align:middle line:84%
pretty much in the
tri-county area.

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.445 align:middle line:84%
People were coming from
all over the counties

00:05:35.445 --> 00:05:37.165 align:middle line:84%
to come to my house
to buy because nobody

00:05:37.165 --> 00:05:38.040 align:middle line:90%
could beat my prices.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: At the ripe
old age of, what, 13, 14?

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:41.510 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: 13, yeah.

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:42.450 align:middle line:90%
By then, I was 13.

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:43.908 align:middle line:84%
By the time I was
14, I was already

00:05:43.908 --> 00:05:45.500 align:middle line:90%
making more than my parents.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:47.740 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.065 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile, you were still
continuing your research?

00:05:51.065 --> 00:05:52.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yes,
still researching.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --regarding reverse
propulsion technologies

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:01.110 align:middle line:84%
and anti-gravity technologies,
trying to piece together

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.110 align:middle line:84%
how that experience you
had functioned physically

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:05.460 align:middle line:90%
in the physical world, right?

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.120 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right, exactly.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.495 align:middle line:84%
I got into all
types of sciences.

00:06:07.495 --> 00:06:10.050 align:middle line:84%
The great thing that happened,
universal synchronicity,

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:13.180 align:middle line:84%
I guess, is not too long
after that experience--

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.740 align:middle line:84%
and I was researching
the encyclopedias,

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.700 align:middle line:84%
the encyclopedia
salesperson came to my house

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.480 align:middle line:84%
knocking on the door, and my mom
got approved for the whole set.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.530 align:middle line:90%
So I was in heaven then.

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:23.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:28.800 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: So I was studying
biology, physics, aerospace,

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.180 align:middle line:84%
everything you could
think of that existed--

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.570 align:middle line:84%
economies, and history--
everything that

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:34.830 align:middle line:90%
was in those books.

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:35.630 align:middle line:90%
It was incredible.

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.770 align:middle line:84%
And I was, like, buried in those
books from morning till night.

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:40.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How did that happen?

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well,
at that time, they

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.290 align:middle line:84%
were so desperate to get
books out, it was like,

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:44.400 align:middle line:84%
we're going to give
you these books,

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.410 align:middle line:84%
and you gotta pay X amount
of dollars every week.

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:46.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:49.080 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And she started
off giving them the money

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:49.440 align:middle line:90%
every week.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.523 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, she wasn't
able to pay for it anymore.

00:06:51.523 --> 00:06:54.030 align:middle line:84%
But what happened was
the salespeople never

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:55.455 align:middle line:90%
came back knocking on the door.

00:06:55.455 --> 00:06:56.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they didn't
take their set back?

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:57.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: They
didn't take it back.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was
your real education?

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.170 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: That was my
in-home education, period.

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:03.900 align:middle line:84%
Literally, that's
what got me started.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.150 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So now, as
your story progressed,

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.060 align:middle line:10%
you stayed very
entrepreneurial and successful,

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.370 align:middle line:10%
and you have a very disciplined
way about you in mind,

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.770 align:middle line:10%
and athletics also
factors into your family.

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:16.470 align:middle line:10%
You're a disciplined person.

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:22.110 align:middle line:10%
You were able to retire, as I
recall, at a very young age,

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.520 align:middle line:10%
and raise your little kids,
and really be there for them.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.320 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.945 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Talk about
that a little bit.

00:07:26.945 --> 00:07:28.830 align:middle line:84%
Did you end up retiring
from that company

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:30.000 align:middle line:90%
or another subsequent one?

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.583 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: It was from a company
called Dotcom Marketing Group.

00:07:32.583 --> 00:07:35.610 align:middle line:84%
So basically, I saw,
again, the future.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:37.110 align:middle line:90%
I have a futuristic mindset.

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.930 align:middle line:84%
I always see things,
what's going to be next.

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:41.200 align:middle line:90%
And I saw a commercial.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.575 align:middle line:84%
That's all you need, a small
glimpse of a commercial that

00:07:43.575 --> 00:07:45.040 align:middle line:90%
said, "IBM.com."

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.053 align:middle line:90%
And I said "dot com?"

00:07:46.053 --> 00:07:48.720 align:middle line:84%
And the commercial was talking a
little bit about the internet--

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.985 align:middle line:90%
not too much.

00:07:49.985 --> 00:07:51.360 align:middle line:84%
So I said, what
is this internet?

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.490 align:middle line:84%
So I started looking
into the internet.

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:55.710 align:middle line:90%
This was like 1998.

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:58.500 align:middle line:84%
A few companies had
websites, and that was it.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.490 align:middle line:84%
And I said, wow,
eventually, everybody's

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:01.710 align:middle line:90%
going to want one of these.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And ironically-- again, the
universe works in mysterious

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:05.460 align:middle line:90%
ways--

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:09.050 align:middle line:84%
two weeks later,
one of the gentleman

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:11.040 align:middle line:84%
that lived in my
same community, he

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.540 align:middle line:84%
was an exchange
student from Arabia.

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:14.248 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me, do
you have a company?

00:08:14.248 --> 00:08:17.010 align:middle line:84%
Because I need to make
a website for a company

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:18.360 align:middle line:90%
as part of my internship.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.985 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, yeah,
I have a company,

00:08:19.985 --> 00:08:21.650 align:middle line:84%
and I was looking
to make websites.

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:22.650 align:middle line:90%
I sat over his shoulder.

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:23.885 align:middle line:90%
I watched everything he did.

00:08:23.885 --> 00:08:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And then when he got done,
I went to Rent-A-Center,

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:27.805 align:middle line:90%
I got a Packet From Hell.

00:08:27.805 --> 00:08:29.428 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What's at
packet from hell?

00:08:29.428 --> 00:08:30.470 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: A Packard Bell.

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:31.562 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, a Packard Bell.

00:08:31.562 --> 00:08:31.960 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.710 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: We called
it at Packet from Hell

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:35.280 align:middle line:90%
because it crashed all the time.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, good.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Two gigabyte
hard drive, AOL dial up,

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.340 align:middle line:84%
and I started replicating
what I saw him doing.

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And when I realized I
had a talent for it,

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:44.910 align:middle line:84%
I went to the bookstore
and I would just literally

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:47.243 align:middle line:84%
read the books at the bookstore,
take a couple of notes,

00:08:47.243 --> 00:08:48.790 align:middle line:90%
go home, and duplicate it.

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:49.590 align:middle line:90%
And I said, wow.

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:52.020 align:middle line:84%
Now if I can make a website
for a service-based company,

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.187 align:middle line:84%
I can just make the same
website over and over again

00:08:54.187 --> 00:08:55.771 align:middle line:84%
and change the colors
and the content,

00:08:55.771 --> 00:08:57.477 align:middle line:90%
and I can do well with this.

00:08:57.477 --> 00:08:59.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you had
to teach yourself code?

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:01.477 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I taught myself
five different programming

00:09:01.477 --> 00:09:03.747 align:middle line:84%
languages, yes,
from the bookstore.

00:09:03.747 --> 00:09:06.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: See, I just like
hearing this story over again

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.338 align:middle line:84%
because I'm so
awe-inspired all the time.

00:09:08.338 --> 00:09:09.630 align:middle line:90%
I just want to keep hearing it.

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:09.960 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.260 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: And that's what I did.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:12.802 align:middle line:84%
So I started Dot
Com Marketing Group.

00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:15.360 align:middle line:84%
I started telemarketing
mortgage companies

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.868 align:middle line:90%
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.

00:09:16.868 --> 00:09:19.160 align:middle line:84%
Thursday and Friday, I would
go out on the appointments

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.350 align:middle line:84%
that I set for myself,
sell them the websites.

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:23.070 align:middle line:84%
Saturday and Sunday, I
would put the websites up

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:24.256 align:middle line:84%
and I would duplicate
their numbers.

00:09:24.256 --> 00:09:26.515 align:middle line:84%
I was doing, like, 10,000
hours a week doing that.

00:09:26.515 --> 00:09:27.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, my God.

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:28.190 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:29.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
when it was time,

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:31.410 align:middle line:90%
you said, OK, I've done this.

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:34.272 align:middle line:84%
And you had enough money to
retire well in good style.

00:09:34.272 --> 00:09:35.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah,
well, what happened

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:37.775 align:middle line:84%
was a gentleman
approached me who

00:09:37.775 --> 00:09:39.900 align:middle line:84%
owned this company called
"Glow Bench Systems," who

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.240 align:middle line:84%
were on the pink sheets
on the stock market.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we need
a cash-rich company

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:48.360 align:middle line:84%
to add to our bottom line
so we can move up and then

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.250 align:middle line:90%
even maybe sell the company.

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:51.870 align:middle line:84%
So they acquired
my company, which

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:53.370 align:middle line:84%
the press release
is still available

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:54.737 align:middle line:90%
online from all these years.

00:09:54.737 --> 00:09:56.320 align:middle line:84%
They acquired Dot.com
Marketing Group.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.700 align:middle line:84%
So I took that money,
and they acquired it.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:03.450 align:middle line:84%
They eventually sold to
the amber alert system.

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:04.950 align:middle line:84%
They funded the
amber alert system,

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:07.650 align:middle line:84%
and that's where it
ended up merging with.

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:09.540 align:middle line:90%
But I took seven years off.

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.790 align:middle line:84%
I didn't do anything, literally
could have stayed out.

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:13.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How lucky
your kids were.

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Oh, I stayed
with the kids all--

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.527 align:middle line:84%
I spent so much
time with my kids--

00:10:18.527 --> 00:10:20.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's no way even
that their mother can add up

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:21.818 align:middle line:90%
to the amount of hours.

00:10:21.818 --> 00:10:22.990 align:middle line:90%
I was at every school.

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:25.570 align:middle line:90%
I volunteered at every school--

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:27.910 align:middle line:84%
all the sports, I
coach every sport,

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:30.732 align:middle line:84%
I help build the
YMCA in West Broward.

00:10:30.732 --> 00:10:32.440 align:middle line:84%
When you walk in the
giant granite block,

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm a founding member.

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:37.360 align:middle line:84%
I started all the sports
programs in Western Florida

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.240 align:middle line:84%
and, really, just helped
participate in any way I can.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.730 align:middle line:84%
I became a team USA
coach, Junior Olympics,

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:44.900 align:middle line:84%
high school basketball
coach, gold medals, I mean,

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.320 align:middle line:90%
the whole thing.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.755 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so it was amazing.

00:10:47.755 --> 00:10:50.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, over-achiever
doesn't work right.

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:52.850 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't really work for you.

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:54.350 align:middle line:84%
You're in a category
of your own.

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:57.995 align:middle line:90%


00:10:57.995 --> 00:11:00.370 align:middle line:10%
How did you get to the point
where they started featuring

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:03.250 align:middle line:10%
you on shows, like what
you do here at Gaia,

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:06.128 align:middle line:10%
"Deep Space" and
"Ancient Civilizations,"

00:11:06.128 --> 00:11:07.420 align:middle line:10%
"Ancient Aliens," and all that.

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:08.230 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen?

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:09.772 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: You know,
it really started

00:11:09.772 --> 00:11:12.310 align:middle line:84%
when I started researching the
procession of the equinoxes.

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:14.090 align:middle line:90%
I became an amateur astronomer.

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:15.340 align:middle line:90%
And I started realizing that--

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:15.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course.

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:16.150 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: [LAUGHS] Of course.

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:16.950 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:18.660 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:22.163 align:middle line:84%
But I started realizing that
the procession was speeding up.

00:11:22.163 --> 00:11:24.580 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, what can cause
the procession to speed up?

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And that took me
down a whole rabbit

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:29.568 align:middle line:84%
hole of trying to figure out,
is our sun orbiting something?

00:11:29.568 --> 00:11:32.110 align:middle line:84%
Because we would need breakaway
speed if we were speeding up.

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:33.943 align:middle line:84%
These are the questions
I was asking myself.

00:11:33.943 --> 00:11:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And I started finding potential
answers to those questions,

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:38.350 align:middle line:84%
and I started looking
into the history books

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:39.860 align:middle line:84%
and seeing where,
in ancient times,

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:42.040 align:middle line:84%
according to this speed
up of the procession,

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.770 align:middle line:84%
different geological disasters
were happening on Earth.

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:46.390 align:middle line:84%
So I started thinking
that we could

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:49.063 align:middle line:84%
be orbiting another star in
our solar system, which now

00:11:49.063 --> 00:11:50.230 align:middle line:90%
has been officially proven--

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:51.452 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:51.452 --> 00:11:52.660 align:middle line:90%
The binary star system, yeah.

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:53.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Correct.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.742 align:middle line:84%
And I started
thinking, hmm, I should

00:11:54.742 --> 00:11:56.380 align:middle line:90%
make an underground shelter.

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.090 align:middle line:84%
So I built an
underground shelter

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:00.630 align:middle line:84%
about the size of three
Wal-Marts in Northwest Georgia.

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:01.463 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course.

00:12:01.463 --> 00:12:02.671 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: [LAUGHS]

00:12:02.671 --> 00:12:05.004 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can the rest of us
come when it all goes down?

00:12:05.004 --> 00:12:05.804 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:05.804 --> 00:12:06.720 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: It's to save the
lives of 360 people in case

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:11.898 align:middle line:84%
of a geological or
economic collapse.

00:12:11.898 --> 00:12:13.690 align:middle line:84%
And it got featured on
the History Channel,

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:14.815 align:middle line:90%
so that was my first break.

00:12:14.815 --> 00:12:16.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ah, OK.

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: The History Channel
came down, the producers, they

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:20.090 align:middle line:90%
talked to me.

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:21.730 align:middle line:84%
They came to my
offices and everything.

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:22.730 align:middle line:90%
It's still online today.

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:24.630 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
Countdown to Apocalypse.

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:26.455 align:middle line:84%
It's the episode
called Nostradamus.

00:12:26.455 --> 00:12:28.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Nostradamus, OK.

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:31.120 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And so that's
when I first got on TV.

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.140 align:middle line:90%
I got an IMDb.

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:33.072 align:middle line:90%
I got on IMDb.

00:12:33.072 --> 00:12:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And then other people
start looking me up

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:36.340 align:middle line:84%
to see what I was into
and what I was doing,

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:39.010 align:middle line:84%
and then it started turning
into radio shows and everything

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:39.220 align:middle line:90%
else.

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And I started finding
out all the other things

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:42.885 align:middle line:84%
I was researching, and talking
about, and blogging about,

00:12:42.885 --> 00:12:45.772 align:middle line:84%
and writing up in forums, and
it just kept growing from there.

00:12:45.772 --> 00:12:46.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So here we are.

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:49.970 align:middle line:84%
And you don't generally
have the opportunity

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:53.097 align:middle line:84%
in these various formats to talk
about your own personal story,

00:12:53.097 --> 00:12:55.430 align:middle line:84%
which is why I wanted to do
that with you because you're

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:56.660 align:middle line:90%
an exceptional human being--

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:57.000 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Thank you.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --on
virtually every level.

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:01.790 align:middle line:10%
And so we don't
have a chance to see

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:04.850 align:middle line:10%
how the lives of people like you
are up close and personal that

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:05.810 align:middle line:10%
often.

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:10.160 align:middle line:10%
And so as we started speaking at
the end of our last interview,

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:13.040 align:middle line:10%
it turns out it wasn't just you.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:13.840 align:middle line:10%
It's in your blood.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:14.260 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:15.300 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:19.850 align:middle line:10%
So let's start at the beginning
of your family's backstory

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:22.570 align:middle line:10%
and probably with your
grandma and grandpa?

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:23.370 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:25.955 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK,
paternal or maternal?

00:13:25.955 --> 00:13:26.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Paternal.

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:28.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Paternal, OK.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:34.190 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: So my grandmother,
she is a Puerto Rican woman.

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:35.740 align:middle line:90%
Her last name is de Castro.

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:38.240 align:middle line:84%
So all the de Castros in Puerto
Rico are all related to me--

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.700 align:middle line:84%
or I'm related to
them, I should say.

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:46.062 align:middle line:84%
And her grandmother was like a
princess almost in Puerto Rico.

00:13:46.062 --> 00:13:47.270 align:middle line:90%
This is a very long time ago.

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:49.910 align:middle line:84%
My grandmother now is 97,
so it's been a long time.

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:53.660 align:middle line:84%
I have a few great, great,
great aunts that are 103, 109,

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:55.100 align:middle line:90%
so forth, so long lifespans.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:58.910 align:middle line:84%
But she met my grandfather who
was from the St. Thomas Virgin

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:01.910 align:middle line:84%
Islands, or The British Virgin
Islands, and they got together,

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:07.700 align:middle line:84%
and she moved to St. Thomas
with him and started a family.

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.770 align:middle line:84%
Now my grandfather's
side of the family

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:12.050 align:middle line:84%
had been interacting
with people there,

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:14.630 align:middle line:84%
as far as I know
now from my aunt who

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:17.300 align:middle line:84%
told me this, from a
very long time ago.

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:21.200 align:middle line:84%
In ancient times, she told
me that people that were more

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.430 align:middle line:90%
advanced than us--

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:24.320 align:middle line:90%
she didn't say aliens--

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:28.010 align:middle line:84%
were involved in building
structures on this planet

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:30.920 align:middle line:84%
and that our family
would aid them

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:33.390 align:middle line:90%
with the construction process.

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:34.250 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, wow.

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:36.500 align:middle line:84%
Now she's basically
almost dead now.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.450 align:middle line:90%
She's about to pass away soon.

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:40.340 align:middle line:84%
She contacted me
and said that this

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:42.090 align:middle line:84%
is something I want to tell
you before I leave this Earth.

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:43.720 align:middle line:84%
Now she doesn't know anything
about Forbidden Knowledge,

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:44.720 align:middle line:90%
me being on TV--

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She doesn't know
anything about your life?

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:47.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: No, nothing.

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:49.755 align:middle line:84%
She knows nothing, not even
an email or a cell phone.

00:14:49.755 --> 00:14:51.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just that you did
well financially, that's it.

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:53.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I did
well financially--

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:56.540 align:middle line:84%
her son tells her,
oh, Billy's doing OK.

00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.710 align:middle line:84%
And my mom passed
away nine years ago.

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:03.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now we'll get
into that in a minute,

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:06.900 align:middle line:84%
but your mother always
understood your curiosity about

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:07.700 align:middle line:90%
these things--

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:08.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Oh, absolutely.

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:10.058 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and supported
that, but here's why.

00:15:10.058 --> 00:15:12.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah, well
because her and my mother,

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:15.350 align:middle line:84%
according to her, were playing
at a megalithic structure

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:19.700 align:middle line:84%
in the islands that, supposedly,
our family helped construct,

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:24.130 align:middle line:84%
and then these beings
came and took them away.

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:26.000 align:middle line:84%
She said they took
us away in a ship

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000 align:middle line:84%
that, basically, as far as she's
concerned, left the planet,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.522 align:middle line:84%
and then came back hours later
and returned them totally safe.

00:15:32.522 --> 00:15:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And she said that our family
has a history of working

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:36.890 align:middle line:84%
with these people
and that she just

00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:39.575 align:middle line:84%
wanted to let me know this
before she left this Earth.

00:15:39.575 --> 00:15:42.273 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's talk
about the megalithic site

00:15:42.273 --> 00:15:43.940 align:middle line:84%
you say that the
family helped build it.

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:45.710 align:middle line:84%
And so if it's megalithic,
link that means your family's

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:47.720 align:middle line:84%
been doing this for many,
many thousands of years.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:47.890 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:50.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they're somehow in
companionship, collaboration,

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:54.250 align:middle line:84%
or maybe even genetically
tied with the people that

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:55.050 align:middle line:90%
have been coming?

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:57.800 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah, something
really interesting.

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:01.550 align:middle line:84%
Only 15% of the world have
Rh-negative blood, and my mom,

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:05.240 align:middle line:84%
and her brother, and myself
all have Rh-negative blood.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.270 align:middle line:84%
And just in one family,
that's too close--

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:09.650 align:middle line:84%
that's so close to
be a coincidence.

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:11.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, just
so everybody knows what

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:15.620 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about here, that
is often associated with alien

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:18.518 align:middle line:84%
DNA or not-of-this-Earth DNA,
however you want to call it.

00:16:18.518 --> 00:16:19.560 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right, correct.

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:20.930 align:middle line:90%
That's what biologists say.

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:23.450 align:middle line:84%
I have to donate my own
blood to my local plasma bank

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:26.030 align:middle line:84%
so that I can have blood on
call in case something happens

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:27.710 align:middle line:84%
to me, they don't
have to go digging

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:28.460 align:middle line:84%
and figuring out
where they're going

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:29.668 align:middle line:90%
to get blood for transfusion.

00:16:29.668 --> 00:16:30.980 align:middle line:90%
I can transfuse my own self.

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:34.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are you an O,
AB, or some combination?

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:39.425 align:middle line:10%
Are you O, A, or AB, B, or AB
in your dominant blood type?

00:16:39.425 --> 00:16:40.270 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: O, yeah.

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:41.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:45.650 align:middle line:10%
And I say this because I did a
show in Sardinia, which is now

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:48.650 align:middle line:10%
airing on Gaia, and
the first episode

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:53.600 align:middle line:10%
had to do with the giants that
had the knowledge that came

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:57.140 align:middle line:10%
from Atlantis that are the--

00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:01.100 align:middle line:10%
they were the wise ones
that established life

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:03.770 align:middle line:10%
after the deluge in
Sardinia that some

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:06.020 align:middle line:10%
of the Sardinians, or a
good portion, believe,

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:07.670 align:middle line:10%
are there ancestors?

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:10.849 align:middle line:10%
And we just had this
conversation where the Ouija

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:13.040 align:middle line:10%
said, we are from those people.

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:17.780 align:middle line:10%
We are O, Rh negative-- the
O blood type and Rh negative.

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And so he was saying
the same thing

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.655 align:middle line:84%
that this is an
indication you're

00:17:20.655 --> 00:17:24.730 align:middle line:84%
coming from a different genetic
bloodline than a normal human's

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:25.530 align:middle line:90%
person.

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:26.697 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah, interesting.

00:17:26.697 --> 00:17:32.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK so did your mother
explain to you at all what

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:35.410 align:middle line:84%
the beings were like,
what they were shown?

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:38.870 align:middle line:84%
Your aunt, did she explain
what they were shown

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:41.330 align:middle line:84%
or anything about that
experience to you?

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:43.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: She didn't tell
me what they were shown.

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:45.800 align:middle line:90%
And she was very weak.

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.830 align:middle line:84%
She only told me that
we look like themselves.

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:52.198 align:middle line:84%
So they don't look like
aliens, green men--

00:17:52.198 --> 00:17:53.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Humanoid,
which is supposed

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.032 align:middle line:90%
to be throughout the universes.

00:17:55.032 --> 00:17:56.830 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Exactly, humanoid.

00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:57.630 align:middle line:90%
But they were big.

00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:58.805 align:middle line:90%
They were large.

00:17:58.805 --> 00:18:00.680 align:middle line:84%
And when I looked back
at the family history,

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.140 align:middle line:90%
I keep seeing architects.

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:07.640 align:middle line:84%
My grandfather, an
architect; my aunt

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:10.670 align:middle line:84%
who unforeseen passed away as
well, her son and daughter--

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:11.690 align:middle line:90%
both architects.

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:13.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm going, wow, this
is really interesting.

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:15.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and they're not
even going to school

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:17.600 align:middle line:90%
for just particularly that.

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.843 align:middle line:84%
My grandfather, only an
eighth-grade education,

00:18:19.843 --> 00:18:21.260 align:middle line:84%
becomes one of the
top architects.

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, let's talk
about what happened to his life

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:24.410 align:middle line:90%
and how that even happened.

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:26.237 align:middle line:84%
How did anyone even
know about this man?

00:18:26.237 --> 00:18:27.320 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: It's incredible.

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.020 align:middle line:84%
I really don't have
the slightest clue.

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:31.015 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm working
on trying to do

00:18:31.015 --> 00:18:33.140 align:middle line:84%
a little documentary about
this because it's really

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:34.400 align:middle line:90%
an amazing story.

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And my cousin, who's watching
now, she's like the caregiver

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.880 align:middle line:84%
for my grandmother
right now, my nana,

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.625 align:middle line:84%
she's digging through
all the old photos

00:18:42.625 --> 00:18:44.000 align:middle line:84%
to bring up the
photos that I can

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.310 align:middle line:90%
put in a little mini series.

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:47.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's tell
about his life-- who he was.

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:50.375 align:middle line:84%
And we know he was
married your grandma,

00:18:50.375 --> 00:18:52.270 align:middle line:90%
and he was from St. Thomas.

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:54.442 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's find
out what happened.

00:18:54.442 --> 00:18:56.900 align:middle line:84%
Because as you said, he only
had an eighth-grade education.

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:58.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah, he started
out as a fisherman.

00:18:58.410 --> 00:18:59.900 align:middle line:90%
He was a master fisherman.

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:03.350 align:middle line:84%
Everybody knew him for his
capability and ability to fish.

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:05.960 align:middle line:84%
He literally fed entire
neighborhoods with fish.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.580 align:middle line:84%
He would go out
and fish and fish,

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:10.140 align:middle line:84%
and he would bring
home the most--

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:11.640 align:middle line:84%
my first day home
from the hospital.

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.755 align:middle line:90%
I remember being there.

00:19:13.755 --> 00:19:14.555 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hospital?

00:19:14.555 --> 00:19:16.610 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: My first day
home from being born, yeah.

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:17.315 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You remember?

00:19:17.315 --> 00:19:18.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I remember the
first day they brought me

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:19.603 align:middle line:90%
to the house, yeah.

00:19:19.603 --> 00:19:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And I told them what they fed
me and everybody went crazy.

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:22.823 align:middle line:90%
It was fish.

00:19:22.823 --> 00:19:24.240 align:middle line:84%
My grandmother
gave me table food.

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.615 align:middle line:84%
She gave me some
of the bluefish,

00:19:25.615 --> 00:19:28.310 align:middle line:84%
which actually became my
favorite fish until I stopped

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:29.810 align:middle line:90%
eating fish, and that's--

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:31.250 align:middle line:90%
my grandfather caught that fish.

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:32.345 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You're a vegan today?

00:19:32.345 --> 00:19:33.080 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: Yes.

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:34.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, that's
what I thought.

00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:35.090 align:middle line:90%
I recall.

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:36.577 align:middle line:90%
And we'll talk about that, too.

00:19:36.577 --> 00:19:37.827 align:middle line:90%
I'm writing little notes here.

00:19:37.827 --> 00:19:38.910 align:middle line:90%
Vegan.

00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:39.710 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:44.030 align:middle line:84%
All right, there are so many
things to ask at this point.

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And I do want to get back to
this notion of having knowledge

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:49.610 align:middle line:84%
from the first day
you incarnated here,

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:51.230 align:middle line:90%
because that's, again--

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:52.470 align:middle line:90%
that has implications.

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:53.780 align:middle line:90%
So you remember this.

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:56.440 align:middle line:84%
So your grandfather was
this master fisherman.

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:59.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yep, he was
a master fisherman.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:03.475 align:middle line:84%
And at some point, he
began doing architecture.

00:20:03.475 --> 00:20:05.600 align:middle line:84%
Now I don't have the exact
point when that started,

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.100 align:middle line:84%
but it started long
before any of us

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:09.350 align:middle line:84%
were even born-- my
cousins and everybody else.

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:11.180 align:middle line:84%
He started doing
construction on houses

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:13.160 align:middle line:84%
and actually designing
the houses to be built.

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now he also
ended up in Egypt

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:18.560 align:middle line:84%
in a joint
archaeological endeavor,

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.210 align:middle line:84%
I think, with a
German team, right?

00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:21.377 align:middle line:10%
An American and German team?

00:20:21.377 --> 00:20:22.177 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:20:22.177 --> 00:20:23.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For a part
of his, I recall,

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:26.657 align:middle line:84%
restoration of the Great
Pyramid or the Sphinx?

00:20:26.657 --> 00:20:28.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: The Great
Pyramids and the Sphinx.

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:28.745 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:20:28.745 --> 00:20:30.260 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Both
needed restoration.

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:32.600 align:middle line:84%
Some areas of the Great
Pyramid on one of the corners

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:35.000 align:middle line:84%
or whatever was deteriorating,
and the Great Sphinx,

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.417 align:middle line:84%
from time to time,
it always needs

00:20:36.417 --> 00:20:39.290 align:middle line:84%
to be fixed because
of weathering

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:42.140 align:middle line:84%
patterns and everything
else and deterioration.

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:44.412 align:middle line:84%
So I thought it was so
interesting like, you know--

00:20:44.412 --> 00:20:45.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why are
they calling him?

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:47.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah, exactly.

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:50.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is like
just an amazing thing.

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:52.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's like-- it's
well documented.

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:53.690 align:middle line:84%
So it's not even-- you
know, it's well documented,

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:54.490 align:middle line:90%
which is amazing.

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:57.110 align:middle line:84%
That's why I have to do a
little tidbit on it because I'd

00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:58.490 align:middle line:84%
like people to know a little
bit more about my grandfather.

00:20:58.490 --> 00:20:59.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I'd
love to see that.

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:00.230 align:middle line:90%
I'd love to see that.

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:00.440 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:03.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so now let me ask
now about the Puerto Rican side

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:05.750 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:08.810 align:middle line:84%
If their understanding was
their family history was

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:13.090 align:middle line:84%
as a part of the architectural
team of these megalithic sites

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:15.320 align:middle line:84%
and that had been passed
down, did the women

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:18.230 align:middle line:84%
or the men in your
lineage and your mother,

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:22.130 align:middle line:84%
and aunt, and their
lineage have the ability

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:23.990 align:middle line:90%
to see, for example?

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:26.490 align:middle line:84%
Were any of them
psychic or unique

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:27.760 align:middle line:90%
in their perceptions of life?

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:28.560 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:29.810 align:middle line:90%
I have an aunt--

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:33.770 align:middle line:84%
now she was really amazing
because she had the capability

00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:36.420 align:middle line:90%
of seeing way in the future.

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:39.862 align:middle line:84%
Now my dad was driving for this
company called Handi-Van, which

00:21:39.862 --> 00:21:41.570 align:middle line:84%
I think might be still
in business today,

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:43.970 align:middle line:84%
so it's well documented
this situation.

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:46.130 align:middle line:84%
He was driving
elderly people around.

00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:49.040 align:middle line:84%
My aunt contacted
us and she said--

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.390 align:middle line:90%
her name was Aunt Doris--

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:52.730 align:middle line:84%
she said, your father--
she told my mom,

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:54.980 align:middle line:84%
your husband's going to be
in a very bad car accident.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:57.440 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's going
to die, but his life

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:58.880 align:middle line:84%
is going to be
restored, but he'll

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.590 align:middle line:90%
be in the hospital for a while.

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:01.610 align:middle line:90%
And my mom went crazy.

00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:03.110 align:middle line:84%
Don't call me telling
me this stuff.

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:04.010 align:middle line:90%
This is scary stuff.

00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:05.600 align:middle line:90%
Blah, blah, blah.

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.520 align:middle line:84%
Three weeks later,
a tractor trailer

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:10.820 align:middle line:84%
jumps across the median,
hits him head on in the van,

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:13.670 align:middle line:84%
all eight people
in the car died.

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:14.930 align:middle line:90%
He was loaded with blood.

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:17.930 align:middle line:84%
The hospital called, pronounced
him dead at the scene.

00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:20.130 align:middle line:84%
And when we got to the
hospital, he was alive.

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:21.950 align:middle line:90%
He had a broken collarbone.

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:24.398 align:middle line:84%
All the blood that
was on him wasn't his.

00:22:24.398 --> 00:22:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And this is another
well-documented--

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:27.857 align:middle line:84%
can be searched, researched,
can be looked up,

00:22:27.857 --> 00:22:29.210 align:middle line:90%
well-documented event.

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And she called it
weeks ahead of time.

00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:33.370 align:middle line:90%
And that was Aunt Doris.

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:34.720 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately she's
passed away now,

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.762 align:middle line:84%
but she used to do things
like this all the time.

00:22:36.762 --> 00:22:39.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did the family feel
threatened by her in general

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:40.540 align:middle line:84%
or did they start
paying attention?

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:43.082 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: They started paying
real close attention after that

00:22:43.082 --> 00:22:46.090 align:middle line:84%
one because other things were
very small, maybe coincidences,

00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:49.760 align:middle line:84%
but this was the largest
thing on the scale.

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:50.560 align:middle line:90%
It was amazing.

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:52.435 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let me ask
you another question.

00:22:52.435 --> 00:22:55.100 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, I'm seeing 50
different paths of conversation

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:56.000 align:middle line:90%
to take right now.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.250 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's just stay
on that one for a minute

00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:01.770 align:middle line:84%
before we go back
to some other stuff.

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:05.420 align:middle line:84%
After Aunt Doris started
being respected by the family

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:08.960 align:middle line:84%
and she'd tell them things,
did they alter their behavior

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:10.390 align:middle line:90%
and alter the outcomes?

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:13.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: People became much
more aware and much more

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:15.990 align:middle line:84%
cautious of situations to try
to figure out when things were

00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:16.790 align:middle line:90%
going--

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:18.170 align:middle line:84%
to have better intuition
about when things

00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:19.420 align:middle line:90%
were going to happen or occur.

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:21.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did they actually
avoid those things happening?

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Some people
avoided some of the things,

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:24.680 align:middle line:90%
and some people weren't able to.

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:26.760 align:middle line:10%
So I guess it--

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:29.790 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I mean, that's, to
me, interesting, of course.

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:33.500 align:middle line:10%
Because as the saying goes,
it is written, darling,

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:37.820 align:middle line:10%
my ballet guru teacher used to
tell me, it is written darling.

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:42.653 align:middle line:10%
And so you wonder in something
like that if-- your father,

00:23:42.653 --> 00:23:45.070 align:middle line:10%
if he was driving for a living,
he couldn't avoid driving.

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:45.870 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:49.478 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So it sounded like
this was destined to occur

00:23:49.478 --> 00:23:51.020 align:middle line:10%
or she would not
have been seeing it.

00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:54.930 align:middle line:84%
So in some timeline, some
reality, it had occurred.

00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:56.810 align:middle line:84%
But as you say,
some of the events

00:23:56.810 --> 00:24:00.170 align:middle line:84%
were actually avoided by simply
increasing one's awareness.

00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:01.655 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Right
example, let's say

00:24:01.655 --> 00:24:04.280 align:middle line:84%
he decided, well, I'm not going
to drive for Handi-Van anymore.

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:06.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to stop
driving for this company.

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And let's say he decided to
go into mechanic work, which

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:11.468 align:middle line:90%
is what he did before.

00:24:11.468 --> 00:24:13.010 align:middle line:84%
He could have averted
that situation.

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:16.510 align:middle line:84%
But how do you know for sure
this is really going to happen?

00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:17.690 align:middle line:90%
I need this money.

00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:19.730 align:middle line:84%
I have to pay my bills
and take care of my kids.

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:21.813 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you don't
know where-- in this case,

00:24:21.813 --> 00:24:22.615 align:middle line:90%
she was very clear.

00:24:22.615 --> 00:24:23.990 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they
have those things,

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:25.160 align:middle line:90%
but they're not as specific.

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:29.750 align:middle line:10%
It's like, one dream, I rolled
in the side of a-- it almost

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:33.130 align:middle line:10%
looked like a Costco, but it was
all white with white walls that

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:35.270 align:middle line:10%
rolled up and my
white car inside,

00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:37.610 align:middle line:10%
and the radio came on
on its own it said,

00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:40.040 align:middle line:10%
we know you've been through
a lot of loss and pain,

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.060 align:middle line:10%
but there's more coming.

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:42.757 align:middle line:10%
Know we're with you.

00:24:42.757 --> 00:24:44.840 align:middle line:84%
So my father and my son
were going in a helicopter

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:46.880 align:middle line:90%
the next day over Yosemite.

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:48.320 align:middle line:90%
So I tried to interfere.

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.490 align:middle line:90%
I did interfere.

00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:51.950 align:middle line:84%
I said, I can't
let my son go, Dad.

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:54.720 align:middle line:84%
You can go if you want,
but I can't let my son go.

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:55.520 align:middle line:90%
It was fine.

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:58.707 align:middle line:10%
But three days later, my mentor,
the woman I mentioned, died.

00:24:58.707 --> 00:24:59.790 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: Oh, my goodness.

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:01.130 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah, she died.

00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:04.040 align:middle line:10%
And she was a big
person, and personality,

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:06.200 align:middle line:10%
and an influence in my life.

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And so I didn't know
where it was coming from.

00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And so you can't necessarily--
it is written to an extent

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:14.960 align:middle line:84%
but, again, when
people listened,

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:17.440 align:middle line:84%
they were able to
avoid some of it.

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.770 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:19.610 align:middle line:90%
It's a tricky thing.

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:20.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's a tricky thing.

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:21.660 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:26.510 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK, so your
grandfather had then done this.

00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:28.760 align:middle line:84%
He had worked with
this German team

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:30.690 align:middle line:90%
on the restoration and such.

00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:35.030 align:middle line:10%
Now continue your own
family story then into you

00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:38.330 align:middle line:10%
because this whole notion
that you remember your life

00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:41.060 align:middle line:10%
from birth, you came
in fully awake aware,

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:42.375 align:middle line:10%
and you remember from birth.

00:25:42.375 --> 00:25:45.410 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: I was a
10.5 pound baby--

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:47.080 align:middle line:10%
10 pounds, 5 ounces.

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:48.540 align:middle line:10%
I was a 10-month baby as well.

00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:49.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:50.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: I was 10, 10, 5.

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:53.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:55.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: My mom,
everybody jokes,

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.660 align:middle line:84%
said I split her
from front to back.

00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:58.190 align:middle line:84%
She actually didn't
have a C-section.

00:25:58.190 --> 00:25:58.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:25:58.990 --> 00:25:59.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:25:59.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ow.

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:00.748 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah, I know.

00:26:00.748 --> 00:26:03.200 align:middle line:84%
So for whatever reason,
according to my family,

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.880 align:middle line:84%
I was in the hospital
for three weeks.

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:05.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why?

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:07.055 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: They
had to keep trying

00:26:07.055 --> 00:26:08.630 align:middle line:10%
to transfuse me
and everything else

00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:11.750 align:middle line:10%
because I was having
some kind of rejection.

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:13.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's part of
the Rh negative issue?

00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:15.130 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: That's
what my cousin told

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:16.830 align:middle line:90%
me, who was closest to my mom.

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:18.320 align:middle line:90%
She's my older cousin.

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
wow, I gotta really

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:21.463 align:middle line:84%
get a lot more
information about this.

00:26:21.463 --> 00:26:23.580 align:middle line:84%
My mom never told
me about that part.

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And this I found out when,
unfortunately, my dad

00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:28.890 align:middle line:84%
passed away recently after I
talked to you the last time,

00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:29.690 align:middle line:90%
after I--

00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:30.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, he did?

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:30.830 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:32.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Were you
expecting that at the time?

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:32.980 align:middle line:90%
Did you know?

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:33.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: No.

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:34.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What happened?

00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:38.090 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: He, unfortunately,
had a police brutality incident

00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:40.760 align:middle line:84%
about four years ago,
where they broke his back

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:43.220 align:middle line:84%
and gave him a
double concussion.

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:44.600 align:middle line:90%
Somebody made a 9-1-1 call.

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:47.090 align:middle line:84%
He was at a concert sitting
in the front row in a suit

00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:48.260 align:middle line:90%
that I bought him.

00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:51.358 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, they
didn't like his color,

00:26:51.358 --> 00:26:53.900 align:middle line:84%
so they called the cops and said
this guy just stole the seat

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:55.220 align:middle line:90%
in the front row, supposedly.

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:56.465 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm so sorry.

00:26:56.465 --> 00:26:58.850 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And four cops came
in and beat him up in front

00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:01.230 align:middle line:84%
of the whole concert, on all
the tapes, all the cameras--

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:02.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is in
the last two months?

00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:04.252 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: No, they did
this four years ago years.

00:27:04.252 --> 00:27:06.860 align:middle line:84%
But the concussion,
it messed his mind up.

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:07.985 align:middle line:90%
He started losing his mind.

00:27:07.985 --> 00:27:10.277 align:middle line:84%
Right after that, he started
forgetting so many things,

00:27:10.277 --> 00:27:11.090 align:middle line:90%
forgetting to eat.

00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:12.620 align:middle line:90%
He was already 74 at that time.

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:15.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so he had the
concussion at that time.

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:17.425 align:middle line:84%
What happened in the
last couple months?

00:27:17.425 --> 00:27:19.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Eating was
the biggest thing.

00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:20.330 align:middle line:90%
He keeps forgetting to eat.

00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:21.740 align:middle line:84%
Even if you give
him food and you

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:23.658 align:middle line:84%
try to force feed it to
him, if you walk away,

00:27:23.658 --> 00:27:24.950 align:middle line:90%
he'll forget you gave him food.

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:25.867 align:middle line:90%
He won't eat anything.

00:27:25.867 --> 00:27:28.640 align:middle line:84%
So he started getting
very malnourished.

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:31.287 align:middle line:84%
Went to the hospital to look
at that-- also, his back.

00:27:31.287 --> 00:27:32.120 align:middle line:90%
They broke his back.

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:33.800 align:middle line:84%
It started hurting
him really bad.

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:34.850 align:middle line:90%
They checked him in.

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:36.267 align:middle line:84%
And they said,
we're going to have

00:27:36.267 --> 00:27:39.080 align:middle line:84%
to try to figure out what
we can do for your back.

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, my dad had
turned to alcohol and pain

00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:44.210 align:middle line:90%
medicine.

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And he was on so much of
that when they took him

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:49.700 align:middle line:84%
in to the hospital
and didn't give him

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:54.260 align:middle line:84%
that, replacement of that,
he went through withdrawals.

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:56.690 align:middle line:84%
And that led him into a
seizure, and that turned

00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:59.307 align:middle line:90%
into 100 seizures in two days.

00:27:59.307 --> 00:28:00.890 align:middle line:84%
Even on the highest
seizure medication

00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:05.100 align:middle line:84%
they couldn't stop them, and
the seizures erased his mind.

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.287 align:middle line:90%
And then he became brain dead.

00:28:07.287 --> 00:28:08.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:09.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Gosh.

00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:11.780 align:middle line:90%
Well, I mean, I'm sorry.

00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:13.400 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Thank you.

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:16.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you had a
complex relationship with him.

00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:17.955 align:middle line:90%
He had a rough go of it himself?

00:28:17.955 --> 00:28:20.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah, he was
really a depressed person.

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:22.970 align:middle line:84%
His mom died when
he was 16, his dad

00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:25.100 align:middle line:84%
when he was just a small
boy, left the house, never

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:26.128 align:middle line:90%
came back.

00:28:26.128 --> 00:28:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And so he was depressed
miles of this life.

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:29.337 align:middle line:84%
And then I look
back, and I see he

00:28:29.337 --> 00:28:30.668 align:middle line:90%
was mentally ill and depressed.

00:28:30.668 --> 00:28:32.210 align:middle line:84%
So I started a
foundation in his name

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:35.570 align:middle line:84%
called the Carson Foundation
for Addiction and Depression.

00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:38.472 align:middle line:10%
And I located a very
good place in Florida

00:28:38.472 --> 00:28:40.430 align:middle line:10%
that can take people from
anywhere in the world

00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:43.580 align:middle line:10%
and help treat them
with that sickness--

00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:48.605 align:middle line:10%
any kind of addiction and
any kind of depression.

00:28:48.605 --> 00:28:50.837 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did you know
he was in the hospital

00:28:50.837 --> 00:28:51.920 align:middle line:90%
or did you find out after?

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:52.550 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: I found out after.

00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:54.330 align:middle line:84%
He had a neighbor take
him to the hospital.

00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:55.190 align:middle line:90%
His back was hurting too much.

00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:56.520 align:middle line:90%
He walked into the hospital.

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:57.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:58.130 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And by
the time I found out

00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:00.470 align:middle line:84%
he was in the hospital,
it was two days later.

00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:02.250 align:middle line:90%
He was already in a coma.

00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:04.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So did you have
a chance, on some level,

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:08.360 align:middle line:84%
on some plane, to be
able to kind of reconcile

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:09.620 align:middle line:90%
and say goodbye?

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:11.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well,
when I went up there

00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:13.877 align:middle line:84%
and while he was
out of it really,

00:29:13.877 --> 00:29:15.460 align:middle line:84%
I just spent some
time with him there.

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:17.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Because they're there.

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:17.360 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:19.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I did that with
my mom who was in a coma.

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:20.150 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Absolutely.

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:21.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
hearing everything.

00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:22.850 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah, ironically,
it was in the same hospital

00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:23.660 align:middle line:90%
that my mom died.

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And he was in the room
directly next to the room

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:26.660 align:middle line:90%
that she died in--

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:27.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:28.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: --in the same ICU.

00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:29.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So where
were you kind of--

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:32.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I was just trying to
communicate with him mentally

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:35.090 align:middle line:84%
and just let him know I love
him, rubbing him on his head,

00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:37.632 align:middle line:84%
kissing him on his head, letting
him know that it's OK to go.

00:29:37.632 --> 00:29:38.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Nice.

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:42.650 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: It's time for
you to just be free,

00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:43.572 align:middle line:90%
shed this mortal coil.

00:29:43.572 --> 00:29:45.530 align:middle line:84%
It's time for you to just
be free and be happy.

00:29:45.530 --> 00:29:46.035 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:46.035 --> 00:29:47.452 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: He
suffered long enough.

00:29:47.452 --> 00:29:49.460 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
yeah, and I know it

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:52.167 align:middle line:10%
created some trouble
in his relationships

00:29:52.167 --> 00:29:53.000 align:middle line:10%
with everybody else.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah, including
with me as well.

00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:55.300 align:middle line:90%
It was tough at times.

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:56.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:57.850 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: So I had to
move out when I was.

00:29:57.850 --> 00:30:00.120 align:middle line:84%
16 It was just just too much
dealing with the problems

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:00.920 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:01.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
that kind of pain.

00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:02.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Mm-hm.

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:03.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But still,
that those things still

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:05.570 align:middle line:84%
exist in this world gets
tears behind my eyes

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:08.270 align:middle line:84%
because we should be
less barbaric than that

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:09.080 align:middle line:90%
by now, right?

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:09.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right, right.

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:11.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you've had to
deal with stuff in your life?

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:12.180 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:12.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:13.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:18.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now, basically,
you're on top of it.

00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:18.910 align:middle line:90%
You've come out OK.

00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:19.710 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:22.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did you use those
challenges of your youth--

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:25.490 align:middle line:84%
this is just kind of
some psychology here--

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:27.500 align:middle line:84%
did they drive you
in a special way?

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And I asked that
for obvious reasons,

00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:35.000 align:middle line:84%
but also there was a trailer
for a film recently I saw.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.060 align:middle line:90%
The name of it as "Waves."

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:40.260 align:middle line:84%
At this moment--
it's coming out soon.

00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And the African-American
man in it was saying,

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:45.800 align:middle line:90%
you don't understand.

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:47.825 align:middle line:90%
We can't afford to be average.

00:30:47.825 --> 00:30:49.040 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah, that's true.

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:50.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We have to try harder.

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:52.160 align:middle line:90%
We can't afford average.

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:53.060 align:middle line:90%
They can, we can't.

00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:53.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:55.265 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So talk about
that for a moment,

00:30:55.265 --> 00:30:56.390 align:middle line:10%
just from your perspective.

00:30:56.390 --> 00:30:59.120 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, I'll
give you an example.

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:03.250 align:middle line:84%
The first time I came to Gaia,
which was 2016, to record--

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:05.873 align:middle line:84%
I came to just meet,
actually, with the owner.

00:31:05.873 --> 00:31:07.790 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know I was
going to be recording.

00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:10.220 align:middle line:84%
But I came in a
three-piece suit,

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:12.710 align:middle line:84%
and then they said,
you know, Melissa Tittl

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:16.130 align:middle line:84%
would like to ask you a
few questions about space.

00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:19.008 align:middle line:84%
So next thing I know, I'm doing
a whole interview on a camera.

00:31:19.008 --> 00:31:21.050 align:middle line:84%
And they were like, next
time you come here, just

00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:21.850 align:middle line:90%
put on a t-shirt.

00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:23.180 align:middle line:90%
You can be comfortable.

00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:24.540 align:middle line:90%
I was like, no.

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:26.748 align:middle line:84%
There's no way in the world
I'm going to come in here

00:31:26.748 --> 00:31:29.040 align:middle line:84%
with a t-shirt and a cap
on and being on TV talking

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:31.137 align:middle line:84%
about these kind of
controversial topics

00:31:31.137 --> 00:31:33.220 align:middle line:84%
and think people are going
to actually believe me.

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:35.130 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you're not gonna
do the Michael Moore thing.

00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:36.242 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: No, I can't--

00:31:36.242 --> 00:31:37.700 align:middle line:84%
some people can
get away with that.

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:40.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm on shows where I'm
in a three-piece suit,

00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:42.500 align:middle line:84%
and the next guy who's
doing his little bit,

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:44.218 align:middle line:84%
he's got a baseball
cap on and t-shirt.

00:31:44.218 --> 00:31:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And people will believe
him, but that's OK.

00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:49.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you feel that
that extra level of-- you

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:52.430 align:middle line:84%
have to go the extra mile
to receive the credibility,

00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:55.120 align:middle line:84%
as brilliant as you are
and as much as you've done,

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:57.950 align:middle line:84%
you still feel you still have
to create the appearance that

00:31:57.950 --> 00:32:01.880 align:middle line:84%
will bring forth respectability
on the first encounter?

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:04.450 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Absolutely,
there's no doubt about it.

00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:06.290 align:middle line:84%
And I live my life
that way, always

00:32:06.290 --> 00:32:08.300 align:middle line:90%
trying to excel and be above.

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:10.370 align:middle line:84%
I remember I came home
crying one day from school

00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:12.063 align:middle line:90%
because I had an A-minus.

00:32:12.063 --> 00:32:13.730 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was going
to get in trouble.

00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:17.020 align:middle line:84%
I had never had anything
less than an A or an A-plus.

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And my mom, of course,
she laughed at me,

00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:22.100 align:middle line:84%
but I literally
thought that was bad.

00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:24.695 align:middle line:84%
I was always seeking to
overachieve because I wanted

00:32:24.695 --> 00:32:26.570 align:middle line:84%
that level of respect,
and I understood early

00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:30.410 align:middle line:84%
on that because of my situation,
and my condition, and my race,

00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:34.187 align:middle line:84%
you have to do a little bit
more sometimes to get noticed.

00:32:34.187 --> 00:32:36.020 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't just just
from the History Channel

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:37.280 align:middle line:90%
that I got noticed.

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:39.340 align:middle line:10%
Like, to get into
lecturing, I literally

00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:42.410 align:middle line:10%
begged the Conscious Life
Expo, contacting the--

00:32:42.410 --> 00:32:45.013 align:middle line:10%
I bugged them for three
years each to get on.

00:32:45.013 --> 00:32:46.680 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah, there
aren't many people

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:47.840 align:middle line:10%
of color lecturing there.

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:49.140 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: No, not at all.

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:50.786 align:middle line:10%
And finally, after the
third year, both of them,

00:32:50.786 --> 00:32:52.703 align:middle line:10%
after three years of
bugging them and begging,

00:32:52.703 --> 00:32:54.290 align:middle line:10%
they finally gave me a chance.

00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:56.070 align:middle line:84%
And when I went in there, I
made sure I knocked it out

00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:56.870 align:middle line:90%
of the park.

00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:59.292 align:middle line:90%


00:32:59.292 --> 00:33:05.365 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so let's
go ahead and continue on.

00:33:05.365 --> 00:33:06.990 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to go back
for a moment to let

00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:10.830 align:middle line:84%
living life as a conscious
person from day one.

00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:13.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously, you
didn't know it any other way.

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:16.135 align:middle line:84%
So how did you operate--
how did it work for you?

00:33:16.135 --> 00:33:17.760 align:middle line:84%
Because I've always
wondered about this

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:20.010 align:middle line:84%
with conscious
babies, the ones who

00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:22.500 align:middle line:90%
come in with full awareness.

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:26.250 align:middle line:84%
How does it work to have your
full awareness and your memory

00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:28.798 align:middle line:84%
and not be able to do anything
with it in the little vehicle?

00:33:28.798 --> 00:33:30.090 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: It's kind of bizarre.

00:33:30.090 --> 00:33:34.170 align:middle line:84%
Like, I wasn't fully aware
of any past memories,

00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:35.940 align:middle line:84%
but I did have a
good understanding

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:38.190 align:middle line:84%
of exactly what was going
on, what people were saying.

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And I really couldn't understand
until a little bit later how.

00:33:41.370 --> 00:33:43.350 align:middle line:84%
But early on, I just
knew-- like, for example,

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:45.240 align:middle line:84%
my grandmother
put me on her lap.

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:47.520 align:middle line:84%
Everybody came over because
it was my first day home--

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:48.960 align:middle line:90%
I survived.

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.820 align:middle line:84%
They're all around
the kitchen table,

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:52.290 align:middle line:84%
and my grandmother
starts giving me

00:33:52.290 --> 00:33:55.710 align:middle line:84%
table food, which was bluefish,
not the whole chunk of fish,

00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:58.917 align:middle line:84%
but just sops of the juice
of the fish and everything.

00:33:58.917 --> 00:34:00.000 align:middle line:90%
And I remember that taste.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.065 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Kind of
like an initiation.

00:34:01.065 --> 00:34:02.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And I remember it,
and it was so clear,

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:06.780 align:middle line:84%
but nobody ever talked
about it after that.

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:08.429 align:middle line:84%
And one day, we all
came together for,

00:34:08.429 --> 00:34:10.710 align:middle line:84%
I think it was Thanksgiving
or something, and I said,

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:12.511 align:middle line:84%
you remember when you
put me on your lap

00:34:12.511 --> 00:34:14.969 align:middle line:84%
and gave me that blue fish,
that table food on my first day

00:34:14.969 --> 00:34:15.630 align:middle line:90%
home from the hospital?

00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:17.010 align:middle line:90%
You think hat was smart to do?

00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:18.989 align:middle line:90%
And everybody goes, what?

00:34:18.989 --> 00:34:20.460 align:middle line:90%
And everybody went crazy.

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:21.260 align:middle line:90%
Like, how--

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:22.770 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I remember.

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:25.440 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I just came
back from Cambria Heights

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:26.929 align:middle line:90%
two weeks ago.

00:34:26.929 --> 00:34:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And I went to go visit the old
house that we were living in,

00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:31.380 align:middle line:84%
because I was up there
doing a big lecture.

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:35.417 align:middle line:84%
And I saw the air conditioner in
the front of the house, the box

00:34:35.417 --> 00:34:37.500 align:middle line:84%
air conditioner where my
mom would put the bubbles

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:38.940 align:middle line:84%
when I was only 1
and 2 years old,

00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:40.190 align:middle line:90%
to fill the room with bubbles.

00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:41.610 align:middle line:90%
And all those things I remember.

00:34:41.610 --> 00:34:43.402 align:middle line:84%
I remember all the book
reports that I did.

00:34:43.402 --> 00:34:45.989 align:middle line:84%
My dad would make me do a
book report every single week

00:34:45.989 --> 00:34:46.830 align:middle line:90%
at that young age.

00:34:46.830 --> 00:34:48.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:52.425 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: All the memories are
so vivid still, which is great.

00:34:52.425 --> 00:34:54.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you're
the record keeper.

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:55.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah, my
recall is excellent.

00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:57.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, clearly.

00:34:57.580 --> 00:34:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And now what about
your own kids?

00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:00.840 align:middle line:90%
Now they grew up in privilege.

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:02.510 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah, they did.

00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:03.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:04.860 align:middle line:84%
So they didn't have
those struggles

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:06.480 align:middle line:90%
to overcome that you had.

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:09.078 align:middle line:84%
So what do you see
in the development

00:35:09.078 --> 00:35:10.120 align:middle line:90%
of your own children now?

00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:12.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I let them kind
of each take their own path.

00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:14.490 align:middle line:84%
I didn't overwhelm
them with my ideals.

00:35:14.490 --> 00:35:17.280 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to see how they
all kind of developed.

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:19.110 align:middle line:84%
I told them how I
felt, and I taught them

00:35:19.110 --> 00:35:23.070 align:middle line:84%
the way that I believe, but
I didn't punch it into them.

00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:25.800 align:middle line:84%
They had a very good life,
every single one of them.

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:28.862 align:middle line:84%
And they all are a little bit
different, which is great.

00:35:28.862 --> 00:35:31.320 align:middle line:84%
Some of the kids are eating
meat, some kids don't eat meat,

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:35.800 align:middle line:84%
some kids believe in
religion, and some don't.

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:39.000 align:middle line:84%
But overall, I gave them a
very good incentive early on.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.312 align:middle line:84%
I told them I wasn't going
to pay for any college

00:35:41.312 --> 00:35:42.770 align:middle line:84%
from the time they
were very small.

00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:43.800 align:middle line:84%
I said if you want
to go to college,

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:46.133 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have to get
a scholarship for athletics,

00:35:46.133 --> 00:35:49.750 align:middle line:84%
or academics, or
fund it for yourself,

00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:51.250 align:middle line:90%
but I'm not paying for it.

00:35:51.250 --> 00:35:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And if you get straight
A's, you'll get $500.

00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:57.315 align:middle line:84%
If you get one B,
you get nothing.

00:35:57.315 --> 00:35:58.190 align:middle line:90%
So I instilled that--

00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:59.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You incentivize them.

00:35:59.070 --> 00:35:59.800 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: I incentivized them.

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:01.883 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And how did they
rise to that challenge?

00:36:01.883 --> 00:36:04.740 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: They all became
Division I athletes.

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:08.400 align:middle line:84%
All excelled-- state champion
in boxing, my youngest son.

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.530 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they all--

00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:14.070 align:middle line:84%
University of North Carolina
Greensboro, Elon University.

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:16.570 align:middle line:84%
My one daughter had
15 offers by the time

00:36:16.570 --> 00:36:19.200 align:middle line:84%
she got to the 10th
grade for scholarships.

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.367 align:middle line:90%
They all excelled, you know?

00:36:20.367 --> 00:36:21.167 align:middle line:90%
All excelled.

00:36:21.167 --> 00:36:22.755 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Did they
ever resent you,

00:36:22.755 --> 00:36:24.550 align:middle line:10%
that you wouldn't
do that for them,

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:27.450 align:middle line:10%
or did they know that you
created a sense of their own

00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:29.158 align:middle line:10%
excellence and help them--

00:36:29.158 --> 00:36:31.200 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: They loved it,
and they thank me for it

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.140 align:middle line:10%
to this current day.

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:33.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's so wonderful.

00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:35.307 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: There's so
many things in life now--

00:36:35.307 --> 00:36:37.173 align:middle line:90%
they're all grown up, obviously.

00:36:37.173 --> 00:36:38.715 align:middle line:84%
And when things come
at them, they're

00:36:38.715 --> 00:36:39.940 align:middle line:90%
just like, OK, whatever.

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:41.140 align:middle line:90%
They're used to a work load.

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:42.930 align:middle line:90%
They're used to being on time.

00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:44.490 align:middle line:90%
They're used to having so many--

00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:46.700 align:middle line:84%
multitasking and having
a lot of things to do,

00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:48.870 align:middle line:84%
so nothing really
overwhelms them.

00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:49.838 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:36:49.838 --> 00:36:51.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I want to see
a movie on your life,

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:53.020 align:middle line:90%
but that will be down the road.

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:54.600 align:middle line:84%
You're still a little too young
to have a movie on your life.

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:55.230 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I'll tell you
one more important thing.

00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:56.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, do.

00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:58.472 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I never beat my kids,
and I never yelled at him.

00:36:58.472 --> 00:36:59.427 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:36:59.427 --> 00:37:00.510 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah, important.

00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:02.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Nor did
I. I don't believe

00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:03.885 align:middle line:84%
that's the way you do
to another human being.

00:37:03.885 --> 00:37:05.080 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: You can't do it.

00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:05.340 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:06.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All you do
is traumatize them.

00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:07.650 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: That's it.

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:08.430 align:middle line:90%
You make them sick.

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:09.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You make them sick.

00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:10.230 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I went back
to my neighborhood,

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:10.740 align:middle line:90%
and I'm telling you--

00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:12.823 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting a little
emotional because-- you know,

00:37:12.823 --> 00:37:14.330 align:middle line:90%
thinking about it--

00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:15.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's OK.

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:17.845 align:middle line:90%
I hear you-- feel you.

00:37:17.845 --> 00:37:19.470 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: The people
there are hurting.

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:20.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:24.080 align:middle line:90%


00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:26.330 align:middle line:90%
They're traumatized every day.

00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:27.500 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:30.357 align:middle line:84%
They're dead, locked up,
they're sick, they've got PTSD,

00:37:30.357 --> 00:37:31.190 align:middle line:90%
they became abusers.

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:33.800 align:middle line:90%


00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:35.150 align:middle line:90%
It's horrible.

00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:37.776 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty bad.

00:37:37.776 --> 00:37:41.015 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And they're tucked
away, and the media ignores--

00:37:41.015 --> 00:37:43.870 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: They got all butt
whoopings that everybody got.

00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:45.280 align:middle line:90%
They got all the yellings.

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.622 align:middle line:90%
They got all the beatings.

00:37:46.622 --> 00:37:47.830 align:middle line:90%
They got all the punishments.

00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:50.110 align:middle line:90%
But that doesn't work.

00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:52.840 align:middle line:84%
You can't take children and
beat them, and yell at them,

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:54.490 align:middle line:84%
and tell them all
kind of crazy stuff,

00:37:54.490 --> 00:37:56.200 align:middle line:90%
and expect them to be OK.

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:58.833 align:middle line:84%
Only a small amount of kids
will make it out of that OK,

00:37:58.833 --> 00:38:00.250 align:middle line:84%
and the rest of
them will struggle

00:38:00.250 --> 00:38:01.417 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of their lives.

00:38:01.417 --> 00:38:02.950 align:middle line:84%
We're creating a
sick environment.

00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:05.847 align:middle line:84%
We're creating a sick race
of people of all skin colors

00:38:05.847 --> 00:38:07.930 align:middle line:84%
by doing this to them, and
treating them that way,

00:38:07.930 --> 00:38:09.513 align:middle line:84%
and beating them,
and yelling at them.

00:38:09.513 --> 00:38:11.270 align:middle line:90%
You can't do that.

00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:12.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:14.860 align:middle line:90%


00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:21.337 align:middle line:10%
I don't know myself on this
level, but in modern times,

00:38:21.337 --> 00:38:23.170 align:middle line:10%
people look to the
African-American culture,

00:38:23.170 --> 00:38:25.628 align:middle line:10%
and they'll often say, well,
there wasn't a father present.

00:38:25.628 --> 00:38:26.580 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:28.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That
phenomena, which you've

00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:31.360 align:middle line:84%
reversed big time
in your genetics

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:32.890 align:middle line:90%
and your lineage you were there.

00:38:32.890 --> 00:38:35.200 align:middle line:84%
Your dad was-- he was
screwed up, but he was there.

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:36.117 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah, right.

00:38:36.117 --> 00:38:38.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He was there.

00:38:38.330 --> 00:38:42.820 align:middle line:10%
So what's happening right now--

00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:45.100 align:middle line:10%
tell us what's happening
in African-American culture

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:46.210 align:middle line:10%
in that way.

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:50.920 align:middle line:84%
Are the men starting to stay
or is the phenomena continuing?

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:53.783 align:middle line:84%
And why has it
happened this way?

00:38:53.783 --> 00:38:56.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I'll start by telling
you why it happened first.

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:56.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:57.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Because that's
the important part

00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:58.632 align:middle line:90%
that people need to understand.

00:38:58.632 --> 00:39:01.690 align:middle line:84%
When you look into the
history of, unfortunately,

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:04.687 align:middle line:84%
racism on this planet, not just
even in the African-American

00:39:04.687 --> 00:39:05.770 align:middle line:90%
culture but all cultures--

00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:06.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, all racism.

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:07.210 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:14.230 align:middle line:84%
You begin to realize that the
way that we have been oppressed

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:16.120 align:middle line:84%
and the way that
slavery occurred,

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:19.810 align:middle line:84%
you were basically making
brother fight against brother

00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:24.370 align:middle line:84%
and also a lot of the raping,
and you're just a person

00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:26.410 align:middle line:90%
here to mate with these women--

00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:28.842 align:middle line:84%
you're like a buck so you
mate, mate, mate, mate, mate,

00:39:28.842 --> 00:39:30.050 align:middle line:90%
and then you're out of there.

00:39:30.050 --> 00:39:31.110 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
take these babies,

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:32.318 align:middle line:90%
and we're going to sell them.

00:39:32.318 --> 00:39:34.030 align:middle line:90%
It's like a breeding plan.

00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:35.860 align:middle line:84%
Now what's important
to understand

00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:38.080 align:middle line:84%
is in your DNA-- your
DNA stores memories.

00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:39.330 align:middle line:90%
This is scientifically proven.

00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:40.413 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:39:40.413 --> 00:39:42.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: You also have
epigenetic memories.

00:39:42.610 --> 00:39:44.470 align:middle line:84%
These epigenetic
memories can persist

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:45.860 align:middle line:90%
for 15 to 20 generations.

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:46.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:48.610 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: So what happened to--

00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:50.580 align:middle line:84%
if I had in any previous
people in my family

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:53.222 align:middle line:84%
that were involved in
slavery, those memories, all

00:39:53.222 --> 00:39:55.180 align:middle line:84%
those tortures, and all
those mindsets, and all

00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:56.847 align:middle line:84%
those teachings, and
all those beatings,

00:39:56.847 --> 00:39:59.140 align:middle line:84%
and all that structure
that was put into them

00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:01.810 align:middle line:84%
back then is inside
of me as well.

00:40:01.810 --> 00:40:04.462 align:middle line:84%
Some of us have the capability
of reprogramming ourselves

00:40:04.462 --> 00:40:06.670 align:middle line:84%
a little bit easier than
others, but a lot of people,

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:08.210 align:middle line:90%
they don't have the capability.

00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:10.630 align:middle line:84%
They're living out
past ancient memories

00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:14.722 align:middle line:84%
that have been taught and
bred into them in modern era.

00:40:14.722 --> 00:40:16.180 align:middle line:84%
So that's where
the problem starts.

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:18.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The breaking
apart of the family

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:20.365 align:middle line:84%
was the critical
basis for slavery.

00:40:20.365 --> 00:40:23.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Exactly, they
would take a woman,

00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:24.460 align:middle line:84%
and they would
take away the son.

00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:25.877 align:middle line:84%
He's going to go
up for sale here.

00:40:25.877 --> 00:40:27.220 align:middle line:90%
The daughter, she's a wench.

00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:30.040 align:middle line:84%
She's going off
for sale over here.

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And she'll be raped,
and she'll have babies.

00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:34.090 align:middle line:84%
The guy, he's a buck
if he's strong enough.

00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:36.132 align:middle line:84%
He's going to mate with
all these different women

00:40:36.132 --> 00:40:39.700 align:middle line:84%
till they can have strong
babies that can go do the work.

00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:41.710 align:middle line:84%
It was bred in to
not be a father,

00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:44.085 align:middle line:84%
not be there for your children,
to just have sex and run.

00:40:44.085 --> 00:40:46.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're just being
used as a commodity yourself.

00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:47.500 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Exactly.

00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:50.733 align:middle line:84%
And people don't realize
that's in the genome.

00:40:50.733 --> 00:40:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And slavery just ended
not too long ago,

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.430 align:middle line:84%
so it's going to persist
for quite a while.

00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:56.830 align:middle line:84%
So part of my mission
is to help reprogram

00:40:56.830 --> 00:40:59.650 align:middle line:84%
the mind of the
African-American, reprogram

00:40:59.650 --> 00:41:01.150 align:middle line:84%
the way that we
think about things.

00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:03.447 align:middle line:84%
So to help us heal
ourselves, we've

00:41:03.447 --> 00:41:04.780 align:middle line:90%
got to heal from the inside out.

00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:05.835 align:middle line:90%
And it's getting better.

00:41:05.835 --> 00:41:07.210 align:middle line:84%
When I went to
Brooklyn, New York

00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:12.100 align:middle line:84%
to do my lecture two weeks ago,
there were 500 people there

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:15.140 align:middle line:90%
at that St. Francis College.

00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:18.400 align:middle line:84%
I think there we might have
been five other races there.

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:20.110 align:middle line:84%
But to see that
many people coming

00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:22.280 align:middle line:84%
for this kind of
information, it blew me away.

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:23.080 align:middle line:90%
I was shocked.

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:25.210 align:middle line:84%
When I walked in the
room, I go, whoa.

00:41:25.210 --> 00:41:26.030 align:middle line:90%
That's incredible.

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:28.350 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea that
was going to happen.

00:41:28.350 --> 00:41:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And these people were really
into this kind of information--

00:41:30.970 --> 00:41:32.950 align:middle line:84%
alternative thinking,
away from religion,

00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:35.740 align:middle line:84%
more into spirituality,
unconditional love,

00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:36.550 align:middle line:90%
all these things.

00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:39.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the
communities of black people now

00:41:39.130 --> 00:41:42.520 align:middle line:84%
around the world, especially
in America in particular,

00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:44.960 align:middle line:84%
has been changing and
going for the better.

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:47.410 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot more
fathers at home

00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:50.360 align:middle line:84%
now, a lot more fathers
taking care of their kids.

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:51.390 align:middle line:90%
It's getting better.

00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:52.598 align:middle line:90%
They're getting a lot better.

00:41:52.598 --> 00:41:56.595 align:middle line:90%


00:41:56.595 --> 00:41:59.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like you
say, it's still so raw.

00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:01.230 align:middle line:90%
It's fresh.

00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:04.650 align:middle line:10%
It's only so many generations
ago, not that many.

00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:06.960 align:middle line:10%
And the repercussions
of it and the prejudice

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:09.360 align:middle line:10%
that has continued
since then has barely

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:12.540 align:middle line:10%
waned in some parts of even
the United States, certainly

00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:14.340 align:middle line:10%
the United States.

00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:19.020 align:middle line:10%
It seems to have taken more of a
backseat in Britain and Europe,

00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:21.690 align:middle line:10%
at least for
African-Americans anyway--

00:42:21.690 --> 00:42:24.760 align:middle line:10%
for blacks than it has
for African-Americans.

00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:27.053 align:middle line:84%
America seems to be a really
tough culture in this way.

00:42:27.053 --> 00:42:28.470 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: It's
pretty tough, yeah.

00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:31.877 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: you know, I had
a conversation with Raymond

00:42:31.877 --> 00:42:33.960 align:middle line:84%
Tarpey, and he and I had
been talking on the phone

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:35.030 align:middle line:90%
beforehand.

00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And it was a really
interesting thing

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.580 align:middle line:84%
he brought up that we
did not get into when

00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:40.510 align:middle line:90%
the interview came around.

00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:48.880 align:middle line:84%
He said that America's
immaturity and entitlement

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:52.810 align:middle line:84%
is, in part, to do with the
fact that this country never

00:42:52.810 --> 00:42:57.940 align:middle line:84%
had to actually pay up and
reconcile with slavery, where

00:42:57.940 --> 00:43:01.960 align:middle line:84%
in other countries there was
some kind of reconciliation,

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:03.055 align:middle line:90%
compensation, something.

00:43:03.055 --> 00:43:03.670 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:05.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it
never happened here.

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:06.715 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:43:06.715 --> 00:43:09.760 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: In your
mind, how can that

00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:13.102 align:middle line:10%
be healed when the country
never took responsibility

00:43:13.102 --> 00:43:13.935 align:middle line:10%
for what we've done?

00:43:13.935 --> 00:43:16.352 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: They keep saying,
oh, that happened in the past,

00:43:16.352 --> 00:43:18.770 align:middle line:84%
and that was our ancestors
or our relatives or whatever,

00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:19.570 align:middle line:90%
but it wasn't us.

00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:23.020 align:middle line:84%
But again, science needs
to come to the forefront

00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:26.050 align:middle line:84%
now and explain the
suffering that's going on.

00:43:26.050 --> 00:43:27.820 align:middle line:84%
People are suffering
from PTSD from things

00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:29.140 align:middle line:90%
that happened 200 years ago.

00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:30.715 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:43:30.715 --> 00:43:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't
agree with you more.

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:35.240 align:middle line:84%
This is where science
and spirituality actually

00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:36.490 align:middle line:90%
need to come forward together.

00:43:36.490 --> 00:43:37.600 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes, I agree.

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:38.200 align:middle line:90%
I agree 100%.

00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:39.658 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when
you do your talks

00:43:39.658 --> 00:43:42.190 align:middle line:84%
to these groups
of people, do you

00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:44.125 align:middle line:84%
approach it from a
genetic standpoint

00:43:44.125 --> 00:43:45.250 align:middle line:90%
and a spiritual standpoint?

00:43:45.250 --> 00:43:45.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:46.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What do you do?

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:46.880 align:middle line:90%
What's your story?

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:49.385 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: A lot of my lectures
are very scientific because I

00:43:49.385 --> 00:43:51.010 align:middle line:84%
like to show people
the spiritual side,

00:43:51.010 --> 00:43:52.480 align:middle line:84%
but I like the show
them-- before I

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:54.910 align:middle line:84%
get to the spiritual
aspect, I show them science.

00:43:54.910 --> 00:43:56.170 align:middle line:90%
So they can say, oh, wow.

00:43:56.170 --> 00:43:57.170 align:middle line:90%
This is really possible.

00:43:57.170 --> 00:43:59.002 align:middle line:84%
These two things really
do work together.

00:43:59.002 --> 00:44:00.460 align:middle line:84%
Because people tend
to think things

00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:05.050 align:middle line:84%
in spirituality and spiritual
concepts are more like "magic"

00:44:05.050 --> 00:44:07.925 align:middle line:84%
and some kind of way
things are just happening,

00:44:07.925 --> 00:44:09.800 align:middle line:84%
but I like to show them
why they're happening

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:10.800 align:middle line:90%
and how their happening.

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:13.038 align:middle line:84%
This is the science
behind why this works

00:44:13.038 --> 00:44:14.830 align:middle line:84%
and why these kind of
thought process work,

00:44:14.830 --> 00:44:16.750 align:middle line:84%
why these kind of
meditations work.

00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:19.240 align:middle line:84%
And then they begin to go,
wow, this is incredible.

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:22.210 align:middle line:84%
Now they're going,
I see, and, I want

00:44:22.210 --> 00:44:25.150 align:middle line:84%
to follow this path
instead of the other path.

00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:27.130 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, religion
really held us down

00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:28.090 align:middle line:90%
a lot more as well.

00:44:28.090 --> 00:44:29.470 align:middle line:84%
That's another big
thing that happened.

00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:30.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:32.613 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: People tend to think
that religions got spread

00:44:32.613 --> 00:44:34.600 align:middle line:84%
around the planet by
love, but it really

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:38.740 align:middle line:84%
got spread around the planet by
force, by rape, and by murder,

00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:39.730 align:middle line:90%
unfortunately.

00:44:39.730 --> 00:44:40.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, absolutely.

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:44.370 align:middle line:84%
And if you're in America, God's
a white guy with a white beard.

00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:45.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Right,
with a magic wand.

00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:46.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:51.700 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And it robs
you of your identity.

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:53.740 align:middle line:84%
Almost every race
has an identity

00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:55.840 align:middle line:90%
that they can correlate with.

00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:59.620 align:middle line:84%
But in America, we're
called African-Americans,

00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:03.935 align:middle line:84%
but there's not Asian-Americans
or Caucasian-Americans.

00:45:03.935 --> 00:45:05.560 align:middle line:84%
So we've lost-- we've
been disconnected

00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:08.650 align:middle line:84%
from our roots, disconnected
from the alchemical sciences

00:45:08.650 --> 00:45:10.150 align:middle line:90%
that we used to know.

00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, when we
got into the religious aspect

00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:16.120 align:middle line:84%
of things, we were only
given small amounts

00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:21.380 align:middle line:84%
of verses that would approve
slavery and slave tactics.

00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:23.580 align:middle line:84%
And that has still
been embedded in us

00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:25.870 align:middle line:84%
till this very day in
the religious aspects.

00:45:25.870 --> 00:45:29.140 align:middle line:84%
So people have gotten
used to that system,

00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:30.915 align:middle line:84%
and some people actually
rejoice and think

00:45:30.915 --> 00:45:32.290 align:middle line:84%
that all those
millions of people

00:45:32.290 --> 00:45:35.215 align:middle line:84%
had to die just so that they
can learn what's in that book.

00:45:35.215 --> 00:45:36.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A lot of
this was exemplified

00:45:36.970 --> 00:45:40.120 align:middle line:84%
in a film called
"Harriet," which is out,

00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:43.000 align:middle line:84%
a character, a heroine
of her day, a slave who

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.500 align:middle line:84%
broke away and started becoming
a part of the Underground

00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:46.300 align:middle line:90%
Railroad.

00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:48.175 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Oh, yeah,
yeah, that just came out.

00:45:48.175 --> 00:45:49.595 align:middle line:90%
I have to go see it.

00:45:49.595 --> 00:45:50.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see everything.

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:51.535 align:middle line:90%
I'm a film buff.

00:45:51.535 --> 00:45:51.790 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:51.790 --> 00:45:52.882 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: OK.

00:45:52.882 --> 00:45:56.620 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: But they showed her
at the plantation or estate,

00:45:56.620 --> 00:46:02.650 align:middle line:10%
whatever it was calm, and they
showed a slave also who was

00:46:02.650 --> 00:46:06.100 align:middle line:10%
the minister, who was reading
to the other slaves on a Sunday

00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:09.730 align:middle line:10%
on behalf of the owners
of the plantation,

00:46:09.730 --> 00:46:11.892 align:middle line:10%
the passages that
reinforce their--

00:46:11.892 --> 00:46:12.850 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: There you go.

00:46:12.850 --> 00:46:14.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --subservience
to their masters.

00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:15.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: There you go.

00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:16.437 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's exactly
what happens.

00:46:16.437 --> 00:46:18.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Holy cow.

00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:19.757 align:middle line:90%
Is that how it worked?

00:46:19.757 --> 00:46:21.048 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: That's how it worked.

00:46:21.048 --> 00:46:22.563 align:middle line:84%
And the slave master
would sit there

00:46:22.563 --> 00:46:24.730 align:middle line:84%
to make sure they didn't
divert into any other parts

00:46:24.730 --> 00:46:24.970 align:middle line:90%
of the book.

00:46:24.970 --> 00:46:26.482 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: That's
exactly the scene

00:46:26.482 --> 00:46:28.190 align:middle line:10%
that's in this toward
the very beginning.

00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:28.930 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: It's a fact.

00:46:28.930 --> 00:46:29.930 align:middle line:90%
That's an actual fact.

00:46:29.930 --> 00:46:32.155 align:middle line:84%
Whoever made the movie, then
they went by real facts.

00:46:32.155 --> 00:46:34.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah, it was
a historical documentary.

00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:37.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously,
it's a film, so there's

00:46:37.570 --> 00:46:42.370 align:middle line:84%
going to be some dramatization,
but it basically was her story

00:46:42.370 --> 00:46:43.840 align:middle line:90%
and very well done.

00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:46.400 align:middle line:10%
I get fierce about
that particular topic.

00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:48.770 align:middle line:84%
I think that has to do
with some past of my own,

00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:51.735 align:middle line:84%
back in those areas in the
day that I'm aware of anyway.

00:46:51.735 --> 00:46:53.110 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well,
some people don't

00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:55.450 align:middle line:84%
realize that-- well,
reincarnation is real--

00:46:55.450 --> 00:46:57.340 align:middle line:84%
but some people may
realize it is real,

00:46:57.340 --> 00:46:58.882 align:middle line:84%
but they may not
realize that they've

00:46:58.882 --> 00:47:00.070 align:middle line:90%
been other races as well.

00:47:00.070 --> 00:47:00.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:47:00.770 --> 00:47:01.570 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:47:01.570 --> 00:47:03.815 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And not only
have they been other races,

00:47:03.815 --> 00:47:04.815 align:middle line:90%
you've been other sexes.

00:47:04.815 --> 00:47:06.290 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Mm-hmm, yeah.

00:47:06.290 --> 00:47:09.820 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And to
me, the beauty in--

00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:12.790 align:middle line:10%
some people say, why would I
want to focus on another time

00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:14.707 align:middle line:10%
when there's so much on
my plate in this time?

00:47:14.707 --> 00:47:16.165 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's like,
why would you want

00:47:16.165 --> 00:47:17.590 align:middle line:90%
to know history of any kind?

00:47:17.590 --> 00:47:20.650 align:middle line:84%
I think it has value to
know your personal history.

00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:24.145 align:middle line:84%
And I've taken people
through-- quite a few people

00:47:24.145 --> 00:47:25.395 align:middle line:90%
through past life regressions.

00:47:25.395 --> 00:47:26.195 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Oh, wow.

00:47:26.195 --> 00:47:29.350 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And in doing
so, the main thing

00:47:29.350 --> 00:47:32.590 align:middle line:10%
is people either think
I'm going to be wrong

00:47:32.590 --> 00:47:37.510 align:middle line:10%
and that I'm going to be lying
to myself, or I was nothing.

00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:40.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they have these fears
and preconceptions going in.

00:47:40.570 --> 00:47:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And I say, you know, don't worry
about any of those details.

00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:47.280 align:middle line:84%
You can make up a fantabulous
story if you want to even.

00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:49.440 align:middle line:84%
But the feeling that
you bring forth inside

00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:52.260 align:middle line:84%
is the junk that's buried
in the subconscious.

00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:54.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
actually affecting you

00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:56.040 align:middle line:90%
in your current incarnation.

00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:56.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:47:56.410 --> 00:47:57.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's like shadow work.

00:47:57.450 --> 00:47:58.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:58.130 --> 00:47:58.320 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:00.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're
bringing that through.

00:48:00.070 --> 00:48:04.080 align:middle line:10%
So if you're in a situation such
as from the lineage of slavery

00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:05.860 align:middle line:10%
and that's been
reinforced, reinforced,

00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:08.430 align:middle line:10%
almost up till present,
which it really has--

00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:10.420 align:middle line:10%
look at what happened
to your father--

00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:12.930 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: Mm-hmm, yeah, that
was the second time that he

00:48:12.930 --> 00:48:14.160 align:middle line:10%
had been beaten by cops.

00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:17.203 align:middle line:84%
The first time, I witnessed
it in Opa-locka, Florida.

00:48:17.203 --> 00:48:18.870 align:middle line:84%
We went to go pay the
rent for the house

00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:21.690 align:middle line:84%
that we were living in, at this
lady who owned a dry cleaner.

00:48:21.690 --> 00:48:24.643 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, six
cops came, slammed him

00:48:24.643 --> 00:48:26.310 align:middle line:84%
to the ground, put
shotguns to his head,

00:48:26.310 --> 00:48:27.720 align:middle line:84%
hit him with the
butt of the gun.

00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:28.710 align:middle line:84%
Me and my brother
were screaming.

00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:29.585 align:middle line:90%
My mom was screaming.

00:48:29.585 --> 00:48:32.190 align:middle line:84%
We were sitting right in the
car right outside the door.

00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And then one of the cops
came over with a racial slur

00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:36.420 align:middle line:84%
and said, no, it's
this one down here,

00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:38.840 align:middle line:84%
and they just got
up and walked away.

00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:40.703 align:middle line:84%
So this is,
unfortunately, something

00:48:40.703 --> 00:48:41.620 align:middle line:90%
that I had to witness.

00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:43.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How do you
deal with that inside?

00:48:43.650 --> 00:48:45.330 align:middle line:84%
How can you deal
with that injustice?

00:48:45.330 --> 00:48:46.705 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: You
know, it's so tough

00:48:46.705 --> 00:48:49.920 align:middle line:90%
because it's an internal battle.

00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:52.140 align:middle line:84%
You want to cry out,
but there's nobody

00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:55.080 align:middle line:84%
to listen to what you have
to say most of the time.

00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:56.160 align:middle line:90%
I did start a website--

00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:58.118 align:middle line:84%
or not really a website,
a social media account

00:48:58.118 --> 00:49:01.480 align:middle line:84%
called, "Wave of Action," which
is on Facebook, over 100,000

00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:02.280 align:middle line:90%
people on that one.

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:04.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wow, and what
is the mission statement?

00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:07.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: It's really
just about exposing

00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:09.510 align:middle line:84%
police brutality,
and police injustice,

00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:11.860 align:middle line:84%
and all different types of
other injustices as well.

00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:15.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's kind of grown
and just not saying that--

00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:17.430 align:middle line:84%
not pounding them and
saying, this is evil

00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:19.500 align:middle line:84%
or these people are all
bad, but saying, this

00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:20.550 align:middle line:90%
is what's going on.

00:49:20.550 --> 00:49:21.670 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:23.460 align:middle line:84%
These are actual video
accounts of things.

00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:25.002 align:middle line:84%
And I don't add any
extra commentary.

00:49:25.002 --> 00:49:26.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any
extra caption to it.

00:49:26.550 --> 00:49:26.617 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:49:26.617 --> 00:49:28.110 align:middle line:90%
Let that speak for itself.

00:49:28.110 --> 00:49:30.932 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I put it out there,
and I just walk away from it.

00:49:30.932 --> 00:49:32.640 align:middle line:84%
But you can see that
the majority-- and I

00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:35.700 align:middle line:84%
do all races of brutality,
whoever they attack,

00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:38.125 align:middle line:84%
even black people
attacking black people.

00:49:38.125 --> 00:49:39.000 align:middle line:90%
They're all on there.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.150 align:middle line:84%
But you get to see this track
record of, unfortunately,

00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:46.590 align:middle line:84%
you can see that
the balance is off.

00:49:46.590 --> 00:49:49.928 align:middle line:84%
And it's still persisting
to this current day.

00:49:49.928 --> 00:49:51.220 align:middle line:90%
And something needs to be done.

00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And I think the best way to
handle it is to get the sheriff

00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:57.570 align:middle line:84%
or the mayor of the town that is
hiring the police officers that

00:49:57.570 --> 00:50:02.040 align:middle line:84%
are making these egregious acts
against human beings, the mayor

00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:05.940 align:middle line:84%
or the sheriff need to be
held accountable financially.

00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:08.370 align:middle line:84%
So their personal pensions
need to be deducted instead

00:50:08.370 --> 00:50:09.660 align:middle line:90%
of the taxpayers'.

00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:12.570 align:middle line:84%
My dad won $36,000
from the taxpayers

00:50:12.570 --> 00:50:15.540 align:middle line:84%
of Palm Bay for the
beating he took,

00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:17.850 align:middle line:84%
which was peanuts, especially
after the attorneys

00:50:17.850 --> 00:50:19.308 align:middle line:84%
took their fees
and after what they

00:50:19.308 --> 00:50:20.742 align:middle line:90%
did to his brain and his back.

00:50:20.742 --> 00:50:22.200 align:middle line:84%
After it happened,
I said they just

00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:23.950 align:middle line:84%
took 15 years of my
dad's life, and that's

00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:28.020 align:middle line:84%
exactly how many years they took
away, 15 years from his life.

00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:29.670 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm the mayor
or I'm the sheriff

00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:32.430 align:middle line:84%
and I know that my personal
income, my nest egg

00:50:32.430 --> 00:50:36.720 align:middle line:84%
is going to be tampered
with if one of my employees

00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:38.440 align:middle line:84%
doesn't do their
job right, I'm going

00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:39.690 align:middle line:90%
to make sure it never happens.

00:50:39.690 --> 00:50:40.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:50:40.410 --> 00:50:41.850 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And
until that happens,

00:50:41.850 --> 00:50:43.440 align:middle line:84%
we're still going to
have police brutality.

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:44.910 align:middle line:84%
Because you have to hit
people in the pockets.

00:50:44.910 --> 00:50:46.560 align:middle line:84%
That's the only way to stop
things like this, hit them

00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:47.510 align:middle line:90%
in the pockets.

00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:49.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:51.180 align:middle line:90%
That is true.

00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:58.320 align:middle line:10%
So you have this group, you
have the Carson Foundation

00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:00.780 align:middle line:10%
giving people with drug
and alcohol problems

00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:05.370 align:middle line:10%
some help to help go
through the detox process

00:51:05.370 --> 00:51:07.280 align:middle line:10%
and the re-education
process and so forth?

00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:09.030 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah, they
get a psychiatrist.

00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:11.620 align:middle line:84%
They get one-on-one in-group
therapy, all different types

00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:12.420 align:middle line:90%
of depression.

00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:14.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So kind of
psycho-spiritual--

00:51:14.310 --> 00:51:17.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Meditation, yoga,
all that's involved as well.

00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:18.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's wonderful.

00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:20.640 align:middle line:90%
And then you have this--

00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:22.915 align:middle line:84%
is it a Facebook page
or a blog site called--

00:51:22.915 --> 00:51:23.715 align:middle line:90%
again?

00:51:23.715 --> 00:51:24.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Wave of Action.

00:51:24.810 --> 00:51:25.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wave of Action.

00:51:25.930 --> 00:51:26.730 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:51:26.730 --> 00:51:27.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:31.297 align:middle line:84%
To keep an eye on the brutality
that's actually happening

00:51:31.297 --> 00:51:32.880 align:middle line:84%
and not let it be
swept under the rug?

00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:33.270 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Correct.

00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:35.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what else
are you up to right now,

00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:37.290 align:middle line:84%
besides coming on
with people like me?

00:51:37.290 --> 00:51:40.532 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I have my own show
on Dame Dash's network, which

00:51:40.532 --> 00:51:42.990 align:middle line:84%
is called 4BIDDEN KNOWLEDGE
with Billy Carson, where I just

00:51:42.990 --> 00:51:44.120 align:middle line:90%
talk about various topics.

00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:45.900 align:middle line:90%
That's been pretty cool.

00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:47.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing mystery schools now.

00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:48.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:51.400 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah, I did the first
mystery school last month,

00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:54.480 align:middle line:84%
and it was standing room
only, 12 hours of teaching.

00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:57.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is this based on
the Compendium of the Emerald

00:51:57.090 --> 00:51:57.345 align:middle line:90%
Tablets?

00:51:57.345 --> 00:51:59.010 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Some of
it, but it's also

00:51:59.010 --> 00:52:01.095 align:middle line:90%
into deep Egyptian mysteries.

00:52:01.095 --> 00:52:03.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, no
one can miss what

00:52:03.690 --> 00:52:07.230 align:middle line:84%
you have around your neck--
your tie and your medallion,

00:52:07.230 --> 00:52:08.640 align:middle line:90%
with the Eye of Horus.

00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:09.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:12.130 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And we only have
a couple of minutes left,

00:52:12.130 --> 00:52:15.420 align:middle line:10%
but give us just a
little taste and maybe

00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:18.150 align:middle line:10%
in another conversation
down the road,

00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:20.160 align:middle line:10%
we can go into the
mystery school teachings

00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:22.810 align:middle line:10%
that you particularly
appreciate or embody.

00:52:22.810 --> 00:52:25.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah, well, I
like to talk to people a lot

00:52:25.050 --> 00:52:27.998 align:middle line:84%
about the fact that we are
extremely powerful beings.

00:52:27.998 --> 00:52:29.790 align:middle line:84%
And people don't really
understand how much

00:52:29.790 --> 00:52:31.590 align:middle line:90%
power is inside the human body.

00:52:31.590 --> 00:52:35.530 align:middle line:84%
You have 0.7 milli volts of
electricity in every cell,

00:52:35.530 --> 00:52:37.597 align:middle line:90%
and you have 35 billion cells.

00:52:37.597 --> 00:52:39.180 align:middle line:84%
Multiply that, all
of a sudden, you're

00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:43.838 align:middle line:84%
at 2.65 or so trillion volts of
electricity in the human body.

00:52:43.838 --> 00:52:44.880 align:middle line:90%
So we're powerful beings.

00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:48.510 align:middle line:84%
This is where qigong comes from,
the ancient art of extracting

00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:50.887 align:middle line:84%
the energy and using
it in your hands

00:52:50.887 --> 00:52:52.470 align:middle line:84%
and Reiki healing
and everything else.

00:52:52.470 --> 00:52:54.090 align:middle line:84%
All that energy
is coming directly

00:52:54.090 --> 00:52:57.510 align:middle line:84%
from the cells in the body,
directly from the cell walls.

00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:59.120 align:middle line:90%
And even the ancient Egyptians--

00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:00.510 align:middle line:84%
and if you go into
the mysteries,

00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:02.052 align:middle line:84%
you discover they
have the capability

00:53:02.052 --> 00:53:04.532 align:middle line:84%
of healing with the hands as
well and using these energies.

00:53:04.532 --> 00:53:05.740 align:middle line:90%
So I like to talk about that.

00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And I also like to
talk about the fact

00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:10.110 align:middle line:84%
that everything in this
universe is made of light.

00:53:10.110 --> 00:53:11.527 align:middle line:84%
Even our bodies
are made of light.

00:53:11.527 --> 00:53:13.657 align:middle line:84%
When you look at
quantum physics,

00:53:13.657 --> 00:53:15.990 align:middle line:84%
you discover that everything
is an electromagnetic wave.

00:53:15.990 --> 00:53:17.310 align:middle line:90%
Everything is a wave.

00:53:17.310 --> 00:53:19.440 align:middle line:90%
And waves are all light waves.

00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:21.450 align:middle line:90%
We only see 1% of the spectrum.

00:53:21.450 --> 00:53:23.880 align:middle line:84%
We're basically blind to what's
really going on around us.

00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:24.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:28.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: But because everything
is made of light, we are light.

00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:30.990 align:middle line:84%
So we're living in
this light matrix.

00:53:30.990 --> 00:53:34.020 align:middle line:84%
These waves of light interact
with conscious intent,

00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:37.500 align:middle line:84%
and we collapse them into things
that we think are solid matter.

00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:38.550 align:middle line:90%
We think it's distance.

00:53:38.550 --> 00:53:41.040 align:middle line:84%
We think it's separation,
but that's only an illusion.

00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:42.780 align:middle line:10%
So I like to talk
about that aspect

00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:46.110 align:middle line:10%
of what the ancients call
"dream world" or "sleepy time,"

00:53:46.110 --> 00:53:48.240 align:middle line:10%
and the ancient sages
talk about this,

00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:50.700 align:middle line:10%
and that we really-- there's
another level above this

00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:53.060 align:middle line:10%
and other dimensions where
true reality does exist.

00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:54.840 align:middle line:90%
Base reality does exist.

00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:55.840 align:middle line:90%
And how do we get there?

00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:58.550 align:middle line:84%
And how do we consciously
incarnate at will

00:53:58.550 --> 00:54:00.360 align:middle line:84%
and using some of the
ancient techniques?

00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:02.945 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very deep class,
12 hours of teaching.

00:54:02.945 --> 00:54:04.355 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:54:04.355 --> 00:54:05.980 align:middle line:84%
When I've been doing
lectures recently,

00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:08.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about a very
similar subject, which

00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:11.820 align:middle line:84%
is if we are light and
space and this field

00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:14.970 align:middle line:84%
is ours to fill within
its information,

00:54:14.970 --> 00:54:17.560 align:middle line:84%
essentially, it's all
information, right?

00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:22.230 align:middle line:84%
Then it's up to us to choose
what kind of information

00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:25.060 align:middle line:84%
we're going to fill our fields
with and the fields around us

00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:25.860 align:middle line:90%
with?

00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:26.943 align:middle line:90%
And how do we go about it?

00:54:26.943 --> 00:54:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds like you carry
that on and extended it

00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:33.570 align:middle line:84%
into the means by which
you can begin intentionally

00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:36.660 align:middle line:84%
filling that field with energy
that's going to support you

00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:37.950 align:middle line:90%
in your life and your Dharma.

00:54:37.950 --> 00:54:40.365 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Absolutely, yes,
that's exactly what it is.

00:54:40.365 --> 00:54:42.240 align:middle line:84%
Every thought creates
an electromagnetic wave

00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:43.990 align:middle line:84%
that comes into your
head, which is light,

00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:45.625 align:middle line:84%
so you're actually
thinking light.

00:54:45.625 --> 00:54:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And that light then
has a direct effect

00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:48.915 align:middle line:84%
on the ether of
spacetime itself.

00:54:48.915 --> 00:54:49.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:54:49.830 --> 00:54:51.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, can't wait
to see what you're

00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:52.430 align:middle line:90%
going to be when you grow up--

00:54:52.430 --> 00:54:53.415 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:53.415 --> 00:54:55.610 align:middle line:90%
--because you're still young.

00:54:55.610 --> 00:54:56.640 align:middle line:90%
Billy, thank you again.

00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:57.750 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Thank you.

00:54:57.750 --> 00:54:59.940 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Always a profound
conversation with you.

00:54:59.940 --> 00:55:03.330 align:middle line:10%
And thank you for sharing
some of the more tender

00:55:03.330 --> 00:55:05.408 align:middle line:10%

with life on Earth.

00:55:05.408 --> 00:55:06.450 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate that.

00:55:06.450 --> 00:55:07.617 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Thank you so much.

00:55:07.617 --> 00:55:08.780 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate you.
