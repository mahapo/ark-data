00:00:27.614 --> 00:00:29.530 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: What
were the elements that

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.180 align:middle line:10%
caused the fall of Rome?

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.550 align:middle line:10%
We've read about gluttony
and bizarre sexual practices,

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.860 align:middle line:10%
but what does this have in
common with our world today

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.020 align:middle line:10%
in terms of excess and
its impact on society?

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.050 align:middle line:84%
Steven Ross is with
us, and we might

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.624 align:middle line:84%
say that it has something
to do with a lack of wisdom.

00:00:44.624 --> 00:00:46.290 align:middle line:84%
And this is part two
of our conversation

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.410 align:middle line:84%
about the real
meaning of alchemy

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.340 align:middle line:84%
and its essence at the
center of our lives.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.214 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVEN ROSS: Right.

00:00:51.214 --> 00:00:54.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So wisdom-- no wisdom,
lots of knowledge, no wisdom.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.870 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Exactly.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.350 align:middle line:10%
And before we get to what
happened with ancient cultures

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.180 align:middle line:10%
in Rome, what you've
brought up with wisdom

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.810 align:middle line:10%
is very, very important.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:10.420 align:middle line:10%
There is such a difference
between knowledge and wisdom.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.570 align:middle line:84%
And we can look at our
iPhones, our cellphones today.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.130 align:middle line:84%
We have access to
tremendous knowledge.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.850 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned it before, so I
hate to use one of your lines,

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.410 align:middle line:84%
because you should
get credit for it.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.690 align:middle line:84%
But when you look
at the ancients,

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:32.900 align:middle line:84%
we have so much knowledge
in our hand with our phones

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.550 align:middle line:84%
that these
individuals never had.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.710 align:middle line:84%
They had to travel
all over the world.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:37.880 align:middle line:90%
They sought.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.830 align:middle line:84%
They looked
everywhere they could.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.667 align:middle line:84%
And we can instantly draw up
any kind of knowledge we want.

00:01:43.667 --> 00:01:46.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Within an hour what
it took them lifetimes to learn.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.150 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: That's exactly right.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.695 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --by way
of information.

00:01:48.695 --> 00:01:53.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: But my understanding,
from studying and reading,

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:58.140 align:middle line:84%
was they weren't just
picking up knowledge.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.920 align:middle line:90%
They were picking up wisdom.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And we have all of
this knowledge today.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:05.869 align:middle line:90%
But does that make us wise?

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.244 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's why
we're going to talk about Rome

00:02:08.244 --> 00:02:10.410 align:middle line:84%
and what it might have in
common with today's world.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And our last conversations,
the last conversation,

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.810 align:middle line:84%
we went into the
essence of the need

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.040 align:middle line:84%
for love, the solvent of
the universe, the thing that

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.360 align:middle line:84%
heals all, trumps all,
can transform all.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.470 align:middle line:90%
We talked about that.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And we also talked about
the need for beauty, and how

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.510 align:middle line:84%
the ancients honored this
as above, so below symmetry,

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.020 align:middle line:84%
and native beauty that
we can all recognize

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.830 align:middle line:84%
and that brings
tears to our eyes

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.770 align:middle line:84%
because it's coming
from our hearts.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.350 align:middle line:84%
But we didn't have a chance
to touch on wisdom and Sophia.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.590 align:middle line:84%
So before we get right
into the Sophia part,

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:46.770 align:middle line:90%
let's talk about Rome.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:47.629 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:48.670 align:middle line:90%
And what's happening now?

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.250 align:middle line:90%
What's the lens?

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: They went to
conquer the world.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.520 align:middle line:84%
And they did conquer
the world, most

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.650 align:middle line:90%
of the known world at the time.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.490 align:middle line:84%
But one has to ask, what
did they really conquer?

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And what did they learn
from what they accumulated?

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.800 align:middle line:84%
That is basically
the underpinning

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.940 align:middle line:90%
of our entire show.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.510 align:middle line:84%
It is the ability or the desire
of individuals to accumulate,

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.070 align:middle line:90%
to have.

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.590 align:middle line:84%
Many people say, oh,
no, I like the freedom.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.590 align:middle line:90%
Freedom is very, very important.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.490 align:middle line:84%
Freedom is important,
but there's

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.670 align:middle line:84%
a question of how wisely
you use that freedom.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.400 align:middle line:84%
Does freedom just mean that
you just go willy nilly,

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.780 align:middle line:84%
take what you want,
do what you want,

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.300 align:middle line:84%
dress how you want because
that is very freeing?

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.100 align:middle line:10%
The question is is that wise?

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, who decides on the criteria
what is wise and what isn't?

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, the ancient would look
at it in the following way.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.940 align:middle line:90%
They looked at archetypes.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.070 align:middle line:84%
They looked at
the higher spheres

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:01.700 align:middle line:84%
and believed that there were
archetypes for beauty, truth,

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.040 align:middle line:84%
even what the perfect
physician should be.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.960 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there was an
archetype of what would

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.930 align:middle line:90%
be the ultimate physician?

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.250 align:middle line:84%
The ultimate physician would
have a total understanding

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.150 align:middle line:84%
of nature, would have
love and compassion,

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.779 align:middle line:84%
would know exactly
what a patient needed,

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:19.680 align:middle line:90%
the wonderful bedside manner.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.940 align:middle line:84%
That would be the
perfect archetype.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.740 align:middle line:84%
That would be wisdom coming
from the founts of wisdom,

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.130 align:middle line:84%
the founts of all archetypes
funneling down to us.

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.100 align:middle line:84%
So what happened with
the Roman Empire?

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.330 align:middle line:90%
They were really never wise.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.210 align:middle line:90%
They had accumulated--

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it is passed
down from the Greeks.

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.870 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.450 align:middle line:84%
What was the point of
corruption, so to speak?

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, the Greeks
from the Egyptians, and one

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.260 align:middle line:84%
would even say the Atlanteans--
even Plato would say that.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: On the previous
show, we gave the real life

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:05.460 align:middle line:84%
account of what Paracelsus
discovered of an individual who

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.510 align:middle line:84%
locked themselves
into a room and died

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.980 align:middle line:90%
from their own atmosphere.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.030 align:middle line:10%
When you have a
prevailing atmosphere that

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:20.350 align:middle line:10%
is very, very limiting to
any outside influences,

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:21.790 align:middle line:10%
you have stagnation.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.599 align:middle line:10%
Now, one may say,
well, wait a minute.

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:24.390 align:middle line:10%
They were gluttony.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.390 align:middle line:10%
They were doing this.

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:26.120 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.140 align:middle line:10%
They had stagnated as a culture.

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.980 align:middle line:84%
They had limited any kind
of information and beliefs

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:38.050 align:middle line:84%
coming from other sources,
because they knew it all.

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.650 align:middle line:90%
They had it all.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.000 align:middle line:90%
They controlled all.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.880 align:middle line:84%
And they placed
themselves, basically,

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.080 align:middle line:84%
as deities-- that
they knew better.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.660 align:middle line:84%
Even though it's a little bit
of a stretch for some people

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.530 align:middle line:84%
to say, well, wait a
minute-- there was freedom.

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And they were off doing this,
and the sexual practices.

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:04.760 align:middle line:84%
No, because when you cut
yourself off from any stream,

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.810 align:middle line:84%
you are going to have a
corruption of the energy

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:13.770 align:middle line:84%
that is existing in that
environment, in that sphere.

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, sometimes, they tend to
go a bit higher in precepts

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.950 align:middle line:90%
than down at the level.

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:24.920 align:middle line:84%
But in the higher precepts, this
is what we're talking about.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:30.810 align:middle line:84%
Any corruption of the energy
flow coming from around us

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:34.860 align:middle line:84%
will lead to death
and destruction,

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.590 align:middle line:84%
whether it is the
physical body, whether it

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:42.980 align:middle line:84%
is a religion, a philosophy,
or an entire culture.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.940 align:middle line:84%
They had cut themselves
off from any kind

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.610 align:middle line:84%
of higher wisdom
coming into them,

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:54.870 align:middle line:84%
because they were not operating
from that part of the being

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:57.300 align:middle line:90%
that draws wisdom in.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:01.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was almost as
though their entire ethos was

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:05.400 align:middle line:84%
based on hand me downs, hand
me downs from the Greeks

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.100 align:middle line:84%
that became distorted
and irrelevant,

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.450 align:middle line:84%
hand me down
mythological characters,

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:11.919 align:middle line:90%
hand me down ethics.

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:13.585 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: This is what's
happened, Regina.

00:07:13.585 --> 00:07:14.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it
didn't have relevance.

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:14.789 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:14.789 --> 00:07:19.310 align:middle line:10%
>>ROSS: Well, we have
taken images and figures

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:25.490 align:middle line:10%
and we have brought them
into what we want them to be.

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:29.440 align:middle line:10%
There is individuals who are
talking about the philosopher

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:35.730 align:middle line:10%
Ficino who translated a lot
of the hermetic teachings

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:39.140 align:middle line:10%
into Latin so it could be read.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:42.920 align:middle line:10%
And what I heard from
these individuals

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:48.840 align:middle line:10%
was the hermetic philosophers
were anticipating

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:52.180 align:middle line:10%
the arrival of Jesus.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.590 align:middle line:10%
And because of
that, this is what

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:56.110 align:middle line:10%
they were really talking about.

00:07:56.110 --> 00:08:00.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, that is ridiculous
and that is nonsense,

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:03.910 align:middle line:84%
because in the
individual culture,

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:05.990 align:middle line:84%
this is what they
were talking about

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:07.650 align:middle line:90%
in the ancient philosophies.

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:11.980 align:middle line:84%
I heard a statement
that biblical scholars

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:17.130 align:middle line:84%
say that Hermes Trismegistus,
the Egyptian wise one,

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:18.905 align:middle line:90%
was really Enoch.

00:08:18.905 --> 00:08:20.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, oh, no, no.

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:20.570 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:21.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:22.860 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: It's like, oh, OK.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:27.280 align:middle line:84%
You bend and twist so the
hand me downs that you spoke

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.790 align:middle line:84%
of-- you take this
little hand me down

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:33.240 align:middle line:84%
and then you dress it the
way you want it to be.

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.309 align:middle line:84%
And then you make it so that
it fits into your philosophy

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:39.350 align:middle line:84%
so that there will be an
acceptance from your members.

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:43.960 align:middle line:10%
So all these people,
previously, Jesus had to go down

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:48.730 align:middle line:10%
and to Hell to release of
them because God didn't

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:52.840 align:middle line:10%
protect all of these people
for 10s of thousands of years

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.090 align:middle line:10%
before.

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:58.190 align:middle line:84%
But now, our teacher's
going to do that.

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:01.310 align:middle line:10%
And before anybody thinks
I'm too sacrilegious,

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:05.740 align:middle line:10%
I happen to think that Jesus
was a tremendous example,

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:11.060 align:middle line:10%
a beautiful teacher, a loving
individual, an archetype.

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:14.760 align:middle line:10%
But there have been many
individuals throughout time

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.230 align:middle line:10%
for their cultures.

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:21.546 align:middle line:10%
So the hand me downs are good
if there is an integrity.

00:09:21.546 --> 00:09:23.045 align:middle line:84%
Here, we're back
to that term again.

00:09:23.045 --> 00:09:23.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:23.800 align:middle line:90%
There was.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.290 align:middle line:84%
It was like the
fabric had already

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:26.690 align:middle line:90%
unraveled by that point.

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:27.490 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: It goes.

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:29.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now let's
overlay what happened there.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And what are our modern
day hand me downs?

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.100 align:middle line:90%
Where are we with this?

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.750 align:middle line:84%
At least they had another
somewhat more advanced culture

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:42.590 align:middle line:84%
to receive from, another more
advanced culture before them.

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:45.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, we've been kind of in the
wilderness for a while here.

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:48.320 align:middle line:90%
We went through the Dark Ages.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.900 align:middle line:90%
What are our hand me downs now?

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:51.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Well, here's
a hand me down.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:55.350 align:middle line:84%
So kind of it-- so we'll
just stretch a little.

00:09:55.350 --> 00:10:01.480 align:middle line:84%
In ancient days, people were
considered great because of how

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.520 align:middle line:90%
they acted and what they said.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And in today's world,
someone's considered great

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:09.950 align:middle line:84%
because they came from
Harvard, because they

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:15.310 align:middle line:84%
came from this university,
because this person has got all

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:17.950 align:middle line:84%
this acknowledgement
that they are

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:20.180 align:middle line:90%
wise because they have a PhD.

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:21.450 align:middle line:90%
They have a degree.

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:22.750 align:middle line:90%
And they know.

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:25.620 align:middle line:84%
That was not the
ancient teachings.

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:28.400 align:middle line:84%
There was no degrees
back then, necessarily.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:33.980 align:middle line:84%
It was on the truth and
integrity of the person's life

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:37.130 align:middle line:84%
and what they taught
and how they walked.

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:39.710 align:middle line:10%
Now, today, we don't
have that anymore.

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:44.480 align:middle line:10%
The guru is-- if MIT said
that the world is really flat,

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.840 align:middle line:10%
I absolutely guarantee
you that there

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:50.460 align:middle line:10%
is a whole culture of
people who will go and say,

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:53.710 align:middle line:10%
you know, gosh, that
must be correct.

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:54.540 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:57.710 align:middle line:90%
Because it's coming out of MIT.

00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:59.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I don't think
we have to stretch

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:01.080 align:middle line:90%
to see the hand me down there.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:05.410 align:middle line:84%
They're taking whatever
information had been somehow

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:08.624 align:middle line:84%
gained maybe 50, 100 years
ago, maybe 20 years ago,

00:11:08.624 --> 00:11:10.040 align:middle line:84%
and they're just
regurgitating it.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.330 align:middle line:84%
It's really a
regurgitation process.

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:12.375 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Well, and
it's a regurgitation--

00:11:12.375 --> 00:11:13.875 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not
original thought.

00:11:13.875 --> 00:11:15.146 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: --with no life--

00:11:15.146 --> 00:11:16.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, that's right.

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:19.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: --when
you take any text,

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:24.150 align:middle line:84%
it is a closed system,
as if the deity,

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:28.160 align:middle line:84%
the god has nothing
fresh for us today.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:32.110 align:middle line:84%
And we're using thous and
things from the terminology.

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:34.410 align:middle line:90%
There is the freshness of life.

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:36.880 align:middle line:84%
There are these
flows that exist.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:42.400 align:middle line:84%
And today, students are
placed in little boxes.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.610 align:middle line:84%
If you're too
creative, you have to--

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:47.370 align:middle line:84%
you're a student
that we can't handle.

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:49.580 align:middle line:84%
You've got to go into
some special school

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:51.510 align:middle line:84%
because that
student doesn't want

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:55.574 align:middle line:84%
to learn "in 1492, Columbus
sailed the ocean blue."

00:11:55.574 --> 00:11:56.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: They're already
thinking in higher dimensions.

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:04.500 align:middle line:84%
The hand me downs that
have come, unfortunately,

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:08.470 align:middle line:84%
in my understanding,
are ones of control

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:13.510 align:middle line:84%
and are not coming through
what the ancients termed

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:15.330 align:middle line:90%
as imagination.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:15.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:16.620 align:middle line:90%
They're not.

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:20.360 align:middle line:84%
And you're ridiculed
as a little person

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:23.080 align:middle line:84%
if you go too far into
the world of imagination

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.650 align:middle line:90%
and original thought.

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:27.017 align:middle line:84%
So it's not really even
encouraged in this world.

00:12:27.017 --> 00:12:27.600 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Right.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:32.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, that leads us to one
of the highest precepts.

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:34.800 align:middle line:84%
We talked about love
as being the solvent.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:38.200 align:middle line:84%
But one of the highest precepts
that some of the ancients

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:43.320 align:middle line:84%
taught on the tools of
getting to that state

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:50.810 align:middle line:84%
were a very simple phrase of
imagination, faith, and will.

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:57.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, those simple little words--
for the ancients, imagination

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:03.830 align:middle line:84%
was not your mental wanderings
of hypothetical things.

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:07.570 align:middle line:84%
That is what they
called fantasy.

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:09.600 align:middle line:84%
Imagination, for
some of the ancients,

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:13.370 align:middle line:84%
wasn't some kind
of preprogramming.

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:17.390 align:middle line:84%
That would be called
visualization.

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:20.540 align:middle line:84%
Imagination, to some of
the ancient teachers,

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:27.530 align:middle line:84%
was that part of our being
where this supreme, ultimate,

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:31.430 align:middle line:84%
beautiful guidance came
from the higher spheres

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:34.180 align:middle line:90%
through the individual.

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:38.060 align:middle line:84%
That is what was
meant as imagination.

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And that wisdom
would come through.

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:45.060 align:middle line:84%
So Paracelsus, again-- I
know I speak about him a lot,

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:48.840 align:middle line:84%
but he was really
an alchemist who

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.400 align:middle line:90%
left us a lot of tools to use.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.310 align:middle line:84%
He said, if you want
to learn about what

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:56.580 align:middle line:84%
herb is going to
be the best, you

00:13:56.580 --> 00:14:00.440 align:middle line:84%
sit cross legged in
front of the herbs

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:05.460 align:middle line:84%
or the flowers or the trees,
and nature will teach you,

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:08.610 align:middle line:84%
because the way
to learn nature is

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:12.720 align:middle line:84%
to walk her branches,
to walk her leaves.

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.840 align:middle line:84%
What he meant was when
you place yourself

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:21.240 align:middle line:84%
in an imaginative state-- he
didn't have the terminology

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.460 align:middle line:84%
for different parts
of mind-- that

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:26.780 align:middle line:90%
meant you have an open channel.

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And the beauty of this that
I want all of your listeners

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:34.310 align:middle line:84%
understand is this is
not the mystery arcana.

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:39.650 align:middle line:84%
This is not this hidden wisdom
that nobody could attain.

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:45.180 align:middle line:84%
You act in a humble manner
to receive from the world,

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.940 align:middle line:90%
from the cosmos, from anything.

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:50.780 align:middle line:90%
The teachings-- we have that.

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:52.160 align:middle line:90%
You're not given it.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.300 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to receive
it from a guru or a teacher.

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:58.340 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to receive
it from other books.

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:04.270 align:middle line:84%
You and I and everybody has
access to the greatest wisdom,

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:07.760 align:middle line:84%
because everything
that existed outside,

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:13.200 align:middle line:84%
according to the ancients,
exists inside-- the macrocosm

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.760 align:middle line:90%
and the microcosm.

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:17.340 align:middle line:84%
These words are
so thrown around,

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:19.320 align:middle line:90%
people don't understand it.

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:24.730 align:middle line:84%
Every star that exists, every
plant outside, is within us.

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:27.170 align:middle line:90%
What is the term wisdom mean?

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:32.060 align:middle line:84%
The wisdom is coming from
the source rather than

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:35.052 align:middle line:84%
some appointed person
who's just interpreting.

00:15:35.052 --> 00:15:36.343 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Regurgitating, right.

00:15:36.343 --> 00:15:38.009 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And their
interpretation may not

00:15:38.009 --> 00:15:40.130 align:middle line:84%
be-- regurgitation
is a better word--

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:43.520 align:middle line:90%
than you can do on your own.

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:44.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, OK.

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:47.880 align:middle line:90%
So that takes us into Sophia.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:48.380 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:49.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:52.600 align:middle line:84%
And let's-- you had a
dream that was profound,

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.710 align:middle line:84%
which is going to go back to
the word you used a moment ago,

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:58.940 align:middle line:84%
which has to do with humility,
because it would appear that

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:01.910 align:middle line:84%
an out of balance-- we call
it ego, whatever it is--

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:05.430 align:middle line:84%
an out of balance psyche is
going to be the very thing that

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:09.160 align:middle line:84%
will stand in the way of our
ability to connect with wisdom

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:11.140 align:middle line:90%
and imagination.

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:11.760 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:16.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Now, several people,
not only in ancient times,

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:18.800 align:middle line:84%
but in more modern
eras-- I'm going

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:21.170 align:middle line:90%
to use the 1500s as modern.

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:26.660 align:middle line:84%
But Jakob Bohme, a
philosopher, actually

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:33.260 align:middle line:84%
believed that he experienced
the goddess of wisdom, Sophia,

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:42.290 align:middle line:84%
who came to him as a true,
real, entity energy pattern.

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:46.560 align:middle line:84%
As strange as that
may seem, Carl Jung

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:51.000 align:middle line:84%
also believed that very, very
strongly, in our modern era,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.630 align:middle line:90%
that this was an archetype.

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:57.710 align:middle line:90%
This Sophia was something real.

00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:01.130 align:middle line:84%
It is an energy
pattern from the deity.

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:05.210 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's so strange,
because my understanding is

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:09.450 align:middle line:84%
that Christ is the
epitome of love.

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:11.940 align:middle line:90%
Jesus was an individual.

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:18.880 align:middle line:84%
The Christ was an energy pattern
of such a magnitude of love

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:24.740 align:middle line:84%
that this individual Jesus
lived the life of love.

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:27.579 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But as we stated
in our last conversation, so

00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:28.769 align:middle line:90%
did JR Newton, for example.

00:17:28.769 --> 00:17:29.560 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Absolutely.

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:32.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so do many people
that we see-- not many, maybe,

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:34.540 align:middle line:84%
but sprinkled around
the planet are

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:38.300 align:middle line:84%
people that are able to reach
into that level of refinement

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:38.990 align:middle line:90%
and live it.

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:42.320 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And that is why,
if you replace the word

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:47.320 align:middle line:84%
"Christ" in the New Testament
with the word "love"

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:50.810 align:middle line:84%
and then look at
how that book reads,

00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:53.350 align:middle line:84%
one may find it very,
very interesting.

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:56.780 align:middle line:84%
So now, they also believed--
individuals believed--

00:17:56.780 --> 00:18:00.190 align:middle line:84%
that Sophia, or
wisdom, is personified

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:02.400 align:middle line:90%
as a beautiful woman.

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And there's an
alchemical drawing

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.350 align:middle line:84%
of the philosopher on the
path with his little lamp.

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And there was
Sophia walking ahead

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:15.820 align:middle line:84%
of him, just ahead
on the pathway,

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:19.030 align:middle line:90%
leading this philosopher along.

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:21.836 align:middle line:90%
So the wisdom is there.

00:18:21.836 --> 00:18:23.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He was
stumbling in the dark.

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:23.850 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: He was.

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:25.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Holding is
little lantern, I think--

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:26.250 align:middle line:90%
did he have a little lantern?

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:27.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: A little alchemic-- yes.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:27.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:28.966 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: That is the alchemy.

00:18:28.966 --> 00:18:32.720 align:middle line:84%
So this other part-- now,
before I read any of this,

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:38.070 align:middle line:84%
about Carl Jung and
really read Jakob Bohme,

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:41.740 align:middle line:84%
quite a few years
ago, I was preparing

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:46.340 align:middle line:84%
the night before for a lecture
that I would give the next day.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And I had a dream
vision, and I wanted

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:57.610 align:middle line:84%
to share it with you and your
guests or your listeners.

00:18:57.610 --> 00:19:00.430 align:middle line:90%
I was walking along the ocean.

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:03.280 align:middle line:90%
The ocean was to my left.

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:06.790 align:middle line:84%
And I was walking with all of
the seekers, all the people

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:10.590 align:middle line:84%
in the world who were looking
for greater enlightenment

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:11.840 align:middle line:90%
and to be better people.

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:13.930 align:middle line:84%
We were all walking
together on the sand.

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:17.610 align:middle line:84%
And in front of
us, I saw a woman

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:22.710 align:middle line:84%
in blue holding a
microphone, trying to talk.

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying trying because
we couldn't hear the words.

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:32.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, to my right was
a horseshoe stands.

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And in these stands were all
these people who have written

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:40.220 align:middle line:84%
books, the weekend
courses, the seminars,

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:43.850 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people that
have very high profile.

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:51.230 align:middle line:84%
But coming from them was
a smoke, fog, pollution.

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:52.690 align:middle line:90%
And I stopped for a second.

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And I was wondering,
what is happening here?

00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:59.360 align:middle line:84%
Because if these
people are producing

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:04.970 align:middle line:84%
smog and smoke and
obliterating wisdom

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:10.570 align:middle line:84%
and the hearing of
wisdom, how are us people

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:13.920 align:middle line:84%
supposed to get in tune
with higher precepts?

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And a tremendous wind
blew off the ocean

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:20.840 align:middle line:84%
and cleared up all
of this pollution.

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:24.600 align:middle line:90%
And I heard the following words.

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:28.510 align:middle line:84%
All that is needed
for individuals

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:35.120 align:middle line:84%
is a beautiful heart, an open
mind, and a humble spirit.

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:38.390 align:middle line:84%
And when I woke up,
I cried a little bit.

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:43.400 align:middle line:84%
I cried because
in its simplicity,

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:45.396 align:middle line:90%
it is very profound.

00:20:45.396 --> 00:20:46.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:51.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And in its action of
life-- I used it the next day.

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:54.920 align:middle line:84%
I spoke, because I don't use
notes when I speak to audience.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.510 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't have to rewrite.

00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:59.250 align:middle line:84%
But I incorporated
it into my talk

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:02.410 align:middle line:84%
and I challenged
everybody in the audience.

00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:05.410 align:middle line:90%
Can you do this?

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:10.410 align:middle line:84%
Can you have a beautiful
heart in your life?

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:14.960 align:middle line:84%
So with each step you take,
are you planting flowers

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.560 align:middle line:90%
or creating swells?

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:19.500 align:middle line:90%


00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:24.010 align:middle line:84%
Can you be open to
this imagination part

00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:28.040 align:middle line:90%
and allow wisdom to talk to you?

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:31.850 align:middle line:84%
But can you do it
in a humble manner?

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:35.780 align:middle line:84%
Paracelsus, Pythagoras-- I
shared in your first segment

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:38.870 align:middle line:84%
the great philosopher
Pythagoras, so humble

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:43.070 align:middle line:84%
in saying that
everybody who I meet,

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:45.580 align:middle line:84%
something is going
to be exchanged.

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:51.140 align:middle line:84%
And we had a Paracelsus who
went to gypsies, midwives,

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:57.910 align:middle line:84%
the barbers, sorcerers, because
he said truth, wisdom, is

00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:03.810 align:middle line:84%
available all over, because this
is what the deity has provided.

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:06.640 align:middle line:90%
This is a schoolroom.

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:10.550 align:middle line:84%
The earth plane is a schoolroom
where we learn lessons and have

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:12.080 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:17.850 align:middle line:84%
So can we have that
beautiful heart with love?

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:21.510 align:middle line:90%
Can we so unfetter our minds?

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:23.870 align:middle line:84%
And I used a little
gimmick during my talk.

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:25.890 align:middle line:90%
I had a Velcro strap.

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:28.580 align:middle line:10%
And I would--
[IMITATING VELCRO NOISES]--

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:33.770 align:middle line:10%
because I tried to show--
Plato said life is not learning

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:35.010 align:middle line:10%
anything new.

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:38.700 align:middle line:10%
It is remembering things
we've already known in spirit.

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:41.960 align:middle line:10%
So is it possible
that despite what

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.370 align:middle line:10%
a lot of these modern
people are saying

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:49.160 align:middle line:10%
with their alchemical teachings
and a minutia of books

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:53.440 align:middle line:10%
that the secret is to
go back to simplicity,

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:57.840 align:middle line:10%
to unlearn some of
these attachments that

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:01.990 align:middle line:10%
are like barnacles on our ship
as we're sailing through life?

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:05.690 align:middle line:84%
It is a lot easier
than is made out.

00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:08.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, people can
challenge and say, you know,

00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:11.210 align:middle line:84%
Steve, you have made a
statement that these people who

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:13.220 align:middle line:84%
are teaching all
these courses-- why

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:15.370 align:middle line:90%
aren't they demonstrating it?

00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:20.480 align:middle line:84%
They purport to have the
rainbow light, be in this,

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:25.210 align:middle line:84%
but I don't see their followers
or their people demonstrating.

00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:30.320 align:middle line:84%
Nor do I see individuals who
are walking and demonstrating

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:36.400 align:middle line:84%
the precepts of
healing and the wisdom

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:41.270 align:middle line:84%
that they are sharing or telling
other people that they have.

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:42.515 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, this is true.

00:23:42.515 --> 00:23:46.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: So I believe,
I acknowledge,

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:50.730 align:middle line:84%
that everybody has different
criterias of what they

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:54.460 align:middle line:90%
think is a fulfilling life.

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:58.740 align:middle line:84%
I will state, for those
people who have watched

00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:04.680 align:middle line:84%
and know what I stand for, that
things have been accomplished.

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:08.200 align:middle line:90%
But everybody can do it.

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.380 align:middle line:90%
We are no different.

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:11.480 align:middle line:84%
I am no different
than other people.

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.040 align:middle line:90%
They don't know my life.

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:19.140 align:middle line:84%
But I will share that I
have received information

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:26.150 align:middle line:84%
that came direct that has led to
myself having a life of beauty

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:32.970 align:middle line:84%
and love and fun and what
I feel is accomplishment.

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:36.070 align:middle line:84%
I would challenge other
people who tell us

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:38.870 align:middle line:84%
that they have the
secret of the ages

00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:43.740 align:middle line:84%
to just stand up and let people
just look at them and ask,

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:49.740 align:middle line:84%
do you really have this wisdom
that you are purporting?

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:53.300 align:middle line:84%
You are saying that the
magic door is going to open.

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:55.260 align:middle line:84%
Have you walked
through that door?

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:58.380 align:middle line:84%
And can you bring
it to other people?

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:00.380 align:middle line:90%
I believe not.

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:02.780 align:middle line:84%
I have not found
that in 40 years.

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:04.800 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean I haven't
found anybody loving?

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:05.480 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:06.920 align:middle line:90%
Not in this field.

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I was going to say--

00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:11.790 align:middle line:84%
not among the
self-proclaimed teachers--

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:13.040 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: That is exactly right.

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:14.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --but
among people, yes.

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: The average
people, the regular people,

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:21.030 align:middle line:84%
the Mother Teresas of the
world, the individuals,

00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:21.800 align:middle line:90%
the JR Newtons.

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:24.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The loving mother
of the world and mothers

00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:25.090 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:25.620 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely-- fathers.

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:26.460 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: They are doing it.

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:26.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:28.470 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And the
mother who lives, say,

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:33.640 align:middle line:84%
because the husband was
working on a car and the jack

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:36.320 align:middle line:84%
fell and the husband
is pinned and the woman

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:41.480 align:middle line:84%
lifts a car that five muscle
men couldn't do and releases

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:42.600 align:middle line:90%
the husband.

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:45.870 align:middle line:84%
I have witnessed and
seen, because I've

00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:47.600 align:middle line:90%
traveled all over the world.

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:50.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
the power of love.

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:53.110 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And this is
what has been the basis,

00:25:53.110 --> 00:26:00.540 align:middle line:84%
from the real teachers that
I have seen who don't profess

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:04.470 align:middle line:84%
to be teachers-- they walk
their talk so that everybody

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:08.710 align:middle line:84%
that they meet walks away from
them, including myself, going,

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:09.790 align:middle line:90%
wow.

00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:12.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
this person has,

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:15.107 align:middle line:84%
but I feel better after
leaving their presence.

00:26:15.107 --> 00:26:15.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:16.330 align:middle line:90%
That's the key.

00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:17.030 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: That's the key.

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:18.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is the key.

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:21.170 align:middle line:84%
So that's very
easy for all of us

00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:23.740 align:middle line:84%
to grok when we start looking
at the world around us.

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:26.990 align:middle line:84%
Where do I go away feeling
uplifted, more powerful,

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:28.660 align:middle line:90%
better, more inspired?

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:31.390 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: But why aren't
people trusting themselves?

00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:34.910 align:middle line:84%
This is how I challenged
audiences before.

00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:39.210 align:middle line:84%
This is how I would
challenge your viewers.

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:44.100 align:middle line:84%
What is stopping you
from understanding

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:49.500 align:middle line:84%
that you are as wise and
have access to total wisdom

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:51.850 align:middle line:90%
as much as all these books?

00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:54.530 align:middle line:84%
And why is it that
people are constantly

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:57.490 align:middle line:90%
going to this weekend seminar?

00:26:57.490 --> 00:27:02.970 align:middle line:84%
And then I met people who
go, Steve, it was so intense.

00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:06.555 align:middle line:84%
I had a headache for
two days-- and that,

00:27:06.555 --> 00:27:07.930 align:middle line:84%
and then two weeks
later, they're

00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:12.060 align:middle line:84%
in another seminar and another
seminar and this course.

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:14.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But we have
been taught as a species

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:17.570 align:middle line:84%
not to have faith in our
own knowledge and ourselves,

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:21.210 align:middle line:84%
but rather to place that
in the hands of others

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:25.270 align:middle line:84%
who are supposedly superior
in knowledge and being to us.

00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:28.820 align:middle line:84%
We've all been subject to
that on one level or another.

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:33.310 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Well, then I would say,
following what you just said,

00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:36.220 align:middle line:84%
that those people
we have been taught

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:39.660 align:middle line:90%
should be able to walk the talk.

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And yet, a majority
of them don't.

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:46.550 align:middle line:84%
I do like what Charles Barkley
said, a basketball player.

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:48.840 align:middle line:90%
Don't make me a role model.

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:50.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm nobody's role model.

00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:52.985 align:middle line:84%
This man is honest, because
there's other people who

00:27:52.985 --> 00:27:54.380 align:middle line:90%
go, no, you should be-- no.

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:58.890 align:middle line:84%
A role model is somebody
who exemplifies something

00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:02.630 align:middle line:84%
that is going to mean
more beauty for all

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:10.840 align:middle line:84%
of us, an understanding that
life is something of beauty.

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:14.864 align:middle line:84%
We have made it such a
colossal something or other.

00:28:14.864 --> 00:28:15.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Chore.

00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:19.470 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: A chore, thank
you-- an incredible chore

00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:23.160 align:middle line:84%
that people are struggling,
struggling, struggling.

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And they don't
feel good at night.

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:27.690 align:middle line:90%
We're on more medications.

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:28.770 align:middle line:90%
We're on more drugs.

00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:31.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, the ancient
philosophers would say,

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:40.310 align:middle line:84%
if we aligned ourselves with
the archetype of good health,

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:47.090 align:middle line:84%
we would increase our lifespan
a tremendous amount-- if we just

00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:49.730 align:middle line:90%
followed nature's dictums.

00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:51.030 align:middle line:90%
But we don't.

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:54.220 align:middle line:84%
And we're back to
when we cut off

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:59.592 align:middle line:84%
from the flows of
health, wisdom, truth--

00:28:59.592 --> 00:29:00.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Beauty, love.

00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:01.750 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Beauty and love.

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:03.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Nature, all of it.

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:04.200 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: We stagnate.

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:04.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We stagnate.

00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:05.734 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: And we get disease.

00:29:05.734 --> 00:29:08.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And even if
you don't die physically,

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.720 align:middle line:84%
your spirit is
often to the point

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:12.300 align:middle line:84%
where there's no real
joy in living anymore.

00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:13.960 align:middle line:90%
So it's a death of another kind.

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:16.077 align:middle line:84%
It's a spiritual kind of
death that occurs even

00:29:16.077 --> 00:29:17.160 align:middle line:90%
before the physical death.

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:20.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And this is why I hope
your listeners appreciate you,

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:25.750 align:middle line:84%
because you are stating
universal truths that are there

00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:27.180 align:middle line:90%
for all people.

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And these are not
Steve Ross's truths.

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:33.050 align:middle line:84%
That was a dream
that came through me.

00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:37.320 align:middle line:84%
But we have been talking
about a universal wisdom that

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:41.970 align:middle line:84%
asks individuals
to be in integrity,

00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:47.190 align:middle line:84%
be consistent, and live
what you want to become.

00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:48.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:48.940 align:middle line:90%
OK, now.

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:51.410 align:middle line:84%
So that comes back
to the statement

00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:54.070 align:middle line:84%
you were talking about about
this planet being a schoolroom.

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:54.580 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:58.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And one of the
things I find interesting

00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:00.680 align:middle line:84%
is-- and we talked
about this off camera,

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:03.440 align:middle line:84%
and you had your
perspective on it--

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:07.640 align:middle line:84%
is there is the perception
that the world is waking up,

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:11.830 align:middle line:84%
that we're elevating
ourselves into finer

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:14.980 align:middle line:84%
realms of consciousness,
awareness, openness, thought.

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
thinking about it.

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:20.420 align:middle line:84%
I don't really know
that that's true,

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:23.910 align:middle line:84%
because I live in kind
of a rarefied world.

00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:26.240 align:middle line:84%
I spend my professional
life with people like you.

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:28.890 align:middle line:84%
I live in Sedona, Arizona,
where you can talk about all

00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:30.340 align:middle line:90%
of these concepts at breakfast.

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:31.210 align:middle line:90%
It's not an issue.

00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:31.793 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Right.

00:30:31.793 --> 00:30:35.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But in the world
at large, is that so?

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:38.380 align:middle line:84%
Has there, in one school
of thought, always

00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:41.670 align:middle line:84%
been kind of basic
percentages on this planet

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:44.560 align:middle line:84%
because there's this
graduation and refreshment

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:45.265 align:middle line:90%
cycle happening?

00:30:45.265 --> 00:30:46.740 align:middle line:90%
And can you talk about that?

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:48.490 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Following
my understanding,

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:52.900 align:middle line:84%
from reading ancient
texts and really

00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:57.040 align:middle line:84%
trying to understand
the philosophers,

00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:01.070 align:middle line:84%
they classified the
Earth as a schoolroom.

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:06.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's take the schoolroom
analogy and go from as above,

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:09.130 align:middle line:90%
so below and as below, so above.

00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:12.400 align:middle line:84%
If you look at a schoolroom,
a regular schoolroom--

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:14.980 align:middle line:84%
and let's take an
elementary school from first

00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:18.020 align:middle line:84%
to sixth grade-- it
could be that the fourth

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:21.270 align:middle line:84%
and fifth or sixth
graders go, oh, my gosh.

00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:23.422 align:middle line:84%
What is with those first
and second graders?

00:31:23.422 --> 00:31:23.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Kindergartners.

00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:24.860 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Yeah, kindergartners--
they can't do this.

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:25.910 align:middle line:90%
They can't do that.

00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:30.330 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is those
sixth graders graduate

00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:32.430 align:middle line:90%
and they go into another school.

00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:35.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, the idea of a school
is to have experience

00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:37.400 align:middle line:90%
in and learn lessons.

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And so is it possible
that this is a schoolroom?

00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:47.360 align:middle line:84%
This allows us opportunities
in a slowed down version

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:52.570 align:middle line:84%
to experience precepts
that we learned in spirit

00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:55.910 align:middle line:84%
but we get down here in
a practical experience.

00:31:55.910 --> 00:32:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And the people who have
learned or taken those lessons,

00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:05.370 align:middle line:84%
they go on to higher
realms of education.

00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:07.090 align:middle line:90%
They continue on.

00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:09.780 align:middle line:84%
This is the antithesis
of what I heard.

00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:14.500 align:middle line:84%
At 2012, the whole consciousness
is going to change.

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And everybody's going to be
enlightened and this and that.

00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:21.550 align:middle line:84%
No, that is nonsense
because that

00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:24.280 align:middle line:84%
would be the equivalent of
going into an elementary school

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:30.170 align:middle line:84%
and saying, you now are
all college students.

00:32:30.170 --> 00:32:36.330 align:middle line:84%
It is that fast food mentality
where you don't work.

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:38.810 align:middle line:84%
When Christianity was
first coming out--

00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:40.550 align:middle line:84%
and it was not
called Christianity

00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:44.200 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning-- and there
were really nothing written

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.580 align:middle line:90%
about Jesus at that time.

00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:49.960 align:middle line:84%
But what was talked
about was Christianity

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:52.970 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most
dangerous religions that

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:54.460 align:middle line:90%
has ever come on the planet.

00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:55.890 align:middle line:90%
And here's why.

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:59.870 align:middle line:84%
It preached vicarious
atonement, which

00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:05.570 align:middle line:84%
means you can do whatever you
want, and if at the last second

00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:10.470 align:middle line:84%
you profess in someone's
name, you are forgiven.

00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:13.270 align:middle line:84%
Wow, that is a very
unusual system.

00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:15.530 align:middle line:84%
But none of the
ancients accepted that,

00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:20.620 align:middle line:84%
because that put no
responsibility on a person.

00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:22.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I asked that
when I was in Sunday school

00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:23.602 align:middle line:90%
when I was five.

00:33:23.602 --> 00:33:25.310 align:middle line:84%
I said, that just
doesn't make any sense.

00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:26.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And I'm sure
you endeared yourself

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:28.181 align:middle line:90%
to the superiors at the time.

00:33:28.181 --> 00:33:29.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, I did not.

00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:35.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: It is a nice, wonderful,
cushy feeling and belief.

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And for the people who want
to keep accepting that,

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:41.590 align:middle line:84%
it means you don't have to
work, because for some, it

00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:46.630 align:middle line:84%
means you get baptized,
and it's all good.

00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:50.330 align:middle line:84%
You say in the name of
Jesus, it is all good.

00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:54.930 align:middle line:84%
But what did Jesus
really point out?

00:33:54.930 --> 00:33:59.090 align:middle line:84%
We're taking him, again, as
a philosopher among many,

00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:00.620 align:middle line:90%
as a teacher.

00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:02.450 align:middle line:90%
He spoke about love.

00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:06.030 align:middle line:84%
He said to Nicodemus,
you go into the closet

00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:08.620 align:middle line:84%
of your own self and
you have a direct link.

00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:11.084 align:middle line:84%
He did not say to
him, you know what?

00:34:11.084 --> 00:34:12.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You go through me.

00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:12.860 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: That's right.

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:13.790 align:middle line:90%
You don't go through me.

00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:14.456 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:14.456 --> 00:34:16.050 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: You go directly.

00:34:16.050 --> 00:34:20.730 align:middle line:84%
He taught a philosophy
that was by example

00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:22.386 align:middle line:90%
every step of the way.

00:34:22.386 --> 00:34:22.969 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:22.969 --> 00:34:25.620 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And that was
what-- when he said

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:28.239 align:middle line:90%
you need to be born again, wow.

00:34:28.239 --> 00:34:31.469 align:middle line:84%
You can go and read so
many different opinion

00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:32.747 align:middle line:90%
of what born again means.

00:34:32.747 --> 00:34:33.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:33.330 --> 00:34:35.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: My understanding
of that was

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:41.179 align:middle line:84%
you are now dwelling from your
spiritual higher consciousness.

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:42.830 align:middle line:90%
You are integrity.

00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:46.920 align:middle line:84%
You are in integrity
with the higher precepts,

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:51.840 align:middle line:84%
working from the spiritual self
rather than just the conscious

00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:56.100 align:middle line:84%
give me, bring me, I'm going
to take, I'm going to grab.

00:34:56.100 --> 00:35:00.220 align:middle line:84%
So why is our society,
in the same way,

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:02.350 align:middle line:84%
going to fall like
the Roman Empire?

00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:05.460 align:middle line:84%
For this simple reason--
during an election

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:12.030 align:middle line:84%
year, you monitor how
many of the politicians

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:15.810 align:middle line:84%
are shown going into that
church-- so and so is attending

00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:17.450 align:middle line:90%
church on Sunday.

00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:18.960 align:middle line:90%
This is not voting.

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.900 align:middle line:84%
They're showing
they're religious.

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And then what do they
do the rest of the week?

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:28.550 align:middle line:84%
Are they in integrity
with love and truth?

00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:29.387 align:middle line:90%
Are they integrity?

00:35:29.387 --> 00:35:30.595 align:middle line:90%
Or do they come out and say--

00:35:30.595 --> 00:35:31.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Expeditious deals.

00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:33.150 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Well, yes.

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:34.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: People to answer to.

00:35:34.930 --> 00:35:36.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: I'm going
to do a good show.

00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:37.669 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Money to answer to.

00:35:37.669 --> 00:35:39.210 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: They'll tell
you they profess

00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:41.930 align:middle line:84%
in turning the other cheek,
which has a different meaning

00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:43.920 align:middle line:90%
than just giving up.

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:46.820 align:middle line:84%
But what it means
is you are looking

00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:51.100 align:middle line:84%
from a state of a higher
consciousness before you react.

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:53.310 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
when you're struck,

00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:58.800 align:middle line:84%
you give the other cheek
because, by my understanding,

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:04.950 align:middle line:84%
you are taking one moment more
than just instantly reacting

00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:07.130 align:middle line:84%
and being the Hatfields
and the McCoys.

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:08.675 align:middle line:90%
You strike me, I strike you.

00:36:08.675 --> 00:36:11.940 align:middle line:84%
You are giving that
other cheek because you

00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:15.450 align:middle line:84%
are taking that
extra time to decide

00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:18.192 align:middle line:84%
how you're going to react
and what you are going to do.

00:36:18.192 --> 00:36:19.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Taking the
higher path ideally.

00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:20.150 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Always.

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:22.286 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's not what's
happening in the world.

00:36:22.286 --> 00:36:24.310 align:middle line:84%
What's happening in
the world at large

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:27.550 align:middle line:84%
is we're taking offense at every
little slap across the cheek,

00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:29.350 align:middle line:90%
and we're reacting very badly.

00:36:29.350 --> 00:36:33.052 align:middle line:84%
And I take this point
back to something

00:36:33.052 --> 00:36:34.510 align:middle line:84%
that you and I
talked about, again,

00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:38.470 align:middle line:84%
off camera, which is
natural calamities seem

00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:40.980 align:middle line:84%
to occur on Earth
when there have been

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:45.960 align:middle line:84%
great political upheavals,
great amounts of bloodshed,

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:50.290 align:middle line:84%
anger, blame, and so forth,
as a result of not having

00:36:50.290 --> 00:36:51.920 align:middle line:84%
the wisdom to turn
the other cheek

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:56.690 align:middle line:84%
and take just a beat before
we react as cultures,

00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:58.520 align:middle line:90%
as political bodies.

00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:01.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: The ancients
started watching.

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:05.050 align:middle line:10%
And as you go into
our modern era--

00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:09.460 align:middle line:10%
that these great plagues
followed very closely

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:14.420 align:middle line:10%
on long wars, upheaval
in different areas,

00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:20.010 align:middle line:10%
despite what some people feel
that this, or that we live on,

00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:25.610 align:middle line:10%
is just to be dredged and sucked
out and blackened and polluted.

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:29.670 align:middle line:10%
It is a living organism.

00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:32.400 align:middle line:10%
And we have cause
and effect here.

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:35.570 align:middle line:84%
And these calamities,
these plagues,

00:37:35.570 --> 00:37:38.770 align:middle line:84%
this constant bickering
back and forth

00:37:38.770 --> 00:37:43.390 align:middle line:84%
is mirrored into the atmosphere
and back to us again.

00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:46.700 align:middle line:10%
And for those people who
don't feel that there's really

00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:49.380 align:middle line:10%
any connection
between what we do,

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:54.670 align:middle line:10%
I saw an incredible
documentary about the wasteland

00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:57.170 align:middle line:10%
that happened in
the '30s and '40s,

00:37:57.170 --> 00:38:01.910 align:middle line:10%
where all of the mid
part of the country

00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:05.310 align:middle line:10%
went through the Dust
Bowl because of what

00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:09.100 align:middle line:10%
they were doing with the
agriculture and the land

00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:11.640 align:middle line:10%
before we lived.

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:14.230 align:middle line:84%
But see, now, we're
back in integrity again.

00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:16.460 align:middle line:10%
We're not saying
that-- and it is not

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:21.330 align:middle line:10%
my position of just
saying, no the world

00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:25.140 align:middle line:10%
is a 100% thinking being.

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:28.200 align:middle line:84%
It could actually be
much greater than us.

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:29.810 align:middle line:90%
I can't say.

00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:33.220 align:middle line:84%
But I will tell you that
cause and effect takes place

00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:35.990 align:middle line:90%
on every realm of our being.

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:40.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a term called
righteous indignation, which

00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:46.390 align:middle line:84%
means I am right, and I am
pissed off-- not a nice term--

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:48.550 align:middle line:90%
but pissed off.

00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:50.480 align:middle line:84%
I am perfectly
right, but you know

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:52.160 align:middle line:90%
what that does to my system?

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:56.560 align:middle line:10%
Because my system doesn't know,
oh, Steven's right, therefore,

00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:57.990 align:middle line:10%
he's getting a free pass for--

00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:59.240 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: On being pissed off.

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:01.406 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Yeah, being pissed
off and raising his blood

00:39:01.406 --> 00:39:03.420 align:middle line:84%
pressure-- we're going
to give him at this.

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:09.440 align:middle line:10%
As above, so below-- everything
that takes place in any sphere

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:11.890 align:middle line:10%
takes place in the
higher spheres.

00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And so we do have
more of an effect.

00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to say which
side's right on the bickering.

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:25.070 align:middle line:84%
But when people go to
argue only to argue,

00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:27.820 align:middle line:84%
when they dogmatically
hold to something,

00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:30.000 align:middle line:84%
and you read about
them later-- well,

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.680 align:middle line:84%
I really believed in that, but
I wanted to vote with my party

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:35.590 align:middle line:84%
because they're
gonna be pissed off--

00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:40.150 align:middle line:84%
there is not only a disconnect
in that individual person,

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:44.507 align:middle line:84%
but in our society, in our
world, and in the cosmos.

00:39:44.507 --> 00:39:46.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When we start
thinking politically rather than

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:49.067 align:middle line:84%
thinking in that
place of integrity

00:39:49.067 --> 00:39:50.400 align:middle line:90%
you're talking about in general.

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:53.487 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: "Mr. Smith Goes to
Washington" is long, long gone.

00:39:53.487 --> 00:39:54.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:54.070 --> 00:39:54.490 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:56.323 align:middle line:84%
Well, now, what you
were just talking about,

00:39:56.323 --> 00:40:00.950 align:middle line:84%
too-- and about our impact
from an emotional standpoint

00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:05.390 align:middle line:84%
on the geological upheavals
and such of the Earth--

00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:10.090 align:middle line:84%
this is also something that
Howard Martin and the Resonance

00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:13.910 align:middle line:84%
Project, HeartMath Institute
and the Resonance Project,

00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:16.800 align:middle line:84%
have also discovered
with the various devices.

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:19.860 align:middle line:84%
They've had sensors they've
had placed around where they

00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:23.340 align:middle line:84%
measure what happens with
the Earth in resonance

00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:26.010 align:middle line:84%
with what's going
on in the attitudes

00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:29.800 align:middle line:84%
and emotions, in particular,
of the people on that land.

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:33.800 align:middle line:84%
And they have measured
the link between the two.

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:38.280 align:middle line:84%
So the fact that the ancients
were able to observe this,

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:40.160 align:middle line:84%
that where there was
war, there became

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:44.010 align:middle line:84%
plague and calamity
geologically and otherwise.

00:40:44.010 --> 00:40:45.550 align:middle line:90%
This is very real.

00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:47.140 align:middle line:84%
So now, we have a
few minutes left.

00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And what I'd like to do
is we all have our areas

00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:52.450 align:middle line:84%
where we haven't
had an open mind,

00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:57.280 align:middle line:84%
we haven't had the most
beautiful heart, and so forth.

00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And the last one is
the humble spirit.

00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:01.200 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Right.

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:02.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:07.507 align:middle line:84%
How would you, if you were
the philosopher that you are,

00:41:07.507 --> 00:41:08.340 align:middle line:90%
begin constructing--

00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:10.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And by the way, I
appreciate you calling me that.

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:13.070 align:middle line:84%
I always look at myself
kind of as a librarian.

00:41:13.070 --> 00:41:14.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know you do.

00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:15.720 align:middle line:90%
And you have a great library.

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:18.570 align:middle line:84%
The library philosopher that you
are and the knowledge that you

00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:22.110 align:middle line:84%
have access to, which is
vast and has deep history

00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:24.610 align:middle line:84%
and meaning-- how
would you tell us just

00:41:24.610 --> 00:41:28.590 align:middle line:84%
to begin, each one of us, on our
own journey to that brilliance

00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:31.970 align:middle line:84%
and genius and intuition and
beautiful heart and love that

00:41:31.970 --> 00:41:34.700 align:middle line:84%
already exists around us,
even if we're not actually

00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:35.910 align:middle line:90%
accessing it in the moment?

00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:36.660 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Right.

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:42.840 align:middle line:84%
I understand that people have
a hesitancy in often believing

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:45.140 align:middle line:90%
that they have any ability.

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:47.640 align:middle line:84%
I would say that a first
step for individuals

00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:51.660 align:middle line:84%
is when a thought
comes into your mind

00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:56.620 align:middle line:84%
that you can help
another person-- maybe

00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:58.890 align:middle line:84%
you're told touch
their shoulder.

00:41:58.890 --> 00:42:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you're told
pat them on the back.

00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:08.006 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you're told to give them
and joke to make them laugh.

00:42:08.006 --> 00:42:10.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or just listen.

00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:11.390 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Just listening.

00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:14.890 align:middle line:84%
That is coming from
a beautiful heart

00:42:14.890 --> 00:42:20.070 align:middle line:84%
where you have a desire to
help another individual,

00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:22.030 align:middle line:90%
to help the land.

00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:26.220 align:middle line:84%
In other words, this
imagination which was really

00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:30.136 align:middle line:84%
a door that the wisdom is
coming through, wherever--

00:42:30.136 --> 00:42:31.260 align:middle line:90%
that would be a whole show.

00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:32.634 align:middle line:84%
Where is that
really coming from?

00:42:32.634 --> 00:42:34.710 align:middle line:10%
Is it your higher yourself?

00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:36.530 align:middle line:90%
Is it a collection of spirits?

00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:38.260 align:middle line:90%
Is it right from god?

00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:41.780 align:middle line:84%
It really doesn't matter,
because you can't identify that

00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:45.890 align:middle line:84%
as much as you follow
what that truth is.

00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:50.410 align:middle line:84%
If it feels right, you
have permission to do it.

00:42:50.410 --> 00:42:55.140 align:middle line:84%
So the beautiful heart
is that you give out,

00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:57.070 align:middle line:90%
that you share that love.

00:42:57.070 --> 00:43:00.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, the open mind
is that you are

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:04.260 align:middle line:84%
open to listening
to whatever that is.

00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:10.780 align:middle line:10%
You have not fallen into that
belief, that, oh my gosh,

00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:14.530 align:middle line:10%
only my teacher knows,
only my guru knows,

00:43:14.530 --> 00:43:16.360 align:middle line:10%
only this person knows.

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:21.050 align:middle line:84%
My family doesn't think I
know what I'm talking about.

00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:28.655 align:middle line:84%
You trust yourself as a divine
child of the mother-father-god,

00:43:28.655 --> 00:43:33.030 align:middle line:84%
of the creator of the creation,
whatever's comfortable.

00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:37.260 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't be here
if you weren't special.

00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:39.240 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't be
here if you were not

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:43.550 align:middle line:84%
supposed to learn that
you can do everything.

00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:48.360 align:middle line:84%
Ralph Waldo Emerson
said, Jesus, the Buddha,

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:51.090 align:middle line:90%
Plato, they had their time.

00:43:51.090 --> 00:43:53.030 align:middle line:90%
You have your time.

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:55.680 align:middle line:90%
You are special.

00:43:55.680 --> 00:44:00.950 align:middle line:84%
This feeling that you
are a child of wisdom,

00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:03.380 align:middle line:90%
everybody must have.

00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:06.640 align:middle line:90%
The last part is being humble.

00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:10.160 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of people who
have written books who started

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:14.360 align:middle line:84%
on a very nice path in our
society, and by the time

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:17.610 align:middle line:84%
a little time goes, they're
not very humble anymore.

00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:19.840 align:middle line:84%
They're not even
very nice people.

00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:21.950 align:middle line:90%
I will never say who.

00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:25.030 align:middle line:10%
But you know, out
there, who it is

00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:28.530 align:middle line:10%
that you have a little bit of
a question about that, yes,

00:44:28.530 --> 00:44:33.630 align:middle line:10%
their teachings are good, but--
their teachings are helpful,

00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:38.890 align:middle line:10%
but-- you have to believe that
you have a right to question

00:44:38.890 --> 00:44:41.260 align:middle line:10%
if somebody's not in integrity.

00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:47.140 align:middle line:84%
So we start by understanding
that we are here

00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:49.530 align:middle line:90%
to demonstrate something.

00:44:49.530 --> 00:44:51.530 align:middle line:90%
We are creators.

00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:57.220 align:middle line:84%
We are not in the image of god
in our physical conveyance.

00:44:57.220 --> 00:45:01.590 align:middle line:84%
We are image of god in
that we are creators

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:06.720 align:middle line:84%
and we are down here to
manage creative energies.

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:09.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
maybe contemplate

00:45:09.610 --> 00:45:13.740 align:middle line:84%
what that means in terms of our
previous conversation-- of love

00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:15.860 align:middle line:84%
and beauty and,
ultimately, wisdom.

00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:17.270 align:middle line:90%
What do those words really mean?

00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:17.990 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:19.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Steven,
thank you so much.

00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:21.220 align:middle line:84%
I always enjoy our
talks together,

00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:23.820 align:middle line:84%
from the previous ones
on "Healing Matrix,"

00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:26.590 align:middle line:84%
of the Rife microscope
and healing with energies

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:30.360 align:middle line:84%
and colors and so forth, all
the way to the deeper concepts

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:32.260 align:middle line:90%
that run far behind that.

00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:33.880 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: And Regina, thank you.

00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:37.090 align:middle line:84%
I always appreciate
that you provide

00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:43.260 align:middle line:84%
an opportunity for an individual
to express their understanding.

00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:44.384 align:middle line:90%
So I thank you.

00:45:44.384 --> 00:45:45.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you, Steven.

00:45:45.550 --> 00:45:48.010 align:middle line:10%
To go more in depth
into these philosophies

00:45:48.010 --> 00:45:50.910 align:middle line:10%
we've been talking about and
also modalities of healing,

00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:53.820 align:middle line:10%
you can go to wrf.org.

00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:58.070 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.

00:45:58.070 --> 00:46:15.957 align:middle line:90%
