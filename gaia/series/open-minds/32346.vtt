>> Regina Meredith: If you've
been watching my programs,

00:00:21.922 --> 00:00:24.125 align:middle line:84%
you've undoubtedly heard
me speak of entrainment

00:00:24.125 --> 00:00:26.961 align:middle line:84%
or programming, designed
to keep our heads down,

00:00:26.961 --> 00:00:29.196 align:middle line:90%
asleep to our own capabilities.

00:00:29.196 --> 00:00:30.698 align:middle line:84%
But what if there
were a frequency

00:00:30.698 --> 00:00:32.833 align:middle line:84%
that could wake us
back up to who we are

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:34.502 align:middle line:90%
and what we're capable of?

00:00:34.502 --> 00:00:37.204 align:middle line:84%
Brenda Williams has a very
strange story to tell us

00:00:37.204 --> 00:00:38.873 align:middle line:90%
about the existence of just

00:00:38.873 --> 00:00:41.242 align:middle line:84%
such a frequency
called the Triad Wave.

00:00:41.242 --> 00:00:43.611 align:middle line:84%
Her journey from trophy
wife to the sequencer

00:00:43.611 --> 00:00:46.147 align:middle line:90%
of this sine wave is phenomenal.

00:00:46.147 --> 00:00:48.816 align:middle line:84%
So I would recommend you
get a cup of tea, sit back,

00:00:48.816 --> 00:00:52.219 align:middle line:84%
and fully immerse yourself
in this conversation.

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.122 align:middle line:84%
It's such a joy to have you
here and I can't wait for you

00:00:55.122 --> 00:01:00.628 align:middle line:84%
to reveal all of this to people
of all walks, all backgrounds.

00:01:00.628 --> 00:01:04.832 align:middle line:84%
This really has to do with
every single human being.

00:01:04.832 --> 00:01:06.801 align:middle line:90%
This isn't for a selected few.

00:01:06.801 --> 00:01:09.503 align:middle line:84%
And you're here essentially
as a messenger.

00:01:09.503 --> 00:01:12.173 align:middle line:84%
You're here to offer this
as a gift to the world

00:01:12.173 --> 00:01:15.442 align:middle line:84%
which to me is also the
phenomenal part of it.

00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:18.746 align:middle line:84%
So, that in mind, do
you mind if I read this?

00:01:18.746 --> 00:01:20.147 align:middle line:90%
>> Brenda Williams: Please do.

00:01:20.147 --> 00:01:21.215 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: I think you
know who the author is of this.

00:01:21.215 --> 00:01:23.484 align:middle line:84%
It may not mean anything
to other people.

00:01:23.484 --> 00:01:25.352 align:middle line:90%
But it sets up the context

00:01:25.352 --> 00:01:28.022 align:middle line:84%
for what we're going
to be talking about.

00:01:28.022 --> 00:01:31.692 align:middle line:84%
This was an excerpt from
cyberspaceorbit.com.

00:01:31.692 --> 00:01:35.329 align:middle line:84%
"When tuned electromagnetic
waves intersect,

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:39.033 align:middle line:84%
they sometimes seem to
cancel out, but do they?

00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:42.036 align:middle line:84%
Is a super potential
scalar energy created?

00:01:42.036 --> 00:01:44.405 align:middle line:84%
Could such a pressure
wave be controlled--

00:01:44.405 --> 00:01:46.607 align:middle line:84%
directed through a
quantum universe?

00:01:46.607 --> 00:01:48.676 align:middle line:90%
Has this happened for years now?

00:01:48.676 --> 00:01:52.580 align:middle line:84%
Do rogue groups on and
off planet wield strange

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.747 align:middle line:90%
new weapons?

00:01:53.747 --> 00:01:56.584 align:middle line:84%
Do directed waves go
beyond machine technology

00:01:56.584 --> 00:02:01.722 align:middle line:84%
and actually reside
within human potential?"

00:02:01.722 --> 00:02:03.557 align:middle line:84%
The answer is what,
yes, yes, yes, yes?

00:02:03.557 --> 00:02:05.492 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Yes, yes and yes and yes.

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:09.163 align:middle line:84%
Actually if you go back
to as early as 1976,

00:02:09.163 --> 00:02:11.298 align:middle line:90%
Andrija Puharich was announcing

00:02:11.298 --> 00:02:13.267 align:middle line:84%
to world governments
the existence

00:02:13.267 --> 00:02:16.570 align:middle line:84%
of this Russian application
of being able

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.107 align:middle line:84%
to polts [phonetic] some of
these waves, these frequencies

00:02:20.107 --> 00:02:24.211 align:middle line:84%
into the population to do
mind control or manipulation.

00:02:24.211 --> 00:02:26.480 align:middle line:84%
And of course not very
many people paid a lot

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.548 align:middle line:90%
of attention to it then.

00:02:27.548 --> 00:02:29.884 align:middle line:84%
Although, they knew
that it existed.

00:02:29.884 --> 00:02:33.454 align:middle line:84%
They also were aware that it was
based on a lot of the Tesla work

00:02:33.454 --> 00:02:36.557 align:middle line:90%
that had been left unfinished.

00:02:36.557 --> 00:02:41.695 align:middle line:84%
As time passed and Charlie--
I began-- I met Charlie.

00:02:41.695 --> 00:02:42.830 align:middle line:90%
Charlie actually--

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:43.964 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Charlie Plyler is
the one who wrote that.

00:02:43.964 --> 00:02:45.266 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: Charlie Plyler is
the one who wrote that.

00:02:45.266 --> 00:02:49.270 align:middle line:84%
Charlie actually noticed
it and picked it up.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.607 align:middle line:84%
ELFRAD was doing basically
what ELFRAD was designed to do

00:02:53.607 --> 00:02:56.175 align:middle line:84%
in its day job was
to monitor and look

00:02:56.175 --> 00:02:59.413 align:middle line:84%
for earthquake precursor so that
they could have an early warning

00:02:59.413 --> 00:03:03.751 align:middle line:84%
system in earthquake
environments.

00:03:03.751 --> 00:03:07.688 align:middle line:84%
The system-- the technicians
were scattered around the world

00:03:07.688 --> 00:03:10.090 align:middle line:84%
and they had very sophisticated
equipment that could pick

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.993 align:middle line:84%
up variations in
frequency modulation.

00:03:12.993 --> 00:03:17.665 align:middle line:84%
So they began to pick up this
unusual sequence of frequencies

00:03:17.665 --> 00:03:20.968 align:middle line:84%
that didn't match anything
they had ever seen before.

00:03:20.968 --> 00:03:24.004 align:middle line:84%
And so, he began to talk
about it and work with it.

00:03:24.004 --> 00:03:28.509 align:middle line:84%
In 2003, in Arizona, I
met Benjamin Lonetree

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:30.644 align:middle line:90%
who actually did analysis of--

00:03:30.644 --> 00:03:33.380 align:middle line:84%
spectral analysis of
the wave sequencing,

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.749 align:middle line:84%
shared it with Charlie,
and I got to meet Charlie

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:41.021 align:middle line:84%
in some time pass 2003,
very clandestine meeting

00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:42.489 align:middle line:84%
because he didn't
talk to people.

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.591 align:middle line:84%
But he told me a
lot of that time

00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:48.996 align:middle line:84%
about what the wave was actually
doing well beyond what my

00:03:48.996 --> 00:03:50.731 align:middle line:90%
original understanding was.

00:03:50.731 --> 00:03:53.701 align:middle line:84%
When it first was
developed, it was more working

00:03:53.701 --> 00:03:56.303 align:middle line:84%
with the physiology
of the human form.

00:03:56.303 --> 00:03:59.173 align:middle line:84%
If I were-- one of
the thoughts I shared

00:03:59.173 --> 00:04:02.609 align:middle line:84%
with you earlier was the wave
acts like the amniotic fluid

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:05.312 align:middle line:84%
that holds the fetus while
it's getting ready to develop

00:04:05.312 --> 00:04:07.981 align:middle line:84%
into its full potential
as a human being.

00:04:07.981 --> 00:04:10.918 align:middle line:84%
Well the wave does
that now in terms

00:04:10.918 --> 00:04:13.187 align:middle line:84%
of how it addresses
the human physiology

00:04:13.187 --> 00:04:16.690 align:middle line:84%
as we now become what I
refer to as holy human,

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.595 align:middle line:84%
our divine intelligence
merged and working into--

00:04:21.595 --> 00:04:23.864 align:middle line:84%
you know, in concert
with the intelligence

00:04:23.864 --> 00:04:28.435 align:middle line:84%
within our heart-brain, not our
database, but our heart-brain

00:04:28.435 --> 00:04:32.306 align:middle line:84%
where that immaculate,
holy human resides.

00:04:32.306 --> 00:04:36.543 align:middle line:84%
So, Charlie was a gift as have
been numerous other people along

00:04:36.543 --> 00:04:37.945 align:middle line:90%
the way.

00:04:37.945 --> 00:04:39.380 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And we're going to talk
about them in what piece each

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.914 align:middle line:90%
of them brought to this story.

00:04:40.914 --> 00:04:45.953 align:middle line:84%
So, I would like to begin at the
beginning of this story with you

00:04:45.953 --> 00:04:50.958 align:middle line:84%
in the East Coast, in the
South, as a trophy wife

00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.427 align:middle line:84%
who was diagnosed with breast
cancer and this has been

00:04:53.427 --> 00:04:54.728 align:middle line:90%
over 20 years ago now.

00:04:54.728 --> 00:05:00.901 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: 1990, and actually
in my pre-1990 programming,

00:05:00.901 --> 00:05:02.870 align:middle line:84%
we would not be having
this conversation

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.973 align:middle line:84%
because I would be probably
walking about 14 miles away

00:05:05.973 --> 00:05:08.509 align:middle line:84%
from anything that even
remotely resembled this.

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:11.278 align:middle line:90%
I had no background in any

00:05:11.278 --> 00:05:15.015 align:middle line:84%
of these concepts nor was I
a mathematician, a scientist,

00:05:15.015 --> 00:05:18.152 align:middle line:84%
or someone who understood
physiology to the degree

00:05:18.152 --> 00:05:19.420 align:middle line:90%
that is required today.

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:24.324 align:middle line:84%
I was-- received a phone
call about 8:30 one night

00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:27.294 align:middle line:84%
from a surgeon who said he
had me scheduled for surgery

00:05:27.294 --> 00:05:29.430 align:middle line:90%
at 7:30 the next morning.

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.533 align:middle line:84%
They had discovered
a very aggressive DNA

00:05:32.533 --> 00:05:35.202 align:middle line:84%
with a cancer-- with
a breast cancer.

00:05:35.202 --> 00:05:39.606 align:middle line:84%
So, I packed my bag and went
into surgery the next morning.

00:05:39.606 --> 00:05:44.945 align:middle line:84%
The cancer was very aggressive
and they were not very hopeful

00:05:44.945 --> 00:05:46.847 align:middle line:90%
as to what the outcome would be.

00:05:46.847 --> 00:05:49.616 align:middle line:84%
But they were willing to put
together this enormous cocktail

00:05:49.616 --> 00:05:54.021 align:middle line:84%
of chemotherapy which would
possibly give me a few more

00:05:54.021 --> 00:05:57.491 align:middle line:84%
months until they could find
something better to use.

00:05:57.491 --> 00:06:00.727 align:middle line:84%
I agreed because I had
family who were concerned

00:06:00.727 --> 00:06:04.865 align:middle line:84%
and six months was
better than no months.

00:06:04.865 --> 00:06:07.501 align:middle line:84%
The outcome of that and
the-- you know, the--

00:06:07.501 --> 00:06:10.971 align:middle line:84%
when I had one treatment of the
chemo, the side effects were

00:06:10.971 --> 00:06:14.441 align:middle line:84%
so tremendously devastating
that I said no more.

00:06:14.441 --> 00:06:20.280 align:middle line:84%
Went out on my deck and
began to observe the patterns

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.283 align:middle line:84%
that were forming when the birds
would come to the bird feeders

00:06:23.283 --> 00:06:24.985 align:middle line:84%
so the wind would
blow a certain way

00:06:24.985 --> 00:06:27.454 align:middle line:84%
and there will be
a specific pattern.

00:06:27.454 --> 00:06:28.856 align:middle line:90%
What I later understood was

00:06:28.856 --> 00:06:32.993 align:middle line:84%
that I was becoming more sensory
awake which is one of the things

00:06:32.993 --> 00:06:35.295 align:middle line:84%
as a human population,
we are not.

00:06:35.295 --> 00:06:37.331 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Now, is this partly
a function of the fact

00:06:37.331 --> 00:06:38.632 align:middle line:90%
that your brain was decimated

00:06:38.632 --> 00:06:40.300 align:middle line:84%
by all the drugs
on a certain level?

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.069 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: I think I was just
taken out of my own way.

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:43.770 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: You were taken out
of your way, exactly, yeah.

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.607 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: And the other part
of that was it was time.

00:06:46.607 --> 00:06:48.475 align:middle line:90%
It was time.

00:06:48.475 --> 00:06:52.779 align:middle line:84%
Others had come before me to set
this up and now I was hearing

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:56.850 align:middle line:84%
in my inner thoughts that this
was my time now to begin my part

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:00.954 align:middle line:84%
of this process and to begin
bringing this on to the planet.

00:07:00.954 --> 00:07:02.189 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So now you're
back on the deck.

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:05.325 align:middle line:84%
You're observing all
these patterns of nature,

00:07:05.325 --> 00:07:07.361 align:middle line:90%
birds, wind and so forth.

00:07:07.361 --> 00:07:09.830 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: And as that happened,

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:14.134 align:middle line:84%
I began to notice things
a little more clearly.

00:07:14.134 --> 00:07:19.940 align:middle line:84%
I begin to have thoughts
that would have information

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:23.343 align:middle line:84%
around numbering sequences
and things like that.

00:07:23.343 --> 00:07:27.514 align:middle line:84%
I was deemed not quite
right in the head, body,

00:07:27.514 --> 00:07:30.984 align:middle line:84%
and so it was important that I
go and talk with a psychologist.

00:07:30.984 --> 00:07:35.923 align:middle line:84%
That's when I call into Dr. Bob
who was this very tall, very--

00:07:35.923 --> 00:07:39.326 align:middle line:84%
had his coat and his white shirt
and, you know, his neck tie all

00:07:39.326 --> 00:07:42.796 align:middle line:84%
up to his neck and we
began a conversation.

00:07:42.796 --> 00:07:46.366 align:middle line:84%
He assured me that I was not
crazy after a few months.

00:07:46.366 --> 00:07:49.036 align:middle line:84%
But we did begin to
explore what was happening

00:07:49.036 --> 00:07:50.604 align:middle line:90%
and what these thoughts were--

00:07:50.604 --> 00:07:53.106 align:middle line:84%
what these memories
were bringing forward.

00:07:53.106 --> 00:07:57.077 align:middle line:84%
There was one particular
instance that I asked him

00:07:57.077 --> 00:07:58.412 align:middle line:90%
if he would hypnotize me.

00:07:58.412 --> 00:08:00.347 align:middle line:84%
I said because I think
there's things stored in here

00:08:00.347 --> 00:08:02.616 align:middle line:90%
that I can't get access to.

00:08:02.616 --> 00:08:07.921 align:middle line:84%
And we did and had a sense
of a past, what I would refer

00:08:07.921 --> 00:08:10.357 align:middle line:84%
to as a past, life
although I don't believe

00:08:10.357 --> 00:08:11.792 align:middle line:90%
in past, present and future.

00:08:11.792 --> 00:08:14.695 align:middle line:84%
I think it's all just big
one long day right now.

00:08:14.695 --> 00:08:17.798 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened
with that was that we got

00:08:17.798 --> 00:08:22.002 align:middle line:84%
into really observing what
was actually happening to me,

00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:26.073 align:middle line:84%
and why was it happening, and
who were these voices that,

00:08:26.073 --> 00:08:28.375 align:middle line:84%
not voices like you
and I are speaking,

00:08:28.375 --> 00:08:30.310 align:middle line:90%
and yet they were as real as.

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:31.178 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: I understand.

00:08:31.178 --> 00:08:32.746 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: As real as.

00:08:32.746 --> 00:08:33.780 align:middle line:90%
And as that continued to--

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:35.549 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: You hear it in your head?

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:37.117 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: You hear it everywhere,

00:08:37.117 --> 00:08:40.253 align:middle line:84%
and pretty soon I wasn't just
hearing it I was feeling it.

00:08:40.253 --> 00:08:43.357 align:middle line:84%
Every sensation, every
movement, my sensory system was

00:08:43.357 --> 00:08:47.728 align:middle line:84%
so keenly acute that I
was noticing every change

00:08:47.728 --> 00:08:51.698 align:middle line:84%
and I was-- everything
was coming into place.

00:08:51.698 --> 00:08:54.701 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And at that
time, somewhere in that,

00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:58.271 align:middle line:84%
and I don't remember, we were
talking off camera, the sequence

00:08:58.271 --> 00:09:00.474 align:middle line:84%
of when it happened
but a phrase came

00:09:00.474 --> 00:09:02.442 align:middle line:90%
into you, into your awareness.

00:09:02.442 --> 00:09:03.644 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: You're talking
about the one

00:09:03.644 --> 00:09:05.145 align:middle line:84%
about helped my children
to remember--

00:09:05.145 --> 00:09:06.113 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:09:06.113 --> 00:09:06.647 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: -- what they
already know?

00:09:06.647 --> 00:09:07.681 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:09:07.681 --> 00:09:09.349 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: The phrase
that I first heard,

00:09:09.349 --> 00:09:12.185 align:middle line:84%
ultimately I did do
some lyrics around it.

00:09:12.185 --> 00:09:13.587 align:middle line:90%
It's on the website also.

00:09:13.587 --> 00:09:16.657 align:middle line:84%
And it was, "Help my
children to remember

00:09:16.657 --> 00:09:18.692 align:middle line:84%
because they've forgotten
who they are and they're

00:09:18.692 --> 00:09:20.961 align:middle line:90%
in despair," and reminding me

00:09:20.961 --> 00:09:24.064 align:middle line:84%
that others had come before
me to mark the pathway.

00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:27.267 align:middle line:84%
But now it was my time to
continue marking that pathway.

00:09:27.267 --> 00:09:28.302 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Did you know what

00:09:28.302 --> 00:09:29.169 align:middle line:84%
that statement meant
when you heard it?

00:09:29.169 --> 00:09:30.303 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: I had no clue.

00:09:30.303 --> 00:09:31.805 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was going to
work with children, so--

00:09:31.805 --> 00:09:33.140 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughter ]

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.342 align:middle line:84%
Excuse me, but my children
were raised and I didn't think

00:09:35.342 --> 00:09:37.244 align:middle line:84%
that was going to
be in a lot of fun.

00:09:37.244 --> 00:09:41.348 align:middle line:84%
But as it turns out, the
primary focus of that was

00:09:41.348 --> 00:09:44.151 align:middle line:84%
to give the population
an understanding

00:09:44.151 --> 00:09:46.420 align:middle line:84%
to remember what they
already knew because it's

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:49.423 align:middle line:84%
so innately encoded within
everyone of us within our DNA.

00:09:49.423 --> 00:09:52.192 align:middle line:90%
And the only thing that stops us

00:09:52.192 --> 00:09:56.329 align:middle line:84%
from remembering it is
how we access information.

00:09:56.329 --> 00:10:00.233 align:middle line:84%
And so, along many years of
sequencing began to happen,

00:10:00.233 --> 00:10:02.769 align:middle line:90%
I would feel things in my body.

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:05.238 align:middle line:84%
I would-- the first sequence
of the wave was designed

00:10:05.238 --> 00:10:08.041 align:middle line:84%
to bring us into
an understanding.

00:10:08.041 --> 00:10:10.177 align:middle line:90%
How to deprogram--

00:10:10.177 --> 00:10:13.413 align:middle line:84%
how we assimilate and
decode information,

00:10:13.413 --> 00:10:16.316 align:middle line:84%
whether it's audible
visual, sensory?

00:10:16.316 --> 00:10:18.351 align:middle line:84%
How does it work
through the physiology

00:10:18.351 --> 00:10:20.287 align:middle line:90%
and where is it getting stuck

00:10:20.287 --> 00:10:23.523 align:middle line:84%
so that we're not really
interpreting from that brain

00:10:23.523 --> 00:10:26.293 align:middle line:84%
of divine intelligence
within the heart

00:10:26.293 --> 00:10:29.563 align:middle line:84%
but we're giving information
out of the database

00:10:29.563 --> 00:10:31.398 align:middle line:84%
which is someone
else's information?

00:10:31.398 --> 00:10:33.033 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: That's what I was
just going to ask you.

00:10:33.033 --> 00:10:34.000 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Yeah.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.368 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Someone else's
information.

00:10:35.368 --> 00:10:38.205 align:middle line:84%
What did you come to understand
about where the programming

00:10:38.205 --> 00:10:40.674 align:middle line:90%
or entrainment is coming from?

00:10:40.674 --> 00:10:43.210 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: Well, the entrainment
is coming from many sources.

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:48.515 align:middle line:84%
Every sound, every non-sound
that we hear has a frequency

00:10:48.515 --> 00:10:52.052 align:middle line:84%
and as frequencies affect the
physiology in different ways.

00:10:52.052 --> 00:10:54.688 align:middle line:84%
So what's happening is
we're bombarded with sounds.

00:10:54.688 --> 00:10:56.123 align:middle line:90%
We're in the studio.

00:10:56.123 --> 00:10:57.924 align:middle line:84%
We're experiencing
the same thing.

00:10:57.924 --> 00:10:59.926 align:middle line:84%
Their frequency is just
blowing from the lights,

00:10:59.926 --> 00:11:01.928 align:middle line:84%
from the sound equipment,
from the camera--

00:11:01.928 --> 00:11:03.196 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And by the
way, if anybody knows,

00:11:03.196 --> 00:11:04.431 align:middle line:90%
there's a slight hummer buzz--

00:11:04.431 --> 00:11:05.699 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: There's a hum.

00:11:05.699 --> 00:11:07.200 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: There is something
going on in the room today

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.736 align:middle line:84%
that they can't fix by
swapping out the microphones,

00:11:09.736 --> 00:11:11.204 align:middle line:90%
so just be patient with us.

00:11:11.204 --> 00:11:12.773 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: But it will be fixed.

00:11:12.773 --> 00:11:16.576 align:middle line:84%
So what was happening was that
we were beginning to understand

00:11:16.576 --> 00:11:21.014 align:middle line:84%
and I use the phrase we a lot,
but understand I was in my body.

00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:23.383 align:middle line:84%
I mean I was alone,
sitting on my deck.

00:11:23.383 --> 00:11:24.885 align:middle line:90%
But I began to understand

00:11:24.885 --> 00:11:27.821 align:middle line:84%
that there was a very
collaborative interface

00:11:27.821 --> 00:11:30.824 align:middle line:90%
between me and something.

00:11:30.824 --> 00:11:35.896 align:middle line:84%
Initially, I knew and understood
it as I was talking to God

00:11:35.896 --> 00:11:37.964 align:middle line:90%
which is part of the sequencing

00:11:37.964 --> 00:11:40.467 align:middle line:84%
of how the consciousness
actually evolves

00:11:40.467 --> 00:11:42.769 align:middle line:84%
that we first sense--
because that's what we know.

00:11:42.769 --> 00:11:44.671 align:middle line:90%
I was raised in the South--

00:11:44.671 --> 00:11:45.238 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:11:45.238 --> 00:11:46.373 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: So I'm--

00:11:46.373 --> 00:11:47.207 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So that would be
your point of reference?

00:11:47.207 --> 00:11:47.607 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: -- Lutheran-Presbyterian.

00:11:47.607 --> 00:11:48.141 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:11:48.141 --> 00:11:49.476 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:11:49.476 --> 00:11:50.710 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: -- you know, that was
my first line of reference.

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:53.346 align:middle line:84%
I ultimately began to
understand that it was much,

00:11:53.346 --> 00:11:57.584 align:middle line:84%
much larger than what my
limited perception actually was

00:11:57.584 --> 00:12:01.221 align:middle line:84%
that there was actually a plan
and an understanding of how

00:12:01.221 --> 00:12:03.690 align:middle line:84%
to bring the human
consciousness back

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:05.559 align:middle line:84%
to its original blueprint
design.

00:12:05.559 --> 00:12:09.629 align:middle line:84%
I would always ask, when I
would have my communication,

00:12:09.629 --> 00:12:13.233 align:middle line:84%
"Why did you put me down here
to experience all this pain

00:12:13.233 --> 00:12:16.469 align:middle line:90%
and all of this disease?

00:12:16.469 --> 00:12:20.240 align:middle line:84%
Why don't I have a mechanism to
self-adjust so that I can move

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.109 align:middle line:84%
through with grace and
ease, and choose if I want

00:12:23.109 --> 00:12:26.613 align:middle line:84%
to have an experience that might
be awkward or uncomfortable?

00:12:26.613 --> 00:12:28.682 align:middle line:90%
But not be in trying to force

00:12:28.682 --> 00:12:30.984 align:middle line:84%
to have it whether I
want it to or not."

00:12:30.984 --> 00:12:33.019 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we are
in our entrainment now.

00:12:33.019 --> 00:12:34.821 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Absolutely, and
I think there are--

00:12:34.821 --> 00:12:37.657 align:middle line:84%
almost everybody watching this
would ask the same question--

00:12:37.657 --> 00:12:38.892 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Yes.

00:12:38.892 --> 00:12:41.728 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: -- which is we do
which is why this, why now?

00:12:41.728 --> 00:12:42.395 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Why now?

00:12:42.395 --> 00:12:43.396 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:12:43.396 --> 00:12:44.531 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: And I've learned
over the years

00:12:44.531 --> 00:12:46.233 align:middle line:84%
that there are no
answers to why questions.

00:12:46.233 --> 00:12:47.534 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:12:47.534 --> 00:12:48.668 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: I can-- and we can
get to the what and the how.

00:12:48.668 --> 00:12:51.104 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So what was the
answer you were given?

00:12:51.104 --> 00:12:53.707 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: The answer I was
given was the capability

00:12:53.707 --> 00:12:56.443 align:middle line:84%
for self adjustment is intact
and it always has been.

00:12:56.443 --> 00:12:57.677 align:middle line:90%
It's never left us.

00:12:57.677 --> 00:12:59.546 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: But there's
something that is interfering.

00:12:59.546 --> 00:13:00.747 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Something is interfering.

00:13:00.747 --> 00:13:03.717 align:middle line:84%
So my question began to
know what's interfering

00:13:03.717 --> 00:13:05.352 align:middle line:90%
and how does it do it?

00:13:05.352 --> 00:13:11.224 align:middle line:84%
How do we become so disconnected
to that divine intelligence

00:13:11.224 --> 00:13:12.659 align:middle line:90%
that we wind up in the state

00:13:12.659 --> 00:13:14.327 align:middle line:84%
that the human population
is now?

00:13:14.327 --> 00:13:16.229 align:middle line:90%
We're stressed, we're fearful.

00:13:16.229 --> 00:13:17.297 align:middle line:90%
We're so afraid to trust.

00:13:17.297 --> 00:13:21.368 align:middle line:90%
We're so afraid to trust.

00:13:21.368 --> 00:13:23.536 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: We are, and
afraid to be made a fool

00:13:23.536 --> 00:13:25.005 align:middle line:90%
of in front of each other.

00:13:25.005 --> 00:13:26.072 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Yes.

00:13:26.072 --> 00:13:27.407 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Which is, again,
just another fear.

00:13:27.407 --> 00:13:29.709 align:middle line:84%
And when I read that little
opening statement, it says,

00:13:29.709 --> 00:13:33.847 align:middle line:84%
"Do rogue groups on and off
planet wield strange new weapons

00:13:33.847 --> 00:13:35.048 align:middle line:90%
as it were?"

00:13:35.048 --> 00:13:36.549 align:middle line:90%
Now, what was revealed to--

00:13:36.549 --> 00:13:37.484 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: And yes and yes.

00:13:37.484 --> 00:13:38.752 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: What was revealed to you

00:13:38.752 --> 00:13:41.855 align:middle line:84%
so we can understand
first the interference

00:13:41.855 --> 00:13:44.057 align:middle line:84%
and then the divine
nature of what we are

00:13:44.057 --> 00:13:45.225 align:middle line:90%
without the interference--

00:13:45.225 --> 00:13:46.226 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Absolutely.

00:13:46.226 --> 00:13:47.260 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: -- and then
we'll continue on.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.763 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: Well, first
of all, there are--

00:13:49.763 --> 00:13:52.699 align:middle line:84%
we live in a polarity
and we always will.

00:13:52.699 --> 00:13:56.169 align:middle line:84%
I don't use the word polarity,
I prefer the word extremes.

00:13:56.169 --> 00:13:59.306 align:middle line:84%
The extremes are this
works and this doesn't.

00:13:59.306 --> 00:14:03.643 align:middle line:84%
But without that, we would never
know when we come to the center.

00:14:03.643 --> 00:14:09.449 align:middle line:84%
So, there are facets within
this rogue on the planet as well

00:14:09.449 --> 00:14:14.721 align:middle line:84%
as off planet who have
intelligence within them

00:14:14.721 --> 00:14:17.390 align:middle line:84%
that want us to come
to the center.

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:19.726 align:middle line:84%
So they're really stepping
forward now to assist

00:14:19.726 --> 00:14:22.996 align:middle line:84%
and had been doing that for
a quite a few years now.

00:14:22.996 --> 00:14:25.765 align:middle line:84%
A lot of my network that
Charlie introduced me

00:14:25.765 --> 00:14:30.236 align:middle line:84%
to when I met Slim
introduced me to our people

00:14:30.236 --> 00:14:33.573 align:middle line:84%
who were involved
in those very deep.

00:14:33.573 --> 00:14:36.209 align:middle line:90%
They don't exist on paper groups

00:14:36.209 --> 00:14:38.845 align:middle line:84%
who have been incredibly
supportive to share with me

00:14:38.845 --> 00:14:42.115 align:middle line:84%
and to help me understand
what does it mean

00:14:42.115 --> 00:14:44.651 align:middle line:90%
for a frequency to interrupt.

00:14:44.651 --> 00:14:46.786 align:middle line:90%
How does that happen?

00:14:46.786 --> 00:14:49.189 align:middle line:84%
And if I were going to
control the population,

00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:50.056 align:middle line:90%
how would I do it?

00:14:50.056 --> 00:14:51.523 align:middle line:90%
That was one of my questions.

00:14:51.523 --> 00:14:53.159 align:middle line:90%
How would I do it?

00:14:53.159 --> 00:14:56.563 align:middle line:84%
If I wanted to bring the
population into total control--

00:14:56.563 --> 00:14:57.964 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Disharmony
and controlling.

00:14:57.964 --> 00:14:59.332 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: -- how would I do it?

00:14:59.332 --> 00:15:02.102 align:middle line:84%
And so there have been several
applications over the years.

00:15:02.102 --> 00:15:04.504 align:middle line:84%
You now, fear-based, look
at the media that we see.

00:15:04.504 --> 00:15:05.438 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:15:05.438 --> 00:15:06.439 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: Most of the
media is based

00:15:06.439 --> 00:15:09.542 align:middle line:84%
on fear telling us
what we can't do.

00:15:09.542 --> 00:15:11.311 align:middle line:90%
Our children come into school.

00:15:11.311 --> 00:15:14.314 align:middle line:84%
They come into the
world actually

00:15:14.314 --> 00:15:16.182 align:middle line:90%
with someone else's information.

00:15:16.182 --> 00:15:19.853 align:middle line:84%
Where was the brain when
the heart was first created

00:15:19.853 --> 00:15:21.121 align:middle line:90%
in the fetus?

00:15:21.121 --> 00:15:25.058 align:middle line:84%
That was my first question
to the physiology experts.

00:15:25.058 --> 00:15:29.062 align:middle line:84%
And they're going, "Hmm,
well it didn't exist."

00:15:29.062 --> 00:15:31.765 align:middle line:84%
So what makes the
heart start beating?

00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:34.934 align:middle line:84%
Well it's the brain
within the heart itself.

00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:38.238 align:middle line:90%
So we've never left that space.

00:15:38.238 --> 00:15:41.574 align:middle line:84%
No matter what anyone does, we
have the capability to return

00:15:41.574 --> 00:15:43.610 align:middle line:90%
to that at any moment.

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:46.312 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: But we have to stop
the interfering frequencies

00:15:46.312 --> 00:15:47.180 align:middle line:90%
that are creating--

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:47.947 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Right.

00:15:47.947 --> 00:15:49.249 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: -- the programming.

00:15:49.249 --> 00:15:51.584 align:middle line:84%
And you mentioned a moment
ago that there are extremes.

00:15:51.584 --> 00:15:55.588 align:middle line:84%
And on one extreme, you have
many beings on and off planet,

00:15:55.588 --> 00:15:59.726 align:middle line:84%
people and beyond human that
are trying to help us go

00:15:59.726 --> 00:16:02.662 align:middle line:84%
through this process of that
reconnection with ourselves

00:16:02.662 --> 00:16:04.731 align:middle line:90%
to simply stop the interference.

00:16:04.731 --> 00:16:06.132 align:middle line:90%
What's on the other side?

00:16:06.132 --> 00:16:09.369 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: The interference is on--
from the off planet is coming

00:16:09.369 --> 00:16:12.338 align:middle line:84%
from the sun actually
most of the time.

00:16:12.338 --> 00:16:14.574 align:middle line:84%
We're getting a lot of
solar influx right now

00:16:14.574 --> 00:16:18.011 align:middle line:84%
that we're saying that
put your sunglasses on.

00:16:18.011 --> 00:16:19.412 align:middle line:90%
You know, cover up your head.

00:16:19.412 --> 00:16:21.714 align:middle line:84%
Don't absorb the sun, certainly
not in the middle of the day,

00:16:21.714 --> 00:16:24.751 align:middle line:84%
please, and not at 90
degrees in Boulder,

00:16:24.751 --> 00:16:27.520 align:middle line:90%
Colorado, but morning sun.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:31.024 align:middle line:84%
I was instructed early on, go
out in the morning sun and go

00:16:31.024 --> 00:16:32.358 align:middle line:90%
out in the evening sun.

00:16:32.358 --> 00:16:33.159 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:16:33.159 --> 00:16:34.360 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: And be present in it.

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.562 align:middle line:90%
Be present in it.

00:16:35.562 --> 00:16:37.997 align:middle line:84%
Because not only does the
sensory system receptors

00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:41.768 align:middle line:84%
on the skin absorb those
frequencies from the sun,

00:16:41.768 --> 00:16:43.336 align:middle line:84%
but what's happening
is it's cracking

00:16:43.336 --> 00:16:45.305 align:middle line:90%
that pineal crustification.

00:16:45.305 --> 00:16:48.141 align:middle line:84%
We have a calcified pineal
gland which is liquid.

00:16:48.141 --> 00:16:51.644 align:middle line:84%
It's our direct connection with
God or with what people perceive

00:16:51.644 --> 00:16:53.680 align:middle line:90%
as our higher intelligence.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.982 align:middle line:84%
I prefer to call
it our intelligence

00:16:55.982 --> 00:16:58.718 align:middle line:84%
because that's what works
with the heart and the brain.

00:16:58.718 --> 00:16:59.919 align:middle line:90%
How do we do that?

00:16:59.919 --> 00:17:02.589 align:middle line:84%
So they're sending that
and it's a very regular--

00:17:02.589 --> 00:17:04.791 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So this is a
positive interference--

00:17:04.791 --> 00:17:05.925 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: It's a very
positive thing.

00:17:05.925 --> 00:17:08.094 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: -- that's breaking
up the programming

00:17:08.094 --> 00:17:09.696 align:middle line:90%
that is also in interference.

00:17:09.696 --> 00:17:10.763 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: [Inaudible] assisting
in the deprogramming--

00:17:10.763 --> 00:17:11.865 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:17:11.865 --> 00:17:13.600 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: -- the actual
physiology of our form.

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:17.036 align:middle line:84%
Our form first of all is the
culprit here because we have

00:17:17.036 --> 00:17:21.040 align:middle line:84%
to come into resonance of how
we route information and decide

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:25.211 align:middle line:84%
and decode, determine what
our perception is going to be.

00:17:25.211 --> 00:17:29.249 align:middle line:84%
So from the off planet, not
only did they begin to work

00:17:29.249 --> 00:17:32.519 align:middle line:84%
with the sequencing, they would
give me a series of numbers.

00:17:32.519 --> 00:17:35.221 align:middle line:84%
At first, I didn't
know what they were.

00:17:35.221 --> 00:17:38.825 align:middle line:84%
And it was through meeting
people like Charlie and Ben

00:17:38.825 --> 00:17:41.728 align:middle line:84%
that I began to understand
what this was about

00:17:41.728 --> 00:17:43.296 align:middle line:84%
and what these numbers
were reflecting

00:17:43.296 --> 00:17:45.331 align:middle line:84%
because they were
doing several things.

00:17:45.331 --> 00:17:49.035 align:middle line:84%
The first one was bringing us
into resonance with the planet.

00:17:49.035 --> 00:17:53.006 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we might see her
as something we live on.

00:17:53.006 --> 00:17:54.908 align:middle line:84%
She has consciousness
just like us.

00:17:54.908 --> 00:17:57.010 align:middle line:90%
She has a skin just like us.

00:17:57.010 --> 00:17:59.712 align:middle line:84%
Her sensory receptors
actually work like ours.

00:17:59.712 --> 00:18:01.281 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: She has an
emotional body just like us.

00:18:01.281 --> 00:18:03.349 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: She has an
emotional body just like us.

00:18:03.349 --> 00:18:06.753 align:middle line:84%
The difference between her
emotional body and ours is

00:18:06.753 --> 00:18:09.722 align:middle line:84%
that hers does not
control her behavior.

00:18:09.722 --> 00:18:11.824 align:middle line:90%
Ours control our behavior

00:18:11.824 --> 00:18:14.127 align:middle line:84%
as our definitions are
defined through our--

00:18:14.127 --> 00:18:17.330 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And this is exploited
every moment of everyday.

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:18.598 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Constantly.

00:18:18.598 --> 00:18:21.301 align:middle line:84%
Let me get you really excited
because as you go high,

00:18:21.301 --> 00:18:24.737 align:middle line:84%
we know you're going to
go low because you aren't

00:18:24.737 --> 00:18:26.639 align:middle line:84%
in the middle, you're
in an extreme.

00:18:26.639 --> 00:18:30.543 align:middle line:84%
So we're constantly living in
these extremes instead of in

00:18:30.543 --> 00:18:34.514 align:middle line:84%
that steadiness of our
personal 18 inches of existence

00:18:34.514 --> 00:18:35.949 align:middle line:90%
when we manage to do that.

00:18:35.949 --> 00:18:39.652 align:middle line:84%
So the wave was created to
begin to set that emotion.

00:18:39.652 --> 00:18:42.655 align:middle line:84%
We thought, at first, well,
if we just become in resonance

00:18:42.655 --> 00:18:45.525 align:middle line:84%
with the planet then
it'll pick right in.

00:18:45.525 --> 00:18:46.492 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:18:46.492 --> 00:18:47.627 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And that would
you speaking

00:18:47.627 --> 00:18:48.995 align:middle line:84%
of this Schumann
wave for example?

00:18:48.995 --> 00:18:50.296 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: It arrives on Schumann.

00:18:50.296 --> 00:18:52.031 align:middle line:90%
Schumann is the basis for that.

00:18:52.031 --> 00:18:55.001 align:middle line:84%
So then we moved in,
in a collaboration

00:18:55.001 --> 00:18:56.369 align:middle line:90%
with the next sequence.

00:18:56.369 --> 00:19:00.073 align:middle line:84%
The second sequence has to do
with how do we move outside

00:19:00.073 --> 00:19:02.876 align:middle line:84%
of the time space continuum
within our awareness.

00:19:02.876 --> 00:19:05.812 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we're not
talking of consciousness.

00:19:05.812 --> 00:19:09.482 align:middle line:84%
We're talking of awareness
which goes beyond consciousness.

00:19:09.482 --> 00:19:13.219 align:middle line:84%
So we're moving in and out
of the space time continuum.

00:19:13.219 --> 00:19:14.587 align:middle line:90%
Well that worked.

00:19:14.587 --> 00:19:18.558 align:middle line:84%
So we got those to in place and
it was like are we ready now

00:19:18.558 --> 00:19:20.526 align:middle line:84%
to bring the creative
process in?

00:19:20.526 --> 00:19:23.696 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And when you say, "We got
those to in place," explain what

00:19:23.696 --> 00:19:26.332 align:middle line:84%
that means, what are
these sequencing--

00:19:26.332 --> 00:19:28.701 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: My body became
the parameter

00:19:28.701 --> 00:19:33.573 align:middle line:84%
to determine how this worked in
real life and real application.

00:19:33.573 --> 00:19:36.876 align:middle line:84%
So, if I were affected,
something would happen,

00:19:36.876 --> 00:19:40.713 align:middle line:84%
my systems monitor those
technicians that I work

00:19:40.713 --> 00:19:43.483 align:middle line:84%
with off planet as well as
the ones that were on planet

00:19:43.483 --> 00:19:45.151 align:middle line:90%
that were actually monitoring.

00:19:45.151 --> 00:19:48.254 align:middle line:84%
They could follow me anywhere I
was lost and tell me precisely

00:19:48.254 --> 00:19:51.958 align:middle line:84%
where I would go because we
each have a very specific

00:19:51.958 --> 00:19:53.960 align:middle line:90%
vibrational signature.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.863 align:middle line:84%
And once they know where
you are at any given moment,

00:19:56.863 --> 00:20:00.500 align:middle line:84%
then what they did was to
recognize that signature

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.468 align:middle line:84%
and be able to follow
me anywhere.

00:20:02.468 --> 00:20:04.203 align:middle line:84%
Once we began to
work with the wave,

00:20:04.203 --> 00:20:06.105 align:middle line:90%
which actually compliments one

00:20:06.105 --> 00:20:08.574 align:middle line:84%
that actually moves
from the heart.

00:20:08.574 --> 00:20:11.778 align:middle line:84%
Dan Winter is one who has
actually monitored some of that

00:20:11.778 --> 00:20:14.414 align:middle line:84%
and has actually shown
with some equipment

00:20:14.414 --> 00:20:16.382 align:middle line:90%
that that actually happens.

00:20:16.382 --> 00:20:19.419 align:middle line:84%
So once that started taking
place then I was really easy

00:20:19.419 --> 00:20:20.753 align:middle line:90%
to follow.

00:20:20.753 --> 00:20:23.623 align:middle line:84%
What became interesting then
was that this didn't happen

00:20:23.623 --> 00:20:26.626 align:middle line:84%
until about 2003, and
yet Charlie was picking

00:20:26.626 --> 00:20:29.362 align:middle line:90%
up the sequencing in 2000.

00:20:29.362 --> 00:20:30.029 align:middle line:90%
Others--

00:20:30.029 --> 00:20:30.997 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Interesting.

00:20:30.997 --> 00:20:32.398 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: -- began picking
it up later.

00:20:32.398 --> 00:20:34.600 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: But now this was moving
beyond the time space continuum?

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:35.568 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Yes.

00:20:35.568 --> 00:20:36.936 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And so it
was being worked on,

00:20:36.936 --> 00:20:40.773 align:middle line:84%
on the other side prior to your
involvement in it obviously,

00:20:40.773 --> 00:20:43.409 align:middle line:84%
or in conditioning
you toward this end.

00:20:43.409 --> 00:20:45.912 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: We began a collaboration

00:20:45.912 --> 00:20:49.248 align:middle line:84%
that on some levels I
have been told I do not--

00:20:49.248 --> 00:20:50.616 align:middle line:90%
I can't confirm this.

00:20:50.616 --> 00:20:53.219 align:middle line:84%
But on some levels, I've been
told that this is a process

00:20:53.219 --> 00:20:54.987 align:middle line:84%
that I agreed to
come in when I signed

00:20:54.987 --> 00:20:56.255 align:middle line:84%
up on the cosmic dry
rays [phonetic]--

00:20:56.255 --> 00:20:56.956 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Sure.

00:20:56.956 --> 00:20:58.157 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: -- to do this.

00:20:58.157 --> 00:21:01.427 align:middle line:84%
That we were part of a
project that was designed

00:21:01.427 --> 00:21:04.864 align:middle line:84%
to bring the human physiology
back into its divinity.

00:21:04.864 --> 00:21:07.433 align:middle line:84%
We talk about our divine
spirit, our essence.

00:21:07.433 --> 00:21:09.802 align:middle line:84%
But we relegate the form is
just something that get's us

00:21:09.802 --> 00:21:13.306 align:middle line:84%
from point A to point B and
that was not the design.

00:21:13.306 --> 00:21:16.709 align:middle line:84%
The design was to give us a
full holy human experience

00:21:16.709 --> 00:21:19.545 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, and
we've never had that.

00:21:19.545 --> 00:21:23.449 align:middle line:84%
We have never had that in
existence as a population

00:21:23.449 --> 00:21:26.319 align:middle line:84%
and we have the opportunity
right now to do it.

00:21:26.319 --> 00:21:28.788 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So wave number one
was to put us in resonance

00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:30.957 align:middle line:90%
with Gaia, Earth itself.

00:21:30.957 --> 00:21:34.127 align:middle line:84%
And that was the Schumann wave
level one of the Triad Wave.

00:21:34.127 --> 00:21:34.694 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Level one.

00:21:34.694 --> 00:21:35.495 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right?

00:21:35.495 --> 00:21:36.596 align:middle line:90%
And now, number two,

00:21:36.596 --> 00:21:38.765 align:middle line:84%
you're going beyond the
time space continuum

00:21:38.765 --> 00:21:40.299 align:middle line:84%
and what is the net
effect of that?

00:21:40.299 --> 00:21:41.367 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:21:41.367 --> 00:21:42.668 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: The net effect
of that was that--

00:21:42.668 --> 00:21:43.870 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: -- they were starting
to pick it up as you say.

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:45.838 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: The net effect of
that personally for me was

00:21:45.838 --> 00:21:47.740 align:middle line:84%
that it allowed me
to have interface

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:50.476 align:middle line:84%
with the off planet
sequences and intelligences

00:21:50.476 --> 00:21:53.846 align:middle line:84%
that I was working with,
with less dysfunction

00:21:53.846 --> 00:21:55.481 align:middle line:90%
within my physical form.

00:21:55.481 --> 00:21:57.717 align:middle line:84%
At first, I had to have
a lot of step-downs

00:21:57.717 --> 00:22:00.787 align:middle line:84%
because vibrationally, remember
I came from not knowing anything

00:22:00.787 --> 00:22:04.023 align:middle line:84%
to working in this field,
so there was a big gap

00:22:04.023 --> 00:22:06.592 align:middle line:84%
in our vibrational
understanding of that.

00:22:06.592 --> 00:22:10.530 align:middle line:84%
So as time progressed over the
years, we began to understand

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:12.765 align:middle line:84%
which technicians would
be appropriate to work

00:22:12.765 --> 00:22:14.767 align:middle line:90%
with each, each sequence.

00:22:14.767 --> 00:22:17.904 align:middle line:84%
I began with the Assyrians,
didn't know who they were.

00:22:17.904 --> 00:22:18.805 align:middle line:90%
Remember I--

00:22:18.805 --> 00:22:20.206 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Assyrians, yes.

00:22:20.206 --> 00:22:20.973 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Who were they?

00:22:20.973 --> 00:22:22.341 align:middle line:90%
Andromedans, I don't know.

00:22:22.341 --> 00:22:25.578 align:middle line:84%
I had to go look it up on a
star map to see where is that.

00:22:25.578 --> 00:22:27.613 align:middle line:90%
Octoroons, I had no clue.

00:22:27.613 --> 00:22:30.316 align:middle line:84%
And so all of this
was very foreign to me

00:22:30.316 --> 00:22:33.052 align:middle line:84%
because I had absolutely
no background in it,

00:22:33.052 --> 00:22:36.489 align:middle line:84%
nor the mathematics, or anything
else that I was hearing.

00:22:36.489 --> 00:22:39.225 align:middle line:84%
However, I knew that
I had to complete it.

00:22:39.225 --> 00:22:41.027 align:middle line:90%
I had to continue with it.

00:22:41.027 --> 00:22:44.897 align:middle line:84%
So once we began moving more
easily in and out, then I began

00:22:44.897 --> 00:22:49.302 align:middle line:84%
to work more collaboratively
with the technicians off planet

00:22:49.302 --> 00:22:51.404 align:middle line:90%
which gave the next sequencing.

00:22:51.404 --> 00:22:57.543 align:middle line:84%
If we got this far, we could
actually create the absolute

00:22:57.543 --> 00:22:58.845 align:middle line:90%
within the human form.

00:22:58.845 --> 00:23:00.179 align:middle line:90%
We could bring it fully.

00:23:00.179 --> 00:23:01.714 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Now, you said
they had not been able

00:23:01.714 --> 00:23:03.149 align:middle line:90%
to accomplish this.

00:23:03.149 --> 00:23:05.885 align:middle line:84%
In times passed, though,
there were precursors to you

00:23:05.885 --> 00:23:08.354 align:middle line:84%
who were working on
portions of it in their day.

00:23:08.354 --> 00:23:09.121 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Yes, we always--

00:23:09.121 --> 00:23:10.056 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Throughout history?

00:23:10.056 --> 00:23:11.390 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: We always
got a little cocky

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:13.426 align:middle line:84%
and a little arrogant thinking
that we could do the work

00:23:13.426 --> 00:23:15.361 align:middle line:90%
without collaboration.

00:23:15.361 --> 00:23:17.563 align:middle line:84%
And this is not a
one-woman show.

00:23:17.563 --> 00:23:19.298 align:middle line:90%
It's not a one-man show.

00:23:19.298 --> 00:23:23.569 align:middle line:84%
This is a fully collaborative
effort that requires a team.

00:23:23.569 --> 00:23:28.441 align:middle line:84%
So when I began working with
it consciously, after the fact,

00:23:28.441 --> 00:23:32.445 align:middle line:84%
this was when I was closing it
out actually in completing this,

00:23:32.445 --> 00:23:37.216 align:middle line:84%
the Earth Project 777
concept actually came on board

00:23:37.216 --> 00:23:40.353 align:middle line:84%
and I began to understand
that there were many more

00:23:40.353 --> 00:23:43.656 align:middle line:84%
who were part of this
project that I had not met.

00:23:43.656 --> 00:23:44.891 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: And some of them were--

00:23:44.891 --> 00:23:46.993 align:middle line:84%
these were earth beings
that were involved in very--

00:23:46.993 --> 00:23:48.060 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: No, these are
fully earth beings.

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:49.028 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: -- earth beings
involved--

00:23:49.028 --> 00:23:49.962 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: These are
fully earth beings.

00:23:49.962 --> 00:23:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: -- in the
realms of science

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:52.765 align:middle line:90%
in very esoteric sciences.

00:23:52.765 --> 00:23:54.333 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: Yes, who were
willing to think

00:23:54.333 --> 00:23:56.802 align:middle line:90%
and move outside of the box.

00:23:56.802 --> 00:24:00.973 align:middle line:84%
And they would come in and
I would meet technicians.

00:24:00.973 --> 00:24:08.247 align:middle line:84%
Well until the last, probably
I would say, end of 2011,

00:24:08.247 --> 00:24:10.016 align:middle line:90%
we actually came fully online.

00:24:10.016 --> 00:24:15.087 align:middle line:84%
2012 was the year that the Earth
Project was to be opened up.

00:24:15.087 --> 00:24:18.024 align:middle line:84%
Until that point in
time, the technicians

00:24:18.024 --> 00:24:21.827 align:middle line:84%
on planet would know
their part of what I did.

00:24:21.827 --> 00:24:26.098 align:middle line:84%
Anyone would know that I was
coming and going all the time.

00:24:26.098 --> 00:24:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And they knew I did
strange things.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.971 align:middle line:84%
But they did not know what I
did because I was not permitted

00:24:31.971 --> 00:24:34.507 align:middle line:84%
to talk about it and
then how could I.

00:24:34.507 --> 00:24:36.809 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well you didn't even
have a framework yourself.

00:24:36.809 --> 00:24:40.213 align:middle line:84%
And what was interesting when
we're talking off camera is

00:24:40.213 --> 00:24:44.517 align:middle line:84%
that you were saying as these
technicians were brought to you

00:24:44.517 --> 00:24:47.053 align:middle line:84%
to work on the development
and the earthly plane

00:24:47.053 --> 00:24:48.788 align:middle line:90%
of these technologies,

00:24:48.788 --> 00:24:51.724 align:middle line:84%
you didn't know what they
were even talking about a lot

00:24:51.724 --> 00:24:53.759 align:middle line:84%
of times and they're
saying, "Oh my God,

00:24:53.759 --> 00:24:55.795 align:middle line:84%
this is the piece we've
been looking for."

00:24:55.795 --> 00:24:58.864 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: When I first
met each one--

00:24:58.864 --> 00:25:01.701 align:middle line:84%
well let me go back to
the-- to when this started.

00:25:01.701 --> 00:25:05.905 align:middle line:84%
I had been introduced
to the woman,

00:25:05.905 --> 00:25:09.275 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Joanne Whittaker [assumed
spelling], who actually began

00:25:09.275 --> 00:25:14.547 align:middle line:84%
to work with me about what
these-- what I was experiencing.

00:25:14.547 --> 00:25:17.249 align:middle line:84%
I didn't-- she didn't know
about the numbers at that time.

00:25:17.249 --> 00:25:21.187 align:middle line:84%
But what she did know was how
my physiology was working.

00:25:21.187 --> 00:25:24.624 align:middle line:84%
And so she acquainted me with
John Lilly's work which is

00:25:24.624 --> 00:25:27.560 align:middle line:84%
about the dolphins and
how dolphins communicate,

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:28.761 align:middle line:90%
so that started it.

00:25:28.761 --> 00:25:31.697 align:middle line:84%
So we decided then, I told
her about the numbers.

00:25:31.697 --> 00:25:33.933 align:middle line:84%
So she introduced me
to a friend of hers

00:25:33.933 --> 00:25:35.901 align:middle line:90%
who had a recording studio.

00:25:35.901 --> 00:25:37.703 align:middle line:84%
So I went into the
recording studio,

00:25:37.703 --> 00:25:40.406 align:middle line:84%
met Glenn Paley [assumed
spelling] who does the work

00:25:40.406 --> 00:25:42.308 align:middle line:90%
and still does the work for me.

00:25:42.308 --> 00:25:45.645 align:middle line:84%
And I handed him the series
of numbers and I said,

00:25:45.645 --> 00:25:47.013 align:middle line:84%
"Could you make me
a CD of this?"

00:25:47.013 --> 00:25:50.049 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at me and he
said, "Well what is it?"

00:25:50.049 --> 00:25:51.784 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "Numbers."

00:25:51.784 --> 00:25:52.818 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughter ]

00:25:52.818 --> 00:25:53.619 align:middle line:90%
"Numbers."

00:25:53.619 --> 00:25:54.420 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: That's clear enough.

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:55.488 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Clear enough.

00:25:55.488 --> 00:25:56.555 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "Well
what kind of numbers?"

00:25:56.555 --> 00:25:58.324 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "Numbers."

00:25:58.324 --> 00:25:59.892 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "Well
are they hertz?"

00:25:59.892 --> 00:26:01.961 align:middle line:90%
I said, "OK, that sounds good."

00:26:01.961 --> 00:26:04.330 align:middle line:84%
And so what he did
was take my numbers

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:06.632 align:middle line:84%
with the timing intervals
that were very specific

00:26:06.632 --> 00:26:11.070 align:middle line:84%
and he created the actual
first sequence of the wave.

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:12.071 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Now this was all three.

00:26:12.071 --> 00:26:13.039 align:middle line:90%
This was the Triad Wave.

00:26:13.039 --> 00:26:13.939 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: This was just
the first one.

00:26:13.939 --> 00:26:14.840 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Oh, just the first one.

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:16.075 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:16.075 --> 00:26:16.942 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: We call the first
one "Through the Illusion."

00:26:16.942 --> 00:26:17.910 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: OK.

00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:19.879 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: So he created
the first one.

00:26:19.879 --> 00:26:21.247 align:middle line:90%
Well we're in a sound studio

00:26:21.247 --> 00:26:24.050 align:middle line:84%
and there are people
in the waiting room.

00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And the guy who owned the
studio, when we were finished,

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:30.823 align:middle line:84%
we went out and everybody in
the studio was sound asleep.

00:26:30.823 --> 00:26:32.024 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughter ]

00:26:32.024 --> 00:26:35.194 align:middle line:84%
It was like-- and I'm
saying, "What's going on?"

00:26:35.194 --> 00:26:37.396 align:middle line:90%
And he said, "This is so wild."

00:26:37.396 --> 00:26:39.865 align:middle line:84%
He said, "What were you
all doing in there?"

00:26:39.865 --> 00:26:42.835 align:middle line:84%
And Glenn said, "Well we were
putting down these numbers."

00:26:42.835 --> 00:26:46.072 align:middle line:84%
Well that was the first
introduction that I had

00:26:46.072 --> 00:26:48.307 align:middle line:84%
of how the physiology
is affected

00:26:48.307 --> 00:26:51.544 align:middle line:84%
because it relaxes
the body immediately.

00:26:51.544 --> 00:26:52.778 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:26:52.778 --> 00:26:54.280 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: And the more stressed
you are, the quieter--

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:57.416 align:middle line:84%
because the body is saying,
"Thank you, finally."

00:26:57.416 --> 00:26:59.852 align:middle line:84%
So after that, I
was not surprised

00:26:59.852 --> 00:27:02.955 align:middle line:84%
when people would make strange
comments if you're talking

00:27:02.955 --> 00:27:07.226 align:middle line:84%
about when I met Ben Lonetree
who did the first analysis

00:27:07.226 --> 00:27:09.895 align:middle line:84%
and he's the one that actually
that introduced me to Charlie.

00:27:09.895 --> 00:27:13.265 align:middle line:84%
He's first thing was--
I saw a book that he had

00:27:13.265 --> 00:27:16.135 align:middle line:84%
in Sedona actually,
it fell off the shelf.

00:27:16.135 --> 00:27:19.105 align:middle line:84%
I picked it up, a
little paperback book,

00:27:19.105 --> 00:27:22.041 align:middle line:84%
and it's about vortexes
in Sedona.

00:27:22.041 --> 00:27:24.076 align:middle line:84%
But right on the
front, it was about,

00:27:24.076 --> 00:27:26.245 align:middle line:90%
big letters, human resonance.

00:27:26.245 --> 00:27:29.315 align:middle line:84%
By then I already knew that
was part of what this was

00:27:29.315 --> 00:27:31.784 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't understand
what that meant.

00:27:31.784 --> 00:27:36.188 align:middle line:84%
So I went back to Scottsdale
where I was staying,

00:27:36.188 --> 00:27:39.191 align:middle line:84%
looked in the back, there was
his phone number, I called him.

00:27:39.191 --> 00:27:42.194 align:middle line:84%
And he listened to me for
a minute and, you know,

00:27:42.194 --> 00:27:45.898 align:middle line:84%
he's talking to me
like I'm really crazy.

00:27:45.898 --> 00:27:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Well would
you meet me for coffee

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:49.735 align:middle line:90%
and let me share this with you?"

00:27:49.735 --> 00:27:50.936 align:middle line:90%
and he agreed.

00:27:50.936 --> 00:27:53.939 align:middle line:84%
And he reluctantly took
it home with him, the CD,

00:27:53.939 --> 00:27:55.174 align:middle line:90%
took it home with him.

00:27:55.174 --> 00:27:57.777 align:middle line:84%
And I had two segments
completed by that time.

00:27:57.777 --> 00:28:00.479 align:middle line:84%
The third one was getting
ready to be completed.

00:28:00.479 --> 00:28:02.448 align:middle line:84%
But he took the two
segments home.

00:28:02.448 --> 00:28:04.183 align:middle line:84%
He called me about
1:30 in the morning

00:28:04.183 --> 00:28:07.386 align:middle line:90%
and he said, "We need to talk.

00:28:07.386 --> 00:28:09.288 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what you have?"

00:28:09.288 --> 00:28:11.857 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Yes, I have
a CD that I just gave you

00:28:11.857 --> 00:28:13.325 align:middle line:90%
with two sequences so what's"--

00:28:13.325 --> 00:28:14.693 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: That's all you knew.

00:28:14.693 --> 00:28:15.795 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:15.795 --> 00:28:17.830 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: And so, we began
a collaboration then

00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:20.232 align:middle line:84%
and he did the specter
analysis on that and began

00:28:20.232 --> 00:28:24.470 align:middle line:84%
to show me how absolutely
riding on that Schumann ideas.

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:27.573 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's-- you can pick it up
anywhere and a lot of the people

00:28:27.573 --> 00:28:30.176 align:middle line:84%
that have picked it up
have actually picked more

00:28:30.176 --> 00:28:34.113 align:middle line:84%
of the Schumann component of
the wave because it's familiar.

00:28:34.113 --> 00:28:35.714 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:28:35.714 --> 00:28:37.917 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: He introduced me
immediately to Charlie.

00:28:37.917 --> 00:28:40.486 align:middle line:84%
So when I went back
to North Carolina,

00:28:40.486 --> 00:28:43.389 align:middle line:84%
Charlie's first comment
to me was,

00:28:43.389 --> 00:28:46.492 align:middle line:84%
"This will deprogram
the program."

00:28:46.492 --> 00:28:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, "What
does that mean?"

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:48.794 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Who was Charlie?

00:28:48.794 --> 00:28:49.762 align:middle line:90%
Explain to us who he was.

00:28:49.762 --> 00:28:51.931 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: Charlie Plyler
with ELFRAD.

00:28:51.931 --> 00:28:53.632 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And ELFRAD,
explain what ELFRAD.

00:28:53.632 --> 00:28:58.204 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: ELFRAD again was
a network of technicians

00:28:58.204 --> 00:28:59.839 align:middle line:84%
around the globe
who were working

00:28:59.839 --> 00:29:02.808 align:middle line:90%
with precursors for earthquakes.

00:29:02.808 --> 00:29:04.109 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:29:04.109 --> 00:29:05.444 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: They wanted to give--
wanted to find out what--

00:29:05.444 --> 00:29:07.546 align:middle line:84%
how do we know when earthquake
arrives before it arrives?

00:29:07.546 --> 00:29:08.814 align:middle line:90%
Can we give some notice?

00:29:08.814 --> 00:29:10.549 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: But there was obviously
something else they were

00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:11.483 align:middle line:90%
looking for.

00:29:11.483 --> 00:29:12.818 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: They were all way under.

00:29:12.818 --> 00:29:13.419 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:29:13.419 --> 00:29:14.753 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Yes.

00:29:14.753 --> 00:29:18.557 align:middle line:84%
And some of them during the
process were still in the--

00:29:18.557 --> 00:29:22.027 align:middle line:84%
in those that you don't
want to talk about.

00:29:22.027 --> 00:29:24.630 align:middle line:84%
But they were also very
carefully monitoring

00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:25.931 align:middle line:90%
and watching and--

00:29:25.931 --> 00:29:26.765 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: OK.

00:29:26.765 --> 00:29:27.600 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: -- looking out for me.

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:28.734 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: So now you meet Charlie

00:29:28.734 --> 00:29:31.136 align:middle line:84%
and what does Charlie
bring to the picture?

00:29:31.136 --> 00:29:36.275 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: My first experience with
Charlie was a big wake up call.

00:29:36.275 --> 00:29:38.143 align:middle line:84%
First of all, he
doesn't speak to anyone.

00:29:38.143 --> 00:29:39.712 align:middle line:90%
These guys don't talk to people.

00:29:39.712 --> 00:29:43.482 align:middle line:84%
The only reason he talked
to me was because of Ben.

00:29:43.482 --> 00:29:48.387 align:middle line:84%
My instruction from Charlie the
day, in writing, by mail, was,

00:29:48.387 --> 00:29:52.458 align:middle line:84%
"I want you to drive," I was
in Salisbury at the time,

00:29:52.458 --> 00:29:53.826 align:middle line:84%
"I want you to drive
to Statesville,"

00:29:53.826 --> 00:29:55.094 align:middle line:84%
which was maybe a
half an hour away.

00:29:55.094 --> 00:29:58.530 align:middle line:84%
"I want you to arrive
at this motel

00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:01.767 align:middle line:84%
at precisely," whatever
time it was.

00:30:01.767 --> 00:30:03.135 align:middle line:84%
"I want you to get
up, park your car

00:30:03.135 --> 00:30:04.503 align:middle line:84%
in the front, get
out of the car.

00:30:04.503 --> 00:30:06.906 align:middle line:84%
I want you to go inside, go
straight back through the lobby.

00:30:06.906 --> 00:30:08.374 align:middle line:90%
There's a row of chairs that sit

00:30:08.374 --> 00:30:10.509 align:middle line:84%
by a window facing
the front door.

00:30:10.509 --> 00:30:14.113 align:middle line:84%
I want you to pick up a paper
and I want you to sit there.

00:30:14.113 --> 00:30:17.583 align:middle line:84%
I will watch to see if you're
followed and I will come in.

00:30:17.583 --> 00:30:20.119 align:middle line:90%
I will stand at the counter.

00:30:20.119 --> 00:30:22.988 align:middle line:84%
And I will come by
you to the rest room.

00:30:22.988 --> 00:30:26.191 align:middle line:84%
And if it's OK, I will come
and sit down beside of you.

00:30:26.191 --> 00:30:27.793 align:middle line:84%
If I do not sit down
beside of you,

00:30:27.793 --> 00:30:29.828 align:middle line:84%
I want you to put your
paper down and leave."

00:30:29.828 --> 00:30:31.964 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Kind of classic
intelligence operations.

00:30:31.964 --> 00:30:34.366 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: And I'm going, woo,
shades of Angelina Jolie.

00:30:34.366 --> 00:30:35.067 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:30:35.067 --> 00:30:36.201 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: This is exciting.

00:30:36.201 --> 00:30:38.604 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be a spy.

00:30:38.604 --> 00:30:41.440 align:middle line:84%
Thinking it was all humorous,
you know, because it was

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:43.876 align:middle line:84%
so far outside of
my realm of reality.

00:30:43.876 --> 00:30:46.545 align:middle line:84%
As it turns out,
Charlie did stop.

00:30:46.545 --> 00:30:49.348 align:middle line:84%
We had a brief conversation
during which time he delivered

00:30:49.348 --> 00:30:51.917 align:middle line:84%
that message and he said,
"You're going to have

00:30:51.917 --> 00:30:56.522 align:middle line:84%
to be very aware of who you talk
to and who you share this with.

00:30:56.522 --> 00:30:58.057 align:middle line:84%
You will talk to me,
you will talk to them.

00:30:58.057 --> 00:31:00.626 align:middle line:84%
You will not talk
to anybody else.

00:31:00.626 --> 00:31:04.129 align:middle line:84%
If anyone ask you any
questions, play dumb."

00:31:04.129 --> 00:31:06.231 align:middle line:84%
So I journaled, remember
I've been journaling

00:31:06.231 --> 00:31:08.500 align:middle line:90%
since this started in 1990.

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.436 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: When you had
the cancer diagnosis.

00:31:10.436 --> 00:31:13.305 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: Yeah, every bit of
this is journaled in my hand,

00:31:13.305 --> 00:31:14.907 align:middle line:90%
you know, very detailed.

00:31:14.907 --> 00:31:17.276 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm journaling this
and still laughing at it,

00:31:17.276 --> 00:31:20.679 align:middle line:84%
but I get home because it's
like, "Well this is so bizarre."

00:31:20.679 --> 00:31:23.716 align:middle line:84%
As it turns out I got
to know very quickly

00:31:23.716 --> 00:31:28.120 align:middle line:84%
that it is a real thing because
the curiosity had began to mount

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:30.789 align:middle line:84%
because those who were curious
about this were beginning

00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:32.558 align:middle line:90%
to pick it up because it was--

00:31:32.558 --> 00:31:33.792 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: They're beginning
with their instrumentation

00:31:33.792 --> 00:31:34.793 align:middle line:90%
to pick up the frequencies.

00:31:34.793 --> 00:31:35.761 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: Instrumentation
to pick it up.

00:31:35.761 --> 00:31:36.829 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:31:36.829 --> 00:31:38.430 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: So now they
were curious about me.

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:39.832 align:middle line:90%
Well I'm a grandmother and I'm--

00:31:39.832 --> 00:31:42.668 align:middle line:84%
you know, this would
be sort of strange.

00:31:42.668 --> 00:31:44.570 align:middle line:84%
We used to-- when
they pull up in the--

00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:46.805 align:middle line:84%
you know, and park around the
street in their black vans,

00:31:46.805 --> 00:31:48.273 align:middle line:90%
we would just say excuse me.

00:31:48.273 --> 00:31:51.510 align:middle line:84%
But Susan's making cookies,
you know, you can come in

00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:53.379 align:middle line:90%
and have cookies if you want to.

00:31:53.379 --> 00:31:57.750 align:middle line:84%
So it was a learning
experience with that.

00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:00.352 align:middle line:84%
And from that point on, most
of the people that I worked

00:32:00.352 --> 00:32:04.656 align:middle line:84%
with for good many years
including Slim Spurling were

00:32:04.656 --> 00:32:06.692 align:middle line:90%
in that network.

00:32:06.692 --> 00:32:09.128 align:middle line:84%
Slim introduced me to
quite a few of his network.

00:32:09.128 --> 00:32:12.498 align:middle line:84%
There's a physicist in
Phoenix that brought some

00:32:12.498 --> 00:32:13.699 align:middle line:90%
of the graphics together,

00:32:13.699 --> 00:32:15.534 align:middle line:84%
Michael Helios [assumed
spelling].

00:32:15.534 --> 00:32:22.207 align:middle line:84%
There were just so many
of this deeply dedicated

00:32:22.207 --> 00:32:28.747 align:middle line:84%
but very wounded and very
afraid to talk publicly

00:32:28.747 --> 00:32:30.082 align:middle line:90%
about what was going on.

00:32:30.082 --> 00:32:33.385 align:middle line:84%
So we kept it very quiet
for as long as we could.

00:32:33.385 --> 00:32:35.054 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: So let's go back.

00:32:35.054 --> 00:32:37.056 align:middle line:84%
We're going to come
back to that point.

00:32:37.056 --> 00:32:38.323 align:middle line:90%
Let's weave it forward.

00:32:38.323 --> 00:32:40.192 align:middle line:84%
You found the third
layer of frequency.

00:32:40.192 --> 00:32:40.959 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Third layer.

00:32:40.959 --> 00:32:42.361 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: What was that?

00:32:42.361 --> 00:32:46.131 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: The third layer, I had
begun to understand through some

00:32:46.131 --> 00:32:48.567 align:middle line:84%
of Andrija Puharich's
work and others

00:32:48.567 --> 00:32:54.440 align:middle line:84%
that many had come very close
to actually creating life.

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:56.942 align:middle line:84%
And so that's based
on what we refer

00:32:56.942 --> 00:32:59.678 align:middle line:90%
to as the Fibonacci sequencing.

00:32:59.678 --> 00:33:02.481 align:middle line:84%
Well being the one who ask
the questions, I'm going,

00:33:02.481 --> 00:33:03.816 align:middle line:90%
"But it just keeps on going.

00:33:03.816 --> 00:33:07.152 align:middle line:84%
How do we ever bring
it back to use it?"

00:33:07.152 --> 00:33:12.357 align:middle line:84%
And so, I called a meeting
of the off planet technicians

00:33:12.357 --> 00:33:14.026 align:middle line:84%
from three different
star systems saying,

00:33:14.026 --> 00:33:16.228 align:middle line:90%
"How do we do this?"

00:33:16.228 --> 00:33:17.529 align:middle line:90%
And, "Well what do you think?"

00:33:17.529 --> 00:33:19.631 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Well, it has
to be folded back on itself.

00:33:19.631 --> 00:33:21.733 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to
manifest, it has to fold up.

00:33:21.733 --> 00:33:24.503 align:middle line:84%
It has to fold back
upon itself."

00:33:24.503 --> 00:33:26.572 align:middle line:84%
And so it was, "Well where
do you want to fold it over?"

00:33:26.572 --> 00:33:29.475 align:middle line:84%
And so I gave them what
I understood was the fold

00:33:29.475 --> 00:33:31.243 align:middle line:84%
over point and they're
applauding me

00:33:31.243 --> 00:33:33.512 align:middle line:90%
and going right on.

00:33:33.512 --> 00:33:37.216 align:middle line:84%
So the fold over point is
actually the pause at the top

00:33:37.216 --> 00:33:40.586 align:middle line:84%
of that sequencing that allows
us to access every frequency,

00:33:40.586 --> 00:33:45.057 align:middle line:84%
every harmonics, sub-acoustic,
anything that exists,

00:33:45.057 --> 00:33:46.525 align:middle line:90%
overtones and undertones.

00:33:46.525 --> 00:33:48.393 align:middle line:90%
We have access to everything.

00:33:48.393 --> 00:33:51.330 align:middle line:84%
However, it's just
a point of pause.

00:33:51.330 --> 00:33:52.831 align:middle line:90%
It's an opportunity.

00:33:52.831 --> 00:33:55.000 align:middle line:90%
It's not a guarantee.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.370 align:middle line:84%
So you have that potential
and then it folds back

00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:01.406 align:middle line:90%
over on itself to manifest.

00:34:01.406 --> 00:34:03.976 align:middle line:90%
When that became on board,

00:34:03.976 --> 00:34:07.912 align:middle line:84%
that's when everything really
started shaking loose because,

00:34:07.912 --> 00:34:14.853 align:middle line:84%
at that point, I had
something then that has to do

00:34:14.853 --> 00:34:22.327 align:middle line:84%
with how the human
population looks in the future.

00:34:22.327 --> 00:34:26.064 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And are you allowed to
share some glimpses of that?

00:34:26.064 --> 00:34:28.600 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: I can even share names.

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:31.737 align:middle line:84%
However, I've never
spoken to these people,

00:34:31.737 --> 00:34:33.705 align:middle line:84%
so I am only giving
you my version

00:34:33.705 --> 00:34:35.673 align:middle line:84%
of what those documents
mean to me.

00:34:35.673 --> 00:34:36.941 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: OK.

00:34:36.941 --> 00:34:40.612 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: And that's as
much as I can go on.

00:34:40.612 --> 00:34:42.280 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: OK.

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:45.617 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: The first with Charlie,
of course, he picked it up

00:34:45.617 --> 00:34:48.187 align:middle line:90%
and knew what was going on.

00:34:48.187 --> 00:34:50.055 align:middle line:90%
The second part was

00:34:50.055 --> 00:34:57.062 align:middle line:84%
when Clifford Carnicom started
monitoring, this was in 2003.

00:34:57.062 --> 00:34:59.431 align:middle line:84%
Well if you remember that's
when I was in Arizona and Ben

00:34:59.431 --> 00:35:02.267 align:middle line:84%
and I were constantly
driving around the countryside

00:35:02.267 --> 00:35:03.969 align:middle line:84%
because we would met-- he
would bring his equipment

00:35:03.969 --> 00:35:06.438 align:middle line:90%
and he'd stand me out there.

00:35:06.438 --> 00:35:10.475 align:middle line:84%
And we were working with
inflow-outflow vortex and energy

00:35:10.475 --> 00:35:11.844 align:middle line:84%
and I would give
him the sequencing

00:35:11.844 --> 00:35:15.080 align:middle line:84%
and the sequencing would
be precise with the wave.

00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:16.215 align:middle line:90%
Although, I didn't know

00:35:16.215 --> 00:35:20.419 align:middle line:84%
that when he was using
me for his guinea pig.

00:35:20.419 --> 00:35:22.487 align:middle line:84%
But we were all over
the place with that.

00:35:22.487 --> 00:35:24.790 align:middle line:90%
Later on, one of the sessions,

00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:26.291 align:middle line:84%
my husband before
he passed away,

00:35:26.291 --> 00:35:28.293 align:middle line:84%
we went to Bandolera
[assumed spelling].

00:35:28.293 --> 00:35:29.895 align:middle line:90%
And he was measuring.

00:35:29.895 --> 00:35:34.199 align:middle line:84%
Somebody is there and they're
transmitting and he decided

00:35:34.199 --> 00:35:35.500 align:middle line:90%
that it had to be military

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:36.902 align:middle line:84%
because they couldn't
break the code.

00:35:36.902 --> 00:35:38.604 align:middle line:90%
Nobody could break the code.

00:35:38.604 --> 00:35:40.906 align:middle line:84%
The only parts they were
aware of and then all

00:35:40.906 --> 00:35:44.977 align:middle line:84%
of these documents that I showed
you earlier today, for years,

00:35:44.977 --> 00:35:48.213 align:middle line:84%
he followed it but he couldn't
determine what it was so he--

00:35:48.213 --> 00:35:49.548 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Who you're
speaking, Cliff?

00:35:49.548 --> 00:35:50.682 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Cliff.

00:35:50.682 --> 00:35:51.984 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Cliff Carnicom
and he is well-known.

00:35:51.984 --> 00:35:54.519 align:middle line:84%
Many people know his name
associated with Chemtrails,

00:35:54.519 --> 00:35:56.255 align:middle line:84%
spent the early years
of his research.

00:35:56.255 --> 00:35:57.589 align:middle line:90%
But he was doing much more.

00:35:57.589 --> 00:36:00.158 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: He was doing much more
and he was picking this up

00:36:00.158 --> 00:36:01.627 align:middle line:90%
but he didn't know what it was.

00:36:01.627 --> 00:36:06.398 align:middle line:84%
So he assumed that it had to be
military and it had to be bad

00:36:06.398 --> 00:36:09.868 align:middle line:84%
because it was low
frequencies and it was moving.

00:36:09.868 --> 00:36:11.270 align:middle line:90%
It was constantly moving.

00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:12.938 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And you were in your car
moving around with your husband.

00:36:12.938 --> 00:36:13.905 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Yeah.

00:36:13.905 --> 00:36:15.307 align:middle line:84%
And it was like we're
in trouble.

00:36:15.307 --> 00:36:18.710 align:middle line:84%
I would love to speak with him
at some point in time and just,

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:20.979 align:middle line:84%
you know, say, "Could we compare
notes because I went down

00:36:20.979 --> 00:36:22.881 align:middle line:84%
and did-- I actually
did a timeline."

00:36:22.881 --> 00:36:24.983 align:middle line:84%
We were here, he
was monitoring here.

00:36:24.983 --> 00:36:26.618 align:middle line:84%
We were here, he
was monitoring here.

00:36:26.618 --> 00:36:27.653 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Interesting.

00:36:27.653 --> 00:36:28.887 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: So it was--
it got to be a game.

00:36:28.887 --> 00:36:29.755 align:middle line:90%
That part of it was a game.

00:36:29.755 --> 00:36:30.956 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: So he was in a little--

00:36:30.956 --> 00:36:32.624 align:middle line:84%
he had concern about
this new low--

00:36:32.624 --> 00:36:35.594 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: That it was very
harmful because so many aspects

00:36:35.594 --> 00:36:37.062 align:middle line:90%
of ultra light frequency

00:36:37.062 --> 00:36:40.332 align:middle line:84%
in the physical form
are incredibly harmful.

00:36:40.332 --> 00:36:41.566 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:36:41.566 --> 00:36:42.968 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: So part of the
reason, again, for this sort

00:36:42.968 --> 00:36:44.636 align:middle line:90%
of sequencing of the wave.

00:36:44.636 --> 00:36:49.074 align:middle line:84%
Because the wave starts
and folds over on itself,

00:36:49.074 --> 00:36:50.876 align:middle line:90%
it can't be manipulated.

00:36:50.876 --> 00:36:53.278 align:middle line:84%
Any time you're shooting
a straight line frequency,

00:36:53.278 --> 00:36:54.613 align:middle line:90%
you got interference.

00:36:54.613 --> 00:36:56.481 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Makes sense because
it's replicated again way back

00:36:56.481 --> 00:36:57.749 align:middle line:90%
to wave.

00:36:57.749 --> 00:36:59.051 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: It's constantly in
motion, so it never stops.

00:36:59.051 --> 00:37:00.052 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:37:00.052 --> 00:37:01.186 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: When that
happens, it allows you

00:37:01.186 --> 00:37:04.089 align:middle line:84%
to choose rather
than being entrained.

00:37:04.089 --> 00:37:07.693 align:middle line:84%
You're entrained to yourself in
your higher intelligence rather

00:37:07.693 --> 00:37:09.127 align:middle line:90%
than being entrained to--

00:37:09.127 --> 00:37:10.495 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Every program out there.

00:37:10.495 --> 00:37:11.596 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: Every program
that's out there.

00:37:11.596 --> 00:37:12.431 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:37:12.431 --> 00:37:13.365 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: The other part of it was

00:37:13.365 --> 00:37:14.900 align:middle line:84%
that it was also
very much designed

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:16.301 align:middle line:90%
to be a support mechanism

00:37:16.301 --> 00:37:19.104 align:middle line:84%
for all the absolutely
great programs that we have,

00:37:19.104 --> 00:37:22.107 align:middle line:84%
and to create an
interference pattern for those

00:37:22.107 --> 00:37:24.176 align:middle line:90%
that were not so great.

00:37:24.176 --> 00:37:27.713 align:middle line:84%
The measurement was
the golden mean.

00:37:27.713 --> 00:37:29.581 align:middle line:84%
Well I didn't even
know what that was

00:37:29.581 --> 00:37:33.051 align:middle line:84%
until I met my friend Susan
Miller [assumed spelling].

00:37:33.051 --> 00:37:34.586 align:middle line:84%
She was Susan Coleman
[assumed spelling] then.

00:37:34.586 --> 00:37:36.655 align:middle line:84%
But she's saying, "This
is the golden mean,"

00:37:36.655 --> 00:37:37.823 align:middle line:90%
and she's an artist.

00:37:37.823 --> 00:37:40.826 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, "OK,
if you say so."

00:37:40.826 --> 00:37:44.496 align:middle line:84%
So that part of it was
folded in at that moment

00:37:44.496 --> 00:37:47.666 align:middle line:84%
so that I would have the
languaging then to talk

00:37:47.666 --> 00:37:48.734 align:middle line:90%
about the golden mean.

00:37:48.734 --> 00:37:49.968 align:middle line:90%
In the beginning, I didn't--

00:37:49.968 --> 00:37:51.770 align:middle line:84%
you know, I'm accumulating
information.

00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:52.904 align:middle line:90%
I'm learning on the job.

00:37:52.904 --> 00:37:55.874 align:middle line:84%
Remember, I have
to articulate this.

00:37:55.874 --> 00:37:59.211 align:middle line:84%
So once that happened, then it
was like, "Well wait a minute,

00:37:59.211 --> 00:38:00.612 align:middle line:90%
if the interference pattern"--

00:38:00.612 --> 00:38:05.083 align:middle line:84%
and that was what Charlie was
able to determine quite easily

00:38:05.083 --> 00:38:08.220 align:middle line:84%
and Slim also, then-- and
some of his technicians

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:11.223 align:middle line:84%
that the interference pattern,
if something is out of resonance

00:38:11.223 --> 00:38:14.159 align:middle line:84%
with the golden mean, it creates
a Maori [phonetic] pattern.

00:38:14.159 --> 00:38:17.529 align:middle line:84%
It traps it just like
this, right in it.

00:38:17.529 --> 00:38:18.630 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Interesting.

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:20.098 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: Maori being a
French dweeb [phonetic]

00:38:20.098 --> 00:38:22.067 align:middle line:90%
so it works sort of like that.

00:38:22.067 --> 00:38:22.734 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: It enmeshes.

00:38:22.734 --> 00:38:23.769 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: It enmeshes.

00:38:23.769 --> 00:38:26.238 align:middle line:84%
So that was interesting
and I'm going,

00:38:26.238 --> 00:38:29.241 align:middle line:90%
"Will that do with everything?"

00:38:29.241 --> 00:38:30.842 align:middle line:90%
You can't lie.

00:38:30.842 --> 00:38:33.845 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is
it exposes on truths.

00:38:33.845 --> 00:38:36.281 align:middle line:84%
So if you stop and realize,
this has been on the planet

00:38:36.281 --> 00:38:40.018 align:middle line:84%
for awhile now and many of us
are now participating in it

00:38:40.018 --> 00:38:42.287 align:middle line:84%
and actually using
it, what's starting

00:38:42.287 --> 00:38:44.556 align:middle line:90%
to happen within our system?

00:38:44.556 --> 00:38:45.791 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: The lies are
being exposed, yes.

00:38:45.791 --> 00:38:47.826 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: The lies are being
exposed, which was one

00:38:47.826 --> 00:38:50.395 align:middle line:84%
of the original intents
of the Earth Project.

00:38:50.395 --> 00:38:55.333 align:middle line:84%
The 777 aspect of the Earth
Project is simply the holy human

00:38:55.333 --> 00:38:57.869 align:middle line:84%
working in its full divinity
whether its intelligence

00:38:57.869 --> 00:39:02.574 align:middle line:84%
and its spirit, so
compassion, love, fully engaged.

00:39:02.574 --> 00:39:08.013 align:middle line:84%
So that if we choose to have
an experience that's not

00:39:08.013 --> 00:39:11.550 align:middle line:84%
harmonious, we do it without
the emotional charge that sends

00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:15.320 align:middle line:84%
out a frequency and a vibration
that affects the population.

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:17.722 align:middle line:90%
It's our experience to have.

00:39:17.722 --> 00:39:19.157 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So it contains
and isolates it.

00:39:19.157 --> 00:39:22.961 align:middle line:84%
So, many people I've interviewed
and many books I've read

00:39:22.961 --> 00:39:25.997 align:middle line:84%
through the last decades have
talked about this point in time

00:39:25.997 --> 00:39:28.099 align:middle line:84%
where there would be this
shifting of frequencies

00:39:28.099 --> 00:39:31.603 align:middle line:84%
that would allow for this new
potential of choice to be there.

00:39:31.603 --> 00:39:34.639 align:middle line:84%
But what it didn't
talk about, per se,

00:39:34.639 --> 00:39:38.643 align:middle line:84%
was that there would be also
this human technological

00:39:38.643 --> 00:39:42.113 align:middle line:84%
interface to help enhance
this thing at that time

00:39:42.113 --> 00:39:44.349 align:middle line:84%
that would also be made
possible by the times.

00:39:44.349 --> 00:39:45.484 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Yes.

00:39:45.484 --> 00:39:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And in all reality, we
were hoping to have it

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:50.589 align:middle line:84%
on ground a long
time before we did.

00:39:50.589 --> 00:39:54.326 align:middle line:84%
As it turned out, we had
to start building in 09/09.

00:39:54.326 --> 00:39:57.195 align:middle line:84%
We brought in what I
refer to as a triple.

00:39:57.195 --> 00:40:02.634 align:middle line:84%
So we brought in a three-prong
enhancement like a supercharge

00:40:02.634 --> 00:40:05.403 align:middle line:84%
that would begin
to unfold itself,

00:40:05.403 --> 00:40:08.740 align:middle line:90%
09/09, 10/10 and 11/11/11.

00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:11.877 align:middle line:84%
And that was building
towards bringing us

00:40:11.877 --> 00:40:17.382 align:middle line:84%
into a unity consciousness
experience which was where we--

00:40:17.382 --> 00:40:19.317 align:middle line:84%
you know, we developed
that and begin to move

00:40:19.317 --> 00:40:21.553 align:middle line:90%
through that in the 2012.

00:40:21.553 --> 00:40:22.521 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we're beginning

00:40:22.521 --> 00:40:24.523 align:middle line:84%
to experience a little
bit of now.

00:40:24.523 --> 00:40:27.893 align:middle line:84%
But we were moving
beyond judgment.

00:40:27.893 --> 00:40:30.128 align:middle line:90%
We had to move beyond judgment.

00:40:30.128 --> 00:40:33.698 align:middle line:84%
And in order to do that, we had
to have a little more assistance

00:40:33.698 --> 00:40:36.034 align:middle line:84%
in how do we understand
how they're--

00:40:36.034 --> 00:40:39.504 align:middle line:84%
how are we being
manipulated and controlled.

00:40:39.504 --> 00:40:42.774 align:middle line:84%
Not just, well, we're
bombarded with frequencies

00:40:42.774 --> 00:40:43.875 align:middle line:90%
but how are we really?

00:40:43.875 --> 00:40:45.944 align:middle line:84%
How do you control
the human physiology

00:40:45.944 --> 00:40:49.548 align:middle line:84%
so that it doesn't route
information appropriately?

00:40:49.548 --> 00:40:53.618 align:middle line:84%
And so what that took me back
to asking the question, "Well,

00:40:53.618 --> 00:40:55.787 align:middle line:84%
if I were going to do
that, how would I do it?"

00:40:55.787 --> 00:40:58.523 align:middle line:84%
Well look at the
proliferation right now

00:40:58.523 --> 00:41:00.025 align:middle line:90%
of autoimmune diseases.

00:41:00.025 --> 00:41:00.825 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:41:00.825 --> 00:41:02.427 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Of thyroid problems.

00:41:02.427 --> 00:41:04.963 align:middle line:90%
Well why is a thyroid important?

00:41:04.963 --> 00:41:09.434 align:middle line:84%
The thyroid, actually,
our blood passes

00:41:09.434 --> 00:41:12.671 align:middle line:84%
through the thyroid
every 17 minutes.

00:41:12.671 --> 00:41:18.577 align:middle line:84%
Any airborne bacteria or viruses
are killed every 17 minutes,

00:41:18.577 --> 00:41:24.549 align:middle line:84%
if our thyroid gland is
working with proper iodine--

00:41:24.549 --> 00:41:25.550 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Which is not.

00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:26.585 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: It is not.

00:41:26.585 --> 00:41:29.454 align:middle line:84%
It is not and it
hasn't been for years.

00:41:29.454 --> 00:41:32.290 align:middle line:84%
So the last piece of the
puzzle for me was, "Oh,

00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:34.826 align:middle line:84%
that's the last part
of the physiology."

00:41:34.826 --> 00:41:38.096 align:middle line:84%
And we came to that conclusion
with some on planet assistance

00:41:38.096 --> 00:41:41.166 align:middle line:84%
and some off planet
assistance understanding

00:41:41.166 --> 00:41:44.302 align:middle line:84%
that the third component
of our hypothalamic access

00:41:44.302 --> 00:41:47.472 align:middle line:84%
that I work with, that the wave
works with, the hypothalamus

00:41:47.472 --> 00:41:49.841 align:middle line:84%
which works with all
the control mechanisms,

00:41:49.841 --> 00:41:52.777 align:middle line:84%
how information is sent to the
different parts of the body,

00:41:52.777 --> 00:41:54.980 align:middle line:84%
the pineal gland
which is our access

00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:56.281 align:middle line:90%
to that divine intelligence--

00:41:56.281 --> 00:41:57.983 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Which has been
calcified through various--

00:41:57.983 --> 00:42:02.821 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: Calcified, has now
been-- is now being decalcified.

00:42:02.821 --> 00:42:06.124 align:middle line:84%
And then moving down
to third segment

00:42:06.124 --> 00:42:08.727 align:middle line:84%
which just started online
about two months ago

00:42:08.727 --> 00:42:11.096 align:middle line:84%
which is the pituitary
which controls all

00:42:11.096 --> 00:42:12.831 align:middle line:90%
of our glandular function.

00:42:12.831 --> 00:42:15.200 align:middle line:90%
Alas, the thyroid.

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:16.234 align:middle line:90%
So we've just begun

00:42:16.234 --> 00:42:18.570 align:middle line:84%
to understand what
was the final piece.

00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:23.241 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't understand why are
we not reaching the pinnacle,

00:42:23.241 --> 00:42:27.245 align:middle line:84%
this empirical awareness
that we are guaranteed.

00:42:27.245 --> 00:42:28.480 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:29.648 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: Where we will be
shown-- actually be shown--

00:42:29.648 --> 00:42:30.415 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:42:30.415 --> 00:42:31.349 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: -- tangible proof.

00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:32.484 align:middle line:90%
What were we missing?

00:42:32.484 --> 00:42:34.085 align:middle line:90%
We were missing that component.

00:42:34.085 --> 00:42:34.853 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:42:34.853 --> 00:42:36.121 align:middle line:90%
And the physical bodies--

00:42:36.121 --> 00:42:38.323 align:middle line:84%
at the same time the possibility
is grander than never,

00:42:38.323 --> 00:42:41.559 align:middle line:84%
the physical bodies are breaking
down faster than that one.

00:42:41.559 --> 00:42:43.395 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Faster and faster.

00:42:43.395 --> 00:42:46.698 align:middle line:84%
Did they-- do the ones the
do not want this to succeed,

00:42:46.698 --> 00:42:47.866 align:middle line:90%
are they aware of that?

00:42:47.866 --> 00:42:49.000 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.101 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Let's talk about that.

00:42:50.101 --> 00:42:54.773 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have been
followed by some groups

00:42:54.773 --> 00:42:57.075 align:middle line:84%
that are highly covert,
Majestic,

00:42:57.075 --> 00:42:58.143 align:middle line:90%
others they've involved

00:42:58.143 --> 00:43:00.712 align:middle line:84%
as an intelligence
agencies of the world.

00:43:00.712 --> 00:43:03.315 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: Majestic is supposedly
not existent anymore,

00:43:03.315 --> 00:43:05.183 align:middle line:90%
so we don't know exactly who--

00:43:05.183 --> 00:43:05.884 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:43:05.884 --> 00:43:06.718 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: -- who they are--

00:43:06.718 --> 00:43:07.552 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: But they all still exist.

00:43:07.552 --> 00:43:08.520 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: But they all still exist.

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:09.554 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: They can change
their name,

00:43:09.554 --> 00:43:11.489 align:middle line:84%
but it all exists in
the shadowy world.

00:43:11.489 --> 00:43:15.160 align:middle line:84%
And we talked about
this off camera too.

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:18.697 align:middle line:84%
As with the CIA, other
intelligence agencies,

00:43:18.697 --> 00:43:21.733 align:middle line:84%
these shadow organizations
that control the species,

00:43:21.733 --> 00:43:24.436 align:middle line:84%
perceptions, biology
and so forth.

00:43:24.436 --> 00:43:29.774 align:middle line:84%
There are some wonderful
beings working along side very

00:43:29.774 --> 00:43:31.309 align:middle line:90%
shadowy forces--

00:43:31.309 --> 00:43:32.277 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Yes.

00:43:32.277 --> 00:43:33.745 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: -- at counter
agendas really

00:43:33.745 --> 00:43:36.815 align:middle line:90%
within the same organizations.

00:43:36.815 --> 00:43:41.820 align:middle line:84%
You, Slim and Charlie,
all were at the brunt end

00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:43.488 align:middle line:90%
of the negative forces.

00:43:43.488 --> 00:43:44.255 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Yes, yes.

00:43:44.255 --> 00:43:45.790 align:middle line:90%
Charlie no longer exists.

00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:50.962 align:middle line:84%
So many times, we would
hear from the network

00:43:50.962 --> 00:43:52.931 align:middle line:90%
that the vans were coming down

00:43:52.931 --> 00:43:54.999 align:middle line:84%
and they would confiscate
all of the equipment.

00:43:54.999 --> 00:43:55.867 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yup.

00:43:55.867 --> 00:43:56.668 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: And these
boys were smart.

00:43:56.668 --> 00:43:58.403 align:middle line:90%
They had so many different--

00:43:58.403 --> 00:44:00.505 align:middle line:84%
you know, so a lot
of the information

00:44:00.505 --> 00:44:03.041 align:middle line:84%
from Charlie was lost, a
lot of the history was lost.

00:44:03.041 --> 00:44:04.709 align:middle line:84%
We tried to piece
some of that together.

00:44:04.709 --> 00:44:06.611 align:middle line:90%
But because they were so careful

00:44:06.611 --> 00:44:10.115 align:middle line:84%
about not telling
everything to--

00:44:10.115 --> 00:44:11.483 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:44:11.483 --> 00:44:12.817 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: -- everybody, so this
person would have a little bit,

00:44:12.817 --> 00:44:14.185 align:middle line:84%
someone else would
have a little bit more.

00:44:14.185 --> 00:44:16.721 align:middle line:90%
Slim worked the same way.

00:44:16.721 --> 00:44:18.289 align:middle line:90%
Charlie is no longer with us.

00:44:18.289 --> 00:44:20.725 align:middle line:90%
He was taken out.

00:44:20.725 --> 00:44:24.896 align:middle line:84%
Slim, we had an appointment
to meet in Virginia.

00:44:24.896 --> 00:44:27.899 align:middle line:84%
He was going to do a workshop
there, [inaudible] planet text

00:44:27.899 --> 00:44:30.535 align:middle line:84%
as well as the young
Charlie, you know,

00:44:30.535 --> 00:44:32.170 align:middle line:84%
[inaudible] planet network
that I was still working

00:44:32.170 --> 00:44:33.872 align:middle line:90%
with were going, "Don't go.

00:44:33.872 --> 00:44:36.541 align:middle line:84%
I had just gone through
a huge transition

00:44:36.541 --> 00:44:40.378 align:middle line:84%
of information exchange to
work on another segment."

00:44:40.378 --> 00:44:44.549 align:middle line:84%
And-- so I was not
physically, you know, up to par.

00:44:44.549 --> 00:44:46.151 align:middle line:84%
There are two rules
you don't break.

00:44:46.151 --> 00:44:47.652 align:middle line:90%
You don't get overly fatigued

00:44:47.652 --> 00:44:49.220 align:middle line:84%
and you don't get
overly distracted.

00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:52.957 align:middle line:84%
I have to always know what's
going on in my environment.

00:44:52.957 --> 00:44:54.125 align:middle line:90%
Slim was exhausted.

00:44:54.125 --> 00:44:56.628 align:middle line:84%
He didn't want to go,
but they went anyway,

00:44:56.628 --> 00:44:58.363 align:middle line:90%
because they had a workshop.

00:44:58.363 --> 00:45:02.066 align:middle line:84%
And those that were there
who were part of the network

00:45:02.066 --> 00:45:05.804 align:middle line:84%
that were there,
he went down fast.

00:45:05.804 --> 00:45:07.172 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: He died.

00:45:07.172 --> 00:45:09.707 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: He actually-- they
got him to a hospital

00:45:09.707 --> 00:45:13.545 align:middle line:84%
but he was technically brain
dead, so they obviously--

00:45:13.545 --> 00:45:16.514 align:middle line:84%
you know, when you stop and
think how bizarre is this,

00:45:16.514 --> 00:45:19.083 align:middle line:84%
but what you have to realize
is that there is a capability

00:45:19.083 --> 00:45:22.987 align:middle line:84%
of a polts being sent out
that can target an individual

00:45:22.987 --> 00:45:24.255 align:middle line:90%
in a crowd of 2,000.

00:45:24.255 --> 00:45:25.356 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Absolutely and I know--

00:45:25.356 --> 00:45:26.925 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: With a heart
attack and an aneurism,

00:45:26.925 --> 00:45:28.760 align:middle line:84%
those are the two
favorite ones that go down.

00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:29.861 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: But they use
others as well.

00:45:29.861 --> 00:45:30.895 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: They use others as well.

00:45:30.895 --> 00:45:31.830 align:middle line:90%
But that one works--

00:45:31.830 --> 00:45:32.964 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:45:32.964 --> 00:45:34.833 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: That one works
and you can't notice it.

00:45:34.833 --> 00:45:35.667 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:45:35.667 --> 00:45:36.367 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: I mean who's going to--

00:45:36.367 --> 00:45:37.202 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: It looks organic

00:45:37.202 --> 00:45:38.102 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: It looks very organic.

00:45:38.102 --> 00:45:39.804 align:middle line:90%
It looks very organic.

00:45:39.804 --> 00:45:43.775 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So he was gone but
you two were targeted?

00:45:43.775 --> 00:45:44.342 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Yes.

00:45:44.342 --> 00:45:45.743 align:middle line:90%
I was targeted.

00:45:45.743 --> 00:45:47.979 align:middle line:84%
Actually when I went to see him,
I was told not to go up there,

00:45:47.979 --> 00:45:50.648 align:middle line:84%
but there were some
information, his wife called

00:45:50.648 --> 00:45:52.550 align:middle line:90%
and asked if I would come up.

00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:55.186 align:middle line:84%
She had been told that
Slim had some information

00:45:55.186 --> 00:45:56.721 align:middle line:90%
to pass on to me.

00:45:56.721 --> 00:45:59.591 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're all in this mode
that says, "I can stand beside

00:45:59.591 --> 00:46:01.860 align:middle line:84%
of his bed and it doesn't
matter whether he can speak

00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:03.361 align:middle line:90%
to me or not."

00:46:03.361 --> 00:46:04.162 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:46:04.162 --> 00:46:05.530 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: And we were targeted.

00:46:05.530 --> 00:46:08.466 align:middle line:84%
When I was in the room with
him, so other guys got me out.

00:46:08.466 --> 00:46:12.270 align:middle line:84%
I got back to North Carolina,
thinking everything was fine.

00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:14.839 align:middle line:84%
I went sort of undercover
at that point.

00:46:14.839 --> 00:46:16.608 align:middle line:84%
I pulled out and
pretty much stopped

00:46:16.608 --> 00:46:18.443 align:middle line:90%
for a good number of years.

00:46:18.443 --> 00:46:25.884 align:middle line:84%
And in 2008, I had brought--
decided to bring it back online

00:46:25.884 --> 00:46:28.353 align:middle line:84%
because I felt we
were getting closer.

00:46:28.353 --> 00:46:31.189 align:middle line:84%
We were getting to a point that
I had started writing the book.

00:46:31.189 --> 00:46:34.425 align:middle line:84%
I understood the importance
of all of the information

00:46:34.425 --> 00:46:35.760 align:middle line:84%
that was contained
in the journal

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:38.229 align:middle line:84%
because it's a very
personal experience,

00:46:38.229 --> 00:46:41.699 align:middle line:84%
but it is also a very detailed
description of the interface.

00:46:41.699 --> 00:46:44.836 align:middle line:84%
How we collaborated with
the off the planets?

00:46:44.836 --> 00:46:45.770 align:middle line:90%
What the purpose was?

00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:47.705 align:middle line:90%
How it affects the physiology?

00:46:47.705 --> 00:46:49.607 align:middle line:90%
What work, what didn't work?

00:46:49.607 --> 00:46:52.143 align:middle line:90%
And I had begun to work on that.

00:46:52.143 --> 00:46:54.913 align:middle line:90%
I'd gone to do one last workshop

00:46:54.913 --> 00:46:57.982 align:middle line:84%
in Florida knowing it
was my last and happy

00:46:57.982 --> 00:46:59.851 align:middle line:90%
that it was going to happen.

00:46:59.851 --> 00:47:04.422 align:middle line:84%
Coming back from Florida,
something happened.

00:47:04.422 --> 00:47:07.625 align:middle line:84%
All I knew was that I
felt excruciating pain.

00:47:07.625 --> 00:47:10.395 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what it was from.

00:47:10.395 --> 00:47:13.298 align:middle line:84%
My friend in North
Carolina got a phone call

00:47:13.298 --> 00:47:15.066 align:middle line:90%
from my cellphone saying,

00:47:15.066 --> 00:47:18.503 align:middle line:84%
"We're bringing her in,
she's hot and toxic."

00:47:18.503 --> 00:47:22.974 align:middle line:84%
Well, hot in our vocabulary
meant I was coming in fast.

00:47:22.974 --> 00:47:24.542 align:middle line:84%
Toxic, she didn't
know what that meant

00:47:24.542 --> 00:47:26.077 align:middle line:84%
because that had
never been a term nor

00:47:26.077 --> 00:47:28.680 align:middle line:84%
that she recognize the
voice on the phone.

00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:32.917 align:middle line:84%
But I got back to North Carolina
and got back to Greensborough,

00:47:32.917 --> 00:47:36.254 align:middle line:84%
and within just a few days,
wound up in a hospice.

00:47:36.254 --> 00:47:43.795 align:middle line:84%
I had exploded my intestine
and wound up with, you know--

00:47:43.795 --> 00:47:44.996 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: This was not
degenerative?

00:47:44.996 --> 00:47:46.064 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: No.

00:47:46.064 --> 00:47:47.665 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: This was a
very fast onset event.

00:47:47.665 --> 00:47:49.167 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Very fast onset event.

00:47:49.167 --> 00:47:50.368 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And again
that technology is--

00:47:50.368 --> 00:47:51.202 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: I felt it--

00:47:51.202 --> 00:47:52.136 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: -- quite capable of that.

00:47:52.136 --> 00:47:52.670 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: I felt it
when it happened.

00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:53.438 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:47:53.438 --> 00:47:54.772 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Speculation, again.

00:47:54.772 --> 00:47:57.942 align:middle line:84%
Speculation again was that
because I sit funny in the car

00:47:57.942 --> 00:48:02.013 align:middle line:84%
when I'm driving long distances,
it missed my heart and went

00:48:02.013 --> 00:48:03.081 align:middle line:90%
down a little bit low--

00:48:03.081 --> 00:48:03.881 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:48:03.881 --> 00:48:04.916 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: -- because I wiggle--

00:48:04.916 --> 00:48:06.017 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: You're little
and you're short.

00:48:06.017 --> 00:48:06.884 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: I'm short and
I wiggle around a lot.

00:48:06.884 --> 00:48:09.587 align:middle line:90%
So that was the speculation.

00:48:09.587 --> 00:48:14.392 align:middle line:84%
I was actually pronounced
dead and I wasn't.

00:48:14.392 --> 00:48:16.294 align:middle line:84%
My agreement with
the off planets was

00:48:16.294 --> 00:48:18.262 align:middle line:90%
that if they send me back

00:48:18.262 --> 00:48:20.698 align:middle line:84%
that we had a meeting
and it was necessary.

00:48:20.698 --> 00:48:23.968 align:middle line:84%
Because to bring
systems up to speed,

00:48:23.968 --> 00:48:27.739 align:middle line:84%
we didn't have the time,
so it was necessary.

00:48:27.739 --> 00:48:29.774 align:middle line:90%
This is my story.

00:48:29.774 --> 00:48:34.312 align:middle line:84%
So I agreed to come back if
everything would be in place

00:48:34.312 --> 00:48:36.547 align:middle line:84%
and I could actually
see it happening.

00:48:36.547 --> 00:48:38.816 align:middle line:84%
They told me-- the only
thing I remembered originally

00:48:38.816 --> 00:48:42.453 align:middle line:84%
from the trip was that it would
take me three years to recover

00:48:42.453 --> 00:48:44.555 align:middle line:84%
and I would begin
on the fourth year,

00:48:44.555 --> 00:48:46.290 align:middle line:90%
which turned out to be 2012.

00:48:46.290 --> 00:48:47.358 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:48:47.358 --> 00:48:49.727 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: And that's
precisely what happened.

00:48:49.727 --> 00:48:50.995 align:middle line:90%
It took a full three years.

00:48:50.995 --> 00:48:54.966 align:middle line:84%
I did a few assignments in
between but mostly it was

00:48:54.966 --> 00:48:59.437 align:middle line:84%
that physical regeneration
because it was bad.

00:48:59.437 --> 00:49:02.373 align:middle line:84%
My requirement for
leaving the hospice,

00:49:02.373 --> 00:49:05.309 align:middle line:84%
they wouldn't let me leave
unless I agreed to have an MRI.

00:49:05.309 --> 00:49:08.179 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to find
out what this was.

00:49:08.179 --> 00:49:08.813 align:middle line:90%
They tried.

00:49:08.813 --> 00:49:10.214 align:middle line:90%
They tried an MRI.

00:49:10.214 --> 00:49:11.149 align:middle line:90%
They tried everything.

00:49:11.149 --> 00:49:12.517 align:middle line:90%
They knew something had happened

00:49:12.517 --> 00:49:14.819 align:middle line:84%
but they could not
find the source of it

00:49:14.819 --> 00:49:16.921 align:middle line:84%
because they had already
taking care of the source

00:49:16.921 --> 00:49:19.624 align:middle line:84%
and all I needed to
do now was to rest

00:49:19.624 --> 00:49:23.161 align:middle line:84%
to clear the system
of the debris.

00:49:23.161 --> 00:49:29.400 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So why is it that
the-- those other factions,

00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:33.504 align:middle line:84%
on and off planet, operating on
the extreme, more negative end,

00:49:33.504 --> 00:49:35.940 align:middle line:84%
would not want to-- I mean it's
kind of redundant question,

00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:37.308 align:middle line:84%
but just so you can
summarize this.

00:49:37.308 --> 00:49:38.509 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: It's about control.

00:49:38.509 --> 00:49:41.746 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Would not want this
technology widespread.

00:49:41.746 --> 00:49:46.017 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: We're much more useful
when we are controlled.

00:49:46.017 --> 00:49:48.886 align:middle line:84%
We don't create as
much backlash.

00:49:48.886 --> 00:49:52.056 align:middle line:84%
We allow whatever and we
fit more into the programs

00:49:52.056 --> 00:49:55.827 align:middle line:84%
that they have for
gathering fund.

00:49:55.827 --> 00:49:57.195 align:middle line:90%
I mean we have the money.

00:49:57.195 --> 00:50:00.498 align:middle line:90%
You know, we are not the few.

00:50:00.498 --> 00:50:03.067 align:middle line:84%
We are the many and
that's the part that seems

00:50:03.067 --> 00:50:06.604 align:middle line:84%
to just not register
with people that we are--

00:50:06.604 --> 00:50:12.376 align:middle line:84%
we have more power in our
collaboration than the few have

00:50:12.376 --> 00:50:13.711 align:middle line:90%
and everything they have.

00:50:13.711 --> 00:50:14.979 align:middle line:90%
Yes, they control the money.

00:50:14.979 --> 00:50:17.815 align:middle line:84%
They control the money
because we allow it.

00:50:17.815 --> 00:50:20.885 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: But they don't control
this and the thing is--

00:50:20.885 --> 00:50:22.253 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: No.

00:50:22.253 --> 00:50:23.287 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: -- there is a part of
this, when you were telling me

00:50:23.287 --> 00:50:25.323 align:middle line:90%
about it, I just love.

00:50:25.323 --> 00:50:27.925 align:middle line:90%
This Triad frequency, this wave,

00:50:27.925 --> 00:50:32.697 align:middle line:84%
this Triad Wave that's been
created, is the native signature

00:50:32.697 --> 00:50:36.667 align:middle line:84%
of that quiet chamber in the
heart that Gary Zukav, many,

00:50:36.667 --> 00:50:37.902 align:middle line:90%
many others have called this--

00:50:37.902 --> 00:50:38.703 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Everyone talks about.

00:50:38.703 --> 00:50:39.937 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: -- Seat of the Soul,

00:50:39.937 --> 00:50:44.075 align:middle line:84%
and when that portion
departs we cease to breath.

00:50:44.075 --> 00:50:46.677 align:middle line:90%
We cease to exist biologically.

00:50:46.677 --> 00:50:52.416 align:middle line:84%
That is the frequency that
your Triad Wave is reproducing

00:50:52.416 --> 00:50:53.451 align:middle line:90%
and broadcasting.

00:50:53.451 --> 00:50:54.919 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: What we're
doing within every--

00:50:54.919 --> 00:50:57.588 align:middle line:84%
because each of us has
a specific signature

00:50:57.588 --> 00:51:02.426 align:middle line:84%
and a specific encoding,
because the Triad Wave works

00:51:02.426 --> 00:51:06.397 align:middle line:84%
in all frequencies, harmonics,
overtones and undertones,

00:51:06.397 --> 00:51:12.203 align:middle line:84%
it is able by coming in your
field of existence to trigger

00:51:12.203 --> 00:51:15.806 align:middle line:84%
that encoding within you
to say, "Knock, knock,

00:51:15.806 --> 00:51:17.041 align:middle line:90%
would you like to wake up?"

00:51:17.041 --> 00:51:18.176 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:51:18.176 --> 00:51:19.710 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: If you do, here
are your training wheels

00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:22.480 align:middle line:84%
until you actually
bring this fully online.

00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:23.981 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: It's so phenomenal.

00:51:23.981 --> 00:51:25.049 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: That's all it is.

00:51:25.049 --> 00:51:26.551 align:middle line:90%
It's not to be all, do all.

00:51:26.551 --> 00:51:29.587 align:middle line:84%
It will not cure disease
unless you participate.

00:51:29.587 --> 00:51:31.489 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: It's still-- it
requires your choices

00:51:31.489 --> 00:51:32.757 align:middle line:90%
and your consciousness.

00:51:32.757 --> 00:51:35.393 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: Your choices, your
full active participation.

00:51:35.393 --> 00:51:37.361 align:middle line:84%
But we have the capability
of doing

00:51:37.361 --> 00:51:39.463 align:middle line:84%
that with some very
simple little experientials

00:51:39.463 --> 00:51:41.899 align:middle line:84%
that we work with and
that are part of the--

00:51:41.899 --> 00:51:44.702 align:middle line:84%
what I refer to as
the API protocol.

00:51:44.702 --> 00:51:49.073 align:middle line:84%
And API is simply awareness,
presence and intent.

00:51:49.073 --> 00:51:50.107 align:middle line:90%
It's a computer language.

00:51:50.107 --> 00:51:51.342 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:51:51.342 --> 00:51:52.577 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: However, we're
working with it differently,

00:51:52.577 --> 00:51:56.013 align:middle line:84%
because we're talking about
the empirical awareness

00:51:56.013 --> 00:51:59.317 align:middle line:84%
that our physical form
was designed to move in.

00:51:59.317 --> 00:52:02.153 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about our
full presence being fully

00:52:02.153 --> 00:52:05.990 align:middle line:84%
and completely aware of
ourselves as a divine being

00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:07.892 align:middle line:84%
as well as a human on
the planet, share--

00:52:07.892 --> 00:52:09.026 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Without interference.

00:52:09.026 --> 00:52:10.194 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Without interference.

00:52:10.194 --> 00:52:11.529 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:52:11.529 --> 00:52:14.031 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: So that when we set
our intent to move information

00:52:14.031 --> 00:52:17.735 align:middle line:84%
out to another or move into
another field with someone else,

00:52:17.735 --> 00:52:21.772 align:middle line:84%
the intent is pure, it
carries no anomalies.

00:52:21.772 --> 00:52:25.209 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: How can people
start-- now, by this time,

00:52:25.209 --> 00:52:27.144 align:middle line:90%
people are watching are saying,

00:52:27.144 --> 00:52:28.880 align:middle line:84%
"But how do we have
access to this?"

00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:29.714 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: How do we play with this?

00:52:29.714 --> 00:52:30.848 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: "How do we play with it?"

00:52:30.848 --> 00:52:32.216 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: We had many ways
that they can do that.

00:52:32.216 --> 00:52:33.618 align:middle line:84%
And if they'll go
on the website,

00:52:33.618 --> 00:52:35.853 align:middle line:90%
we have it embedded under music.

00:52:35.853 --> 00:52:37.388 align:middle line:90%
We work with groups.

00:52:37.388 --> 00:52:39.957 align:middle line:84%
We do group calls that
we actually teach.

00:52:39.957 --> 00:52:42.760 align:middle line:84%
If they'll go to the part on the
website, this is Conversations

00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:45.396 align:middle line:84%
with Brenda, then
they can see what it's

00:52:45.396 --> 00:52:47.465 align:middle line:84%
in my toolbox, that's
what we do.

00:52:47.465 --> 00:52:50.568 align:middle line:84%
The API protocol actually
moves out in group calls.

00:52:50.568 --> 00:52:52.870 align:middle line:84%
It actually can go
into any environment,

00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:55.239 align:middle line:84%
because we're working
first with human beings.

00:52:55.239 --> 00:52:58.342 align:middle line:84%
Then the human being
begins to set the field

00:52:58.342 --> 00:52:59.677 align:middle line:84%
for the environment
that they're in.

00:52:59.677 --> 00:53:02.213 align:middle line:84%
So all of that takes
place off of the website.

00:53:02.213 --> 00:53:04.415 align:middle line:90%
We have applications to do that.

00:53:04.415 --> 00:53:07.585 align:middle line:84%
The people that actually have
the music now have embedded the

00:53:07.585 --> 00:53:08.986 align:middle line:90%
Triad Wave in their music.

00:53:08.986 --> 00:53:12.590 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And this is going to be
huge because you're giving it

00:53:12.590 --> 00:53:14.659 align:middle line:90%
to the world to utilize.

00:53:14.659 --> 00:53:16.794 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: This is what
we're here to do.

00:53:16.794 --> 00:53:18.763 align:middle line:84%
You know, we are--
it was a gift.

00:53:18.763 --> 00:53:20.164 align:middle line:90%
It was gift.

00:53:20.164 --> 00:53:22.667 align:middle line:84%
And it's here, as I said, for
the-- it's a training wheels.

00:53:22.667 --> 00:53:23.534 align:middle line:90%
It's the training wheels.

00:53:23.534 --> 00:53:24.802 align:middle line:90%
It's a support mechanism

00:53:24.802 --> 00:53:26.804 align:middle line:84%
for every application
that [inaudible].

00:53:26.804 --> 00:53:30.041 align:middle line:84%
If you have a program,
the music that's done

00:53:30.041 --> 00:53:34.679 align:middle line:84%
by Steve Skudler actually
in Fort Collins, his share

00:53:34.679 --> 00:53:36.147 align:middle line:90%
and works with healing touch.

00:53:36.147 --> 00:53:37.415 align:middle line:84%
He's a healing touch
practitioner

00:53:37.415 --> 00:53:38.983 align:middle line:90%
as well as an instructor.

00:53:38.983 --> 00:53:42.353 align:middle line:84%
So when he and I got together
embedded the first music

00:53:42.353 --> 00:53:45.690 align:middle line:84%
with the wave, we worked with
it for three years with her

00:53:45.690 --> 00:53:48.125 align:middle line:84%
and with my applications
before we ever released it.

00:53:48.125 --> 00:53:49.927 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Were you seeing
outstanding results?

00:53:49.927 --> 00:53:51.195 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Yes.

00:53:51.195 --> 00:53:54.231 align:middle line:84%
And he now has two CDs
available off of his website,

00:53:54.231 --> 00:53:55.766 align:middle line:90%
Twin Flames Production.

00:53:55.766 --> 00:53:57.101 align:middle line:90%
All of this is on the website.

00:53:57.101 --> 00:53:58.636 align:middle line:84%
So if they go there,
they can see--

00:53:58.636 --> 00:54:01.372 align:middle line:84%
we refer to that as
licensing partners.

00:54:01.372 --> 00:54:04.175 align:middle line:84%
I do license the wave, if
they're going to put it

00:54:04.175 --> 00:54:05.710 align:middle line:90%
in a large production.

00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:07.011 align:middle line:90%
We work with that.

00:54:07.011 --> 00:54:08.179 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens with
that is that there are a lot

00:54:08.179 --> 00:54:10.181 align:middle line:84%
of people who don't
have funding.

00:54:10.181 --> 00:54:13.217 align:middle line:84%
So if you have funding,
we'll take funding for it

00:54:13.217 --> 00:54:15.820 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll apply it
into those who don't,

00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:18.522 align:middle line:84%
because it's important
now for it to be embedded

00:54:18.522 --> 00:54:21.492 align:middle line:84%
so that the population can
have access to this now

00:54:21.492 --> 00:54:23.894 align:middle line:84%
and begin their process
of coming online.

00:54:23.894 --> 00:54:25.796 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: It can go under
music, soundtracks.

00:54:25.796 --> 00:54:26.998 align:middle line:84%
It can go under anything,
really?

00:54:26.998 --> 00:54:28.366 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: You're having
a live event.

00:54:28.366 --> 00:54:30.801 align:middle line:84%
It's perfect if you're
in a board meeting.

00:54:30.801 --> 00:54:33.604 align:middle line:84%
It's incredible because
remember it's infrasound.

00:54:33.604 --> 00:54:35.806 align:middle line:84%
So you can turn the
volume all the way down

00:54:35.806 --> 00:54:38.743 align:middle line:84%
and all you're getting then
is the frequency's modulation

00:54:38.743 --> 00:54:42.213 align:middle line:84%
itself which brings everyone
to the table together.

00:54:42.213 --> 00:54:45.649 align:middle line:84%
It quiets the environment and
allows the highest potential

00:54:45.649 --> 00:54:48.018 align:middle line:84%
to take place, because
the physiology is no

00:54:48.018 --> 00:54:49.854 align:middle line:90%
longer resisting.

00:54:49.854 --> 00:54:52.823 align:middle line:84%
You're using that
higher intelligence

00:54:52.823 --> 00:54:55.192 align:middle line:84%
and your divine compassion
from the heart.

00:54:55.192 --> 00:54:59.463 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And it is, as you
say, essentially enmeshing it

00:54:59.463 --> 00:55:01.699 align:middle line:84%
within taking out the
interfering frequency.

00:55:01.699 --> 00:55:03.033 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Interference, yes.

00:55:03.033 --> 00:55:04.435 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: So beautiful.

00:55:04.435 --> 00:55:06.337 align:middle line:84%
I mean I'm just so happy to be
sitting here with you and here

00:55:06.337 --> 00:55:09.073 align:middle line:84%
to have heard the
genesis of this story.

00:55:09.073 --> 00:55:11.275 align:middle line:84%
And there's more to it
because there are children.

00:55:11.275 --> 00:55:13.577 align:middle line:84%
And you're teaching something
because again this goes

00:55:13.577 --> 00:55:14.745 align:middle line:90%
through the sensory process--

00:55:14.745 --> 00:55:15.846 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Right.

00:55:15.846 --> 00:55:16.680 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: -- including,
as you say, the skin,

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:17.681 align:middle line:90%
the largest organ in the body.

00:55:17.681 --> 00:55:18.816 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: Largest organ
on the body.

00:55:18.816 --> 00:55:20.851 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And what are you
teaching the children?

00:55:20.851 --> 00:55:23.387 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: Well, with the children--
we do everyone the same,

00:55:23.387 --> 00:55:25.890 align:middle line:84%
actually, because the
process is very simple.

00:55:25.890 --> 00:55:27.525 align:middle line:84%
We have what's known
as a reset breath

00:55:27.525 --> 00:55:29.960 align:middle line:84%
and we have something
known as quiet touch.

00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:34.598 align:middle line:84%
The reset breath is simply
a way to signal your body,

00:55:34.598 --> 00:55:38.702 align:middle line:84%
your brain that you're going
to change what you're doing.

00:55:38.702 --> 00:55:40.337 align:middle line:90%
So how would you do that?

00:55:40.337 --> 00:55:42.206 align:middle line:84%
Well we're used to
breathing in and out,

00:55:42.206 --> 00:55:43.407 align:middle line:90%
that's our normal pattern.

00:55:43.407 --> 00:55:45.109 align:middle line:84%
Well to break that pattern,
you're going breathe

00:55:45.109 --> 00:55:47.511 align:middle line:90%
out first without that inhale.

00:55:47.511 --> 00:55:49.213 align:middle line:90%
So it just stops you.

00:55:49.213 --> 00:55:50.347 align:middle line:90%
It's a pause.

00:55:50.347 --> 00:55:52.416 align:middle line:84%
It's simply a pause,
very simple.

00:55:52.416 --> 00:55:55.252 align:middle line:84%
You do it one time,
the body begins to,

00:55:55.252 --> 00:55:56.987 align:middle line:90%
"Oh, that's what it is."

00:55:56.987 --> 00:56:00.758 align:middle line:84%
The quiet touch is
simply a hand position

00:56:00.758 --> 00:56:03.761 align:middle line:84%
that positions your left
hand over your heart.

00:56:03.761 --> 00:56:07.431 align:middle line:84%
What you're doing is creating
an electromagnetic loop,

00:56:07.431 --> 00:56:10.701 align:middle line:84%
an electromagnetic loop
that puts you right in touch

00:56:10.701 --> 00:56:13.204 align:middle line:84%
with that spark that's
within your heart.

00:56:13.204 --> 00:56:14.338 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: That's seems-- yes.

00:56:14.338 --> 00:56:15.973 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: And you feel
it when it happens.

00:56:15.973 --> 00:56:17.074 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:56:17.074 --> 00:56:19.376 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: You feel the
feel, the body responds.

00:56:19.376 --> 00:56:22.480 align:middle line:84%
We're doing it with cardiac
rehab patients back in the '90s.

00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:25.883 align:middle line:84%
You know, doing it in school
[inaudible] school systems,

00:56:25.883 --> 00:56:27.117 align:middle line:90%
elementary schools.

00:56:27.117 --> 00:56:28.853 align:middle line:84%
And they would make the
announcements everyday.

00:56:28.853 --> 00:56:31.789 align:middle line:84%
And part of the announcement
would be what we refer

00:56:31.789 --> 00:56:33.123 align:middle line:90%
to is RBQT.

00:56:33.123 --> 00:56:35.926 align:middle line:84%
They would do RBQT, because
I didn't have the sequencing

00:56:35.926 --> 00:56:39.363 align:middle line:84%
of the waves back in 1996 when
we were doing all of this.

00:56:39.363 --> 00:56:42.967 align:middle line:84%
We were having to hand--
you know, be body doing it.

00:56:42.967 --> 00:56:44.535 align:middle line:90%
Now we have assistance.

00:56:44.535 --> 00:56:46.036 align:middle line:84%
But those still are
the components.

00:56:46.036 --> 00:56:49.073 align:middle line:84%
The third component is becoming
familiar with what we refer

00:56:49.073 --> 00:56:53.077 align:middle line:84%
to is your 18-inch field of
existence which is that tube

00:56:53.077 --> 00:56:55.679 align:middle line:84%
of your own personal
field of existence.

00:56:55.679 --> 00:56:57.982 align:middle line:90%
How we work with that.

00:56:57.982 --> 00:57:00.985 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And you're looking for
people that will take this on

00:57:00.985 --> 00:57:03.320 align:middle line:90%
and become instructors in this.

00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:04.154 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Absolutely.

00:57:04.154 --> 00:57:05.556 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: And help with children--

00:57:05.556 --> 00:57:08.359 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: We need 100 bodies by the
end of the year for a project

00:57:08.359 --> 00:57:11.028 align:middle line:84%
that we're working with
called Bridge Global.

00:57:11.028 --> 00:57:14.265 align:middle line:84%
Bridge Global will be taking
this concept around the world.

00:57:14.265 --> 00:57:16.734 align:middle line:84%
They'll particularly be
working in third world countries

00:57:16.734 --> 00:57:18.702 align:middle line:90%
and underprivileged areas.

00:57:18.702 --> 00:57:21.305 align:middle line:84%
So that's the component
that we're working with.

00:57:21.305 --> 00:57:25.743 align:middle line:84%
And to meet their requirement,
I need 100 bodies that we can--

00:57:25.743 --> 00:57:29.113 align:middle line:84%
you know, we can start to work
within their project as well

00:57:29.113 --> 00:57:30.481 align:middle line:84%
as some others that
are going on.

00:57:30.481 --> 00:57:33.017 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And another thing is
that it's not as though you have

00:57:33.017 --> 00:57:36.220 align:middle line:84%
to be some brilliantly
lit up psychic to do this.

00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:37.021 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Please don't.

00:57:37.021 --> 00:57:38.289 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: The thing you don't.

00:57:38.289 --> 00:57:41.025 align:middle line:84%
It's-- in fact, you're saying
that-- the more we have,

00:57:41.025 --> 00:57:42.026 align:middle line:90%
the more complex our thinking--

00:57:42.026 --> 00:57:43.027 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: This is from others.

00:57:43.027 --> 00:57:44.428 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: This is for anyone.

00:57:44.428 --> 00:57:45.529 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: If you're breathing.

00:57:45.529 --> 00:57:46.630 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: If you're breathing.

00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:47.965 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: Anyone can share
this and we've done

00:57:47.965 --> 00:57:49.133 align:middle line:90%
that through the group calls.

00:57:49.133 --> 00:57:50.601 align:middle line:84%
We've done that in
school systems.

00:57:50.601 --> 00:57:53.537 align:middle line:84%
We could train cafeteria
people because they're--

00:57:53.537 --> 00:57:56.106 align:middle line:84%
bus drivers, that was the most
fun, with the bus drivers,

00:57:56.106 --> 00:57:59.643 align:middle line:84%
because they're coming and
going, "You want me to do what?"

00:57:59.643 --> 00:58:02.479 align:middle line:84%
And once they understood
how their--

00:58:02.479 --> 00:58:06.250 align:middle line:84%
how the vibration from their
field affects, because remember

00:58:06.250 --> 00:58:08.786 align:middle line:84%
if thoughts, words and actions
are in resonance, then we're--

00:58:08.786 --> 00:58:11.989 align:middle line:84%
you know, we're not
disturbing the field.

00:58:11.989 --> 00:58:15.492 align:middle line:84%
We can think that we're
saying, "Well I'm going to smile

00:58:15.492 --> 00:58:18.195 align:middle line:90%
when he comes on the bus today."

00:58:18.195 --> 00:58:19.897 align:middle line:84%
And you're greeting
him, "Hello Johnny,"

00:58:19.897 --> 00:58:20.965 align:middle line:90%
when he gets on the bus.

00:58:20.965 --> 00:58:23.267 align:middle line:84%
But what the bus
driver was thinking was,

00:58:23.267 --> 00:58:26.370 align:middle line:84%
"I think you better go sit
down in your sit quietly,

00:58:26.370 --> 00:58:28.172 align:middle line:84%
if you make-- we're going
to the office today.

00:58:28.172 --> 00:58:30.240 align:middle line:84%
I know we're going
to the office today".

00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:33.344 align:middle line:84%
Once they realize that the
little boy was picking up--

00:58:33.344 --> 00:58:34.745 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes, yes.

00:58:34.745 --> 00:58:36.880 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: -- what he was thinking
because thought is vibration.

00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:39.750 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So all of us are
basically easy to work

00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:40.351 align:middle line:90%
with children [inaudible].

00:58:40.351 --> 00:58:41.752 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Everyone.

00:58:41.752 --> 00:58:43.988 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And you're making this
frequency available everywhere.

00:58:43.988 --> 00:58:45.389 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Everywhere.

00:58:45.389 --> 00:58:46.724 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Every kind of producer
around the planet can put this

00:58:46.724 --> 00:58:48.058 align:middle line:90%
and embed it in what they do.

00:58:48.058 --> 00:58:49.126 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Embed in anything.

00:58:49.126 --> 00:58:50.628 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Just speak to
our hearts directly.

00:58:50.628 --> 00:58:53.297 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, it's a very
positive message, of course.

00:58:53.297 --> 00:58:54.431 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:58:54.431 --> 00:58:55.566 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: Well, you know,
the interesting this is,

00:58:55.566 --> 00:58:58.235 align:middle line:84%
if it isn't, then what
happens to the receiver

00:58:58.235 --> 00:59:00.571 align:middle line:84%
when they receive it is they'll
make a different choice the

00:59:00.571 --> 00:59:01.639 align:middle line:90%
next time.

00:59:01.639 --> 00:59:02.573 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Very good.

00:59:02.573 --> 00:59:03.607 align:middle line:90%
OK, now we only have--

00:59:03.607 --> 00:59:04.742 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: So we don't stop people.

00:59:04.742 --> 00:59:07.511 align:middle line:84%
We have to reach these
elements where they are.

00:59:07.511 --> 00:59:08.812 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Exactly.

00:59:08.812 --> 00:59:09.880 align:middle line:84%
>> BW: We're not going to
change every school system.

00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:12.416 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
change every broadcast.

00:59:12.416 --> 00:59:16.820 align:middle line:84%
However, if we can bring
it to a plate, embedded it,

00:59:16.820 --> 00:59:18.856 align:middle line:84%
and get it to a place
that the receiver,

00:59:18.856 --> 00:59:22.526 align:middle line:84%
the person who is watching
and listening has the choice

00:59:22.526 --> 00:59:26.230 align:middle line:84%
to decided whether they want
to partake of it or not,

00:59:26.230 --> 00:59:30.067 align:middle line:84%
then we stop feeding
the monster.

00:59:30.067 --> 00:59:32.503 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: On that note, I
hardly don't know what

00:59:32.503 --> 00:59:33.837 align:middle line:90%
to say except thank you.

00:59:33.837 --> 00:59:35.039 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Thank you.

00:59:35.039 --> 00:59:36.440 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And I hope we're
together again doing this

00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:37.574 align:middle line:90%
as it progresses.

00:59:37.574 --> 00:59:38.275 align:middle line:90%
>> BW: Thank you.

00:59:38.275 --> 00:59:39.376 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:59:39.376 --> 00:59:40.844 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: If you're
interested in participating

00:59:40.844 --> 00:59:42.913 align:middle line:84%
in this profound project
you can reach Brenda

00:59:42.913 --> 00:59:46.884 align:middle line:84%
at earthproject777.com and she
is so correct that it needs

00:59:46.884 --> 00:59:48.452 align:middle line:90%
to be introduced to the kids.

00:59:48.452 --> 00:59:50.220 align:middle line:84%
They don't have the
programming adults have.

00:59:50.220 --> 00:59:52.156 align:middle line:90%
And even so, most people

00:59:52.156 --> 00:59:54.692 align:middle line:84%
who haven't been overly
programmed are certainly going

00:59:54.692 --> 00:59:57.828 align:middle line:84%
to be affected by this
in a positive way.

00:59:57.828 --> 01:00:02.332 align:middle line:84%
