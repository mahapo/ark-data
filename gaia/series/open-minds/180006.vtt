>>REGINA MEREDITH: Many of
you have seen David Icke and I

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.930 align:middle line:10%
in several previous
conversations,

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.464 align:middle line:10%
but this one today is perhaps
the most comprehensive of all.

00:00:28.464 --> 00:00:30.380 align:middle line:84%
We're going to dive into
the actual definition

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.960 align:middle line:84%
of the Archontic
Realm, and then break

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.950 align:middle line:84%
free solutions that deliver us
back to our own loving nature.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.320 align:middle line:84%
Without further ado,
let's welcome David Icke.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.050 align:middle line:84%
David, it's so good
to see you again.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:41.620 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID ICKE: Thank you.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Haven't seen you
in the flesh in a few years.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.700 align:middle line:90%
>>ICKE: No.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I
have to say, you're

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.610 align:middle line:84%
looking rosier,
healthier, and happier

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:47.750 align:middle line:90%
than I have ever seen you.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:48.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ICKE: Yeah, I feel good.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm growing younger.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.435 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
growing younger.

00:00:51.435 --> 00:00:54.657 align:middle line:10%
>>ICKE: Yeah, this growing
old stuff, I'll give it up.

00:00:54.657 --> 00:00:55.740 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: It doesn't work.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:56.906 align:middle line:10%
>>ICKE: No, it doesn't work.

00:00:56.906 --> 00:00:57.740 align:middle line:90%
It's not good.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.150 align:middle line:84%
Too many things start
to hurt, and I've

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.530 align:middle line:84%
decided they're not
going to hurt anymore.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it's
crazy, because you

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.900 align:middle line:90%
used to be in a lot of pain.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.430 align:middle line:90%
And you've been on a major tour.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.769 align:middle line:90%
Like, the last month.

00:01:05.769 --> 00:01:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And-- because we'll be talking
about this in a moment--

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.010 align:middle line:84%
because in your understanding
of it, this is all an illusion.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.630 align:middle line:84%
And if this is an
illusion, then we

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.370 align:middle line:84%
can create it any
way we want, and you

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.380 align:middle line:90%
have chosen to age backwards.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.210 align:middle line:90%
>>ICKE: Well, yeah.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:28.550 align:middle line:10%
The thing is that if you start
from the point that the mind

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.610 align:middle line:10%
consciousness--

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.990 align:middle line:10%
let me just make a
definition there.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.240 align:middle line:84%
What I call mind is that
which interacts and perceives

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.640 align:middle line:84%
the world of the
so-called five senses.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.160 align:middle line:84%
I say consciousness, the
real eye is beyond that.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:50.150 align:middle line:84%
But whether it's consciousness
or mind, that is dictating

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.880 align:middle line:90%
the reality it's experiencing.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.650 align:middle line:90%
So I've got one word for you.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:56.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah?

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.840 align:middle line:90%
>>ICKE: Placebo.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Placebo.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.850 align:middle line:90%
Love the word placebo.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:00.650 align:middle line:90%
>>ICKE: Placebo.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:01.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.920 align:middle line:84%
Because you know,
I studied Japanese.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.540 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.570 align:middle line:90%
Placebo.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.910 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:13.500 align:middle line:84%
That is when two groups of
people are in a medical study.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.930 align:middle line:90%
One is given the, quote, "drug."

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.000 align:middle line:90%
The other one is not.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.070 align:middle line:84%
And when you study these,
you study these studies,

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:27.740 align:middle line:84%
you find that often, the people
on the placebo get the effect.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:34.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I read a study once of
a trial in which half the people

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.743 align:middle line:84%
were given LSD and half the
people were given a placebo.

00:02:37.743 --> 00:02:41.210 align:middle line:84%
It was a sugar
pill or something.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.830 align:middle line:84%
And people on the placebo sugar
pill went out on the trip,

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.070 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:53.450 align:middle line:84%
I've read studies where they did
control groups for hair growth

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.450 align:middle line:84%
drugs, and some of the
people on the placebo

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.870 align:middle line:90%
started growing hair.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.220 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: Now this is
the power of the mind,

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.950 align:middle line:84%
which people also call belief,
to impact upon reality.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.480 align:middle line:84%
Now if you bring this
back to human society,

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.150 align:middle line:84%
if you can program someone's
perception from cradle

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.950 align:middle line:90%
to grave--

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.090 align:middle line:84%
and what we call a human life
is just a programming download

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.560 align:middle line:84%
from cradle to grave, from
coming out of the womb

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.930 align:middle line:84%
and into the perceptual
influence of the parents who've

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.390 align:middle line:84%
been through the process
you're about to go through.

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.880 align:middle line:84%
You then go to school
at the earliest age now.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.470 align:middle line:84%
You know, three,
four years of age.

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And you are then given,
throughout your formative years

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.410 align:middle line:84%
right into your teenage
years, the version of reality,

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.200 align:middle line:84%
history, what's right, what's
wrong, what's possible,

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.200 align:middle line:84%
what's impossible,
nature of everything

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.810 align:middle line:84%
from representatives
of the state called

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.640 align:middle line:90%
teachers and academics.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.160 align:middle line:84%
All around you are
other people that

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.470 align:middle line:84%
have been through
the same program who

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.540 align:middle line:84%
are confirming to you that
what you've downloaded is true.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.750 align:middle line:84%
You then go out into the
institutions of work,

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.690 align:middle line:84%
of politics like across the
road from where we are now,

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.290 align:middle line:90%
Houses of Parliament.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.260 align:middle line:84%
You go into medicine,
you go into science,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.010 align:middle line:84%
you go into journalism, you go
into all these institutions.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And you meet people who went
through the process you've just

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.640 align:middle line:90%
done ahead of you.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And they all downloaded
the same program,

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.525 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, they
are confirming to you

00:04:30.525 --> 00:04:35.480 align:middle line:84%
and you're confirming to them
that the program is real.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.600 align:middle line:84%
You've got the media 24/7
telling you the program

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.280 align:middle line:90%
is real.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And from therefore, cradle
to grave, you are downloading

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.200 align:middle line:84%
and having constantly
confirmed a version of reality

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.880 align:middle line:84%
that I call the postage
stamp consensus.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.060 align:middle line:84%
Tiny, tiny little
band of possibility,

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.800 align:middle line:84%
including the
nature of who we are

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.720 align:middle line:84%
and the nature of the
reality we're experiencing.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And therefore,
what you are doing

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.260 align:middle line:84%
is programming perception
in the same way

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.620 align:middle line:84%
as believing the placebo
pill is real and will have

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.250 align:middle line:90%
the effect of the real drug.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:21.440 align:middle line:84%
Your mind then in that
perceptually programmed state

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.320 align:middle line:84%
will manifest the reality
that the program has dictated

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.127 align:middle line:90%
is real.

00:05:27.127 --> 00:05:28.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know
what's interesting,

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.920 align:middle line:84%
David, is when people
think of you they think,

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.230 align:middle line:84%
you know, David's all
about the conspiracy.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.750 align:middle line:84%
He's about, like, tearing
down the House of Lords,

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.970 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.650 align:middle line:84%
And the reality is while
you're trying to inform people

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.160 align:middle line:84%
how the program
happens, your passion

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.740 align:middle line:84%
is about alerting
people to the fact

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.440 align:middle line:84%
that this programmable
reality can

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.220 align:middle line:84%
be unprogrammed and reprogrammed
toward our own favor.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.750 align:middle line:90%
That's your passion.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.550 align:middle line:84%
That's why you like
talking so much

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.440 align:middle line:84%
about the nature
of reality and have

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.780 align:middle line:84%
throughout all of your
books all of these years.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.370 align:middle line:84%
Though what you're known for
is the conspiracy, right?

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.950 align:middle line:90%
And so let's talk about that.

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.340 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, go ahead and make
your comment first.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.890 align:middle line:90%
>>ICKE: They're seamless.

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:21.280 align:middle line:84%
People, even in the area
of alternative thought,

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:27.010 align:middle line:84%
see divisions between
things that aren't there.

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:31.930 align:middle line:84%
The world is as it is in
terms of manipulated wars,

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.700 align:middle line:84%
manipulated banking systems,
manipulated accumulation

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.010 align:middle line:84%
of vast wealth in
the hands of the few.

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And the rest can get on
with it without anything

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.790 align:middle line:84%
like the same number of
choices, the same ability

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:53.930 align:middle line:84%
to decide their life,
because of this program.

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And what you find
with this program

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:05.050 align:middle line:84%
is it infests every
perception with a simple--

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:09.040 align:middle line:84%
what I would call a
simple description.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.140 align:middle line:90%
Unquestioned belief.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.090 align:middle line:90%
That's what this program is.

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:14.440 align:middle line:90%
It's unquestioned belief.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:18.280 align:middle line:84%
So you download the program
and then you don't question it,

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.710 align:middle line:84%
and then you jump on anyone
that does question it,

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.030 align:middle line:84%
and put pressure on
them to conform as well

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:27.220 align:middle line:84%
for the crime of
being different.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.340 align:middle line:84%
And then you go on and
on with these things

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.140 align:middle line:84%
you won't question
until you come

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:37.010 align:middle line:84%
to you won't question the nature
of reality and what it is.

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:40.540 align:middle line:84%
You don't question the nature
of who you are as opposed

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:41.950 align:middle line:84%
to what you've
been told you are,

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:44.800 align:middle line:84%
which is basically
a list of labels.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:49.030 align:middle line:84%
I am an A, B, C. Man, woman,
black, white, transgender,

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:50.530 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And so this whole
so-called conspiracy

00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:02.680 align:middle line:84%
is all based on
manipulating and downloading

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:06.550 align:middle line:84%
a perception of
reality which plays out

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:10.040 align:middle line:90%
as a perception of everything.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.850 align:middle line:84%
So there are no
divisions between them.

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:14.290 align:middle line:84%
You know, they
get away with what

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:17.080 align:middle line:84%
they do in terms
of world events,

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.870 align:middle line:84%
because people don't question
what's really going on.

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And once you start questioning
the nature of reality,

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.870 align:middle line:84%
then everything else
starts to unravel.

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:34.850 align:middle line:84%
Because I find this when I
do talks around the world.

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:37.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing a series of
evening events at the moment,

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:43.030 align:middle line:84%
and I start out not talking
about the manipulated wars

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:49.470 align:middle line:84%
and banking systems and
the privilege of royalty,

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:51.460 align:middle line:90%
but about the nature of reality.

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:58.030 align:middle line:84%
Because you know, people think
that a few people controlling

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:03.570 align:middle line:84%
the world is kind of far out
and not possible, a bit weird.

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:08.170 align:middle line:84%
And then you say,
well, actually, we

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:16.290 align:middle line:84%
are currently
perceiving a tiny sliver

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:19.100 align:middle line:84%
of the electromagnetic
spectrum, which

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:23.730 align:middle line:84%
according to mainstream
science is 0.005% of what

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:27.080 align:middle line:90%
exists in the universe.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:30.350 align:middle line:90%
Say that light fell over.

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:34.500 align:middle line:84%
It will only make a
noise if we hear it,

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.290 align:middle line:84%
because when it falls
over, all it's doing

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:40.377 align:middle line:84%
is disturbing the
energetic field

00:09:40.377 --> 00:09:41.460 align:middle line:90%
and creating a vibration--

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:42.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Creating vibration.

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:42.950 align:middle line:90%
Yes, of course.

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:43.750 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:47.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: We only hear it
when the ears transfer

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:51.810 align:middle line:84%
that vibrational effect into
an electrical form, which they

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:53.670 align:middle line:84%
then communicate
to the brain, which

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:58.100 align:middle line:84%
then hears the sound of
the light falling over.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:04.490 align:middle line:84%
Now compared with that,
when we experience reality

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:08.315 align:middle line:84%
in a completely different
way of everything being solid

00:10:08.315 --> 00:10:10.610 align:middle line:84%
and we look out of our eyes
and we can see everything

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:14.240 align:middle line:84%
in the space we're looking
at, compared with that,

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.700 align:middle line:84%
a few people manipulating
wars, which can be shown

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:21.240 align:middle line:84%
to be provable fact, by the
way, and directing human society

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:25.370 align:middle line:84%
so that the power and control
goes into fewer and fewer hands

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:28.220 align:middle line:90%
every day is small deal.

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:35.066 align:middle line:84%
So this whole perceptual
program affects,

00:10:35.066 --> 00:10:39.780 align:middle line:84%
and in a negative sense,
infests all our perceptions.

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:41.340 align:middle line:90%
Thus, all our behavior.

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.510 align:middle line:90%
What does behavior come from?

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:46.550 align:middle line:84%
It comes from
perceptions of reality.

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:50.150 align:middle line:84%
What I will say now, what I
will do, what I will challenge,

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:54.410 align:middle line:84%
what I won't challenge,
what I'll not believe

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:56.240 align:middle line:84%
and what I will
believe is dictated

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.890 align:middle line:90%
by my perception of reality.

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:02.720 align:middle line:84%
So you control perception
of the population,

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.610 align:middle line:84%
and then you manipulate
them to insist

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:09.740 align:middle line:84%
that everybody else accepts
the same perception,

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:14.300 align:middle line:84%
or they get called ridiculed
or crazy or dangerous.

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And basically, you
control the world.

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:19.430 align:middle line:84%
So you know, I look at
the alternative media,

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:22.640 align:middle line:84%
and I see them about fighting
the enemy and stockpiling

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:28.100 align:middle line:84%
weapons and all these five
sense perceptions of how

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.440 align:middle line:84%
you deal with apparently,
though they're not,

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.400 align:middle line:90%
five sense problems.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And what I don't see
in the vast majority

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:41.720 align:middle line:84%
of the alternative
media is this balance

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:45.090 align:middle line:84%
of, A, exposing
the names, dates,

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:49.070 align:middle line:84%
places, world
events manipulation,

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:51.260 align:middle line:84%
but also connecting
it to the fact

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.720 align:middle line:84%
that it's only
possible because we

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:57.220 align:middle line:84%
have given our minds away,
our perceptions away.

00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:01.430 align:middle line:84%
The placebo is telling
us what to think.

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:04.190 align:middle line:84%
And by doing so,
we are collectively

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:07.660 align:middle line:84%
creating the world we think
someone else has created.

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:08.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:09.350 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:12.960 align:middle line:84%
So now we get down to the
real nuts and bolts of it.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.660 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
who you speak to.

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:18.590 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter even speaking
to lovely intuitive sources

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:19.670 align:middle line:90%
in the other world.

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:21.980 align:middle line:84%
I can say without
exception all of them

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:25.820 align:middle line:84%
have said even if they
don't choose to go into it,

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:28.610 align:middle line:84%
yes, there are forces
that are interfering

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:30.080 align:middle line:90%
with the people of your planet.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.510 align:middle line:90%
And that goes without exception.

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:34.510 align:middle line:84%
In every intuitive
source, every channel

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:36.800 align:middle line:84%
where we featured
on Gaia privately

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.800 align:middle line:84%
when I've spoken to them
said, they're being said, yes.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.480 align:middle line:90%
You are being interfered with.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.610 align:middle line:90%
Your job is to break that.

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:46.580 align:middle line:84%
So I think people have
a hard time accepting

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:49.685 align:middle line:84%
that this reality, this
bandwidth we're living in

00:12:49.685 --> 00:12:53.640 align:middle line:84%
on Earth is balanced between
the higher realms and the lower

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:54.440 align:middle line:90%
realms.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And by nature of higher
realms, you don't interfere.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.620 align:middle line:84%
You let people get on with
it and help if it's requested

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:01.970 align:middle line:90%
or if it's needed.

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:05.300 align:middle line:84%
The lower realms don't
have those same virtues

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:06.590 align:middle line:90%
that they live by.

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:09.410 align:middle line:84%
They're intrusive,
invasive, and usurious.

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:11.910 align:middle line:84%
And they're coming into
our reality all the time.

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:14.840 align:middle line:84%
So now I think it's a good time
to start explaining to people--

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.060 align:middle line:84%
and you did a beautiful job
of it in your new book--

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:21.710 align:middle line:84%
what the Archontic Realm,
as it's called, is.

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:27.290 align:middle line:84%
How these really lower
consciousness beings

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:28.730 align:middle line:90%
interface with our reality.

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:32.520 align:middle line:84%
They may be powerful, but
still lower consciousness.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:38.240 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: Well, to really get
it to its foundation level,

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:41.600 align:middle line:84%
in my view, my research
over, what, 30 years,

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.680 align:middle line:84%
you've got to get out
of the realm of form.

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:49.130 align:middle line:84%
Form is the place
where consciousness

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:54.290 align:middle line:84%
has a vehicle to experience
particular bands of frequency.

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:58.670 align:middle line:84%
This is why we have this
whole concept through the ages

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:00.860 align:middle line:90%
to present day of possession.

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:02.510 align:middle line:90%
What is possession?

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:05.210 align:middle line:84%
It's another
consciousness taking

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:09.890 align:middle line:84%
over the perceptual
processes of another form.

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:12.280 align:middle line:90%
This is what happens.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you know,
if you look at possession

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:19.400 align:middle line:84%
and its really extreme level
where people's faces are

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:23.390 align:middle line:84%
actually changing,
then what is happening

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:27.920 align:middle line:84%
is that the possessing
consciousness is impacting

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:31.550 align:middle line:84%
upon what I would say
is a holographic form

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:33.380 align:middle line:90%
of the possessed person.

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:36.560 align:middle line:84%
And thus, you've got, if
you like, an information

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:40.280 align:middle line:84%
field imposing itself on
another information field

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:43.040 align:middle line:84%
until the possessing
information field becomes

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:46.610 align:middle line:84%
so dominant that it starts
to affect the hologram,

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:48.740 align:middle line:84%
and the hologram
starts to shift.

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:51.200 align:middle line:90%
Any observer says, whoa.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.110 align:middle line:90%
A face is changing.

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:53.450 align:middle line:90%
I've seen it.

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:55.235 align:middle line:90%
It happens.

00:14:55.235 --> 00:14:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And so we get out
the realms of form,

00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:00.650 align:middle line:84%
we can see what
we're dealing with.

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:03.740 align:middle line:90%
We talk about balanced behavior.

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:06.560 align:middle line:84%
We talk about
psychopathic behavior.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:09.620 align:middle line:84%
And anyone will
appreciate immediately

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:11.490 align:middle line:90%
they are very different.

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:13.330 align:middle line:90%
So what is balanced behavior?

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:15.065 align:middle line:84%
It's a state of
balanced consciousness,

00:15:15.065 --> 00:15:20.000 align:middle line:84%
a state a balanced
awareness, a state of balance

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.150 align:middle line:84%
where you have little
things like empathy,

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:26.840 align:middle line:84%
where you can put yourself
in the feelings of others

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.660 align:middle line:84%
that you affect, which has
a massive impact on what

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:34.185 align:middle line:84%
you will and will not do,
because you have this--

00:15:34.185 --> 00:15:37.880 align:middle line:84%
if not awareness of what you're
doing, which is what empathy

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:41.060 align:middle line:84%
is, you have an emotional
consequence when

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:43.550 align:middle line:90%
you make other people suffer.

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:47.360 align:middle line:84%
That's balance, and that
creates a certain type of world.

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.890 align:middle line:84%
It creates a certain
type of society,

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:52.290 align:middle line:90%
a certain type of interaction.

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:58.160 align:middle line:84%
Then you've got the
psychopathic state of mind.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at something
called the hair test, named

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:05.420 align:middle line:84%
after the guy who came up with
it, of psychopathic traits,

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:10.010 align:middle line:84%
and what they say is if you've
got enough of these traits,

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:16.400 align:middle line:84%
you are deemed a psychopath, at
the top of them is no empathy.

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:21.320 align:middle line:84%
No ability to put yourself in
the feelings of those you make

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.120 align:middle line:90%
suffer.

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:25.090 align:middle line:84%
So one, you've got no
emotional consequence

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:26.560 align:middle line:90%
for whatever you do.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.210 align:middle line:90%
No shame is another one.

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:32.600 align:middle line:90%


00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:37.090 align:middle line:84%
No care about what you need
to do to get what you want.

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:39.800 align:middle line:84%
Anything goes to
get what you want.

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.310 align:middle line:90%
There are no limits.

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:45.160 align:middle line:90%
Another psychopathic trait.

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.750 align:middle line:84%
Parasiting off the
target, whether it's

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:50.900 align:middle line:90%
an individual or a population.

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:55.200 align:middle line:84%
A pathological liar is another
one of the psychopathic traits.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.420 align:middle line:90%
Now, OK.

00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:59.330 align:middle line:84%
Now think of the society
that would create,

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:02.240 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to the balanced
society with empathy and love

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.670 align:middle line:90%
and caring and integrity.

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:07.160 align:middle line:90%
Completely different society.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And what we are
doing in this reality

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:15.800 align:middle line:84%
is seeing the two
in the same reality.

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:22.130 align:middle line:84%
You see people of
the former state

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:25.790 align:middle line:84%
of beings' perception,
behavior, and then you

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:27.680 align:middle line:90%
see the psychopaths.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And what tends to happen--
and not by coincidence--

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:37.070 align:middle line:84%
is the psychopaths tend to
get into positions of power.

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:39.140 align:middle line:90%
And it's systematically done.

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:44.510 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the hierarchy
of power in the world,

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:47.540 align:middle line:84%
in any country,
you'll invariably

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:50.720 align:middle line:84%
find psychopaths
working all the way

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.550 align:middle line:84%
through the major
positions of power that

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:55.430 align:middle line:90%
are impacting upon society.

00:17:55.430 --> 00:18:01.700 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at ancient
writings and ancient legends

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:04.300 align:middle line:84%
and ancient accounts,
they all talk--

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.410 align:middle line:84%
and no matter what the
culture is, no matter where

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:10.490 align:middle line:84%
it is-- they all talk about
this manipulative force, which

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:11.780 align:middle line:90%
they give different names.

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:13.550 align:middle line:84%
And all the people,
the anthropologists

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:17.360 align:middle line:84%
and the historians
go around, and they

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:21.440 align:middle line:84%
seem to think that all these
different names for gods

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.330 align:middle line:84%
and manipulators and
the different cultures

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:25.190 align:middle line:84%
are all different
gods of manipulators.

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:26.210 align:middle line:90%
They're not.

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:28.850 align:middle line:84%
Just break down how they're
being described, for goodness

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:30.800 align:middle line:84%
sake, and you see
actually they're

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.020 align:middle line:84%
different names
for the same force.

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And this force of
manipulation falls

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:44.210 align:middle line:84%
straight into the category
of being psychopathic.

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:48.680 align:middle line:84%
So if you go beyond
the realms of form,

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:53.290 align:middle line:84%
you're dealing with different
states of consciousness.

00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:58.850 align:middle line:10%
And one of the names
given to this force

00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:05.240 align:middle line:10%
is Archons or Archontic, which
comes from the gnostic belief

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:08.760 align:middle line:10%
system, particularly
those out of Egypt,

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:12.830 align:middle line:10%
who left the Nag Hammadi
texts that were found in Egypt

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:15.290 align:middle line:10%
in 1945 in an earthen jar.

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:21.830 align:middle line:10%
And these were, it seems,
hidden around 400 AD, which

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:25.730 align:middle line:10%
would kind of sink
with the destruction

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:27.534 align:middle line:10%
of the great library
of Alexandria,

00:19:27.534 --> 00:19:28.700 align:middle line:10%
which was basically run by--

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.320 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And the
rise of Constantine

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:31.400 align:middle line:10%
and the Catholic church.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:32.774 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: Yeah, the
Catholic church

00:19:32.774 --> 00:19:35.934 align:middle line:84%
destroyed anything that
challenged the Catholic church.

00:19:35.934 --> 00:19:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, they
targeted the great library

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:40.940 align:middle line:84%
of Alexandria,
which was basically

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:45.620 align:middle line:84%
run by gnostic thinkers
who had a much more

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:47.690 align:middle line:90%
open mind to everything.

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And in these Nag Hammadi
texts, about a fifth of them

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:59.560 align:middle line:84%
talk about this Archontic
force, which they say

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:02.480 align:middle line:84%
takes form and
manipulates human society.

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.810 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, they say--
and it fits massively

00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:08.500 align:middle line:84%
with what I'm saying too--
that this reality was actually

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:11.650 align:middle line:84%
created by that force, this
reality we're experiencing

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:13.270 align:middle line:90%
through the five senses.

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:19.706 align:middle line:84%
And in their prime form,
they are just energy.

00:20:19.706 --> 00:20:22.080 align:middle line:84%
Although they do take form,
but really, it's just energy.

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:24.960 align:middle line:84%
So that fits too
with what I'm saying

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:27.900 align:middle line:84%
about the fact we're dealing
with different states

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.090 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:35.340 align:middle line:84%
And this Archontic
awareness, if you like,

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:43.590 align:middle line:84%
is extremely psychopathic,
extremely distorting,

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:48.510 align:middle line:84%
and it's impacted
upon this reality

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:54.830 align:middle line:84%
to the point where its
distortion is distorting

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:58.310 align:middle line:84%
the reality that
we are living in.

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't hold your
consciousness, awareness

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:09.170 align:middle line:84%
in that balanced state, and
therefore not get pulled in,

00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:11.680 align:middle line:90%
it will pull you in.

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:18.380 align:middle line:84%
And I can't describe it any
more accurately, not even

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:23.759 align:middle line:84%
symbolically accurately, than
to call it a computer virus.

00:21:23.759 --> 00:21:25.550 align:middle line:84%
You have a computer,
and it's working fine.

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:29.075 align:middle line:90%


00:21:29.075 --> 00:21:32.660 align:middle line:84%
Say the computer is
symbolic of the five

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:36.050 align:middle line:90%
senses, the conscious mind.

00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And you have the person with
the mouse and the keyboard.

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:43.730 align:middle line:84%
Say that's symbolic of
consciousness beyond the five

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:46.610 align:middle line:90%
sense mind, the conscious mind.

00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:51.170 align:middle line:84%
Everything's fine, because
you've got the computer itself

00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:56.830 align:middle line:84%
interacting with the internet,
the collective reality

00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:58.310 align:middle line:90%
directly.

00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:02.270 align:middle line:84%
But you've got the person with
the mouse and the keyboard

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:08.420 align:middle line:84%
with the bigger picture
who's guiding that journey

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:10.790 align:middle line:90%
across the internet.

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:14.080 align:middle line:84%
Now imagine-- of course,
it happens all the time--

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:16.910 align:middle line:90%
a virus takes over the computer.

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:21.440 align:middle line:84%
Now the person who's got
the big picture who's

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:24.550 align:middle line:84%
been guiding the computer
through the internet

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:26.950 align:middle line:84%
is now banging the mouse
and banging the keyboard.

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:28.760 align:middle line:90%
Nothing's happening.

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:31.195 align:middle line:90%
The computer's gone its own way.

00:22:31.195 --> 00:22:33.900 align:middle line:84%
Its gone where it wants
to go on the internet now,

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:34.860 align:middle line:90%
and nothing works.

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And it all becomes distorted
and a mess and everything

00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:39.920 align:middle line:84%
slows down or
quickens up, whatever

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:42.800 align:middle line:90%
the effect of the virus.

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:45.910 align:middle line:84%
That's what's happened
in this world.

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:50.870 align:middle line:84%
The true self expanded
awareness has been disconnected,

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:55.430 align:middle line:84%
not least through the perceptual
programs, from five sense mine.

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:59.060 align:middle line:84%
So five sense mind
becomes isolated.

00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:05.774 align:middle line:84%
Now if you're in this, which
is just a band of frequency--

00:23:05.774 --> 00:23:06.690 align:middle line:90%
it's not even a world.

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:09.920 align:middle line:84%
It's an information source
that we're decoding.

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:14.200 align:middle line:84%
If you're in it and
interacting with it,

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:17.450 align:middle line:84%
and your whole
perception of reality

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:21.770 align:middle line:84%
is also in that frequency
band, you're in the world

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:23.870 align:middle line:90%
and you're of the world.

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:26.120 align:middle line:84%
Where is your information
coming that's going

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:29.180 align:middle line:84%
to give you a fix and an
understanding on the reality

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:31.640 align:middle line:90%
you're experiencing?

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:34.529 align:middle line:84%
From the reality
you're experiencing.

00:23:34.529 --> 00:23:37.070 align:middle line:84%
And so if you control the media
and you control the education

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:40.710 align:middle line:84%
system and you control all
the sources of communication,

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:42.632 align:middle line:84%
the only information
you're getting

00:23:42.632 --> 00:23:45.090 align:middle line:84%
to give you a perception of
the reality you're experiencing

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:49.280 align:middle line:84%
is coming from the reality
you're experiencing.

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:53.370 align:middle line:84%
But when you expand your
awareness beyond the program,

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:55.830 align:middle line:84%
beyond the postage
stamp, as I call it,

00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:58.470 align:middle line:84%
you're now tapping in
to levels of reality

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:00.420 align:middle line:90%
that are beyond the program.

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:03.285 align:middle line:84%
You're tapping into
the person, again,

00:24:03.285 --> 00:24:05.720 align:middle line:90%
with the mouse and the keyboard.

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And from that
perception, you start

00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:12.510 align:middle line:84%
to see the reality that
you're experiencing

00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:13.854 align:middle line:90%
a completely different way.

00:24:13.854 --> 00:24:16.520 align:middle line:84%
Now you're in the world, because
yes, we're interacting with it.

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:17.320 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:20.050 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, I can't
pick that cup up.

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:21.810 align:middle line:84%
But our perceptions
of that world

00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:26.880 align:middle line:84%
are no longer entirely
of that world.

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:31.300 align:middle line:84%
You're the guy with the
mouse and the keyboard again.

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
everything changes.

00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:34.330 align:middle line:90%
Now you look at the pressures.

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:37.780 align:middle line:84%
You look at the pressures
throughout someone's life

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:41.530 align:middle line:84%
not to break out of that in
the world and of the world.

00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:46.570 align:middle line:84%
Total ridicule,
condemnation, all of it.

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And what we need to do is
have the backbone initially--

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:52.230 align:middle line:90%
you don't need it later--

00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:57.580 align:middle line:84%
to reject that
perceptual imposition,

00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:01.030 align:middle line:84%
that psychological fascism,
because that's what it is,

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:04.240 align:middle line:84%
that is holding
humanity in servitude

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:08.320 align:middle line:84%
to this force,
which is basically

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:12.460 align:middle line:84%
the dominant force within
this band of frequency

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:13.830 align:middle line:90%
that we're experiencing.

00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:15.580 align:middle line:84%
But it's not the
dominant force beyond it.

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:16.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, absolutely not.

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:22.410 align:middle line:84%
So if we're looking at that
psychopathic force without form

00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:26.590 align:middle line:84%
that has a way of insinuating
itself into the appropriate

00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:30.090 align:middle line:84%
host, would you say
that in general--

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:32.920 align:middle line:84%
and it can be all
throughout society--

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:34.630 align:middle line:84%
it takes a certain
kind of person

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:37.810 align:middle line:84%
to claw their way to the
top of any field, right?

00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:39.970 align:middle line:84%
So whether they're in
Parliament or whether they're

00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:43.540 align:middle line:84%
in, you know,
entertainment or whatnot,

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:46.510 align:middle line:84%
there are certain people that
are known to kind of step

00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:49.360 align:middle line:84%
over each other's backs to
get where they want to go.

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:53.050 align:middle line:84%
Would you say that it's that
personality and resonance

00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:55.990 align:middle line:84%
field itself that
makes them a good host

00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:59.140 align:middle line:84%
for the Archontic
energy to flow through?

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:04.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: Well, there's
number of levels of this.

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:07.150 align:middle line:84%
In the end, we're
talking about frequency.

00:26:07.150 --> 00:26:12.610 align:middle line:84%
If you expand your awareness,
you expand your self-identity

00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:15.820 align:middle line:84%
from I am little me and
my little set of labels

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:18.130 align:middle line:84%
I've been given, to I am
infinite awareness having

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:22.570 align:middle line:84%
those experiences, then
your frequency immediately

00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:24.940 align:middle line:90%
starts to resonate quicker.

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:30.225 align:middle line:84%
The more you get pulled into
low vibrational emotion,

00:26:30.225 --> 00:26:34.740 align:middle line:84%
the more you get pulled into
myopic self-identities--

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:38.130 align:middle line:84%
I am Ethel on the checkout,
and that's all I am--

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:41.130 align:middle line:84%
then your frequency
starts to fall.

00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:44.460 align:middle line:84%
This is why when people
are in states of anxiety

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:48.180 align:middle line:84%
or in states of fear
and depression they say,

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:49.040 align:middle line:90%
oh, I'm so--

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:51.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which all the
media tries to keep is there.

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:52.100 align:middle line:90%
>>ICKE: Exactly.

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:53.100 align:middle line:90%
I feel so heavy today.

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And when you're in a state of
joy and positivity, you say,

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:57.980 align:middle line:90%
I feel so light today.

00:26:57.980 --> 00:26:58.780 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:01.640 align:middle line:84%
Because they're different
frequency states.

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:08.450 align:middle line:84%
And as you say, if you look
at human society and all

00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:12.710 align:middle line:84%
the forces of communication,
which equal perception,

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:16.310 align:middle line:84%
they're all basically
trying to keep us

00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:19.220 align:middle line:84%
in a low vibrational state
by keeping us in fear,

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:21.100 align:middle line:90%
by keeping us in anxiety.

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:22.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And distracted.

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:23.113 align:middle line:90%
Terribly distracted.

00:27:23.113 --> 00:27:27.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: Distracted, stressed,
and with a very narrow sense

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:30.857 align:middle line:90%
of our identity and our own--

00:27:30.857 --> 00:27:31.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Our possibility.

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:32.939 align:middle line:90%
>>ICKE: --our own power.

00:27:32.939 --> 00:27:33.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:36.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: So what that's
doing is pulling us

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:39.590 align:middle line:90%
into a low-frequency state.

00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:41.900 align:middle line:90%
Now this is where--

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:44.930 align:middle line:84%
which I've written about
a lot over the years--

00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:47.300 align:middle line:84%
this is where these
bloodlines come in,

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:50.750 align:middle line:84%
these particular
family bloodlines

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:52.970 align:middle line:84%
that go way back to
the ancient world

00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:55.580 align:middle line:84%
and incessantly interbreed
with each other.

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:58.600 align:middle line:90%


00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:02.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, people say about loyalty
and about the aristocracy,

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:05.380 align:middle line:84%
or it's the blue
bloods, they call them.

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:07.690 align:middle line:84%
Oh, they interbreed
to keep the genes up.

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And they interbreed
with each other

00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:18.670 align:middle line:84%
to keep a certain
information frequency field

00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:20.560 align:middle line:90%
through their generations.

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:25.090 align:middle line:84%
Which, if it was
interbred and interspersed

00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:30.430 align:middle line:84%
with the general population,
then that particular Archontic,

00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:34.450 align:middle line:84%
I would call it,
information field, bloodline

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:36.640 align:middle line:90%
would be quickly diluted.

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:42.780 align:middle line:84%
So these bloodlines have
been specifically created

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:47.210 align:middle line:84%
to process information
in a way that does not

00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:51.830 align:middle line:84%
have empathy, and all
those traits of the hair

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:54.500 align:middle line:90%
test of a psychopath.

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:59.030 align:middle line:84%
If you've got a computer and
you program it in a certain way,

00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:03.050 align:middle line:84%
it will decode
information in that way.

00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:05.480 align:middle line:84%
Won't decode information
outside of that.

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:06.620 align:middle line:90%
Only that way.

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:09.800 align:middle line:84%
Now if we're going
to get streetwise

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:12.620 align:middle line:84%
to the force that's
manipulating human society,

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:14.810 align:middle line:84%
we've got to get
streetwise to the fact

00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:18.320 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't have the limitations,
particularly emotional

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:20.270 align:middle line:90%
limitations that we have.

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:23.840 align:middle line:84%
So you've got these particular
bloodlines, which started out

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:30.350 align:middle line:84%
as out and out royalty, kings
and queens of the ancient past,

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:32.210 align:middle line:90%
and the aristocracy.

00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And then when-- apart
from, of course,

00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:37.120 align:middle line:84%
we still have the royal
family here and in one or two

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:37.920 align:middle line:90%
other countries.

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:40.580 align:middle line:84%
But there came a point
where humanity in general

00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:43.850 align:middle line:84%
started rejecting this
in-your-face control

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:45.590 align:middle line:90%
by royal bloodline.

00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:47.270 align:middle line:84%
So these bloodlines
then went out

00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:50.720 align:middle line:84%
into the dark suit professions
of banking, of politics,

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:55.850 align:middle line:84%
of business, of media ownership,
and all the institutions

00:29:55.850 --> 00:29:57.560 align:middle line:90%
of science and medicine.

00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And they've gone on
manipulating ever since.

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:03.530 align:middle line:84%
But they still
perceive themselves,

00:30:03.530 --> 00:30:08.360 align:middle line:84%
even though they're not
out and out called royalty,

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:11.690 align:middle line:84%
they still see themselves
as a special bloodline,

00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:13.830 align:middle line:90%
the bloodlines of the gods.

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:17.180 align:middle line:84%
This is where this
whole concept of royalty

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:20.430 align:middle line:84%
and the divine right
to rule comes from.

00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:22.430 align:middle line:84%
So you've got these
bloodlines, which

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:27.290 align:middle line:84%
are of a particular
informational, information

00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:31.250 align:middle line:84%
processing nature
that become incredibly

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:34.850 align:middle line:84%
easy for this Archontic
force to possess,

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:41.030 align:middle line:84%
because the frequency
compatibility is so close.

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:43.670 align:middle line:84%
And you have them
with this inability

00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:47.120 align:middle line:84%
to express empathy
and the ability

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:52.010 align:middle line:84%
to express all the character
traits of psychopaths.

00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:54.150 align:middle line:84%
Which is why the
world is as it is

00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:57.320 align:middle line:84%
and why you find the psychopaths
in the positions of power

00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:58.520 align:middle line:90%
invariably.

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:00.350 align:middle line:90%
And then there's others--

00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:03.740 align:middle line:84%
this is one of the ways
the secret society networks

00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:04.750 align:middle line:90%
operate--

00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:06.590 align:middle line:84%
where they're keeping
an eye on people.

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:09.110 align:middle line:84%
They do this at universities
in this country like Oxford

00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:11.860 align:middle line:84%
and Cambridge and in the Ivy
League universities of America.

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:13.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For the people
with those very traits.

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:15.580 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed
a couple of them

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:17.150 align:middle line:84%
where they're a
little tweaked, they

00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:21.090 align:middle line:84%
don't have the normal kind of
constraints of the personality.

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:21.890 align:middle line:90%
>>ICKE: Exactly.

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:23.330 align:middle line:90%
They're looking for them.

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:29.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you talk to Satanists,
and what they tell you--

00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:30.710 align:middle line:90%
those that are in the know--

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:34.580 align:middle line:84%
is that you know like the
Anton Lavey kind of level

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:35.750 align:middle line:90%
of the Church of Satan.

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:37.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:40.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: It's not Sunday
school, but by comparison it's

00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:44.540 align:middle line:84%
Sunday school, compared with the
real deep levels of Satanism,

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:49.460 align:middle line:84%
which actually is the force
behind these bloodlines.

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:53.950 align:middle line:84%
It's the way they interact
with their masters,

00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:55.200 align:middle line:90%
if you like, in these rituals.

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:59.930 align:middle line:84%
But what they're looking
for in these kind

00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:04.280 align:middle line:84%
of outer levels of Satanism are
people with particular traits.

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And they'll give
them things to do,

00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:12.219 align:middle line:84%
and they give them, like,
questionnaire tests.

00:32:12.219 --> 00:32:13.760 align:middle line:84%
In this situation,
would you do this?

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:14.390 align:middle line:90%
Would you do that?

00:32:14.390 --> 00:32:15.190 align:middle line:90%
Would you do that?

00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And if they show in these
tests they have no empathy

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:20.994 align:middle line:84%
and will do horrific things,
then they go deeper--

00:32:20.994 --> 00:32:22.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're recruited.

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:24.020 align:middle line:84%
They're recruited
by intelligence.

00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:27.320 align:middle line:84%
They're recruited
into academic circles.

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:29.590 align:middle line:90%
They're recruited into media.

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:30.650 align:middle line:90%
I am aware of this.

00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:31.450 align:middle line:90%
>>ICKE: Exactly.

00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:36.710 align:middle line:84%
So through this
whole recruitment

00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:42.830 align:middle line:84%
system of psychopaths, plus the
inner core who are basically

00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:48.320 align:middle line:84%
interbreeding psychopaths,
you concentrate power

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:53.070 align:middle line:84%
in the world right across
the institutions of politics

00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:55.730 align:middle line:84%
and banking and
business and journalism,

00:32:55.730 --> 00:33:00.680 align:middle line:84%
in terms of media ownership,
and of academia and science

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:01.910 align:middle line:90%
and medicine.

00:33:01.910 --> 00:33:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And you call the
shots of society,

00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:06.890 align:middle line:84%
because all these
institutions are fiercely

00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:09.440 align:middle line:90%
compartmentalized pyramids.

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:10.970 align:middle line:84%
You've got the tiny
few at the top.

00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:12.570 align:middle line:90%
There's your psychopaths.

00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And then as you come
down the pyramid

00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:15.830 align:middle line:84%
in all these
organizations, you're

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:17.300 align:middle line:84%
meeting more and
more and more people

00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:19.050 align:middle line:84%
who know less and less
and less about what

00:33:19.050 --> 00:33:20.250 align:middle line:90%
the organization's about.

00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:22.880 align:middle line:84%
They're just adding their
part without realizing

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:26.090 align:middle line:84%
how their part connects
to everyone else's part.

00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And you have then therefore
a global structure

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:34.880 align:middle line:84%
of the imposition on the global
population of a few people

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:40.360 align:middle line:84%
at the top with vast
numbers, playing their part

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:45.170 align:middle line:84%
and pushing that control forward
while having no idea that's

00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:46.380 align:middle line:90%
what they're doing.

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:47.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:48.700 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about this.

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:52.130 align:middle line:84%
You know, everybody
says, toward what end?

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:55.280 align:middle line:84%
What is it that
these beings want

00:33:55.280 --> 00:34:00.290 align:middle line:84%
to achieve in and of
themselves at human expense?

00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And what would they like to see
this planet ultimately become?

00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:08.449 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: Well, there's
many, many levels to that.

00:34:08.449 --> 00:34:13.190 align:middle line:84%
But imagine you are a distorted
state of consciousness.

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:17.510 align:middle line:84%
Imagine a distorted
vibrational state.

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:20.480 align:middle line:90%
That's you.

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:21.510 align:middle line:90%
That's what you are.

00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:23.370 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't mean you have
to stay like that,

00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:29.780 align:middle line:84%
but it's what you are and what's
driving everything you do.

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:32.360 align:middle line:84%
For more and more
power, you want

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:34.550 align:middle line:84%
to pull more and
more consciousness

00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:36.860 align:middle line:90%
into that vibration.

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:38.180 align:middle line:90%
That's what we're seeing.

00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:39.305 align:middle line:90%
We see it in human society.

00:34:39.305 --> 00:34:42.080 align:middle line:84%
More and more people have
been pulled over the years

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:45.179 align:middle line:90%
into this distortion.

00:34:45.179 --> 00:34:50.239 align:middle line:84%
And what happens when they do
that is this on a consciousness

00:34:50.239 --> 00:34:53.659 align:middle line:84%
level, this distortion
is basically

00:34:53.659 --> 00:34:58.610 align:middle line:84%
absorbing, assimilating
into itself

00:34:58.610 --> 00:35:00.410 align:middle line:84%
all the consciousness
that it's got

00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:04.790 align:middle line:84%
to vibrate at the same
level, vibration as itself.

00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:05.909 align:middle line:90%
So it gets more--

00:35:05.909 --> 00:35:06.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So than a fuel.

00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:08.990 align:middle line:90%
It's a food source.

00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:12.650 align:middle line:84%
It's a nutrient, a
low-frequency nutrient

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:14.270 align:middle line:90%
that resonates with the beings.

00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:15.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ICKE: Yeah.

00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:20.480 align:middle line:84%
It's like having a computer
virus which starts off

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:22.486 align:middle line:90%
infecting one computer.

00:35:22.486 --> 00:35:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And then it infects another
computer and another computer

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:26.276 align:middle line:84%
and another computer,
until you've

00:35:26.276 --> 00:35:31.070 align:middle line:84%
got a massive global
computer virus

00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:34.190 align:middle line:84%
infection that is affecting,
you know, computers

00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:37.086 align:middle line:90%
on a very large scale.

00:35:37.086 --> 00:35:39.170 align:middle line:90%
What is that virus doing?

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:44.420 align:middle line:84%
It's absorbing the balance that
those computers were working on

00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:47.420 align:middle line:84%
into itself so the
computers start

00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:52.975 align:middle line:84%
to manifest the traits of
the distortion, of the virus.

00:35:52.975 --> 00:35:56.870 align:middle line:84%
This is precisely
what is happening.

00:35:56.870 --> 00:36:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is to
absorb the human mind

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:08.540 align:middle line:84%
into this distortion via
artificial intelligence

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:16.900 align:middle line:84%
and a technological connection
of the brain body to AI.

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And you know, not
too long ago if I'd

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:25.030 align:middle line:84%
have said that, people would
have said, you're mad, mate.

00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:26.630 align:middle line:90%
That would never happen.

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:30.880 align:middle line:10%
And you see, if you think
about it, what has happened up

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:38.420 align:middle line:10%
to this point is human
perception has been manipulated

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:41.180 align:middle line:10%
by control of
information received,

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:43.970 align:middle line:10%
because people's perceptions
come from information received.

00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:46.250 align:middle line:84%
And if it's not through
a personal experience,

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:50.480 align:middle line:84%
it's through some form of
information communication.

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:55.660 align:middle line:84%
This stage we're entering
now, unless we wake up fast,

00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:58.510 align:middle line:84%
is bringing an end
to the manipulation

00:36:58.510 --> 00:37:02.230 align:middle line:84%
of human perception by
control of information.

00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's turning
artificial intelligence

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:07.150 align:middle line:90%
into human perception.

00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:08.710 align:middle line:90%
It becomes it.

00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:12.400 align:middle line:84%
So what people think,
how people feel

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:18.706 align:middle line:90%
becomes whatever AI dictates.

00:37:18.706 --> 00:37:20.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you look
at what Kurzweil

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:25.330 align:middle line:84%
is saying, for instance, that
once the connection is made

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:27.220 align:middle line:84%
between the human
brain, human mind,

00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:32.020 align:middle line:84%
and artificial intelligence,
artificial intelligence will

00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:34.880 align:middle line:84%
have more and more
and more influence

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:37.960 align:middle line:84%
until the human
thought processes

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:41.720 align:middle line:84%
that we perceive now are
negligible and eventually

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:42.520 align:middle line:90%
extinct.

00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:43.890 align:middle line:90%
It's an assimilation.

00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:47.080 align:middle line:84%
It's an assimilation into
artificial intelligence.

00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:48.850 align:middle line:90%
And I hear all the time now--

00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:50.260 align:middle line:90%
of course we do--

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:54.310 align:middle line:84%
AI this, AI that, AI the other,
AI's taking over the military,

00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:56.950 align:middle line:90%
AI's taking over communication.

00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:58.090 align:middle line:90%
AI this, AI that.

00:37:58.090 --> 00:38:00.050 align:middle line:90%
I don't hear this question.

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:01.330 align:middle line:90%
What is AI?

00:38:01.330 --> 00:38:02.350 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:38:02.350 --> 00:38:04.390 align:middle line:84%
What is this
artificial intelligence

00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:06.730 align:middle line:90%
that's taking everything over?

00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:08.410 align:middle line:90%
Because we're being invaded.

00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:10.090 align:middle line:90%
We're being invaded.

00:38:10.090 --> 00:38:13.459 align:middle line:84%
Our minds are being invaded and
our society is being invaded--

00:38:13.459 --> 00:38:16.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're saying it's
a technological assimilation

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.590 align:middle line:84%
of the human collective
consciousness.

00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:19.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: Yeah, and
I'm asking this.

00:38:19.870 --> 00:38:20.710 align:middle line:90%
What is AI?

00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:25.330 align:middle line:84%
And I feel this strongly after
all these years of research

00:38:25.330 --> 00:38:28.360 align:middle line:90%
that AI is this Archontic force.

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:30.450 align:middle line:90%
See, there's two types of AI.

00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:33.089 align:middle line:90%
There's algorithmic AI, codes.

00:38:33.089 --> 00:38:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
what they're calling

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:37.990 align:middle line:84%
strong AI, which is
an AI that's basically

00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:40.450 align:middle line:90%
a form of consciousness.

00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:48.700 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I say is
going to lead to the infusion

00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:53.000 align:middle line:84%
into this technological
control system

00:38:53.000 --> 00:39:01.100 align:middle line:84%
of this Archontic distortion,
which will then be controlling

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:07.880 align:middle line:84%
human perceptions
like humans were just

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:10.910 align:middle line:84%
computer terminals on
someone else's internet.

00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:13.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The way we're plugged
into our technology, that's

00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:16.160 align:middle line:84%
a very likely outcome,
because we've given over

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:19.370 align:middle line:84%
our own consciousness to the
information that's constantly

00:39:19.370 --> 00:39:21.440 align:middle line:84%
streaming in in
everybody's hands.

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:26.220 align:middle line:84%
Here on the Tube, everybody's
on their own little devices,

00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:27.020 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:28.670 align:middle line:84%
Being programmed
minute by minute.

00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:31.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: Yeah, well, you
know, something else

00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:35.510 align:middle line:84%
I point out in the book is this
very easy-to-follow process

00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:37.520 align:middle line:84%
of how this has
been brought about.

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:42.840 align:middle line:84%
Number one, you
get people addicted

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:45.150 align:middle line:90%
to technology they hold.

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:46.034 align:middle line:90%
Then you move on to--

00:39:46.034 --> 00:39:47.700 align:middle line:84%
because you want to
get inside the body.

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:50.366 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you had to put
a little entertainment in there

00:39:50.366 --> 00:39:51.450 align:middle line:90%
to keep people--

00:39:51.450 --> 00:39:54.550 align:middle line:84%
keep the juice going, to
keep people hooked into it.

00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:58.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: Then you go to
technology on the body.

00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:02.237 align:middle line:84%
This is your Bluetooth, your
Google Glass, your Apple Watch.

00:40:02.237 --> 00:40:03.570 align:middle line:90%
And now we're already seeing it.

00:40:03.570 --> 00:40:07.630 align:middle line:84%
You go inside the body, and
many levels to that as well.

00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:12.930 align:middle line:84%
But I'm saying that
this extraordinary level

00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:19.770 align:middle line:84%
of addiction to technology now,
especially among the young,

00:40:19.770 --> 00:40:20.880 align:middle line:90%
is not just--

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:25.260 align:middle line:84%
well, on one level
it's the brain

00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:29.450 align:middle line:84%
becoming addicted to the
electronic digital stimulation.

00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:31.746 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:40:31.746 --> 00:40:33.870 align:middle line:84%
The speed at which the
experience is happening too.

00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:36.170 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: It goes into
cold turkey when

00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:37.692 align:middle line:90%
people put their phone down.

00:40:37.692 --> 00:40:39.400 align:middle line:84%
But I think there's
more to it than that.

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:40.900 align:middle line:84%
I think there's
something coming off

00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:45.510 align:middle line:84%
these phones, actually, that
are having an addictive impact.

00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And so you get people
addicted to technology.

00:40:50.610 --> 00:40:54.870 align:middle line:84%
You get people-- especially when
people are born into this world

00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:56.940 align:middle line:90%
now, it's all they know.

00:40:56.940 --> 00:41:00.720 align:middle line:84%
You get them to make a
psychological connection

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:01.587 align:middle line:90%
to technology.

00:41:01.587 --> 00:41:03.670 align:middle line:84%
Because before you can
make a physical connection,

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:06.995 align:middle line:84%
you've got to make a
psychological connection.

00:41:06.995 --> 00:41:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And once that psychological
connection's made--

00:41:10.350 --> 00:41:15.090 align:middle line:84%
and this, by the way, is what
these digital assistants are

00:41:15.090 --> 00:41:19.420 align:middle line:90%
all about like Echo and Alexa.

00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:21.740 align:middle line:90%
What is that doing?

00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:24.150 align:middle line:84%
That's getting people
in their own homes

00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:28.260 align:middle line:84%
all the time to make a
psychological connection,

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:30.540 align:middle line:90%
an interaction to AI.

00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And you are seeing this
psychological connection.

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:36.720 align:middle line:84%
This is why they're
having Barbie dolls

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:41.280 align:middle line:84%
connected to the internet
so young, young kids

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:45.750 align:middle line:84%
from the earliest ages having
conversation interactions

00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:47.030 align:middle line:90%
with artificial intelligence--

00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Don't get me going.

00:41:47.970 --> 00:41:48.480 align:middle line:90%
I agree with you.

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:49.290 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: This is
what it's all about

00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:49.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:50.850 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about it now.

00:41:50.850 --> 00:41:52.620 align:middle line:84%
We're going to start
looking at the story

00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:54.270 align:middle line:90%
from the other side of it.

00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:55.890 align:middle line:90%
We're seeing the problem.

00:41:55.890 --> 00:41:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And you know, certainly people
say, oh my god, the problem

00:41:58.630 --> 00:41:59.430 align:middle line:90%
is so scary.

00:41:59.430 --> 00:42:00.240 align:middle line:90%
It scares me.

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:01.710 align:middle line:90%
It's so fear-based.

00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:04.184 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is,
it's just information.

00:42:04.184 --> 00:42:06.600 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to frighten
you if you understand you have

00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:08.427 align:middle line:90%
the ultimate power over this.

00:42:08.427 --> 00:42:10.260 align:middle line:84%
The individual does
have the ultimate power.

00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:12.150 align:middle line:84%
It's not as though
it's not a task

00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:14.910 align:middle line:84%
to try to break free of this
matrix that's been created.

00:42:14.910 --> 00:42:16.800 align:middle line:84%
But we do have the
power to do so,

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:18.750 align:middle line:84%
so let's look at it
from a soul level.

00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:21.540 align:middle line:84%
Souls are still continuing
to incarnate on Earth.

00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:23.980 align:middle line:84%
The soul is something
much finer than AI.

00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:29.010 align:middle line:84%
It's much finer than what these
low-density beings can create.

00:42:29.010 --> 00:42:33.920 align:middle line:84%
What would you say is the
opportunity for a soul, who

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:36.270 align:middle line:84%
is always looking to
expand and experience

00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:41.376 align:middle line:84%
and grow and refine, to
incarnate into this matrix?

00:42:41.376 --> 00:42:44.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: Well, I mean,
you know, maybe it's

00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:48.300 align:middle line:90%
not always free will, you know?

00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:54.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know, bees get
attracted to honey pots,

00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:56.950 align:middle line:84%
but who's waiting with the
swatter next to the honey pot?

00:42:56.950 --> 00:42:57.360 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:58.735 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
we might disagree

00:42:58.735 --> 00:43:00.769 align:middle line:84%
on that, because I
do think souls have

00:43:00.769 --> 00:43:02.310 align:middle line:84%
some say in what
they're going to do.

00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:03.780 align:middle line:90%
>>ICKE: It depends--

00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:06.390 align:middle line:84%
I think it depends on the
level of consciousness

00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:11.460 align:middle line:84%
of what you call soul, whether
they are drawn in to this

00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:15.060 align:middle line:90%
or whether they make a choice.

00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:17.820 align:middle line:90%
Probably both is true.

00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:23.790 align:middle line:90%
But the point about fear--

00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:26.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know, when
I started this journey,

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:30.100 align:middle line:84%
consciously started
it 30 years ago,

00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:34.860 align:middle line:84%
I was seeing what we then
called New Age people--

00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:37.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't hear that phrase
so much these days--

00:43:37.310 --> 00:43:41.247 align:middle line:84%
who were calling about
letting go of fear.

00:43:41.247 --> 00:43:43.080 align:middle line:84%
And then they were
saying to people like me,

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:44.010 align:middle line:90%
you can't say that.

00:43:44.010 --> 00:43:45.540 align:middle line:90%
You'll frighten people.

00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And I used to say to them, what
happened to letting go of fear?

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:55.090 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's
one thing for sure

00:43:55.090 --> 00:43:59.020 align:middle line:84%
that will make certain
that we will do nothing

00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:01.960 align:middle line:84%
about what's going
on, and that is

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:05.140 align:middle line:90%
ignorance of what is going on.

00:44:05.140 --> 00:44:06.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is very true.

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:09.670 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: The bottom
line is we have

00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:15.340 align:middle line:84%
to appreciate what is happening
and how the scam works,

00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:18.350 align:middle line:84%
how the perceptual
manipulation works.

00:44:18.350 --> 00:44:21.410 align:middle line:84%
Because without that,
we've got no chance.

00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:28.870 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing more
manipulatable than genuineness

00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:30.970 align:middle line:90%
that isn't streetwise.

00:44:30.970 --> 00:44:33.370 align:middle line:90%
Easiest thing in the world.

00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And so it's no
good people saying,

00:44:36.010 --> 00:44:39.446 align:middle line:84%
well, this might frighten
people, because, well, they'll

00:44:39.446 --> 00:44:40.570 align:middle line:90%
have to be frightened then.

00:44:40.570 --> 00:44:43.540 align:middle line:84%
Because if they're
not frightened now,

00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:46.400 align:middle line:84%
they will be a bit
further down the line.

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:48.970 align:middle line:84%
So we face it now
or we face it then,

00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:53.560 align:middle line:84%
when it's much more
difficult to turn around.

00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:56.080 align:middle line:90%
And so there's two levels of it.

00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:58.160 align:middle line:84%
One, we have to
understand how it works,

00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:00.220 align:middle line:84%
because by understanding
the problem,

00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:01.960 align:middle line:84%
then you can understand
how to remove

00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:03.400 align:middle line:90%
the cause of the problem.

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:07.870 align:middle line:84%
The cause of the problem is
how literally comparatively

00:45:07.870 --> 00:45:12.130 align:middle line:84%
a handful of people and that
consciousness they represent

00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:15.550 align:middle line:84%
controls and dictates
the lives of 7.5 billion.

00:45:15.550 --> 00:45:17.980 align:middle line:84%
It's because most
of the 7.5 billion

00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:19.810 align:middle line:84%
are in ignorance
that it's going on,

00:45:19.810 --> 00:45:22.690 align:middle line:84%
and certainly in ignorance
of how the scam works

00:45:22.690 --> 00:45:24.220 align:middle line:84%
and how they're
being manipulated.

00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:26.636 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And being kept so
exhausted they don't have time

00:45:26.636 --> 00:45:27.530 align:middle line:90%
to contemplate it.

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:28.330 align:middle line:90%
>>ICKE: Exactly.

00:45:28.330 --> 00:45:30.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know,
it's the old thing.

00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:33.040 align:middle line:84%
Keep their heads down,
and they'll never

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:35.770 align:middle line:84%
look up and see what's
actually going on.

00:45:35.770 --> 00:45:37.940 align:middle line:84%
So we need to understand
what's happening.

00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:42.460 align:middle line:84%
But this is why the
outward expression

00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:48.970 align:middle line:84%
of the manipulation, human
society and what goes on there,

00:45:48.970 --> 00:45:51.120 align:middle line:90%
should be communicated.

00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:53.170 align:middle line:84%
And for me, has
to be communicated

00:45:53.170 --> 00:45:57.160 align:middle line:84%
with the nature of reality
and the nature of who we are.

00:45:57.160 --> 00:46:01.780 align:middle line:84%
Because then we can not
only see how this plays out,

00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:05.240 align:middle line:90%
but how it can unplay out.

00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:10.930 align:middle line:84%
We have given our minds away
to a perceptual program that

00:46:10.930 --> 00:46:15.430 align:middle line:84%
gives us a particular
perception of reality

00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:18.130 align:middle line:84%
and a particular
perception of self.

00:46:18.130 --> 00:46:23.650 align:middle line:84%
What I'm saying is
that we are interacting

00:46:23.650 --> 00:46:27.880 align:middle line:84%
with this, what you might call
quantum field of possibility

00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:32.650 align:middle line:84%
and probability, within a
frequency band represented

00:46:32.650 --> 00:46:34.330 align:middle line:90%
by our perceptions.

00:46:34.330 --> 00:46:36.950 align:middle line:84%
Everything in our
reality is frequency.

00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:40.210 align:middle line:84%
So little me, I've got
no power, is a frequency.

00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:41.830 align:middle line:90%
It's a very dense frequency.

00:46:41.830 --> 00:46:44.740 align:middle line:90%
It's a very narrow frequency.

00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:49.870 align:middle line:84%
I am all that is, has been,
and ever can be is an expanded

00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:52.660 align:middle line:84%
frequency, because it's
an expanded self-identity,

00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:58.260 align:middle line:84%
and it is a very high,
comparatively, vibrational--

00:46:58.260 --> 00:46:59.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And more
empowering by far.

00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:00.780 align:middle line:90%
>>ICKE: Yeah.

00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:04.990 align:middle line:84%
So I'm little me,
I have no power,

00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:08.320 align:middle line:84%
is interacting symbolically
with this field of possibility

00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:10.740 align:middle line:84%
and probability and
this narrow band.

00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And it creates a
feedback loop in effect,

00:47:14.350 --> 00:47:16.780 align:middle line:84%
where your perceptions become
your experienced reality.

00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:19.310 align:middle line:90%


00:47:19.310 --> 00:47:22.120 align:middle line:84%
And then when you
expand your awareness,

00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:24.406 align:middle line:84%
you expand your
self-identity, now

00:47:24.406 --> 00:47:25.780 align:middle line:84%
you're interacting
with a quantum

00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:27.520 align:middle line:84%
field of possibility
and probability

00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:29.660 align:middle line:90%
in a much more expanded way.

00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:30.460 align:middle line:90%
And what happens?

00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:34.900 align:middle line:84%
What happens when people
so-called wake up, which means

00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:37.420 align:middle line:84%
wake up from the
program or start to?

00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:40.690 align:middle line:84%
They start to notice the
incredible synchronicity

00:47:40.690 --> 00:47:42.910 align:middle line:84%
in their life that
suddenly starts.

00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:47.260 align:middle line:84%
These amazing coincidences,
these amazing bits of luck,

00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:48.670 align:middle line:90%
these manifestations.

00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:49.630 align:middle line:90%
Oh my goodness.

00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:51.670 align:middle line:90%
Fancy seeing you here, huh?

00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:55.114 align:middle line:84%
That's incredible to meet
you here, thousands of miles

00:47:55.114 --> 00:47:56.280 align:middle line:90%
from home, and there you go.

00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:57.194 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's amazing.

00:47:57.194 --> 00:47:58.110 align:middle line:90%
That starts to happen.

00:47:58.110 --> 00:47:59.550 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:47:59.550 --> 00:48:04.720 align:middle line:84%
I am little me becomes
I am infinite me.

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the amount of
possibility and probability

00:48:09.250 --> 00:48:12.250 align:middle line:84%
that we are interacting
with massively expands.

00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:15.400 align:middle line:84%
So what you manifest in the
feedback loop of perception

00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:20.110 align:middle line:84%
becomes experienced reality
dramatically changes.

00:48:20.110 --> 00:48:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And this is-- you
know, coming around

00:48:22.450 --> 00:48:28.690 align:middle line:84%
to how we started out here, if
you walk through fire believing

00:48:28.690 --> 00:48:31.480 align:middle line:84%
you'll get burned, then they'll
be calling an ambulance.

00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:34.840 align:middle line:84%
But if you go into other
levels of awareness

00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:43.950 align:middle line:84%
that will not perceive that
dynamic, that feedback loop--

00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:46.267 align:middle line:84%
I'll get burned,
ah, I'm burned--

00:48:46.267 --> 00:48:47.850 align:middle line:84%
then you can walk
through fire and not

00:48:47.850 --> 00:48:49.650 align:middle line:84%
get burned, which of
course is what people do.

00:48:49.650 --> 00:48:51.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, your
atomic structure literally

00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:52.930 align:middle line:84%
changes according
to that thought.

00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:53.730 align:middle line:90%
>>ICKE: Exactly.

00:48:53.730 --> 00:49:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And so when you are
changing your perception,

00:49:00.970 --> 00:49:02.950 align:middle line:84%
you change your
experienced reality.

00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:05.590 align:middle line:84%
So coming back to
how we started out,

00:49:05.590 --> 00:49:10.750 align:middle line:84%
if you believe
that life is random

00:49:10.750 --> 00:49:14.950 align:middle line:84%
and that you go through
an aging process--

00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:17.620 align:middle line:84%
because that's encoded
in the body anyway,

00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:20.350 align:middle line:90%
but it can be unencoded--

00:49:20.350 --> 00:49:24.060 align:middle line:84%
and if the body's a
hologram, what does

00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:25.590 align:middle line:90%
a hologram need to breathe?

00:49:25.590 --> 00:49:28.170 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever seen a
hologram have to breathe?

00:49:28.170 --> 00:49:31.230 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever seen
a hologram age?

00:49:31.230 --> 00:49:34.610 align:middle line:84%
But if you perceive
that, then again,

00:49:34.610 --> 00:49:38.810 align:middle line:84%
the placebo symbolic
effect will manifest it.

00:49:38.810 --> 00:49:41.730 align:middle line:84%
And people look around
them, and what do they see?

00:49:41.730 --> 00:49:43.620 align:middle line:84%
They see people
aging everywhere.

00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:44.420 align:middle line:90%
Oh, god.

00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:46.490 align:middle line:90%
You can't do that at your age.

00:49:46.490 --> 00:49:47.720 align:middle line:90%
It's all a program.

00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:50.030 align:middle line:90%
It's all a program.

00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:54.350 align:middle line:84%
And we have the ability to
take power over that program

00:49:54.350 --> 00:49:58.389 align:middle line:84%
back any time we choose, but
the program is constantly

00:49:58.389 --> 00:50:00.430 align:middle line:84%
telling us we don't have
that power, because it's

00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:01.635 align:middle line:90%
self-preserving itself.

00:50:01.635 --> 00:50:04.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'd like to spend
some time talking about that,

00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:08.520 align:middle line:84%
because that is what people need
to understand loud and clear.

00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:09.800 align:middle line:90%
They do have that power.

00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:11.540 align:middle line:84%
They need to understand
how to identify

00:50:11.540 --> 00:50:15.410 align:middle line:84%
the actual I. Not the little
me, but the real true self.

00:50:15.410 --> 00:50:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And so they can start
aligning with that

00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:19.710 align:middle line:90%
and break free of this matrix.

00:50:19.710 --> 00:50:25.500 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: Well, if you
asked almost everybody

00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:28.197 align:middle line:84%
the question who
are you, they'll

00:50:28.197 --> 00:50:29.280 align:middle line:90%
give you a list of labels.

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:30.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:32.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm a mom, I'm a TV
lady, I'm a whatever.

00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:33.670 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:34.500 align:middle line:90%
>>ICKE: Yeah.

00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:35.625 align:middle line:90%
But that's not who you are.

00:50:35.625 --> 00:50:38.220 align:middle line:90%
That's what you're experiencing.

00:50:38.220 --> 00:50:41.400 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
great foundations of

00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:45.330 align:middle line:84%
this whole perceptual
control of the human race

00:50:45.330 --> 00:50:47.190 align:middle line:84%
is to get people
to self-identify

00:50:47.190 --> 00:50:49.620 align:middle line:84%
with their experience
instead of the consciousness

00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:51.360 align:middle line:90%
that's having the experience.

00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:53.520 align:middle line:84%
You know, when people have
near-death experiences

00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:57.390 align:middle line:84%
and they leave the body,
and suddenly, whoa, they

00:50:57.390 --> 00:51:00.840 align:middle line:84%
massively expand their
awareness and can experience

00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:04.500 align:middle line:84%
multiple realities in the same
moment, all that's happened

00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:10.020 align:middle line:84%
is that I has left the
body, which is doing what?

00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:12.992 align:middle line:84%
It's focusing our attention
in a narrow band of frequency.

00:51:12.992 --> 00:51:15.450 align:middle line:84%
So as soon as it leaves the
body, that focus of attention's

00:51:15.450 --> 00:51:18.200 align:middle line:84%
gone, and suddenly you have
expanded states of awareness.

00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:19.440 align:middle line:90%
That's the I.

00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:23.130 align:middle line:90%
I remember-- quick story.

00:51:23.130 --> 00:51:27.120 align:middle line:84%
When my mother
died, at that point,

00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:28.270 align:middle line:90%
I'd never seen a dead body.

00:51:28.270 --> 00:51:32.214 align:middle line:84%
It just hadn't been
in my experience.

00:51:32.214 --> 00:51:33.630 align:middle line:84%
But on the morning
of the funeral,

00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:40.120 align:middle line:84%
I went to the funeral parlor,
and there was my mother,

00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:42.440 align:middle line:90%
lying on the slab.

00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:44.680 align:middle line:90%
And I touched her hand.

00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:46.600 align:middle line:90%
Stone cold.

00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:52.720 align:middle line:84%
Next to her was a big,
blown-up picture of her,

00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:54.310 align:middle line:84%
which my brother
had had done, which

00:51:54.310 --> 00:51:58.210 align:middle line:84%
was going to stand next to the
coffin in the funeral service.

00:51:58.210 --> 00:52:01.240 align:middle line:90%
The body had no life.

00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:02.410 align:middle line:90%
None.

00:52:02.410 --> 00:52:06.400 align:middle line:90%
I mean, talk about dead.

00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:08.810 align:middle line:90%
The picture was alive.

00:52:08.810 --> 00:52:09.870 align:middle line:90%
It was alive.

00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:12.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It had the sparkle
in her eyes, the personality

00:52:12.580 --> 00:52:13.380 align:middle line:90%
and feeling.

00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:16.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: What was in
that picture but wasn't

00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:18.140 align:middle line:90%
in the body, that's who we are.

00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:19.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:25.910 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: And so when you
start self-identifying

00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:32.150 align:middle line:84%
with that level of self, that
I, a massive effect happens.

00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:36.440 align:middle line:84%
Because that expanded
perception first of all

00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:38.150 align:middle line:84%
changes the frequency
and everything

00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:40.250 align:middle line:84%
that we are operating
on, and the interaction

00:52:40.250 --> 00:52:42.690 align:middle line:84%
with possibility
and probability.

00:52:42.690 --> 00:52:45.680 align:middle line:84%
But it also puts
what experiences

00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:48.620 align:middle line:90%
we're having into perspective.

00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:51.650 align:middle line:84%
Instead of the experiences
overwhelming you

00:52:51.650 --> 00:52:54.650 align:middle line:84%
because the experiences
are you, they

00:52:54.650 --> 00:53:00.200 align:middle line:84%
become something transitory
that you are experiencing.

00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:02.360 align:middle line:90%
And that's what this is.

00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:07.392 align:middle line:84%
And if people just realize that,
I think they'd chill out more.

00:53:07.392 --> 00:53:08.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I think they would.

00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:10.266 align:middle line:84%
I think the biggest
issue is people say,

00:53:10.266 --> 00:53:11.640 align:middle line:90%
but I don't know how to do that.

00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:13.490 align:middle line:84%
And so they'll go into
meditation classes

00:53:13.490 --> 00:53:17.450 align:middle line:84%
and be very diligent and
try to find the I in that.

00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:19.430 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes,
that doesn't work.

00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And you know,
interestingly, in some

00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:24.980 align:middle line:84%
of the workshops
I do for people,

00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:27.320 align:middle line:84%
I had this one little
meditation that

00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:29.270 align:middle line:84%
is so freeing
because you go back

00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:31.550 align:middle line:84%
to kindergarten, to
the desires of what you

00:53:31.550 --> 00:53:32.900 align:middle line:90%
had when you were a little kid.

00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:37.570 align:middle line:84%
These unfettered desires that
no one had trampled on yet.

00:53:37.570 --> 00:53:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And it is shocking
how close people

00:53:40.090 --> 00:53:42.770 align:middle line:84%
start coming to what
it is they are again

00:53:42.770 --> 00:53:46.132 align:middle line:84%
by going into that little
experience of what they loved

00:53:46.132 --> 00:53:47.090 align:middle line:90%
when they were a child.

00:53:47.090 --> 00:53:48.548 align:middle line:84%
And I guide him
through it and all.

00:53:48.548 --> 00:53:52.250 align:middle line:84%
But it seems to be
so far that desire

00:53:52.250 --> 00:53:55.340 align:middle line:84%
of what one is
passionate about seems

00:53:55.340 --> 00:53:59.930 align:middle line:84%
to be the closest tool
to getting people up

00:53:59.930 --> 00:54:03.080 align:middle line:90%
into that field of who I am.

00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:05.510 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: And it's
interesting also going on

00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:10.489 align:middle line:84%
from that to ask the question,
how many people in this world

00:54:10.489 --> 00:54:11.780 align:middle line:90%
are doing what they want to do?

00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:12.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Almost no one.

00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:13.310 align:middle line:90%
>>ICKE: Almost no one.

00:54:13.310 --> 00:54:14.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and that's
what they all discover in this.

00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:16.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: They're doing what the
system tells them they must do.

00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:20.570 align:middle line:84%
The whole system is
set up to enforce--

00:54:20.570 --> 00:54:23.180 align:middle line:90%
I mean, here's a simple thing.

00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:24.500 align:middle line:90%
What is freedom?

00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:25.420 align:middle line:90%
What is freedom?

00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:27.020 align:middle line:84%
In this reality,
what is freedom?

00:54:27.020 --> 00:54:28.350 align:middle line:90%
What is freedom anywhere?

00:54:28.350 --> 00:54:29.150 align:middle line:90%
It's choice.

00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:29.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:29.720 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:32.240 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: The more choices
you have, the freer you are.

00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:33.410 align:middle line:90%
So what does the system do?

00:54:33.410 --> 00:54:34.760 align:middle line:90%
It takes choice away.

00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:37.760 align:middle line:84%
Or the perception
of choice away.

00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, people
get up in the morning

00:54:42.110 --> 00:54:45.930 align:middle line:90%
to get through to going to bed.

00:54:45.930 --> 00:54:48.470 align:middle line:84%
And so weekends
become this big thing,

00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:51.250 align:middle line:84%
because, oh, I've got to work,
I haven't got to do this,

00:54:51.250 --> 00:54:52.410 align:middle line:90%
I haven't got to do that.

00:54:52.410 --> 00:54:55.665 align:middle line:84%
But you know, you look at
people and how many times

00:54:55.665 --> 00:54:58.040 align:middle line:84%
they're saying all the time,
I've got to, got to, got to,

00:54:58.040 --> 00:54:59.070 align:middle line:90%
got to, got to.

00:54:59.070 --> 00:55:00.350 align:middle line:90%
Just, OK.

00:55:00.350 --> 00:55:01.340 align:middle line:90%
Just take a breath.

00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:02.810 align:middle line:84%
Just, let's go
through these go tos

00:55:02.810 --> 00:55:05.595 align:middle line:84%
and see what you
really have to do

00:55:05.595 --> 00:55:08.240 align:middle line:84%
and which of them you
perceive you have to do,

00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:14.720 align:middle line:84%
because that's the program of
reality that you've taken on.

00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:21.950 align:middle line:84%
And when you realize that
we are consciousness having

00:55:21.950 --> 00:55:26.870 align:middle line:84%
a transitory experience in
this reality, and you know,

00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:29.720 align:middle line:84%
you haven't got to
get anywhere, you

00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:33.740 align:middle line:84%
haven't got to be
someone, you're already

00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:36.890 align:middle line:84%
a point of attention within
all that is, has been, and ever

00:55:36.890 --> 00:55:40.040 align:middle line:84%
could be, all
possibility, what do you

00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:41.960 align:middle line:90%
mean you've got to be someone?

00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:44.450 align:middle line:84%
What someone can you
be that's more than

00:55:44.450 --> 00:55:48.350 align:middle line:84%
being a point of attention
within all possibility?

00:55:48.350 --> 00:55:51.680 align:middle line:84%
But it's this got
to, got to, got it.

00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:55.220 align:middle line:84%
And basically-- and I saw
this advertisement once.

00:55:55.220 --> 00:55:57.470 align:middle line:84%
It couldn't have been a great
advertisement, because I

00:55:57.470 --> 00:56:01.250 align:middle line:84%
can't remember what it was for,
but it was a brilliant concept.

00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:05.030 align:middle line:84%
This child comes out
of the womb at one end

00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:08.720 align:middle line:84%
and flies through the
air like a missile.

00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:10.340 align:middle line:84%
And as it's flying
through the air,

00:56:10.340 --> 00:56:12.740 align:middle line:84%
it's aging and aging
and aging and aging.

00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And then it hits the
cemetery at the other end.

00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:17.300 align:middle line:90%
And that's life.

00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:19.340 align:middle line:84%
It's like, got to,
got to, got to.

00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:21.950 align:middle line:90%
But we haven't.

00:56:21.950 --> 00:56:27.035 align:middle line:84%
You see, someone said
to me the other day,

00:56:27.035 --> 00:56:28.210 align:middle line:90%
why are you always working?

00:56:28.210 --> 00:56:31.280 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you have
more in your life?

00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:32.129 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:56:32.129 --> 00:56:33.920 align:middle line:84%
And I said well, A,
because I like working.

00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:37.340 align:middle line:84%
But also because I
had this perception

00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:39.500 align:middle line:84%
of what I'm doing
a long time ago

00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:44.120 align:middle line:84%
that you see, people,
they look at a human life

00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:45.500 align:middle line:84%
and they say it
has to have this,

00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:47.627 align:middle line:84%
it has to have that, it
has to have a balance.

00:56:47.627 --> 00:56:49.460 align:middle line:84%
So it has to have work,
it has to have this,

00:56:49.460 --> 00:56:50.750 align:middle line:90%
it has to have that.

00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:54.337 align:middle line:84%
And so people say, I go to
work, and then I'll go out,

00:56:54.337 --> 00:56:55.670 align:middle line:90%
and that's my chill time, right?

00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:58.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, often it isn't these
days, but that's my chill time,

00:56:58.620 --> 00:56:59.420 align:middle line:90%
they say.

00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:02.635 align:middle line:84%
I just see it over
a long period.

00:57:02.635 --> 00:57:06.787 align:middle line:84%
I feel my perception of my
life is I've come to work.

00:57:06.787 --> 00:57:08.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have come
to work, and you do.

00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:11.180 align:middle line:84%
I know you well enough to
know you work hard every day,

00:57:11.180 --> 00:57:12.222 align:middle line:90%
but you love what you do.

00:57:12.222 --> 00:57:13.021 align:middle line:90%
>>ICKE: Yeah.

00:57:13.021 --> 00:57:13.960 align:middle line:90%
But I've come to work.

00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:14.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm at work now.

00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:15.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're here.

00:57:15.110 --> 00:57:15.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:57:15.990 --> 00:57:17.660 align:middle line:90%
When you're out of your body.

00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:20.315 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: The person they call
David Icke has come to work.

00:57:20.315 --> 00:57:22.940 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize that for a long
time in my life, but I do now.

00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:24.890 align:middle line:90%
I've come to work.

00:57:24.890 --> 00:57:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And when I leave this reality,
I'll go and chill or something.

00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:32.450 align:middle line:84%
It's just seeing it over
a longer period than just

00:57:32.450 --> 00:57:34.040 align:middle line:90%
concertinaing it all into--

00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:36.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Into a week,
into a seven-day cycle.

00:57:36.170 --> 00:57:38.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: Into this transitory
threescore years and 10.

00:57:38.780 --> 00:57:39.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:42.020 align:middle line:84%
And people want to
know you, because they

00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:43.060 align:middle line:90%
want to know David.

00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:44.450 align:middle line:90%
They know this part of you.

00:57:44.450 --> 00:57:46.830 align:middle line:84%
The people that know your
work know that of you.

00:57:46.830 --> 00:57:50.280 align:middle line:84%
But there are other things
that you love and give you

00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:52.694 align:middle line:84%
great joy in life
besides just your work,

00:57:52.694 --> 00:57:54.110 align:middle line:84%
and I think the
viewers would love

00:57:54.110 --> 00:57:56.150 align:middle line:84%
to hear a couple things
that just kind of warm

00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:56.950 align:middle line:90%
your heart up.

00:57:56.950 --> 00:58:00.340 align:middle line:90%


00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:02.620 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: I love the
landscape of England.

00:58:02.620 --> 00:58:05.290 align:middle line:90%
I love landscape in general.

00:58:05.290 --> 00:58:08.490 align:middle line:90%
I think they're works of art.

00:58:08.490 --> 00:58:10.300 align:middle line:90%
I love seeing people happy.

00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:12.485 align:middle line:90%
That's what makes me cry.

00:58:12.485 --> 00:58:14.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I've
ever cried in my life

00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:18.370 align:middle line:84%
at something that was sad,
because my instincts are

00:58:18.370 --> 00:58:21.260 align:middle line:84%
if I can, I want to
do something about it.

00:58:21.260 --> 00:58:23.890 align:middle line:84%
What makes me cry
is people happy,

00:58:23.890 --> 00:58:28.870 align:middle line:84%
is people doing lovely
things for people.

00:58:28.870 --> 00:58:32.650 align:middle line:84%
That's what affects
me in that way.

00:58:32.650 --> 00:58:36.460 align:middle line:84%
So I get great joy from
seeing the kindness of people,

00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:38.680 align:middle line:90%
because people are kind.

00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:43.570 align:middle line:84%
You know, this distortion
is not all powerful,

00:58:43.570 --> 00:58:47.680 align:middle line:84%
and it's not all
controlling either.

00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:49.630 align:middle line:84%
It's just controlled
the positions of power

00:58:49.630 --> 00:58:51.220 align:middle line:84%
to a very large
extent, but it's not

00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:54.790 align:middle line:84%
controlled all the
processes and reactions

00:58:54.790 --> 00:58:56.990 align:middle line:90%
of the human population.

00:58:56.990 --> 00:59:02.380 align:middle line:84%
And you see this kindness
coming out in people often,

00:59:02.380 --> 00:59:03.890 align:middle line:90%
so I love that.

00:59:03.890 --> 00:59:07.152 align:middle line:90%
And you know, I just--

00:59:07.152 --> 00:59:08.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I can think
of a couple things,

00:59:08.860 --> 00:59:09.700 align:middle line:90%
just knowing you a bit.

00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:10.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ICKE: Oh, go on then.

00:59:10.230 --> 00:59:11.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:12.245 align:middle line:90%
You love choo choo trains.

00:59:12.245 --> 00:59:15.040 align:middle line:84%
You love steam trains
and riding on trains

00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:16.815 align:middle line:84%
and looking at the
country on trains.

00:59:16.815 --> 00:59:18.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: Yeah, I tell you
what that's connected you.

00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:20.440 align:middle line:84%
I tell you what
that's connected to.

00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:24.370 align:middle line:84%
It's connected to my
childhood, because there's

00:59:24.370 --> 00:59:27.130 align:middle line:84%
a film crew out of California
doing a film about my life

00:59:27.130 --> 00:59:29.050 align:middle line:90%
and work at the moment.

00:59:29.050 --> 00:59:33.430 align:middle line:84%
And I spoke back in Leicester,
my hometown in the English

00:59:33.430 --> 00:59:38.890 align:middle line:84%
Midlands about three weeks ago,
and went back to all the places

00:59:38.890 --> 00:59:41.380 align:middle line:84%
that I knew as a
kid, and you know,

00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:44.620 align:middle line:84%
where I used to
often watch trains.

00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:47.290 align:middle line:84%
But the trains, the steam
trains and all these

00:59:47.290 --> 00:59:49.620 align:middle line:84%
preserved lines in
England I like to go to,

00:59:49.620 --> 00:59:51.100 align:middle line:84%
they're basically
just taking you

00:59:51.100 --> 00:59:54.310 align:middle line:84%
back to what was a
lovely time in my life,

00:59:54.310 --> 00:59:56.020 align:middle line:90%
a simple time in my life.

00:59:56.020 --> 01:00:00.790 align:middle line:84%
I was born in 1952, and anyone
that was born more recently

01:00:00.790 --> 01:00:03.880 align:middle line:84%
would not believe how
different the world is

01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:06.100 align:middle line:90%
to when I was born in 1952.

01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:10.690 align:middle line:84%
It was a simple
life in the sense

01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:18.120 align:middle line:84%
that you had to make
your own pleasure.

01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:21.260 align:middle line:90%
You had to be imaginative.

01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:24.900 align:middle line:84%
And what I see with
children today--

01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:29.430 align:middle line:84%
and this I say is
absolutely systematic--

01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:34.530 align:middle line:84%
is they're not just
allowed to play and let

01:00:34.530 --> 01:00:39.990 align:middle line:84%
their imagination run riot
and go where it wants to go.

01:00:39.990 --> 01:00:43.230 align:middle line:84%
They're focused
all the time, not

01:00:43.230 --> 01:00:46.080 align:middle line:84%
least on these
technological devices.

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:49.230 align:middle line:84%
The more focused
you are, the more

01:00:49.230 --> 01:00:51.810 align:middle line:84%
you're shutting out
peripheral vision

01:00:51.810 --> 01:00:54.950 align:middle line:90%
and peripheral imagination.

01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And that, I think,
is not a good thing.

01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:58.300 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you one
of the things that

01:00:58.300 --> 01:01:00.480 align:middle line:84%
hit me when I went
back to the old house

01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:01.620 align:middle line:90%
where I was brought up.

01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:03.676 align:middle line:90%
My brother still lives there.

01:01:03.676 --> 01:01:04.800 align:middle line:90%
There was a green in front.

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:06.070 align:middle line:90%
It was a big council estate.

01:01:06.070 --> 01:01:06.870 align:middle line:90%
There was a green.

01:01:06.870 --> 01:01:09.880 align:middle line:84%
But I was fortunate, given
it was a council estate,

01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:13.050 align:middle line:84%
and normally it's houses
as far as the eye can see.

01:01:13.050 --> 01:01:15.990 align:middle line:84%
Because there was a green
just across from the house,

01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:19.940 align:middle line:84%
and there was this spinney,
this wood next to it

01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:21.980 align:middle line:90%
between two roads.

01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And so my childhood was climbing
trees and playing football

01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:26.430 align:middle line:90%
on that green.

01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:29.700 align:middle line:90%
And there were kids everywhere.

01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:31.620 align:middle line:84%
There were kids out
playing football,

01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:33.240 align:middle line:84%
there were kids
climbing trees, there

01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:36.420 align:middle line:84%
were kids playing hide
and seek in the forest.

01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And I went back, and
first of all, there

01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:47.130 align:middle line:84%
was a tree that was
planted at that time.

01:01:47.130 --> 01:01:50.670 align:middle line:90%
Made me think, about time.

01:01:50.670 --> 01:01:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And it was a sapling,
and it was tied

01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:58.590 align:middle line:84%
to a post to hold it up
till it got to some size,

01:01:58.590 --> 01:02:00.405 align:middle line:90%
could grow on its own.

01:02:00.405 --> 01:02:01.590 align:middle line:90%
That was our goal post.

01:02:01.590 --> 01:02:02.520 align:middle line:90%
That was that post.

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And we put a coat down the
other side for the other post.

01:02:05.070 --> 01:02:05.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:06.876 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: I went
back two weeks ago.

01:02:06.876 --> 01:02:10.800 align:middle line:84%
That tree's about this big
now, this sapling I remember.

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:13.750 align:middle line:84%
But you know what
hit me when I looked?

01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:14.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No kids.

01:02:14.550 --> 01:02:15.460 align:middle line:90%
>>ICKE: No children.

01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:16.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:18.750 align:middle line:84%
And the media has
perpetuated this notion.

01:02:18.750 --> 01:02:22.530 align:middle line:84%
In the US, they call it stranger
danger, stranger danger.

01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:25.230 align:middle line:84%
You walk around in the
US, and these little kids

01:02:25.230 --> 01:02:26.830 align:middle line:90%
won't smile at you.

01:02:26.830 --> 01:02:28.590 align:middle line:90%
You can-- hi, you know?

01:02:28.590 --> 01:02:30.270 align:middle line:84%
Most of them will
not smile back.

01:02:30.270 --> 01:02:32.430 align:middle line:84%
They'll kind of retract,
like, stranger danger.

01:02:32.430 --> 01:02:33.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm not supposed to talk to you.

01:02:33.990 --> 01:02:35.640 align:middle line:90%
I don't already know you.

01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:38.260 align:middle line:90%
This to me is-- that is sad.

01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:41.910 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: Yeah, the houses
where I was brought up

01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:43.274 align:middle line:90%
are family houses.

01:02:43.274 --> 01:02:45.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's like
public housing in America.

01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:47.310 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: Yeah, but
they're family houses.

01:02:47.310 --> 01:02:48.210 align:middle line:90%
You know?

01:02:48.210 --> 01:02:50.520 align:middle line:90%
They're big enough for families.

01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And so families still
live in them today.

01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:56.990 align:middle line:90%
But where are the children?

01:02:56.990 --> 01:03:03.125 align:middle line:84%
And this is changing
the way that children

01:03:03.125 --> 01:03:05.515 align:middle line:90%
and young people's brains work.

01:03:05.515 --> 01:03:06.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:08.181 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: It's changing
the way they perceive

01:03:08.181 --> 01:03:10.140 align:middle line:84%
the world, because you
know, I've been saying

01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:16.900 align:middle line:84%
for a long time, you know,
the generations that were born

01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:19.150 align:middle line:84%
before this great
transformation,

01:03:19.150 --> 01:03:22.690 align:middle line:84%
this great technological
transformation at least,

01:03:22.690 --> 01:03:26.830 align:middle line:84%
have a big responsibility
in the sense

01:03:26.830 --> 01:03:31.990 align:middle line:84%
that we can remember what it
was like against what it is now.

01:03:31.990 --> 01:03:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we have a
radar or a perceptual range

01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:44.290 align:middle line:84%
that can see the dramatic,
almost indescribable changes

01:03:44.290 --> 01:03:46.750 align:middle line:84%
that have taken place
in such a short time.

01:03:46.750 --> 01:03:48.970 align:middle line:84%
Whereas people born and
kids born into the world

01:03:48.970 --> 01:03:52.690 align:middle line:84%
today or born in
the recent past,

01:03:52.690 --> 01:03:54.047 align:middle line:90%
they're born into it as it is.

01:03:54.047 --> 01:03:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And of course, what
people tend to do,

01:03:55.630 --> 01:03:58.171 align:middle line:84%
we all do is when you come into
the world, you tend to think,

01:03:58.171 --> 01:04:00.520 align:middle line:90%
this is how it is.

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And so they're being born
into a world of to them,

01:04:05.230 --> 01:04:06.940 align:middle line:90%
this is how it is.

01:04:06.940 --> 01:04:10.670 align:middle line:84%
Whereas to someone like me
born in 1952, it's like, whoa.

01:04:10.670 --> 01:04:14.930 align:middle line:84%
The transformation in such
a short time is incredible.

01:04:14.930 --> 01:04:18.580 align:middle line:90%
And so it's a radar.

01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:22.300 align:middle line:84%
It's a perceptual
range that when

01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:30.900 align:middle line:84%
the generations of the '50s
and '60s even have gone,

01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:32.890 align:middle line:90%
that will not be there.

01:04:32.890 --> 01:04:33.750 align:middle line:90%
This is how it is.

01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:35.958 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, can I just
add something that kind of

01:04:35.958 --> 01:04:38.130 align:middle line:90%
gives me a little bit of hope?

01:04:38.130 --> 01:04:41.370 align:middle line:84%
You know, you look to
kind of pop culture

01:04:41.370 --> 01:04:44.370 align:middle line:84%
to see where the collective
mind might be headed.

01:04:44.370 --> 01:04:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And there's an interesting
magazine that has just

01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:48.247 align:middle line:90%
appeared in the United States.

01:04:48.247 --> 01:04:49.080 align:middle line:90%
It's not well-known.

01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:51.940 align:middle line:84%
It's I think it's only
had three editions so far.

01:04:51.940 --> 01:04:53.760 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
"Farmhouse Movement."

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And what it's doing,
it's by millennials,

01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:57.570 align:middle line:84%
and it's written
for millennials.

01:04:57.570 --> 01:05:00.340 align:middle line:84%
Very short articles, lots
of beautiful pictures,

01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:03.370 align:middle line:84%
but a lot of lovely
how-tos and so forth

01:05:03.370 --> 01:05:05.670 align:middle line:84%
to get your fingers
dirty, get your kids off

01:05:05.670 --> 01:05:08.880 align:middle line:84%
of technology, back to the
land, raising little chickens

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:11.940 align:middle line:84%
and animals, even if you just
have a tiny plot of land.

01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:14.490 align:middle line:84%
And where I'm living
in Penryn, California,

01:05:14.490 --> 01:05:16.860 align:middle line:84%
all the older fellows
have either died off

01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:20.580 align:middle line:90%
or sold and gone to homes.

01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And this land is
all being bought

01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:25.200 align:middle line:84%
by young families with two
and three little kids who

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:26.830 align:middle line:90%
are all raising little animals.

01:05:26.830 --> 01:05:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And this is, in my
area, ubiquitous now.

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:31.850 align:middle line:84%
Everyone around us are
these young families.

01:05:31.850 --> 01:05:36.390 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: Well, this is a point
that's important to make

01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:43.970 align:middle line:84%
is that it's very clear when
you observe young people today

01:05:43.970 --> 01:05:47.000 align:middle line:84%
the difference between the
conscious and the unconscious.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

01:05:48.010 --> 01:05:53.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: Because for me,
the young generations today

01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:57.310 align:middle line:84%
are the most
perceptually targeted

01:05:57.310 --> 01:06:00.130 align:middle line:84%
and certainly-- well, I would
say in human history because

01:06:00.130 --> 01:06:04.960 align:middle line:84%
of the technological impact of
that perceptual programming.

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And you're seeing this creation
of the snowflake mentality

01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:17.700 align:middle line:84%
where people call
themselves anti-fascists

01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:20.730 align:middle line:84%
while acting like Nazis in
terms of destroying freedom

01:06:20.730 --> 01:06:23.340 align:middle line:90%
of speech and everything.

01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And they are in so many
ways the Stormtroopers

01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:30.690 align:middle line:90%
of the Orwellian world.

01:06:30.690 --> 01:06:33.030 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
you see young people,

01:06:33.030 --> 01:06:37.530 align:middle line:84%
who despite the programming,
despite the perceptual

01:06:37.530 --> 01:06:42.240 align:middle line:84%
targeting from birth,
basically, have seen through it

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:44.040 align:middle line:90%
and are seeing through it.

01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:46.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's the power of
consciousness over program.

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And the program is
the village idiot.

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:54.930 align:middle line:84%
It's the two-stone weakling
compared with consciousness

01:06:54.930 --> 01:06:55.770 align:middle line:90%
in its power.

01:06:55.770 --> 01:06:59.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
system has to work

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:05.970 align:middle line:84%
so hard to keep the population
in this perceptually programmed

01:07:05.970 --> 01:07:10.650 align:middle line:84%
state, because it's terrified
of people waking up.

01:07:10.650 --> 01:07:11.630 align:middle line:90%
Which means what?

01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:13.240 align:middle line:90%
What does waking up mean?

01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:15.600 align:middle line:84%
If you are
consciousness, but you're

01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:19.590 align:middle line:84%
operating within a bubble
of that consciousness which

01:07:19.590 --> 01:07:24.535 align:middle line:84%
I would call perception,
then waking up

01:07:24.535 --> 01:07:28.110 align:middle line:90%
is not finding something.

01:07:28.110 --> 01:07:30.690 align:middle line:90%
It's not even seeking something.

01:07:30.690 --> 01:07:36.180 align:middle line:84%
It's removing the perceptual
onion skins of programming

01:07:36.180 --> 01:07:38.820 align:middle line:90%
to allow the true self in.

01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:41.310 align:middle line:84%
It's basically
deleting the virus

01:07:41.310 --> 01:07:45.670 align:middle line:84%
so we start hearing the
mouse and the keyboard again.

01:07:45.670 --> 01:07:46.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

01:07:46.470 --> 01:07:49.620 align:middle line:90%


01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:52.380 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: This is
one of the things

01:07:52.380 --> 01:07:55.500 align:middle line:84%
that I won't say has
irritated me over the years,

01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:58.460 align:middle line:90%
but it's made me shake my head.

01:07:58.460 --> 01:08:04.320 align:middle line:84%
You know when people
want power, they

01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:09.690 align:middle line:84%
want people to think
they have something

01:08:09.690 --> 01:08:17.130 align:middle line:84%
that others don't have, and that
it's very difficult and complex

01:08:17.130 --> 01:08:25.490 align:middle line:84%
and time consuming
over a period for you

01:08:25.490 --> 01:08:28.670 align:middle line:84%
that don't have it to
have what I have, right?

01:08:28.670 --> 01:08:34.990 align:middle line:84%
Now that's power, because you're
telling people how difficult it

01:08:34.990 --> 01:08:36.950 align:middle line:90%
is to be like me.

01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:37.750 align:middle line:90%
It isn't.

01:08:37.750 --> 01:08:38.569 align:middle line:90%
It's a hoax.

01:08:38.569 --> 01:08:39.369 align:middle line:90%
It's another hoax.

01:08:39.369 --> 01:08:41.859 align:middle line:90%


01:08:41.859 --> 01:08:43.399 align:middle line:90%
I've never meditated in my life.

01:08:43.399 --> 01:08:45.720 align:middle line:90%
I've nothing against it.

01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:46.520 align:middle line:90%
I say meditate.

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:47.811 align:middle line:90%
I don't sit there cross-legged.

01:08:47.811 --> 01:08:49.200 align:middle line:90%
I've got arthritis in my knees.

01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:50.939 align:middle line:90%
Can't cross my knees anyway.

01:08:50.939 --> 01:08:54.596 align:middle line:84%
But I daydream a lot, let my
mind go where it wants to go.

01:08:54.596 --> 01:08:55.720 align:middle line:90%
I do that most of the time.

01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:58.899 align:middle line:90%
It's my basically base state.

01:08:58.899 --> 01:09:05.630 align:middle line:90%
But I don't fast, you know?

01:09:05.630 --> 01:09:10.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't go out and sit
in a forest for a month.

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:13.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't do any of this stuff,
which you're supposed to do.

01:09:13.770 --> 01:09:17.040 align:middle line:84%
Or go on a quest
and all this stuff.

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:20.532 align:middle line:84%
You know, go and
sit in a sweat lodge

01:09:20.532 --> 01:09:21.740 align:middle line:90%
for days on end or something.

01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:22.674 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:09:22.674 --> 01:09:24.899 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not knocking
any of those things.

01:09:24.899 --> 01:09:27.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm not knocking
any of those things.

01:09:27.180 --> 01:09:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure some people
find them beneficial.

01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:36.930 align:middle line:84%
What I'm saying is it's not
as complex as it's made out.

01:09:36.930 --> 01:09:40.080 align:middle line:90%
We are consciousness.

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:43.290 align:middle line:84%
The scale of the
consciousness we are

01:09:43.290 --> 01:09:50.529 align:middle line:84%
has been imprisoned and
enslaved by myopic perception,

01:09:50.529 --> 01:09:54.180 align:middle line:90%
myopic self-identity.

01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:59.470 align:middle line:84%
We change the self-identity,
everything changes.

01:09:59.470 --> 01:10:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And no cross-legged on
a mountain necessary.

01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:07.030 align:middle line:84%
No walking around temples
in India necessary.

01:10:07.030 --> 01:10:12.910 align:middle line:84%
Just re self-identity
of who we are.

01:10:12.910 --> 01:10:15.330 align:middle line:90%
And from that, everything comes.

01:10:15.330 --> 01:10:18.940 align:middle line:84%
Just for a month, just
for a month try it.

01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:21.790 align:middle line:84%
Go through your life
self-identifying

01:10:21.790 --> 01:10:26.170 align:middle line:84%
with being all that is,
has been, and ever can be,

01:10:26.170 --> 01:10:28.000 align:middle line:90%
having an experience.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.780 align:middle line:84%
All consciousness,
all possibility,

01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:35.610 align:middle line:84%
having an experience, and
seeing the labels that

01:10:35.610 --> 01:10:39.900 align:middle line:84%
were your previous self-identity
as merely a set of experiences

01:10:39.900 --> 01:10:40.900 align:middle line:90%
we're having.

01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:42.295 align:middle line:90%
And I tell you what.

01:10:42.295 --> 01:10:47.306 align:middle line:84%
If you do that and mean it, you
watch the experiences change.

01:10:47.306 --> 01:10:48.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

01:10:48.180 --> 01:10:49.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: You watch the
experiences change.

01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:50.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, it's very true.

01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to end
on this one thing,

01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:54.580 align:middle line:84%
because I think
it's so appropriate.

01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:58.300 align:middle line:84%
This was on page 666 of
your book, by the way.

01:10:58.300 --> 01:10:59.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ICKE: Oh, symbolic.

01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:00.179 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's symbolic.

01:11:00.179 --> 01:11:03.790 align:middle line:84%
And it says, "No one
rules if no one obeys."

01:11:03.790 --> 01:11:05.080 align:middle line:90%
It's not about protest.

01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:09.559 align:middle line:84%
It's about mass non-cooperation
with the program.

01:11:09.559 --> 01:11:10.600 align:middle line:90%
>>ICKE: That's all it is.

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:17.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we have the
fault lines of divide and rule

01:11:17.830 --> 01:11:23.290 align:middle line:84%
falling into greater and greater
minutiae of detail, which

01:11:23.290 --> 01:11:26.110 align:middle line:84%
is coming from the greater
and greater subdivision

01:11:26.110 --> 01:11:28.240 align:middle line:90%
of self-identity.

01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:30.880 align:middle line:84%
You know, there was
a time, for instance,

01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:36.670 align:middle line:84%
when you had the idea that
I'm a man or I'm a woman,

01:11:36.670 --> 01:11:39.610 align:middle line:84%
or I'm black, I'm
white, whatever.

01:11:39.610 --> 01:11:44.320 align:middle line:84%
These were
self-identities, which

01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:48.064 align:middle line:84%
could have divide and rule
fault lines put between them.

01:11:48.064 --> 01:11:49.480 align:middle line:84%
Because when there's
a few and you

01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:51.790 align:middle line:84%
want to control a
vast population,

01:11:51.790 --> 01:11:54.503 align:middle line:84%
you've got to get the vast
population at war with itself.

01:11:54.503 --> 01:11:57.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

01:11:57.070 --> 01:11:58.820 align:middle line:84%
Which we do politics
and everything else.

01:11:58.820 --> 01:11:59.620 align:middle line:90%
>>ICKE: Exactly.

01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:02.535 align:middle line:84%
If the population, your
total population is united,

01:12:02.535 --> 01:12:04.620 align:middle line:90%
then you've got a big problem.

01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:07.330 align:middle line:84%
If it's in harmony, you've
got a massive problem.

01:12:07.330 --> 01:12:10.780 align:middle line:84%
You need a disharmonious,
chaotic state

01:12:10.780 --> 01:12:15.430 align:middle line:84%
of inter-label
conflict, and then you

01:12:15.430 --> 01:12:18.580 align:middle line:84%
can pull the strings of
everyone without them realizing

01:12:18.580 --> 01:12:24.230 align:middle line:90%
there are any strings at all.

01:12:24.230 --> 01:12:27.710 align:middle line:10%
And what we're seeing now with
this whole transgender thing--

01:12:27.710 --> 01:12:29.770 align:middle line:10%
I could talk about
that for hours

01:12:29.770 --> 01:12:32.110 align:middle line:10%
and why that's suddenly
come out of nowhere--

01:12:32.110 --> 01:12:37.210 align:middle line:10%
is the minutiae of self-identity
subdividing and subdividing.

01:12:37.210 --> 01:12:40.460 align:middle line:10%
We've had feminists and
transgender activists

01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:42.320 align:middle line:10%
having fights in the
street in Britain.

01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:45.680 align:middle line:90%


01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:53.530 align:middle line:84%
And so the more you subdivide
self-identity into I am are,

01:12:53.530 --> 01:12:56.020 align:middle line:84%
and then there's a lot of
letters, a lot of letters--

01:12:56.020 --> 01:12:59.310 align:middle line:90%


01:12:59.310 --> 01:13:01.150 align:middle line:90%
where am I in them letters?

01:13:01.150 --> 01:13:01.950 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you're there.

01:13:01.950 --> 01:13:02.750 align:middle line:90%
You're them too.

01:13:02.750 --> 01:13:04.040 align:middle line:90%
You know, all this stuff.

01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:05.560 align:middle line:90%
I mean, hello?

01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:08.530 align:middle line:84%
Then the further
you're moving away

01:13:08.530 --> 01:13:13.210 align:middle line:84%
from self-identity
with consciousness

01:13:13.210 --> 01:13:18.220 align:middle line:84%
to self-identity with not just
labels, though certainly that,

01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:22.450 align:middle line:84%
sub-labels, but with the world
of the five senses, which

01:13:22.450 --> 01:13:26.680 align:middle line:84%
self-identifies with the
body, not with consciousness.

01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:28.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, indeed.

01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:31.090 align:middle line:84%
David, on that
note, gosh, this has

01:13:31.090 --> 01:13:32.560 align:middle line:90%
been a wonderful conversation.

01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:34.420 align:middle line:90%
I've absolutely loved it.

01:13:34.420 --> 01:13:36.880 align:middle line:84%
I think we covered the
depth of it pretty well.

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:39.910 align:middle line:84%
Is there any final statement
you'd like to make?

01:13:39.910 --> 01:13:42.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, yes, we could talk
for another 10 or 12 hours,

01:13:42.590 --> 01:13:45.370 align:middle line:84%
but considering this is
roughly an hour interview.

01:13:45.370 --> 01:13:46.540 align:middle line:90%
>>ICKE: OK.

01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, again, we come back
to the self-identity.

01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:53.400 align:middle line:90%
Who is the I?

01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:55.000 align:middle line:90%
Are you little me I?

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.190 align:middle line:84%
In which case, you will
live a little me life.

01:13:58.190 --> 01:14:00.610 align:middle line:84%
Or are you infinite
me I, in which case

01:14:00.610 --> 01:14:02.980 align:middle line:84%
your life will be
dramatically different?

01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:08.440 align:middle line:10%
Because possibility is only
what we believe it to be.

01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:12.640 align:middle line:10%
The more you believe in I
can't, the more you won't.

01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:16.220 align:middle line:84%
The more you believe
in I can do anything,

01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:21.970 align:middle line:84%
the more you will experience
what you perceive.

01:14:21.970 --> 01:14:24.640 align:middle line:90%
What you believe, you perceive.

01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:26.870 align:middle line:84%
What you perceive,
you experience.

01:14:26.870 --> 01:14:30.280 align:middle line:10%
And I had some
posters made which

01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:35.560 align:middle line:10%
say, change your perception,
change your life.

01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:39.860 align:middle line:10%
Because your life
is your perception.

01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:42.280 align:middle line:84%
And these people
are manipulating

01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:44.590 align:middle line:90%
human society know that.

01:14:44.590 --> 01:14:46.120 align:middle line:90%
They know that dynamic.

01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:48.740 align:middle line:84%
They know that one
causes the other.

01:14:48.740 --> 01:14:50.470 align:middle line:84%
They know if they can
get our perception,

01:14:50.470 --> 01:14:52.660 align:middle line:90%
they've got our experience.

01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:56.320 align:middle line:84%
We take our perception back,
we take our lives back.

01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:58.690 align:middle line:90%
No meditation necessary.

>>REGINA: Thank you so
much on that note, David.

01:15:01.542 --> 01:15:03.000 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
being the warrior

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.130 align:middle line:90%
you've been the last 30 years.

01:15:04.130 --> 01:15:05.170 align:middle line:84%
I know everybody
thanks you for that.

01:15:05.170 --> 01:15:07.030 align:middle line:84%
But it's not been easy
doing what you do.

01:15:07.030 --> 01:15:09.990 align:middle line:84%
You go through a lot to
do it, but you love it.

01:15:09.990 --> 01:15:11.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: I do, and
it gets easier.

01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:12.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does.

01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:14.300 align:middle line:90%
And you get younger as a result.

>>ICKE: Yeah, that looks nice.

01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:17.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're hacking
into the matrix yourself.

01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:20.620 align:middle line:84%
Really, you look younger than
when I saw you five years ago.

01:15:20.620 --> 01:15:22.600 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, thank you, David.

01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:25.554 align:middle line:10%
