>> Regina Meredith: Throughout
the last few centuries,

00:00:23.624 --> 00:00:26.627 align:middle line:84%
angels have been depicted
as human beings with wings,

00:00:26.627 --> 00:00:29.663 align:middle line:84%
but what if those beautiful
orbs that show up in photographs

00:00:29.663 --> 00:00:33.200 align:middle line:84%
and that many of us see with our
naked eye are the real angels?

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.769 align:middle line:90%
Author Stuart Pierce says

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:36.904 align:middle line:84%
that they are here
surrounding us all the time

00:00:36.904 --> 00:00:39.173 align:middle line:84%
and are simply waiting to
be addressed and called

00:00:39.173 --> 00:00:40.975 align:middle line:84%
up if we wish to
have their help.

00:00:40.975 --> 00:00:43.844 align:middle line:84%
He has an interesting personal
history with the angels

00:00:43.844 --> 00:00:46.680 align:middle line:84%
and a circuitous path to
sharing this information with us

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.216 align:middle line:84%
through his book, "The
Angels of Atlantis."

00:00:49.216 --> 00:00:51.819 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very
intriguing title on its own.

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:54.688 align:middle line:84%
I haven't seen anything
out there that alies them

00:00:54.688 --> 00:00:57.057 align:middle line:90%
with Atlantis specifically.

00:00:57.057 --> 00:00:59.994 align:middle line:84%
And your book is so
beautifully done.

00:00:59.994 --> 00:01:01.228 align:middle line:84%
>> Stewart Pearce:
Oh, thank you.

00:01:01.228 --> 00:01:02.396 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Clearly
you're a perfectionist

00:01:02.396 --> 00:01:05.032 align:middle line:84%
in your studies, but
also it's not just that,

00:01:05.032 --> 00:01:07.968 align:middle line:84%
it's that they've spoken
to you through your heart,

00:01:07.968 --> 00:01:09.637 align:middle line:84%
really since you were
a very young child.

00:01:09.637 --> 00:01:12.473 align:middle line:84%
So as our audience gets
to know you a little bit,

00:01:12.473 --> 00:01:14.141 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about
your first experience

00:01:14.141 --> 00:01:16.710 align:middle line:90%
with angels back as a wee one?

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.879 align:middle line:84%
And also, I could just sit
here and listen to you.

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:20.748 align:middle line:84%
I wish I didn't have
to do an interview.

00:01:20.748 --> 00:01:22.550 align:middle line:84%
I wish you could
just tell us stories.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:23.951 align:middle line:90%
I love your voice.

00:01:23.951 --> 00:01:27.754 align:middle line:84%
>> Stewart Pearce: Once upon a
time there was a fairy prince.

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:34.028 align:middle line:84%
So once upon a time, there
was a child, namely myself,

00:01:34.028 --> 00:01:40.000 align:middle line:84%
and we shared prior to coming
on camera about meeting Michael,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.468 align:middle line:84%
Archangel Michael
that is, when I was 6,

00:01:42.468 --> 00:01:45.339 align:middle line:84%
but actually there was
something that preceded that.

00:01:45.339 --> 00:01:47.808 align:middle line:84%
Because I can remember,
I never, ever,

00:01:47.808 --> 00:01:53.480 align:middle line:84%
ever felt as though I wasn't
surrounded by an angelic form

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.482 align:middle line:84%
but now, the consiousness
of the 2,

00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:58.018 align:middle line:84%
3-year old who really
didn't speak very much

00:01:58.018 --> 00:02:01.655 align:middle line:84%
but was just simply
consumed by the wonderment

00:02:01.655 --> 00:02:03.958 align:middle line:84%
of what it was to
be a human being.

00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.793 align:middle line:84%
I believe that's what
it was all about.

00:02:05.793 --> 00:02:08.395 align:middle line:84%
But I always felt that
there was this presence

00:02:08.395 --> 00:02:10.464 align:middle line:90%
in the space wherever I was.

00:02:10.464 --> 00:02:13.300 align:middle line:90%
Even in sleeping consciousness,

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.202 align:middle line:84%
I felt that there
was something there,

00:02:15.202 --> 00:02:17.404 align:middle line:84%
which of course now I
appreciate the vastness

00:02:17.404 --> 00:02:20.874 align:middle line:84%
of the morphogenetic field,
the vastness of consciousness.

00:02:20.874 --> 00:02:21.976 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:02:21.976 --> 00:02:23.210 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: But I felt these
light beings coming

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.945 align:middle line:90%
through all the time; however,

00:02:24.945 --> 00:02:27.381 align:middle line:84%
the first major administration
was,

00:02:27.381 --> 00:02:29.683 align:middle line:84%
as I shared with you
earlier, when I was 6,

00:02:29.683 --> 00:02:31.752 align:middle line:84%
and I remember standing
outside this building

00:02:31.752 --> 00:02:35.723 align:middle line:84%
which I was very affected
by because the emination was

00:02:35.723 --> 00:02:37.458 align:middle line:84%
so rich, and I remember
turning to my mother

00:02:37.458 --> 00:02:38.993 align:middle line:90%
and saying, "Where are we?"

00:02:38.993 --> 00:02:42.429 align:middle line:84%
And she said, "This is a
church, and it's dedicated

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:44.832 align:middle line:90%
to Michael and all angels."

00:02:44.832 --> 00:02:48.102 align:middle line:84%
And there was this large --
it was a modern sculpture --

00:02:48.102 --> 00:02:49.937 align:middle line:84%
not a modern sculpture;
I mean, it was post-war,

00:02:49.937 --> 00:02:51.171 align:middle line:90%
post Second World War --

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:55.276 align:middle line:84%
sculpture on the side of
this church, and this being

00:02:55.276 --> 00:02:58.946 align:middle line:84%
as it were, looked to me
and as it were, winked.

00:02:58.946 --> 00:03:02.182 align:middle line:84%
But what I heard within my
6-year-old consciousness was,

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:05.386 align:middle line:84%
"I will always be
with you, remember."

00:03:05.386 --> 00:03:06.787 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:03:06.787 --> 00:03:09.890 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: And that is indeed true,
and Michael has steered my path

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.060 align:middle line:84%
through a very extraordinary
process

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.296 align:middle line:90%
up to this point, really.

00:03:15.296 --> 00:03:18.032 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: But Michael isn't
necessarily a beautiful,

00:03:18.032 --> 00:03:19.533 align:middle line:90%
blond-haired Caucasian?

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:20.934 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: No, not at
all, not at all.

00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:24.805 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I'm saying, you know,
the way the angels are depicted.

00:03:24.805 --> 00:03:27.975 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: Yeah, exactly, exactly,
and so to pick up the theme

00:03:27.975 --> 00:03:32.246 align:middle line:84%
of what you set for us in your
introduction, that I never,

00:03:32.246 --> 00:03:35.883 align:middle line:84%
ever saw the angels as a
human being with wings,

00:03:35.883 --> 00:03:38.085 align:middle line:84%
looking in there like as
you say, a blonde Caucasian,

00:03:38.085 --> 00:03:40.086 align:middle line:84%
or indeed, an angel
with black skin,

00:03:40.086 --> 00:03:43.190 align:middle line:90%
or yellow skin or red skin.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.795 align:middle line:84%
These beings were always
extraordinary connumbs of light,

00:03:47.795 --> 00:03:53.600 align:middle line:84%
or these brilliant orbs, which
I learned early were plasmic

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.904 align:middle line:84%
forces that they were
refractions of photonic light,

00:03:56.904 --> 00:04:00.207 align:middle line:84%
that they said, "We are
plasma, we are made of fire,

00:04:00.207 --> 00:04:03.677 align:middle line:84%
Just as you are made of star
seed, we are made of fire

00:04:03.677 --> 00:04:07.514 align:middle line:84%
and therefore we have a
lineage that is corresponding.

00:04:07.514 --> 00:04:09.550 align:middle line:84%
It's just that your physical
form is somewhat different

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:10.684 align:middle line:90%
to us."

00:04:10.684 --> 00:04:13.887 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And that was very
validating for myself,

00:04:13.887 --> 00:04:16.357 align:middle line:84%
and I think will be for many,
many people watching this,

00:04:16.357 --> 00:04:18.591 align:middle line:90%
because I often see these orbs.

00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:21.462 align:middle line:84%
I see certain colors of
orbs around certain people,

00:04:21.462 --> 00:04:23.831 align:middle line:84%
and when certain
truths are being spoken,

00:04:23.831 --> 00:04:27.234 align:middle line:84%
a very specific type of
orb and color comes in,

00:04:27.234 --> 00:04:29.036 align:middle line:84%
and I had always thought
"Gee, what a shame.

00:04:29.036 --> 00:04:31.238 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to see those
angels with wings."

00:04:31.238 --> 00:04:33.440 align:middle line:90%
And that's not how I see it.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.111 align:middle line:84%
Just as you say, columns
of light and orbs.

00:04:37.111 --> 00:04:39.179 align:middle line:84%
So this isn't that
we're deficient

00:04:39.179 --> 00:04:40.948 align:middle line:90%
in some way in our inner sight.

00:04:40.948 --> 00:04:43.283 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: Yeah, it's very
interesting, isn't it,

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:46.053 align:middle line:84%
because now we're becoming
more aware of all phenomenon.

00:04:46.053 --> 00:04:47.321 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:04:47.321 --> 00:04:49.056 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: And vastly aware
because of digital photography.

00:04:49.056 --> 00:04:52.192 align:middle line:84%
But I do remember way before the
digital photography scene became

00:04:52.192 --> 00:04:56.330 align:middle line:84%
the fashionable thing, or
became within our attention,

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.998 align:middle line:90%
where the angel said to me,

00:04:57.998 --> 00:05:00.667 align:middle line:84%
"What do you know
about angelology?"

00:05:00.667 --> 00:05:02.970 align:middle line:84%
And the tone was
almost scornful.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.371 align:middle line:90%
I was chastened.

00:05:04.371 --> 00:05:07.608 align:middle line:84%
And so what I did was to spend
as much time as possible in some

00:05:07.608 --> 00:05:09.209 align:middle line:84%
of the great libraries
of the world,

00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:11.678 align:middle line:90%
really delving into angelology.

00:05:11.678 --> 00:05:14.815 align:middle line:84%
And there are some very
considerable living mystics

00:05:14.815 --> 00:05:16.617 align:middle line:90%
that were very useful to me,

00:05:16.617 --> 00:05:19.153 align:middle line:84%
such as the wonderful
Rubin Sheldrick,

00:05:19.153 --> 00:05:20.988 align:middle line:90%
writing about angelololic field.

00:05:20.988 --> 00:05:23.590 align:middle line:84%
And this unique conversation
that he had with Matthew Faulks,

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.394 align:middle line:84%
whose teaching I
absolutely admire.

00:05:27.394 --> 00:05:31.031 align:middle line:84%
However, there I was in
these world great libraries,

00:05:31.031 --> 00:05:34.001 align:middle line:84%
and reading about Hildegard
of Bingen and reading

00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:36.670 align:middle line:84%
about Dionysus the Areopagite
and John on the Cross.

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.573 align:middle line:84%
And they all said
angels are orbs of light.

00:05:39.573 --> 00:05:40.908 align:middle line:90%
They were seeing orbs of light.

00:05:40.908 --> 00:05:41.909 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Thank you.

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:43.377 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: So when was
Hildegard living?

00:05:43.377 --> 00:05:44.044 align:middle line:90%
12th century?

00:05:44.044 --> 00:05:44.812 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Mm-hm.

00:05:44.812 --> 00:05:46.513 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: So it's apparent

00:05:46.513 --> 00:05:50.918 align:middle line:84%
that there is something very
extraordinary about the geometry

00:05:50.918 --> 00:05:54.688 align:middle line:84%
of the orb, or at least
the circular manifestation.

00:05:54.688 --> 00:05:59.126 align:middle line:84%
And I understand in terms
of sacred acoustics,

00:05:59.126 --> 00:06:04.298 align:middle line:84%
that very high vibrations of
sound are also cyclic or orblike

00:06:04.298 --> 00:06:08.168 align:middle line:84%
when they move from the wavelike
manifestation that we see

00:06:08.168 --> 00:06:10.070 align:middle line:84%
into the very higher
frequencies.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not a scientist, so
if anybody's listening to this

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.642 align:middle line:84%
and has corroboration of
what that's all about,

00:06:15.642 --> 00:06:16.877 align:middle line:90%
I'd be very interested.

00:06:16.877 --> 00:06:18.378 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well, you've
had corroboration

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:20.047 align:middle line:90%
and photographs, certainly.

00:06:20.047 --> 00:06:22.382 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: Indeed, true,
just purely for sound.

00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:23.784 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: And many people have.

00:06:23.784 --> 00:06:28.088 align:middle line:84%
I have also taken photographs
of this nature and people look

00:06:28.088 --> 00:06:31.190 align:middle line:84%
at it and they say, "just some
issue of play with the light."

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.426 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: Yes.

00:06:32.426 --> 00:06:34.761 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Now, tell us why
that is absolutely not true.

00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:36.763 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: Well, of course on
occasion I believe it is.

00:06:36.763 --> 00:06:37.531 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: But not with...

00:06:37.531 --> 00:06:38.665 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: But it would be...

00:06:38.665 --> 00:06:39.199 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: We're going to
see some in a minute...

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:40.133 align:middle line:90%
maybe you...

00:06:40.133 --> 00:06:41.535 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: We'll see
some photographs,

00:06:41.535 --> 00:06:43.170 align:middle line:84%
because people are very kindly
have heard about the authority

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.072 align:middle line:84%
of the witness that
I bring forth

00:06:45.072 --> 00:06:46.874 align:middle line:84%
through these 12
extraordinary angels.

00:06:46.874 --> 00:06:48.842 align:middle line:90%
So therefore semi-photographs,

00:06:48.842 --> 00:06:51.678 align:middle line:84%
and often very ordinary
photographs in their bedrooms,

00:06:51.678 --> 00:06:53.914 align:middle line:84%
and I very kindly exchanged
with them and said, "well,

00:06:53.914 --> 00:06:55.382 align:middle line:90%
thank you very much, indeed."

00:06:55.382 --> 00:06:58.252 align:middle line:84%
But actually what I'm really
looking for is something

00:06:58.252 --> 00:07:00.787 align:middle line:84%
like this but in
a refined context,

00:07:00.787 --> 00:07:03.657 align:middle line:84%
not from any social class
point of view but just purely

00:07:03.657 --> 00:07:07.327 align:middle line:84%
and simply in terms of
seeking photographs that are

00:07:07.327 --> 00:07:09.596 align:middle line:84%
within sacred space,
so that we actually see

00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:14.535 align:middle line:84%
that these immense beings, these
orb wanderers, the shining ones,

00:07:14.535 --> 00:07:16.904 align:middle line:84%
come forth at this
time, because they wish

00:07:16.904 --> 00:07:20.607 align:middle line:84%
to venerate the whole substance
of what it is to be human,

00:07:20.607 --> 00:07:24.545 align:middle line:84%
to be divine in flesh,
which is also why they work

00:07:24.545 --> 00:07:26.213 align:middle line:84%
through the vibration
of sound so much...

00:07:26.213 --> 00:07:27.147 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:07:27.147 --> 00:07:28.115 align:middle line:84%
>> SP ...because
of course we know

00:07:28.115 --> 00:07:29.249 align:middle line:84%
that in the beginning
was the Word

00:07:29.249 --> 00:07:30.717 align:middle line:84%
and the Word was made
flesh and well among us.

00:07:30.717 --> 00:07:32.352 align:middle line:90%
And so originally of course,

00:07:32.352 --> 00:07:33.987 align:middle line:84%
that was in the beginning
was sound.

00:07:33.987 --> 00:07:35.222 align:middle line:90%
It's just that we...

00:07:35.222 --> 00:07:36.456 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: It's just another
dimension of that frequency.

00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:37.491 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: Absolutely, that locos.

00:07:37.491 --> 00:07:38.058 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:07:38.058 --> 00:07:39.392 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: Exactly.

00:07:39.392 --> 00:07:40.127 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well, could we take a
look at a few of those orbs?

00:07:40.127 --> 00:07:41.061 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: Yeah.

00:07:41.061 --> 00:07:42.195 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Really some
excellent ones.

00:07:42.195 --> 00:07:42.963 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: Be wonderful.

00:07:42.963 --> 00:07:44.631 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Let's take a look.

00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:46.633 align:middle line:84%
This one, now, this
isn't a classic orb.

00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:49.770 align:middle line:84%
THis is more the column of
light you were speaking of.

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:53.206 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: Yes, this was a lady that
I met, a client many years ago,

00:07:53.206 --> 00:07:56.142 align:middle line:84%
so this is before the advent
of digital photography,

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:59.313 align:middle line:84%
and she came to me in a very
bad state, a very poorly state,

00:07:59.313 --> 00:08:03.850 align:middle line:84%
in fact, with the possibility
of terminal disease.

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:08.355 align:middle line:84%
And I saw within her and above
her this radiating light,

00:08:08.355 --> 00:08:12.159 align:middle line:84%
rather like this stream that
we see, this beam that we see,

00:08:12.159 --> 00:08:13.660 align:middle line:90%
and I knew it to be Raphael.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.363 align:middle line:84%
I felt the consciousness
of Raphael around me.

00:08:16.363 --> 00:08:18.065 align:middle line:84%
And so you know,
viewers may say, well,

00:08:18.065 --> 00:08:19.466 align:middle line:90%
what was that all about?

00:08:19.466 --> 00:08:23.637 align:middle line:84%
And it is an intuitive aligning
within one's own consciousness

00:08:23.637 --> 00:08:27.040 align:middle line:84%
of just simply, the ideas
as it were, are within us,

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:31.979 align:middle line:84%
and then one feels the
intimacy of the angel coming in,

00:08:31.979 --> 00:08:36.083 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, and it -- I
suppose it's akin to anybody

00:08:36.083 --> 00:08:40.053 align:middle line:84%
that one really feels
vibrational correspondence with,

00:08:40.053 --> 00:08:41.622 align:middle line:90%
and so you know the identity

00:08:41.622 --> 00:08:43.724 align:middle line:84%
within the vibration,
its essence.

00:08:43.724 --> 00:08:47.227 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And so this photograph,
which was taken in --

00:08:47.227 --> 00:08:48.462 align:middle line:90%
by someone else entirely...

00:08:48.462 --> 00:08:50.130 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: This was 20 years
ago, very innocently.

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:53.367 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Very innocently taken
perfectly reflected what you

00:08:53.367 --> 00:08:56.503 align:middle line:84%
were seeing in her at
that time in this...

00:08:56.503 --> 00:08:58.572 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: And she was in complete
remission in this point,

00:08:58.572 --> 00:09:03.010 align:middle line:84%
so it was always like a divine
celebration of the wonderment

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:05.646 align:middle line:84%
of what her journey had
been all about, and indeed,

00:09:05.646 --> 00:09:08.181 align:middle line:84%
as we were talking about,
the more collective use of

00:09:08.181 --> 00:09:10.617 align:middle line:84%
or the more collective
representation

00:09:10.617 --> 00:09:12.252 align:middle line:90%
of the way the orbs function.

00:09:12.252 --> 00:09:14.221 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Let's take a
look at a couple more.

00:09:14.221 --> 00:09:16.056 align:middle line:90%
I find them so beautiful.

00:09:16.056 --> 00:09:19.593 align:middle line:84%
In this one, now,
let's talk about that.

00:09:19.593 --> 00:09:20.427 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: It's extraordinary.

00:09:20.427 --> 00:09:21.528 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: This is extraordinary.

00:09:21.528 --> 00:09:22.963 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: I can't remember
exactly where it is.

00:09:22.963 --> 00:09:27.067 align:middle line:84%
It's obviously an oceanographic
scene, but it was sent to me

00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:29.269 align:middle line:84%
by I believe, a lady
in Australia,

00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:33.106 align:middle line:84%
and obviously we can see
where the setting sun is,

00:09:33.106 --> 00:09:36.109 align:middle line:84%
but the very fact that there
is this very large orblike

00:09:36.109 --> 00:09:39.646 align:middle line:84%
manifestation on the right,
in this beautiful isocitrine,

00:09:39.646 --> 00:09:42.416 align:middle line:90%
citrus -- cerise pink rather...

00:09:42.416 --> 00:09:44.951 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Cerise pink, yes.

00:09:44.951 --> 00:09:48.121 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: ...which for me is always
the resonation of chamaille,

00:09:48.121 --> 00:09:54.061 align:middle line:84%
the great guide, who comes
forth in a pink or lilac form.

00:09:54.061 --> 00:09:57.097 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: It's interesting,
because it's almost,

00:09:57.097 --> 00:10:00.167 align:middle line:84%
depending on the time of
day, the after color you see

00:10:00.167 --> 00:10:02.336 align:middle line:84%
if you're staring -- which you
shouldn't stare too long --

00:10:02.336 --> 00:10:04.037 align:middle line:84%
but if you're looking
at the sun and look away

00:10:04.037 --> 00:10:05.772 align:middle line:84%
or close your eyes,
it's almost like that

00:10:05.772 --> 00:10:07.174 align:middle line:84%
but it's happening
simutaneously.

00:10:07.174 --> 00:10:08.108 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: Yes, exactly.

00:10:08.108 --> 00:10:09.476 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And let's
take a look at...

00:10:09.476 --> 00:10:10.977 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: And then there's the
smaller orb, which is yellow...

00:10:10.977 --> 00:10:12.379 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right on top of it.

00:10:12.379 --> 00:10:13.914 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: ...which is almost in the
center, which is extraordinary.

00:10:13.914 --> 00:10:14.781 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And let's take a
look at another.

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:21.988 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: And this was actually
April of this year, 2013,

00:10:21.988 --> 00:10:25.058 align:middle line:84%
with a group of people
that very kindly had come

00:10:25.058 --> 00:10:26.960 align:middle line:90%
with me on retreat to Egypt.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.329 align:middle line:84%
This is something that I
do twice or thrice a year.

00:10:29.329 --> 00:10:32.733 align:middle line:84%
And this is the Temple of
Karnak, and we were talking

00:10:32.733 --> 00:10:35.469 align:middle line:84%
about metatronic energy,
and I said, "Well,

00:10:35.469 --> 00:10:37.337 align:middle line:90%
Metatron is above my head."

00:10:37.337 --> 00:10:37.904 align:middle line:90%
People said, "Where?

00:10:37.904 --> 00:10:38.739 align:middle line:90%
Where? Where?"

00:10:38.739 --> 00:10:40.207 align:middle line:90%
And this photograph was taken

00:10:40.207 --> 00:10:42.275 align:middle line:84%
in a very innocent
way, and there it was.

00:10:42.275 --> 00:10:45.812 align:middle line:84%
Nobody could see it for
me, but there is Metatron,

00:10:45.812 --> 00:10:49.182 align:middle line:84%
providing extraordinary
teaching.

00:10:49.182 --> 00:10:52.252 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yes, and okay, do we
have maybe one more or two more?

00:10:52.252 --> 00:10:55.021 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes, I love this one.

00:10:55.021 --> 00:10:56.323 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: Ah, Ah, this is amazing.

00:10:56.323 --> 00:10:58.391 align:middle line:84%
Yes, this was taken
in the Vatican,

00:10:58.391 --> 00:11:03.330 align:middle line:84%
when we saw these
extraordinary orbs, and so these

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:06.600 align:middle line:84%
in fact are the 12 Angels of
Atlantis that have come for.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:10.971 align:middle line:84%
I saw them as color, but here
we -- I suppose on this side --

00:11:10.971 --> 00:11:12.239 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if the
viewers can see --

00:11:12.239 --> 00:11:13.940 align:middle line:90%
is a refraction of violet light,

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:14.875 align:middle line:84%
which is all these
blue violet...

00:11:14.875 --> 00:11:15.809 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Mm-hm, yes,
you can see it,

00:11:15.809 --> 00:11:17.644 align:middle line:84%
circling around it
and coming down.

00:11:17.644 --> 00:11:19.079 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: ...which is
Gabriel energy.

00:11:19.079 --> 00:11:20.580 align:middle line:84%
But yes, there are
12 imprints here.

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:21.948 align:middle line:90%
That's astonishing, I feel.

00:11:21.948 --> 00:11:23.350 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: That really.

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:27.888 align:middle line:84%
I love these photographs, and
also I find them very confirming

00:11:27.888 --> 00:11:30.223 align:middle line:84%
of things that I have felt
to be true, so I thank you

00:11:30.223 --> 00:11:31.291 align:middle line:90%
for sharing them with us.

00:11:31.291 --> 00:11:32.492 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: My pleasure.

00:11:32.492 --> 00:11:33.393 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Now we need to
get back to your journey.

00:11:33.393 --> 00:11:34.995 align:middle line:90%
Okay, you were 6 years old.

00:11:34.995 --> 00:11:37.164 align:middle line:84%
You understood this since
the time you were a wee one.

00:11:37.164 --> 00:11:39.466 align:middle line:90%
So how did that relationship

00:11:39.466 --> 00:11:41.201 align:middle line:84%
with the angels then
refine itself?

00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:42.869 align:middle line:84%
They told you, go
out into the world

00:11:42.869 --> 00:11:45.939 align:middle line:84%
and learn what you
can about angelology.

00:11:45.939 --> 00:11:48.442 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: So that was
obviously not when I was 6.

00:11:48.442 --> 00:11:50.310 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yeah, much
later, much later.

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:51.645 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: Yeah, yeah.

00:11:51.645 --> 00:11:53.613 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And then how did the
communication refine itself

00:11:53.613 --> 00:11:55.382 align:middle line:90%
over time?

00:11:55.382 --> 00:11:58.285 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: They were ever
present, but something else

00:11:58.285 --> 00:12:02.389 align:middle line:90%
into being from 6 through to 26.

00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:05.091 align:middle line:84%
And that was dealing with
3D, which is something

00:12:05.091 --> 00:12:09.229 align:middle line:84%
that I found challenging,
largely as a result of that fact

00:12:09.229 --> 00:12:12.065 align:middle line:84%
that I couldn't do what most
people seemed to be able to do.

00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:15.101 align:middle line:84%
And I had no problem with that,
frankly, but the world seemed

00:12:15.101 --> 00:12:16.203 align:middle line:90%
to have a problem with it.

00:12:16.203 --> 00:12:17.637 align:middle line:84%
My teachers had a
problem with it.

00:12:17.637 --> 00:12:19.940 align:middle line:84%
So what this means is
that I was synesthetic,

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:22.843 align:middle line:84%
and could not read
before the age of 14,

00:12:22.843 --> 00:12:26.213 align:middle line:84%
largely through the inspiration
of my mother, who said --

00:12:26.213 --> 00:12:30.717 align:middle line:84%
I was always singing, so I
was always enchanted by sound,

00:12:30.717 --> 00:12:32.452 align:middle line:84%
by the spoken and
the sung sound.

00:12:32.452 --> 00:12:36.523 align:middle line:84%
And she had the ingenuity of
placing me in a church choir.

00:12:36.523 --> 00:12:38.992 align:middle line:84%
And what I did, I
would ape the boys,

00:12:38.992 --> 00:12:42.095 align:middle line:84%
standing in the little rough
and surplus and so forth,

00:12:42.095 --> 00:12:44.464 align:middle line:84%
with the book here,
looking very cute, I guess,

00:12:44.464 --> 00:12:46.566 align:middle line:84%
and I would just
simply ape the boys.

00:12:46.566 --> 00:12:49.169 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what I was
reading, but eventually,

00:12:49.169 --> 00:12:52.572 align:middle line:84%
through the magic of sound, with
the magic of this great music,

00:12:52.572 --> 00:12:55.342 align:middle line:84%
singing Handel's Messiah,
or whatever it was,

00:12:55.342 --> 00:12:57.777 align:middle line:84%
that I would see that the
notes were a topography

00:12:57.777 --> 00:12:59.679 align:middle line:84%
and that the word
was written either

00:12:59.679 --> 00:13:01.381 align:middle line:84%
above the note or
below the note.

00:13:01.381 --> 00:13:04.317 align:middle line:84%
So I began to read singing
and then read speaking.

00:13:04.317 --> 00:13:07.187 align:middle line:90%
So that's a little illustration

00:13:07.187 --> 00:13:09.422 align:middle line:84%
of the learning challenges
that I had.

00:13:09.422 --> 00:13:11.524 align:middle line:84%
There were others to do,
enumeracy and so forth.

00:13:11.524 --> 00:13:14.995 align:middle line:84%
However, it seemed that I
was displeasing my teachers

00:13:14.995 --> 00:13:20.033 align:middle line:84%
and certainly my father,
and the only thing

00:13:20.033 --> 00:13:24.070 align:middle line:84%
that was ever complimented for
or gained at probation with

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:27.307 align:middle line:84%
or for, was the fact that
I would tell stories.

00:13:27.307 --> 00:13:29.542 align:middle line:84%
And people kept saying,
"Why don't you be an actor?"

00:13:29.542 --> 00:13:31.912 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well, maybe
I should be an actor.

00:13:31.912 --> 00:13:35.815 align:middle line:84%
So eventually, I found a way
of really becoming involved

00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:37.884 align:middle line:84%
in the arts as an actor,
and that's something

00:13:37.884 --> 00:13:39.286 align:middle line:84%
that as an adult,
as a young adult,

00:13:39.286 --> 00:13:43.623 align:middle line:84%
then I did for about 8
years, and was very fortunate

00:13:43.623 --> 00:13:46.526 align:middle line:84%
and actually came and spent
time on this great island

00:13:46.526 --> 00:13:50.397 align:middle line:84%
of North America
and had great fun.

00:13:50.397 --> 00:13:52.832 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: But along
that, alongside that,

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:55.802 align:middle line:84%
there was obviously some
deeper resonance with voice,

00:13:55.802 --> 00:13:58.071 align:middle line:84%
besides the fact that you
just have a beautiful voice

00:13:58.071 --> 00:13:59.272 align:middle line:90%
and perfect allocution.

00:13:59.272 --> 00:14:02.042 align:middle line:84%
There was something
else going on,

00:14:02.042 --> 00:14:04.577 align:middle line:84%
because this was now
starting to interface

00:14:04.577 --> 00:14:06.112 align:middle line:84%
with the angelic
realm, was it not?

00:14:06.112 --> 00:14:07.447 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well, what's
interesting...

00:14:07.447 --> 00:14:09.282 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: And you were being
used almost as an instrument.

00:14:09.282 --> 00:14:11.184 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: They were always there.

00:14:11.184 --> 00:14:13.119 align:middle line:84%
It's just that they
were there as it were,

00:14:13.119 --> 00:14:15.255 align:middle line:84%
in the periphery of
my consciousness.

00:14:15.255 --> 00:14:17.190 align:middle line:84%
I believe that what
I was trying to do,

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:22.362 align:middle line:84%
having spent a very
sacred childhood and living

00:14:22.362 --> 00:14:24.030 align:middle line:84%
in very extraordinary
accommodations

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:25.098 align:middle line:90%
as well although...

00:14:25.098 --> 00:14:26.933 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: Let's talk about
that for a moment,

00:14:26.933 --> 00:14:28.568 align:middle line:84%
if you just give
people a little glimpse

00:14:28.568 --> 00:14:30.837 align:middle line:84%
of what your life
was like early on?

00:14:30.837 --> 00:14:34.741 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So okay, so my
parents were royal servants,

00:14:34.741 --> 00:14:39.245 align:middle line:84%
which meant that my father
had a high-ranking position

00:14:39.245 --> 00:14:42.015 align:middle line:84%
in the Duke Vandenberg's
household,

00:14:42.015 --> 00:14:45.051 align:middle line:84%
which meant that we were given
grace and favor accommodation.

00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:48.855 align:middle line:84%
I think it was the first 6 years
that we had an apartment in one

00:14:48.855 --> 00:14:52.292 align:middle line:84%
of the palaces in London,
and they were given a house.

00:14:52.292 --> 00:14:54.861 align:middle line:84%
So it was an extremely
privileged time

00:14:54.861 --> 00:14:57.697 align:middle line:84%
to be happy tubes, so
to speak, with members

00:14:57.697 --> 00:15:00.734 align:middle line:84%
of the Royal Family, and
I have an infinite respect

00:15:00.734 --> 00:15:02.702 align:middle line:90%
for the substance of the way

00:15:02.702 --> 00:15:06.673 align:middle line:84%
that these people live their
lives, and indeed, the symbol

00:15:06.673 --> 00:15:09.576 align:middle line:84%
and the emblem of their
extraordinary gifts

00:15:09.576 --> 00:15:11.077 align:middle line:90%
of grace to us.

00:15:11.077 --> 00:15:13.313 align:middle line:84%
But yes, it was a very
extraordinary childhood,

00:15:13.313 --> 00:15:15.982 align:middle line:84%
but I really was trying to
concentrate on what is it

00:15:15.982 --> 00:15:18.752 align:middle line:84%
to be human, because it seemed
that I spent so much time

00:15:18.752 --> 00:15:22.122 align:middle line:84%
out of my body as a young one,
that it was a question of,

00:15:22.122 --> 00:15:24.991 align:middle line:84%
they were always just
there in the periphery.

00:15:24.991 --> 00:15:29.262 align:middle line:84%
And it was really when I made
the transition in my late 20s,

00:15:29.262 --> 00:15:36.403 align:middle line:84%
early 30s, when I'd auditioned
very successfully for a film,

00:15:36.403 --> 00:15:40.306 align:middle line:84%
and I was about to move to
Los Angeles to make this film,

00:15:40.306 --> 00:15:41.508 align:middle line:84%
and the telephone
rang and the Wheel

00:15:41.508 --> 00:15:44.044 align:middle line:84%
of Fortune literally
spun around, clunk,

00:15:44.044 --> 00:15:46.880 align:middle line:84%
and those extraordinary moments
when everything stands still,

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.250 align:middle line:84%
and I knew something
immense was about to happen.

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:53.153 align:middle line:84%
And the telephone call was
from my brother, who said,

00:15:53.153 --> 00:15:54.421 align:middle line:90%
"Are you sitting down?

00:15:54.421 --> 00:15:56.456 align:middle line:84%
You need to know, our
mother's got terminal cancer."

00:15:56.456 --> 00:15:58.023 align:middle line:90%
And I was so shocked by that

00:15:58.023 --> 00:16:00.660 align:middle line:84%
that I felt the most
important thing was to go back

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:02.829 align:middle line:84%
to the United Kingdom
and look after her,

00:16:02.829 --> 00:16:04.597 align:middle line:84%
which I did, so I
let the film go.

00:16:04.597 --> 00:16:07.033 align:middle line:84%
And that's when everything
started changing,

00:16:07.033 --> 00:16:10.136 align:middle line:84%
because when you're dealing
with one of the dearest beings

00:16:10.136 --> 00:16:13.073 align:middle line:84%
of your life, indeed
your own mother,

00:16:13.073 --> 00:16:15.975 align:middle line:84%
who was a very extraordinary
woman who taught nobility

00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:20.180 align:middle line:84%
and grace and unconditional love
-- she embodied it implicitly --

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:22.082 align:middle line:84%
that this was a very
shocking state.

00:16:22.082 --> 00:16:24.617 align:middle line:84%
So the heightened
nature of the way

00:16:24.617 --> 00:16:29.089 align:middle line:84%
that I was emotionally tuned
me back into my psyche,

00:16:29.089 --> 00:16:32.358 align:middle line:84%
So that that I'd effectively
switched off from as a child,

00:16:32.358 --> 00:16:34.627 align:middle line:84%
as a small child, I
spoke about what I saw

00:16:34.627 --> 00:16:36.663 align:middle line:84%
and my father was
very displeased in me.

00:16:36.663 --> 00:16:39.766 align:middle line:84%
So I thought the easiest
thing to do was to shut up.

00:16:39.766 --> 00:16:42.001 align:middle line:84%
And here I was switching
back on.

00:16:42.001 --> 00:16:45.171 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually she
passed, and when she passed,

00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:49.109 align:middle line:84%
the grief set in,
because during the bout

00:16:49.109 --> 00:16:51.311 align:middle line:84%
with cancer one remains
very strong.

00:16:51.311 --> 00:16:55.148 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a pretty classic
behavioral statement for people

00:16:55.148 --> 00:16:57.650 align:middle line:84%
to make, just keep going, just
keep going, just keep going.

00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:59.953 align:middle line:84%
And then when she'd
gone I caved in.

00:16:59.953 --> 00:17:03.656 align:middle line:84%
And I always remember the
moment when I really caved in

00:17:03.656 --> 00:17:07.226 align:middle line:84%
and let grief take me over,
this huge tsunami hit me,

00:17:07.226 --> 00:17:12.499 align:middle line:84%
and the room was filled with
this extraordinary emanation,

00:17:12.499 --> 00:17:15.068 align:middle line:84%
and I heard within me, "I
will always be with you,"

00:17:15.068 --> 00:17:16.802 align:middle line:84%
and indeed she is
always with me.

00:17:16.802 --> 00:17:19.639 align:middle line:90%
And so from that moment onward,

00:17:19.639 --> 00:17:24.177 align:middle line:84%
I was asked to profess a
statement of joy with my life

00:17:24.177 --> 00:17:26.812 align:middle line:84%
and to use the grief
meaningfully to open

00:17:26.812 --> 00:17:29.816 align:middle line:84%
up emphathy, to open up
compassion, to open up sympathy,

00:17:29.816 --> 00:17:32.385 align:middle line:84%
and that's when the
angels step back in.

00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:36.790 align:middle line:84%
But it was really not until 1987
during the harmonic convergence,

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:39.259 align:middle line:90%
when something profound shifted

00:17:39.259 --> 00:17:41.261 align:middle line:84%
within my cellular
consciousness,

00:17:41.261 --> 00:17:44.464 align:middle line:84%
and that's when I
met them full-time.

00:17:44.464 --> 00:17:45.965 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: Do you think that --

00:17:45.965 --> 00:17:49.068 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we all have
potential alternate timelines,

00:17:49.068 --> 00:17:50.737 align:middle line:90%
and alternate realities?

00:17:50.737 --> 00:17:52.005 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Mm-hm.

00:17:52.005 --> 00:17:54.574 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: Even that we could
be living, simultaneously.

00:17:54.574 --> 00:17:59.245 align:middle line:84%
That said, do you think that
the event that took you back

00:17:59.245 --> 00:18:02.448 align:middle line:84%
to your mother, and staying
with her and nurturing her

00:18:02.448 --> 00:18:05.685 align:middle line:84%
through her end of her
physical life here, do you think

00:18:05.685 --> 00:18:09.222 align:middle line:84%
that that was actually a
preferred timeline for you --

00:18:09.222 --> 00:18:11.424 align:middle line:84%
rather than going into
acting in America,

00:18:11.424 --> 00:18:13.159 align:middle line:84%
to be able to bring
these talents --

00:18:13.159 --> 00:18:14.561 align:middle line:90%
or not these talents --

00:18:14.561 --> 00:18:17.230 align:middle line:84%
to be able to bring that deep
resonance through in a new way,

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:18.498 align:middle line:84%
that was going to
be used for healing?

00:18:18.498 --> 00:18:19.332 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:18:19.332 --> 00:18:21.167 align:middle line:90%
Yes. Yes. I was being prepared.

00:18:21.167 --> 00:18:22.268 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: Yes.

00:18:22.268 --> 00:18:25.305 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Because that
was a vast initiation.

00:18:25.305 --> 00:18:26.673 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: Yes.

00:18:26.673 --> 00:18:28.808 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And therefore for the
last -- she died in '79, '80,

00:18:28.808 --> 00:18:32.512 align:middle line:84%
so for the last 33 years
-- interesting it's 33 --

00:18:32.512 --> 00:18:35.014 align:middle line:84%
that I'd interfaced
with female cancer.

00:18:35.014 --> 00:18:39.052 align:middle line:84%
And I am in service to
the divine feminine;

00:18:39.052 --> 00:18:41.721 align:middle line:84%
what I mean by that is the
arousal of the feminine,

00:18:41.721 --> 00:18:44.791 align:middle line:84%
divine feminine consciousness,
which we are evoking

00:18:44.791 --> 00:18:48.127 align:middle line:84%
in our presence by
the grace of the heart

00:18:48.127 --> 00:18:51.364 align:middle line:84%
and by really truly embodying
what unconditional love is

00:18:51.364 --> 00:18:52.532 align:middle line:90%
all about.

00:18:52.532 --> 00:18:54.601 align:middle line:84%
So the work that I'm
really engaged in in terms

00:18:54.601 --> 00:18:57.003 align:middle line:84%
of that deep resonance,
I believe,

00:18:57.003 --> 00:19:01.007 align:middle line:84%
is about really feeling
how feeling is a langauge

00:19:01.007 --> 00:19:04.344 align:middle line:84%
of the soul, enters into
the whole of our beings,

00:19:04.344 --> 00:19:07.013 align:middle line:84%
but at the same time we
make intelligent choices

00:19:07.013 --> 00:19:10.984 align:middle line:84%
about the way that we feel, so
that we're not caving into woe.

00:19:10.984 --> 00:19:13.653 align:middle line:90%
We see it as an amazing teacher,

00:19:13.653 --> 00:19:16.723 align:middle line:84%
and therefore we move
from woe into joy.

00:19:16.723 --> 00:19:19.058 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, I think it was
William Blake who said,

00:19:19.058 --> 00:19:23.062 align:middle line:84%
"Joy and woe are woven fine a
clothing for the soul divine,

00:19:23.062 --> 00:19:27.033 align:middle line:84%
when in this he rightly know,
safely through the world he go."

00:19:27.033 --> 00:19:31.337 align:middle line:84%
And so his metaphysics
in the 18th century,

00:19:31.337 --> 00:19:34.474 align:middle line:84%
teaching us where we are today,
which is this recognition

00:19:34.474 --> 00:19:36.042 align:middle line:84%
of nothing is singular,
everything is plural,

00:19:36.042 --> 00:19:37.944 align:middle line:84%
and that when we're
actually feeling joy

00:19:37.944 --> 00:19:40.246 align:middle line:84%
and woe there is
a medium current

00:19:40.246 --> 00:19:43.349 align:middle line:84%
that if we're literally sitting
in, that we have the choice

00:19:43.349 --> 00:19:45.151 align:middle line:84%
to be the master mistress
of our own destiny.

00:19:45.151 --> 00:19:47.086 align:middle line:84%
That's when we truly
become sorcerors.

00:19:47.086 --> 00:19:48.988 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: So that is what
happened with you.

00:19:48.988 --> 00:19:52.592 align:middle line:84%
And so now your mother
has safely passed over.

00:19:52.592 --> 00:19:54.193 align:middle line:84%
You've gone through
this experience,

00:19:54.193 --> 00:19:58.731 align:middle line:84%
you now reunited permanently
with the angelic realm,

00:19:58.731 --> 00:20:02.368 align:middle line:84%
and you have an opportunity
to take an assignment,

00:20:02.368 --> 00:20:05.905 align:middle line:84%
which I just think is wonderful
-- I'm speaking of Margaret.

00:20:05.905 --> 00:20:07.006 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Oh, yeah.

00:20:07.006 --> 00:20:08.308 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: So if you could
tell us a little bit

00:20:08.308 --> 00:20:10.376 align:middle line:84%
about what happened there,
and a little bit about her.

00:20:10.376 --> 00:20:14.514 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know that we're just
essentially eavesdropping

00:20:14.514 --> 00:20:16.683 align:middle line:84%
in on someone else's life
a bit for just a moment,

00:20:16.683 --> 00:20:19.285 align:middle line:90%
but if you'll indulge us?

00:20:19.285 --> 00:20:22.689 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Man who gave
Margaret Thatcher her voice.

00:20:22.689 --> 00:20:25.792 align:middle line:84%
So when my mother had
passed and I'd moved

00:20:25.792 --> 00:20:30.964 align:middle line:84%
through this recalibration, and
was facing the possibility of,

00:20:30.964 --> 00:20:32.265 align:middle line:90%
well, do I return to acting?

00:20:32.265 --> 00:20:35.301 align:middle line:84%
It seems that that actually
is no longer on the cards,

00:20:35.301 --> 00:20:38.204 align:middle line:84%
because I've been initiated
into something very different --

00:20:38.204 --> 00:20:40.506 align:middle line:90%
I had a remarkable encounter,

00:20:40.506 --> 00:20:42.842 align:middle line:84%
a remeeting with a very
extraordinary woman by the name

00:20:42.842 --> 00:20:45.445 align:middle line:84%
of Cicely Berry, who is the
voice director of the RSC,

00:20:45.445 --> 00:20:48.748 align:middle line:84%
which I'd had connections
with in the '70s.

00:20:48.748 --> 00:20:52.285 align:middle line:84%
And Cicely very kindly
gave me my first job,

00:20:52.285 --> 00:20:53.953 align:middle line:90%
and it just so happened

00:20:53.953 --> 00:20:56.723 align:middle line:84%
that Margaret was also
in need of a coach.

00:20:56.723 --> 00:20:57.857 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: Margaret Thatcher, yes.

00:20:57.857 --> 00:21:00.660 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And so yeah, so I
dove in at the deep end.

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:04.030 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: Now, what stage was she
at this point in her career?

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:07.367 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: She had just begun her
premiership, and she was moving

00:21:07.367 --> 00:21:11.371 align:middle line:84%
through what is now
historically, "the makeover,"

00:21:11.371 --> 00:21:13.873 align:middle line:84%
which Barry Humphrey, who's
the great drag artist,

00:21:13.873 --> 00:21:15.308 align:middle line:84%
has sort of taken in
another direction.

00:21:15.308 --> 00:21:18.945 align:middle line:84%
But yes, Margaret -- they key
thing I believe was moving

00:21:18.945 --> 00:21:22.648 align:middle line:84%
Margaret into a much
more universal style

00:21:22.648 --> 00:21:26.252 align:middle line:84%
of communication, rather than
being within the social caste

00:21:26.252 --> 00:21:28.821 align:middle line:84%
that had evidently been
appropriate for her

00:21:28.821 --> 00:21:32.692 align:middle line:84%
to live through, which was
sort of upper middle class --

00:21:32.692 --> 00:21:36.696 align:middle line:84%
I've been to Oxford, terribly
sort of rather like so.

00:21:36.696 --> 00:21:40.032 align:middle line:84%
And she needed gravitas and she
needed weight and she needed

00:21:40.032 --> 00:21:45.037 align:middle line:84%
to understand how to become
a persuasive personality

00:21:45.037 --> 00:21:50.076 align:middle line:84%
in the dogmatic rhetoric of
what politics was all about.

00:21:50.076 --> 00:21:53.479 align:middle line:84%
One of the chief skills
I remember that we looked

00:21:53.479 --> 00:21:57.784 align:middle line:84%
into was how to engage
magnetically the listener.

00:21:57.784 --> 00:22:00.753 align:middle line:84%
And so we use the rising
inflection, even at the end

00:22:00.753 --> 00:22:04.457 align:middle line:84%
of thought cadence, so that
she would always go up,

00:22:04.457 --> 00:22:06.592 align:middle line:84%
rather than to go down,
which is of course is

00:22:06.592 --> 00:22:07.727 align:middle line:90%
when people interrupt,

00:22:07.727 --> 00:22:11.097 align:middle line:84%
and that's why she was
always uninterruptable.

00:22:11.097 --> 00:22:14.200 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: So now this has to
be a general principle.

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.436 align:middle line:84%
If you end a sentence
going down,

00:22:16.436 --> 00:22:19.372 align:middle line:84%
people think you're pausing for
a thought or a pregnant pause,

00:22:19.372 --> 00:22:21.340 align:middle line:84%
so they will interrupt
you or jump in...

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:22.375 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:22:22.375 --> 00:22:24.177 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: ...but if you
go up, they won't?

00:22:24.177 --> 00:22:25.511 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: If you go up,
yeah, so rising...

00:22:25.511 --> 00:22:27.313 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: So this is what you
taught her, so she was able

00:22:27.313 --> 00:22:28.614 align:middle line:90%
to maintain the energy...

00:22:28.614 --> 00:22:29.315 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Absolutely.

00:22:29.315 --> 00:22:30.283 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: ...and attention.

00:22:30.283 --> 00:22:31.417 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So she seemed
indefatigable

00:22:31.417 --> 00:22:33.419 align:middle line:90%
and certainly uninterruptible.

00:22:33.419 --> 00:22:37.156 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: Well, now, Meryl
Streep, when she played --

00:22:37.156 --> 00:22:39.759 align:middle line:84%
she seemed to be -- I don't
know Margaret Thatcher --

00:22:39.759 --> 00:22:43.796 align:middle line:84%
she seemed to embody her in the
film "The Iron Lady," right?

00:22:43.796 --> 00:22:44.931 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes, yes.

00:22:44.931 --> 00:22:47.233 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: And how did you
feel about her portrayal

00:22:47.233 --> 00:22:51.103 align:middle line:84%
and her voice and how she was
using it toward her powerful

00:22:51.103 --> 00:22:51.671 align:middle line:90%
end there?

00:22:51.671 --> 00:22:52.405 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Amazing.

00:22:52.405 --> 00:22:53.372 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:22:53.372 --> 00:22:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: Did she really
capture it?

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:57.076 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Absolutely amazing.

00:22:57.076 --> 00:23:01.147 align:middle line:84%
It was like an animated
photographic representation

00:23:01.147 --> 00:23:05.151 align:middle line:84%
of what Margaret was
about: the sound cadence,

00:23:05.151 --> 00:23:07.553 align:middle line:84%
the idiosyncratic
quality of the way

00:23:07.553 --> 00:23:09.989 align:middle line:84%
that Margaret used her voice,
but not just the voice,

00:23:09.989 --> 00:23:12.258 align:middle line:84%
because we know that our
voice is a physical mechanism

00:23:12.258 --> 00:23:13.826 align:middle line:84%
that we use to communicate
the way we think

00:23:13.826 --> 00:23:16.229 align:middle line:84%
and the way we feel, so
therefore it emanates

00:23:16.229 --> 00:23:18.931 align:middle line:84%
from the body, the way
that she used her body

00:23:18.931 --> 00:23:20.666 align:middle line:90%
in terms of physical behavior.

00:23:20.666 --> 00:23:23.870 align:middle line:84%
And we could say it was an
impersonation, but actually,

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:26.172 align:middle line:84%
it was a very genuine,
organic characterization.

00:23:26.172 --> 00:23:27.139 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yes, as though
she embodied it, yes.

00:23:27.139 --> 00:23:29.575 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: She is immensely
talented.

00:23:29.575 --> 00:23:31.077 align:middle line:84%
She's a shape-shifter,
isn't she?

00:23:31.077 --> 00:23:31.577 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:23:31.577 --> 00:23:32.945 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:32.945 --> 00:23:34.547 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: And the greats, like
Meryl, like Daniel Day-Lewis,

00:23:34.547 --> 00:23:37.216 align:middle line:84%
Like Mark Rylance, like
Johnny Depp, something happens

00:23:37.216 --> 00:23:39.018 align:middle line:90%
within their cellular council,

00:23:39.018 --> 00:23:42.188 align:middle line:84%
and they richly change,
and she did.

00:23:42.188 --> 00:23:44.156 align:middle line:90%
Amazing, amazing, amazing.

00:23:44.156 --> 00:23:47.126 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was an
immensely touching film.

00:23:47.126 --> 00:23:48.461 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: It was.

00:23:48.461 --> 00:23:51.597 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was, too, but
just from a professional point

00:23:51.597 --> 00:23:53.766 align:middle line:84%
of view, she really captured
it, because she did have

00:23:53.766 --> 00:23:55.735 align:middle line:84%
that gravitas that
you're speaking of,

00:23:55.735 --> 00:23:59.038 align:middle line:84%
that you coached
Margaret Thatcher into.

00:23:59.038 --> 00:24:00.139 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: Yes.

00:24:00.139 --> 00:24:01.407 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And you also
worked with Princess Di.

00:24:01.407 --> 00:24:04.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, how -- you must have
met her fairly early on,

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:07.880 align:middle line:90%
before or after she was married?

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:10.616 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: I remember first
meeting her at a garden party,

00:24:10.616 --> 00:24:12.218 align:middle line:84%
because when my parents
had died,

00:24:12.218 --> 00:24:16.756 align:middle line:84%
the Royal Family were very
sympathetically solicitous,

00:24:16.756 --> 00:24:19.158 align:middle line:84%
and had invited -- I have a
brother who's a year older --

00:24:19.158 --> 00:24:22.061 align:middle line:84%
had invited my brother
and I to a garden party

00:24:22.061 --> 00:24:23.863 align:middle line:90%
to check up on us, I think.

00:24:23.863 --> 00:24:25.531 align:middle line:84%
My brother didn't
come, but I went along,

00:24:25.531 --> 00:24:28.401 align:middle line:90%
and I was very kindly invited

00:24:28.401 --> 00:24:30.636 align:middle line:84%
into the Royal enclosure
to drink tea.

00:24:30.636 --> 00:24:33.873 align:middle line:84%
And there was this young
Diana, so we met then.

00:24:33.873 --> 00:24:37.276 align:middle line:84%
But this would have
been '82, possibly '83.

00:24:37.276 --> 00:24:40.179 align:middle line:84%
It was much later, it was
really during the mid '90s

00:24:40.179 --> 00:24:42.114 align:middle line:84%
that we met again,
and I was sought

00:24:42.114 --> 00:24:45.284 align:middle line:84%
out by her private secretary
who telephoned and said,

00:24:45.284 --> 00:24:47.386 align:middle line:84%
"Princess Diana -- she's
heard all about you;

00:24:47.386 --> 00:24:48.721 align:middle line:84%
she would very much
like to work wth you."

00:24:48.721 --> 00:24:51.891 align:middle line:84%
And I don't often speak
about this, but she was --

00:24:51.891 --> 00:24:57.663 align:middle line:84%
now that she is memorably
iconic in the sense of the fact

00:24:57.663 --> 00:25:00.199 align:middle line:84%
that I believe that we
all, even if we tainted her

00:25:00.199 --> 00:25:04.470 align:middle line:84%
when she was alive with our own
prejudices, we all recognize

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:07.239 align:middle line:84%
that she was a collective
witness

00:25:07.239 --> 00:25:10.109 align:middle line:84%
of an extraordinary aspect
of human consciousness.

00:25:10.109 --> 00:25:14.246 align:middle line:84%
Without that, we saw what took
place within the initiation

00:25:14.246 --> 00:25:16.549 align:middle line:84%
of the collective --
and I'm talking not just

00:25:16.549 --> 00:25:17.683 align:middle line:90%
about the British people;

00:25:17.683 --> 00:25:19.018 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about people
all around the world.

00:25:19.018 --> 00:25:20.219 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes, that's true.

00:25:20.219 --> 00:25:21.587 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: When she eventually
passed, when she went

00:25:21.587 --> 00:25:25.858 align:middle line:84%
through that Diana huntress
initiation, of giving her life,

00:25:25.858 --> 00:25:28.728 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, to arouse
the divine feminine.

00:25:28.728 --> 00:25:31.964 align:middle line:84%
I feel that that was a crucial
turning point for us all.

00:25:31.964 --> 00:25:34.667 align:middle line:84%
But obviously I was
deeply shocked.

00:25:34.667 --> 00:25:36.569 align:middle line:84%
I was actually in the United
States when it took place.

00:25:36.569 --> 00:25:40.272 align:middle line:84%
I remember howling,
howling for an hour.

00:25:40.272 --> 00:25:43.476 align:middle line:84%
She was extraordinary,
very beautiful being,

00:25:43.476 --> 00:25:47.980 align:middle line:84%
love and compassion and
tremendous grace and fun.

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:51.550 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: And fun, and you were
helping her establish her own

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:54.253 align:middle line:84%
identity by this point, where
she was starting to take

00:25:54.253 --> 00:25:57.290 align:middle line:84%
on various pet projects
and such where she was out,

00:25:57.290 --> 00:25:59.525 align:middle line:84%
and she was actually
speaking publicly,

00:25:59.525 --> 00:26:01.093 align:middle line:84%
which she hadn't done
much to that point.

00:26:01.093 --> 00:26:02.328 align:middle line:84%
And so that's where
you were brought in.

00:26:02.328 --> 00:26:04.130 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: She was not an
easy speaker, publicly.

00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:04.930 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: Very shy.

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:06.732 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Very, very, very shy.

00:26:06.732 --> 00:26:11.003 align:middle line:84%
And so what I did with
Diana was to introduce her

00:26:11.003 --> 00:26:15.241 align:middle line:84%
to the whole nature of persona,
meaning that the very core

00:26:15.241 --> 00:26:19.645 align:middle line:84%
of my work is the
re-capitulation, so to speak,

00:26:19.645 --> 00:26:23.849 align:middle line:84%
of a very ancient premise
that was set up by the Romans,

00:26:23.849 --> 00:26:26.986 align:middle line:84%
which is that we each have
a note, we each have a sound

00:26:26.986 --> 00:26:30.122 align:middle line:84%
within us, and that
when we emit this sound,

00:26:30.122 --> 00:26:33.459 align:middle line:84%
we literally sing
the song of our soul.

00:26:33.459 --> 00:26:37.129 align:middle line:84%
They refer to this as being
persona, because persona

00:26:37.129 --> 00:26:42.168 align:middle line:84%
in Latin means per through sona,
sound, so we emit our beings

00:26:42.168 --> 00:26:44.203 align:middle line:90%
through sound, through persona.

00:26:44.203 --> 00:26:45.705 align:middle line:84%
And so they took
it further in terms

00:26:45.705 --> 00:26:47.973 align:middle line:84%
of classifying their
status in society,

00:26:47.973 --> 00:26:51.811 align:middle line:84%
that persona grata was somebody
who has the freedom of speech,

00:26:51.811 --> 00:26:56.749 align:middle line:84%
persona non grata was somebody
who as actually a non-person

00:26:56.749 --> 00:26:59.785 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, who would be
a servant, who would serve.

00:26:59.785 --> 00:27:02.888 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, we still use that
term today, because I remember

00:27:02.888 --> 00:27:07.760 align:middle line:84%
after the horror, or during
the horror of 9/11 that the man

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:10.396 align:middle line:84%
and I believe men or the
women who were locked

00:27:10.396 --> 00:27:13.966 align:middle line:84%
in Tiananmen Bay were
called non-persons.

00:27:13.966 --> 00:27:15.735 align:middle line:90%
Their voice was taken from them.

00:27:15.735 --> 00:27:16.802 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: Yes.

00:27:16.802 --> 00:27:18.137 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So I introduced
her to the notion

00:27:18.137 --> 00:27:21.140 align:middle line:84%
of that there were certain
sounds that we can use

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:24.110 align:middle line:84%
that firstly entrain
our own consciousness

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:27.146 align:middle line:84%
so that we literally integrate,
we come into a wholeness

00:27:27.146 --> 00:27:29.815 align:middle line:84%
of being, physically,
emotionally, and spiritually,

00:27:29.815 --> 00:27:33.519 align:middle line:84%
but also that when these sounds
leave us, they entrain others.

00:27:33.519 --> 00:27:34.720 align:middle line:90%
They're magnetic.

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:37.256 align:middle line:84%
For example, if I sat
here and talked like this,

00:27:37.256 --> 00:27:39.525 align:middle line:84%
I think after a period
of time you probably...

00:27:39.525 --> 00:27:40.059 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: It hurts.

00:27:40.059 --> 00:27:40.760 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:41.961 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: It's annoying.

00:27:41.961 --> 00:27:43.395 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Exactly, so it's
very electrical, isn't it?

00:27:43.395 --> 00:27:44.730 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: It's annoying.

00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:47.767 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: But if I go back into
where I am now, it's the --

00:27:47.767 --> 00:27:50.402 align:middle line:84%
that's what I refer to as
being the magnetic voice.

00:27:50.402 --> 00:27:53.239 align:middle line:84%
It has weight, it has
substance, it has physicality...

00:27:53.239 --> 00:27:54.173 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: And we each have this?

00:27:54.173 --> 00:27:54.740 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: We each have it.

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:55.775 align:middle line:90%
We each have it.

00:27:55.775 --> 00:27:58.310 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: And yet, so
few people resonate

00:27:58.310 --> 00:28:00.746 align:middle line:90%
at that level with their voice.

00:28:00.746 --> 00:28:05.184 align:middle line:84%
What's going on with us, that
obviously Diana did embody that.

00:28:05.184 --> 00:28:07.853 align:middle line:84%
She had an absolutely
beautiful speaking voice

00:28:07.853 --> 00:28:10.156 align:middle line:84%
by the time she started
maturing,

00:28:10.156 --> 00:28:11.957 align:middle line:84%
after these years
you're talking about.

00:28:11.957 --> 00:28:13.659 align:middle line:90%
What is it in us that's missing?

00:28:13.659 --> 00:28:16.562 align:middle line:84%
What are we not connecting
to in ourselves

00:28:16.562 --> 00:28:19.064 align:middle line:90%
to bring our full note through,

00:28:19.064 --> 00:28:20.432 align:middle line:84%
and how do we do
that, just in brief?

00:28:20.432 --> 00:28:21.967 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I believe it's to do
with the way we're educated

00:28:21.967 --> 00:28:24.503 align:middle line:84%
and the way that
we're socialized,

00:28:24.503 --> 00:28:28.674 align:middle line:84%
because we're educated to just
purely be left brain thinkers.

00:28:28.674 --> 00:28:31.310 align:middle line:84%
We're educated to do,
do, do, do, do, do, do,

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:33.679 align:middle line:84%
and that we forget that
we're human beings.

00:28:33.679 --> 00:28:36.115 align:middle line:84%
So effectively what we
do is that we fixate

00:28:36.115 --> 00:28:39.385 align:middle line:84%
on the doing center of the
body, so that what happens is

00:28:39.385 --> 00:28:41.954 align:middle line:84%
that the majority of
people just live here.

00:28:41.954 --> 00:28:43.956 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we hear
it very specifically

00:28:43.956 --> 00:28:46.892 align:middle line:84%
on this great island,
this great continent,

00:28:46.892 --> 00:28:50.262 align:middle line:84%
and the nasality is really
coming in, because here we are.

00:28:50.262 --> 00:28:51.897 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: You spent time
in New York, though.

00:28:51.897 --> 00:28:52.832 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I spent time
in New York, right.

00:28:52.832 --> 00:28:53.933 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: Fair enough.

00:28:53.933 --> 00:28:55.968 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And that's very
hybrid, of course,

00:28:55.968 --> 00:28:58.938 align:middle line:90%
and it's not (unintelligible).

00:28:58.938 --> 00:29:01.273 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: It's really coming
from the head alone,

00:29:01.273 --> 00:29:03.909 align:middle line:84%
because this is what
we're using all the time,

00:29:03.909 --> 00:29:07.513 align:middle line:84%
rather than actually what
I'm now professing in all

00:29:07.513 --> 00:29:09.882 align:middle line:84%
of the work, which is that
we have the thinking heart

00:29:09.882 --> 00:29:13.285 align:middle line:84%
and the feeling head, so that we
literally balance the fullness

00:29:13.285 --> 00:29:15.421 align:middle line:84%
of what our embodied
state is all about,

00:29:15.421 --> 00:29:19.525 align:middle line:84%
between how we feel our heart
and how we feel our head.

00:29:19.525 --> 00:29:21.660 align:middle line:84%
It's certain, going back to
what I was sharing with you

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:24.430 align:middle line:84%
about the notion of persona,
that we each have a note,

00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:26.198 align:middle line:84%
we each have a significant
sound,

00:29:26.198 --> 00:29:30.502 align:middle line:84%
which in classical voice
coaching, spoken voice coaching,

00:29:30.502 --> 00:29:33.472 align:middle line:84%
is about finding the
center of our compass,

00:29:33.472 --> 00:29:35.474 align:middle line:84%
that our compass is
the whole of our range,

00:29:35.474 --> 00:29:37.309 align:middle line:84%
so how do we sit in
the middle of it?

00:29:37.309 --> 00:29:40.546 align:middle line:84%
Well, I believe that the middle
-- and if we think, for example,

00:29:40.546 --> 00:29:44.049 align:middle line:84%
a keyboard, we know that
the most important thing

00:29:44.049 --> 00:29:46.886 align:middle line:84%
about the piano is the fact
that it has a middle C. Well,

00:29:46.886 --> 00:29:49.221 align:middle line:84%
if I speak up here, I
speak in the treble;

00:29:49.221 --> 00:29:51.223 align:middle line:84%
if I speak down here,
I speak in the bass.

00:29:51.223 --> 00:29:53.392 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: It hurts when you speak
like that, it hurts my being.

00:29:53.392 --> 00:29:56.061 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: Well, I think if I
can talk to you like this,

00:29:56.061 --> 00:29:57.296 align:middle line:84%
you're going to get
very depressed.

00:29:57.296 --> 00:29:58.597 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:29:58.597 --> 00:30:00.232 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: You're going to be
pushing, slightly psychotic.

00:30:00.232 --> 00:30:02.635 align:middle line:84%
But if we play with both
hands, we've have a mixture

00:30:02.635 --> 00:30:04.336 align:middle line:84%
of the treble and
the bass together.

00:30:04.336 --> 00:30:07.273 align:middle line:90%
This is me mixing the harmonics.

00:30:07.273 --> 00:30:09.975 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we take that
horizontal plane and place it

00:30:09.975 --> 00:30:12.177 align:middle line:84%
into the spine vertically,
where's the middle here?

00:30:12.177 --> 00:30:14.880 align:middle line:84%
So we're literally
arising through here --

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:17.116 align:middle line:84%
I think I shared this
with you earlier --

00:30:17.116 --> 00:30:19.752 align:middle line:84%
if words arise from the heart,
they will enter the heart.

00:30:19.752 --> 00:30:21.320 align:middle line:84%
If words arise from
the tongue alone,

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:23.122 align:middle line:84%
they will not pass
beyond the ears.

00:30:23.122 --> 00:30:24.390 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:26.058 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: But unfortunately,
mass media communications,

00:30:26.058 --> 00:30:27.559 align:middle line:84%
particularly on this
great island,

00:30:27.559 --> 00:30:29.395 align:middle line:84%
tend to communicate
themselves like this...

00:30:29.395 --> 00:30:30.729 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Absolutely.

00:30:30.729 --> 00:30:31.697 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: ...because again, we're
caught up in the rhetoric

00:30:31.697 --> 00:30:33.766 align:middle line:84%
of I say something
and you disagree

00:30:33.766 --> 00:30:35.067 align:middle line:90%
with me rather than let's agree.

00:30:35.067 --> 00:30:40.005 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: It's all heady and
vapid at that, so let's talk

00:30:40.005 --> 00:30:41.674 align:middle line:90%
about how we find our note.

00:30:41.674 --> 00:30:43.108 align:middle line:90%
Is it through chanting?

00:30:43.108 --> 00:30:45.511 align:middle line:90%
Is it through singing?

00:30:45.511 --> 00:30:49.281 align:middle line:84%
How do we find our
own unique note?

00:30:49.281 --> 00:30:51.050 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: Wonderful question.

00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:53.485 align:middle line:84%
These questions are
so stimulating.

00:30:53.485 --> 00:30:58.257 align:middle line:84%
Well, the first thing
is that the exciter

00:30:58.257 --> 00:31:02.461 align:middle line:84%
for the sound is our breath,
and most of us don't breathe,

00:31:02.461 --> 00:31:04.530 align:middle line:84%
or if we do breathe, we
breathe very shallowly.

00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:05.664 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: That's true.

00:31:05.664 --> 00:31:07.066 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: And so what I do

00:31:07.066 --> 00:31:10.269 align:middle line:84%
with somebody who's requesting
the information you just asked,

00:31:10.269 --> 00:31:12.438 align:middle line:84%
is to firstly tune
them into the way

00:31:12.438 --> 00:31:13.806 align:middle line:90%
that they're feeling their body,

00:31:13.806 --> 00:31:15.874 align:middle line:84%
the way that they're feeling
their spine as a central column

00:31:15.874 --> 00:31:18.577 align:middle line:84%
of support, and then
how the breath moves.

00:31:18.577 --> 00:31:21.647 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there's we today
who have awakened ourselves

00:31:21.647 --> 00:31:24.750 align:middle line:84%
over the last 25, 30 years,
about our bodies are the temples

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:27.152 align:middle line:84%
of our soul, but we
believe that we just need

00:31:27.152 --> 00:31:29.021 align:middle line:90%
to be breathing in the abdomen.

00:31:29.021 --> 00:31:31.824 align:middle line:84%
And when we're in a deep
state of rest, we breathe just

00:31:31.824 --> 00:31:35.694 align:middle line:84%
into the abdomen, but what I
profess or what I counsel is

00:31:35.694 --> 00:31:36.829 align:middle line:90%
that when we open up the ribs

00:31:36.829 --> 00:31:39.498 align:middle line:84%
and the abdomen we have
a very strong support,

00:31:39.498 --> 00:31:41.900 align:middle line:84%
and when an individual is doing
this, of course, we're working

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:43.435 align:middle line:90%
through this part of the body...

00:31:43.435 --> 00:31:45.804 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I can hear when you're
speaking, where you're coming

00:31:45.804 --> 00:31:47.473 align:middle line:90%
from with each word, yes.

00:31:47.473 --> 00:31:48.007 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: That you can see it.

00:31:48.007 --> 00:31:48.540 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:49.742 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: Yes.

00:31:49.742 --> 00:31:51.043 align:middle line:84%
So that's how I begin it,
and then through breath

00:31:51.043 --> 00:31:58.117 align:middle line:84%
into sustained toning,
ahhhhh, or heeeeee,

00:31:58.117 --> 00:32:00.285 align:middle line:84%
you literally can feel
where the sound is coming

00:32:00.285 --> 00:32:02.287 align:middle line:84%
from in your body, and
then to make a choice

00:32:02.287 --> 00:32:03.422 align:middle line:90%
of where is my center?

00:32:03.422 --> 00:32:05.057 align:middle line:90%
Where do I feel most at home?

00:32:05.057 --> 00:32:06.258 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Where's my
authentic note, yes.

00:32:06.258 --> 00:32:09.128 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: Where is my
authenticity, where is my truth,

00:32:09.128 --> 00:32:11.196 align:middle line:84%
and where our truth
is I believe --

00:32:11.196 --> 00:32:12.798 align:middle line:90%
hopefully this is perceivable,

00:32:12.798 --> 00:32:14.733 align:middle line:84%
that this is my truth,
this is my heart.

00:32:14.733 --> 00:32:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And then that engenders
the whole substance

00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:19.571 align:middle line:84%
of really what my
second book is all about,

00:32:19.571 --> 00:32:23.842 align:middle line:84%
which is the heart's node, that
actually we each are moving

00:32:23.842 --> 00:32:26.045 align:middle line:84%
into a great celebration
of the fact

00:32:26.045 --> 00:32:27.980 align:middle line:84%
that the heart is
the seat of the soul.

00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:30.115 align:middle line:84%
And so if we're sitting in the
seat of the soul with the sum

00:32:30.115 --> 00:32:32.651 align:middle line:84%
of our soul, then we're in a
really, really powerful space.

00:32:32.651 --> 00:32:33.752 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Absolutely.

00:32:33.752 --> 00:32:35.587 align:middle line:84%
Okay, now we're going
to connect this back

00:32:35.587 --> 00:32:37.523 align:middle line:90%
with the story of the angels.

00:32:37.523 --> 00:32:40.359 align:middle line:84%
Because the book that
we're talking about today,

00:32:40.359 --> 00:32:43.162 align:middle line:84%
"The Angels of Atlantis,"
is really interesting

00:32:43.162 --> 00:32:47.933 align:middle line:84%
because you give a chronology of
sorts of how these beings move

00:32:47.933 --> 00:32:51.070 align:middle line:84%
through the ages from one
form of identity into another

00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:53.939 align:middle line:84%
and what they were known
as, and why the names

00:32:53.939 --> 00:32:55.641 align:middle line:84%
and the identities
have to shift.

00:32:55.641 --> 00:32:57.643 align:middle line:84%
Can you give us an
overview of that?

00:32:57.643 --> 00:33:01.947 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll get into some of
the very specifics of Michael

00:33:01.947 --> 00:33:04.283 align:middle line:84%
and some of the angelic
realm you've worked with.

00:33:04.283 --> 00:33:07.753 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: It's a fascinating
question, and I suppose

00:33:07.753 --> 00:33:11.990 align:middle line:84%
to alight on the absolute
premise of what you're asking,

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:14.359 align:middle line:84%
is to talk a little
about Atlantis,

00:33:14.359 --> 00:33:15.627 align:middle line:90%
and why the angel of Atlantis.

00:33:15.627 --> 00:33:16.462 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:33:16.462 --> 00:33:17.729 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: And the angels teach me

00:33:17.729 --> 00:33:21.366 align:middle line:84%
that it was a very extraordinary
project, so to speak,

00:33:21.366 --> 00:33:25.804 align:middle line:84%
a cosmic project that lasted for
probably about 250,000 years.

00:33:25.804 --> 00:33:31.610 align:middle line:84%
And certainly a thousand of
those years was when homosapien,

00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:34.780 align:middle line:84%
homosapiens that knew
that they were star seeds,

00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:38.550 align:middle line:84%
were living a 12-helix DNA, a 12
toque system, and therefore...

00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:40.252 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: In the earliest days?

00:33:40.252 --> 00:33:42.187 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: It -- probably in the
middle of the civilization.

00:33:42.187 --> 00:33:42.688 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: In the middle?

00:33:42.688 --> 00:33:43.755 align:middle line:90%
Okay.

00:33:43.755 --> 00:33:45.657 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: About 1,000
years, that the power

00:33:45.657 --> 00:33:48.994 align:middle line:84%
of the frequency was
thus, that they were able

00:33:48.994 --> 00:33:52.531 align:middle line:84%
to create a very
special biosphere,

00:33:52.531 --> 00:33:56.168 align:middle line:84%
an energetic proportion
around the globe,

00:33:56.168 --> 00:34:01.473 align:middle line:84%
which meant that they lived a
level of harmony that was one

00:34:01.473 --> 00:34:02.975 align:middle line:84%
of the most supreme
that was of harmony

00:34:02.975 --> 00:34:05.511 align:middle line:84%
that I believe this
planet has ever witnessed.

00:34:05.511 --> 00:34:08.580 align:middle line:84%
And I mention that simply
because that's the part

00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:12.618 align:middle line:84%
of the teaching of the
Angels of Atlantis in terms

00:34:12.618 --> 00:34:13.986 align:middle line:90%
of what's happening now.

00:34:13.986 --> 00:34:18.122 align:middle line:84%
Because the whole project
of Atlantis, we know went

00:34:18.122 --> 00:34:21.593 align:middle line:90%
through a cataclysmic finality.

00:34:21.593 --> 00:34:23.961 align:middle line:90%
All civilizations rise and fall.

00:34:23.961 --> 00:34:27.533 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting is that
the precepts have a continuum.

00:34:27.533 --> 00:34:30.568 align:middle line:90%
They are durable, they continue.

00:34:30.568 --> 00:34:34.072 align:middle line:84%
It's just that it seems that
there is a beginning and an end.

00:34:34.072 --> 00:34:37.743 align:middle line:84%
And that's somehow at the very
core of genesis, being the Gene

00:34:37.743 --> 00:34:40.546 align:middle line:84%
of Isis, that genesis
really is the very core

00:34:40.546 --> 00:34:42.180 align:middle line:84%
of what the divine feminine
is really all about,

00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:44.550 align:middle line:84%
what I believe is
the Gene of Isis.

00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:49.488 align:middle line:84%
So without getting too caught
up in all of the splendor

00:34:49.488 --> 00:34:51.823 align:middle line:84%
of this information, that
right at the very end,

00:34:51.823 --> 00:34:56.093 align:middle line:84%
I asked the angels, could you
tell me who were the priests

00:34:56.093 --> 00:34:57.829 align:middle line:90%
and priestesses of Atlantis?

00:34:57.829 --> 00:35:00.766 align:middle line:84%
By this time they taught me
there were 12 communions,

00:35:00.766 --> 00:35:03.836 align:middle line:84%
and the communions were
very specifically oriented

00:35:03.836 --> 00:35:07.606 align:middle line:84%
around certain crafts or
tasks or created actions,

00:35:07.606 --> 00:35:09.741 align:middle line:84%
which is not too
dissimilar to some

00:35:09.741 --> 00:35:13.679 align:middle line:84%
of our indigenous peoples
today, where the child is taken

00:35:13.679 --> 00:35:17.349 align:middle line:84%
by the elders at the age of
7, 8, 9 and it is revealed

00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:19.985 align:middle line:84%
through vision quest what the
incarnation or pathway is to be.

00:35:19.985 --> 00:35:21.253 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:35:21.253 --> 00:35:23.088 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: And so there were
apparently these 12 communions

00:35:23.088 --> 00:35:27.960 align:middle line:84%
of approximately 144,000 people
who were part of a soul group

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:33.365 align:middle line:84%
or a monad, and so I asked who
were the priests and priestesses

00:35:33.365 --> 00:35:36.902 align:middle line:84%
of these 12 communions, and
I was told categorically,

00:35:36.902 --> 00:35:38.437 align:middle line:90%
we will not tell you that.

00:35:38.437 --> 00:35:43.575 align:middle line:84%
And I asked why in a slightly
naughty way, and was told, well,

00:35:43.575 --> 00:35:44.910 align:middle line:90%
because the crystalline grid

00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:48.513 align:middle line:84%
of the planet is still being
repaired, a shock mechanism

00:35:48.513 --> 00:35:50.949 align:middle line:84%
that was set by the splitting
of the atom at the end

00:35:50.949 --> 00:35:52.951 align:middle line:84%
of the 19th century
was something

00:35:52.951 --> 00:35:56.188 align:middle line:84%
that once again created
an imbalance

00:35:56.188 --> 00:35:58.724 align:middle line:84%
within the crystalline
grid, and that we needed

00:35:58.724 --> 00:36:03.061 align:middle line:84%
to move successfully through
toward 10, 10, 10, 11, 11, 11,

00:36:03.061 --> 00:36:06.498 align:middle line:84%
and 12, 12, 12, where genetic
codes are open not just

00:36:06.498 --> 00:36:08.233 align:middle line:90%
within our bodies but also

00:36:08.233 --> 00:36:10.435 align:middle line:84%
within the crystalline
grid of the planet.

00:36:10.435 --> 00:36:13.905 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I found that fascinating
on a personal level as well,

00:36:13.905 --> 00:36:16.375 align:middle line:84%
because I had been taken
back into a regression

00:36:16.375 --> 00:36:19.444 align:middle line:84%
in the end days, not knowing
that's what I was going toward,

00:36:19.444 --> 00:36:20.946 align:middle line:84%
I probably would
have avoided it,

00:36:20.946 --> 00:36:23.515 align:middle line:90%
by a woman named Dolores Cannon.

00:36:23.515 --> 00:36:26.551 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing I kept
saying repeatedly is

00:36:26.551 --> 00:36:31.123 align:middle line:84%
that we had ruined this matrix
between the sun and the Earth

00:36:31.123 --> 00:36:35.227 align:middle line:84%
and the systems, the matrix in
between, and it never occurred

00:36:35.227 --> 00:36:38.297 align:middle line:84%
to me, or I wasn't
seeing or understanding,

00:36:38.297 --> 00:36:41.166 align:middle line:84%
or it wasn't important in
that moment of the regression,

00:36:41.166 --> 00:36:44.536 align:middle line:84%
that this has a crystalline
interface, quite literally,

00:36:44.536 --> 00:36:47.005 align:middle line:84%
and they were using the large
crystals at that time...

00:36:47.005 --> 00:36:48.006 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: Absolutely, absolutely.

00:36:48.006 --> 00:36:48.940 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: ...when things went down.

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:49.941 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: Yes.

00:36:49.941 --> 00:36:51.209 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And I found
that fascinating.

00:36:51.209 --> 00:36:52.644 align:middle line:84%
That was a very important
thing that was destroyed,

00:36:52.644 --> 00:36:54.313 align:middle line:90%
and so they told you about this.

00:36:54.313 --> 00:36:55.647 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: Yes.

00:36:55.647 --> 00:36:56.181 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: That's the first time
I've heard someone else talk

00:36:56.181 --> 00:36:57.516 align:middle line:90%
about this.

00:36:57.516 --> 00:37:00.218 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: And you know, we know
the enormity of the essence

00:37:00.218 --> 00:37:01.353 align:middle line:84%
of what we're saying
at this moment.

00:37:01.353 --> 00:37:02.487 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:37:02.487 --> 00:37:03.588 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: And I'm being
immensely simplistic

00:37:03.588 --> 00:37:05.157 align:middle line:90%
because of the nature of...

00:37:05.157 --> 00:37:06.858 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: It was devastating, yes.

00:37:06.858 --> 00:37:08.193 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: Absolutely extraordinary.

00:37:08.193 --> 00:37:10.996 align:middle line:84%
And so they have the technology
to be able to move largely

00:37:10.996 --> 00:37:14.232 align:middle line:84%
through ultrasound, to be
able to move great fields

00:37:14.232 --> 00:37:17.235 align:middle line:90%
of crystology into safekeeping.

00:37:17.235 --> 00:37:19.871 align:middle line:84%
And so effectively the
wonderment and the mystery

00:37:19.871 --> 00:37:24.443 align:middle line:84%
of their technology was partly
closed down while the priests

00:37:24.443 --> 00:37:28.947 align:middle line:84%
and priestesses moved through
the diaspora to colonize

00:37:28.947 --> 00:37:31.183 align:middle line:90%
in other areas of the world.

00:37:31.183 --> 00:37:32.250 align:middle line:90%
And of course,

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:34.619 align:middle line:84%
it's topographically
or geographically...

00:37:34.619 --> 00:37:35.420 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: You wrote it
beautifully in here.

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:36.355 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: ...identified there.

00:37:36.355 --> 00:37:37.756 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:37:37.756 --> 00:37:40.525 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: The being of light that I
was always in association with,

00:37:40.525 --> 00:37:46.031 align:middle line:84%
which who I still am is Toth
or Thoth or Thothe, Tahuti,

00:37:46.031 --> 00:37:48.700 align:middle line:84%
the great master alchemist
known as the Scribe of the Gods,

00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:50.635 align:middle line:84%
who of course we know
in another aspect

00:37:50.635 --> 00:37:52.571 align:middle line:90%
of incarnation became Hermes

00:37:52.571 --> 00:37:55.574 align:middle line:84%
or Hermes Trismegistus,
the Thrice Born.

00:37:55.574 --> 00:37:57.409 align:middle line:84%
I believe then went
on and became Merlin

00:37:57.409 --> 00:38:00.445 align:middle line:84%
and Christopher Columbus and
Francis Bacon and [inaudible].

00:38:00.445 --> 00:38:01.780 align:middle line:90%
So we went to Egypt.

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:05.650 align:middle line:84%
The unique thing about
Egypt, is really the Nile.

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:08.954 align:middle line:84%
The Nile is the longest river
that we have on the planet,

00:38:08.954 --> 00:38:11.223 align:middle line:90%
almost over 4,000 miles long.

00:38:11.223 --> 00:38:15.127 align:middle line:84%
But it represented
the spine of Atlantis.

00:38:15.127 --> 00:38:17.729 align:middle line:84%
The spine of Atlantis was
an extraordinary river

00:38:17.729 --> 00:38:20.298 align:middle line:84%
which I believe was
called the Alph River,

00:38:20.298 --> 00:38:22.134 align:middle line:84%
at least that's how
I hear the sound

00:38:22.134 --> 00:38:24.636 align:middle line:84%
in my consciousness
during this life.

00:38:24.636 --> 00:38:26.104 align:middle line:90%
It possibly was something else,

00:38:26.104 --> 00:38:29.808 align:middle line:84%
because they used a phonetic
code that we don't use,

00:38:29.808 --> 00:38:32.277 align:middle line:84%
which is basically
vowel resonance.

00:38:32.277 --> 00:38:34.613 align:middle line:84%
What we've done over the
centuries is to bring in a lot

00:38:34.613 --> 00:38:37.516 align:middle line:84%
of consonant, which
is to do with the edge

00:38:37.516 --> 00:38:38.750 align:middle line:90%
of thought, so to speak.

00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:40.285 align:middle line:90%
The consonants actually...

00:38:40.285 --> 00:38:41.286 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: It's more linear.

00:38:41.286 --> 00:38:42.687 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: Yes, exactly.

00:38:42.687 --> 00:38:45.824 align:middle line:84%
And so they set up this
extraordinary magnification

00:38:45.824 --> 00:38:48.693 align:middle line:84%
of what Atlantis was all about,
in different areas of the world,

00:38:48.693 --> 00:38:51.563 align:middle line:84%
but specifically as I
was mentioning in Egypt.

00:38:51.563 --> 00:38:54.599 align:middle line:84%
And this is when the angels
really stepped forward

00:38:54.599 --> 00:38:58.403 align:middle line:84%
with the new paradigm teachings
that are very akin to so many

00:38:58.403 --> 00:39:01.506 align:middle line:84%
of our other great teachers of
today, whether it be Dolores

00:39:01.506 --> 00:39:05.710 align:middle line:84%
or Deepak or Mary Ann
and Mary Williamson,

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:09.781 align:middle line:84%
about how we could actually use
these ancient understandings,

00:39:09.781 --> 00:39:12.517 align:middle line:84%
these new paradigm
principles, knowing full well

00:39:12.517 --> 00:39:15.821 align:middle line:84%
that actually they're universal
concepts that we once used

00:39:15.821 --> 00:39:19.291 align:middle line:84%
in a completely different way
in this context in Atlantis.

00:39:19.291 --> 00:39:22.094 align:middle line:84%
And so that's when they really
presented the whole body

00:39:22.094 --> 00:39:25.263 align:middle line:84%
of the work to me that we
see represented in this book.

00:39:25.263 --> 00:39:29.534 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for
your approbation.

00:39:29.534 --> 00:39:32.270 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: It's so well done,
because it's very clear

00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:34.272 align:middle line:84%
in its layout, but
also you go back

00:39:34.272 --> 00:39:38.310 align:middle line:84%
to after describing the traits
and the functions that each one

00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:40.712 align:middle line:84%
of these beings provides
for humanity

00:39:40.712 --> 00:39:43.648 align:middle line:84%
and then oftentimes
beyond, you also speak

00:39:43.648 --> 00:39:46.818 align:middle line:84%
about what happened during
the decline and the final days

00:39:46.818 --> 00:39:49.454 align:middle line:84%
of Atlantis, and then
the transition of each

00:39:49.454 --> 00:39:51.656 align:middle line:84%
of these beings, who
became then known

00:39:51.656 --> 00:39:55.293 align:middle line:84%
as something else throughout
Egyptian history, Greek history,

00:39:55.293 --> 00:39:58.563 align:middle line:84%
Roman history, but
essentially the same task.

00:39:58.563 --> 00:40:00.832 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: It's interesting, isn't
it that there is lineage.

00:40:00.832 --> 00:40:02.133 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:40:02.133 --> 00:40:03.602 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: And that was what I
was hoping to intend earlier

00:40:03.602 --> 00:40:06.338 align:middle line:84%
when I was talking about the
durability or the endurance,

00:40:06.338 --> 00:40:10.675 align:middle line:84%
that the precepts live on, that
love is a cosmic principle,

00:40:10.675 --> 00:40:12.844 align:middle line:84%
the highest vibration
that we have.

00:40:12.844 --> 00:40:17.182 align:middle line:84%
And that lives on, that grace
lives on, that truth lives on.

00:40:17.182 --> 00:40:18.250 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:19.518 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: Except we
experience the hurly burly

00:40:19.518 --> 00:40:21.453 align:middle line:84%
of what cataclysm is all
about, and of course,

00:40:21.453 --> 00:40:23.588 align:middle line:84%
I'm being very euphemestic
when I say hurly burly,

00:40:23.588 --> 00:40:25.223 align:middle line:90%
because it's disatrous.

00:40:25.223 --> 00:40:30.662 align:middle line:84%
So the principle of -- I
asked them, well what happened

00:40:30.662 --> 00:40:34.299 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the Egyptian
civilization or what happened

00:40:34.299 --> 00:40:37.035 align:middle line:84%
when the Mayan people stepped
into the Fifth Dimension.

00:40:37.035 --> 00:40:40.138 align:middle line:84%
And I was told categorically,
well, you see, what happened is

00:40:40.138 --> 00:40:44.709 align:middle line:84%
that the lineage continued into
the Greek gods and goddesses,

00:40:44.709 --> 00:40:47.412 align:middle line:84%
and so what I've done hopefully
in the book, as effectively

00:40:47.412 --> 00:40:49.981 align:middle line:84%
as possible is to
balance the Greek

00:40:49.981 --> 00:40:52.484 align:middle line:84%
and the Egyptian names
that we were given.

00:40:52.484 --> 00:40:53.952 align:middle line:90%
And then on to Rome.

00:40:53.952 --> 00:40:55.654 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: No, I think you've
done a beautiful job.

00:40:55.654 --> 00:40:59.291 align:middle line:84%
I would like it if you
wouldn't mind, to go into some

00:40:59.291 --> 00:41:02.294 align:middle line:84%
of the traits specifically
of some of the angels.

00:41:02.294 --> 00:41:04.329 align:middle line:84%
And then we can't do all of
them because we'd be here

00:41:04.329 --> 00:41:07.966 align:middle line:84%
for another three hours, but
I know that Michael is near

00:41:07.966 --> 00:41:10.869 align:middle line:84%
and dear to you, so let's
speak about Michael first,

00:41:10.869 --> 00:41:13.805 align:middle line:84%
and talk about what this being
represents, what they bring

00:41:13.805 --> 00:41:17.042 align:middle line:84%
to us, the accessibility
of this being --

00:41:17.042 --> 00:41:19.077 align:middle line:84%
because this is something
people, because we are

00:41:19.077 --> 00:41:23.615 align:middle line:84%
so linear, how can a being speak
to so many at one time type

00:41:23.615 --> 00:41:26.818 align:middle line:84%
of thing, and you can explain
all these basic principles

00:41:26.818 --> 00:41:28.186 align:middle line:90%
to us.

00:41:28.186 --> 00:41:30.021 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: Well, the
finality of the lineage

00:41:30.021 --> 00:41:33.425 align:middle line:84%
up to this present chronology
that we're living in now,

00:41:33.425 --> 00:41:37.896 align:middle line:84%
was the inspiration of the
moment when the fact was shared

00:41:37.896 --> 00:41:41.066 align:middle line:84%
with me by these
extraordinary beings,

00:41:41.066 --> 00:41:43.902 align:middle line:84%
that the archetypes
reappeared in the mind

00:41:43.902 --> 00:41:47.405 align:middle line:84%
of a reincarnated
Atlantan priest wizard

00:41:47.405 --> 00:41:49.374 align:middle line:90%
by the name of Carl Jung.

00:41:49.374 --> 00:41:50.875 align:middle line:90%
And that I found fascinating

00:41:50.875 --> 00:41:54.479 align:middle line:84%
because immediately having taken
myself through Jungian therapy

00:41:54.479 --> 00:41:58.316 align:middle line:84%
as a young person to sort myself
out, and how the development

00:41:58.316 --> 00:42:00.685 align:middle line:84%
of conscious awareness of
the unconscious, so to speak,

00:42:00.685 --> 00:42:03.555 align:middle line:84%
if that's ever possible, came
much more of an interplay,

00:42:03.555 --> 00:42:05.123 align:middle line:84%
and I believe that
that's something that many

00:42:05.123 --> 00:42:06.891 align:middle line:84%
of us have shared
in our awakening

00:42:06.891 --> 00:42:10.629 align:middle line:84%
through this supposed New
Age, that the very fact

00:42:10.629 --> 00:42:12.998 align:middle line:84%
that we're here with
the 12 archetypes.

00:42:12.998 --> 00:42:15.934 align:middle line:84%
And so to swiftly move
into the archetype

00:42:15.934 --> 00:42:19.571 align:middle line:84%
that Michael represents,
that Michael in this form,

00:42:19.571 --> 00:42:22.140 align:middle line:84%
is always seen as
the great leader.

00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:27.879 align:middle line:84%
And we often see Michael with
a sword, the Sword of Truth.

00:42:27.879 --> 00:42:29.714 align:middle line:90%
I believe it's symbolic rather

00:42:29.714 --> 00:42:32.784 align:middle line:84%
than it's the statement
of a fierce warrior.

00:42:32.784 --> 00:42:34.119 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:42:34.119 --> 00:42:36.521 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: But if it is warrior
state, it's about remind us

00:42:36.521 --> 00:42:40.158 align:middle line:84%
of the bravery and the
courage and the steadfastness

00:42:40.158 --> 00:42:42.160 align:middle line:84%
of what the sacred
warrior is all about.

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:43.194 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:42:43.194 --> 00:42:45.163 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: However, I'm
mixing roles here,

00:42:45.163 --> 00:42:48.366 align:middle line:84%
because there is another angel
within the communion of the 12,

00:42:48.366 --> 00:42:51.603 align:middle line:84%
called Haniel, who is
appointed the warrior status,

00:42:51.603 --> 00:42:54.105 align:middle line:84%
whereas Michael was
the great leader.

00:42:54.105 --> 00:42:57.676 align:middle line:84%
So for me, Michael
has always appeared

00:42:57.676 --> 00:43:02.781 align:middle line:84%
as this extraordinary Amethyst
quality, that is in association

00:43:02.781 --> 00:43:04.783 align:middle line:84%
with the alchemy
of transmutation,

00:43:04.783 --> 00:43:06.184 align:middle line:84%
that nothing is singular,
everything is plural.

00:43:06.184 --> 00:43:08.987 align:middle line:84%
So if we can identify
what the disharmony is,

00:43:08.987 --> 00:43:10.488 align:middle line:84%
we can always move
it into harmony.

00:43:10.488 --> 00:43:14.426 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we know that
in the '30s Sazumain appeared

00:43:14.426 --> 00:43:18.663 align:middle line:84%
on Mount Shasta to
Jeffrey Ballard,

00:43:18.663 --> 00:43:21.900 align:middle line:84%
who gave him the
violent Flame Ceremony

00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:24.602 align:middle line:84%
that we know was
conducted in Atlantis,

00:43:24.602 --> 00:43:26.604 align:middle line:90%
that we know was conducted...

00:43:26.604 --> 00:43:28.573 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: That has endured
throughout the ages.

00:43:28.573 --> 00:43:29.107 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: Exactly.

00:43:29.107 --> 00:43:30.475 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:43:30.475 --> 00:43:32.177 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: And now we are using
it, so this is this possibility

00:43:32.177 --> 00:43:37.182 align:middle line:84%
of a device, a tool a paradigm
whereby we can literally shift

00:43:37.182 --> 00:43:40.118 align:middle line:84%
and be led by the
master mistress aspect

00:43:40.118 --> 00:43:41.419 align:middle line:90%
of our own destiny.

00:43:41.419 --> 00:43:44.622 align:middle line:84%
Having said that that's all
very lofty and very real.

00:43:44.622 --> 00:43:48.593 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: But people are saying
yes, but who do we talk to

00:43:48.593 --> 00:43:49.894 align:middle line:90%
and what can you do us?

00:43:49.894 --> 00:43:51.563 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: Yeah, there is a website

00:43:51.563 --> 00:43:55.366 align:middle line:84%
that I've created called
the AngelsofAtlantis.com,

00:43:55.366 --> 00:43:59.104 align:middle line:84%
which is purely a temple
where people can go to listen

00:43:59.104 --> 00:44:02.040 align:middle line:84%
to prayers that the angels
have given me, and to listen

00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:04.375 align:middle line:84%
to meditations that the
angels have given me.

00:44:04.375 --> 00:44:07.445 align:middle line:84%
So it's my voice taking people
through sonic meditations.

00:44:07.445 --> 00:44:09.614 align:middle line:84%
But you know, it's
successfully one

00:44:09.614 --> 00:44:10.982 align:middle line:90%
of the most clickable website.

00:44:10.982 --> 00:44:12.016 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes, wonderful.

00:44:12.016 --> 00:44:13.585 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: Millions of
people click on just

00:44:13.585 --> 00:44:15.687 align:middle line:84%
to receive the countenance
of the angels.

00:44:15.687 --> 00:44:20.325 align:middle line:84%
So if I may drop in the
principle of why are they here?

00:44:20.325 --> 00:44:21.259 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:44:21.259 --> 00:44:22.627 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: These ideas
are fascinating,

00:44:22.627 --> 00:44:25.263 align:middle line:84%
but why are they here,
literally at this time.

00:44:25.263 --> 00:44:29.634 align:middle line:84%
Because many of the great angel
mediums that we know of today

00:44:29.634 --> 00:44:33.204 align:middle line:84%
who have published many books,
are speaking about the fact

00:44:33.204 --> 00:44:36.307 align:middle line:84%
that this appears to be
a new wave of angels,

00:44:36.307 --> 00:44:37.742 align:middle line:90%
and it's highly significant.

00:44:37.742 --> 00:44:40.612 align:middle line:84%
I believe that they are
here to teach us one thing,

00:44:40.612 --> 00:44:43.948 align:middle line:84%
to teach us to love for the
sake of love rather than love

00:44:43.948 --> 00:44:47.085 align:middle line:84%
for the sake of being loved,
and that we are not alone,

00:44:47.085 --> 00:44:50.155 align:middle line:84%
because it seems effectively
that our growth process

00:44:50.155 --> 00:44:52.857 align:middle line:84%
through the substance of
individuation since the end

00:44:52.857 --> 00:44:55.627 align:middle line:84%
of the 19th century, is
to unplug from patriarchy,

00:44:55.627 --> 00:44:59.330 align:middle line:84%
to unplug from that system
that has always held us,

00:44:59.330 --> 00:45:02.066 align:middle line:84%
and if we unplug,
well, who do we go to?

00:45:02.066 --> 00:45:04.369 align:middle line:84%
And what we've effectively
done through all

00:45:04.369 --> 00:45:06.971 align:middle line:90%
of our psychotherapy are shrink

00:45:06.971 --> 00:45:10.708 align:middle line:84%
or our self-empowerment
processes, getting healthy

00:45:10.708 --> 00:45:13.278 align:middle line:84%
and drinking a lot of water, et
cetera, et cetera, et cetera,

00:45:13.278 --> 00:45:15.413 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, all the many
manifestations that there are,

00:45:15.413 --> 00:45:18.149 align:middle line:84%
that we've reached this
point where we're standing

00:45:18.149 --> 00:45:20.385 align:middle line:84%
in the sovereignty
of our own beings.

00:45:20.385 --> 00:45:21.986 align:middle line:84%
We're beginning to see
what the implications

00:45:21.986 --> 00:45:25.690 align:middle line:84%
of being a master mistress of
our own destiny is all about.

00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:28.993 align:middle line:84%
But I feel alone, and
then we realize that no,

00:45:28.993 --> 00:45:32.664 align:middle line:84%
we're not alone, we're all one,
and that's why they're here.

00:45:32.664 --> 00:45:37.735 align:middle line:84%
They're here as instruments to
remind us that we are not alone.

00:45:37.735 --> 00:45:40.605 align:middle line:84%
Because we know that 9/10ths
of the population believe

00:45:40.605 --> 00:45:43.575 align:middle line:84%
in angelic phenomenon, and
yet, if you ask most people

00:45:43.575 --> 00:45:45.910 align:middle line:84%
about the physical
manifestation of angels,

00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:48.079 align:middle line:90%
they are somewhat confused,

00:45:48.079 --> 00:45:49.914 align:middle line:84%
because they're still
feeling alone.

00:45:49.914 --> 00:45:54.953 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the great methods
that I move in using Michael,

00:45:54.953 --> 00:45:57.822 align:middle line:84%
is that we each have
a guardian angel.

00:45:57.822 --> 00:46:00.525 align:middle line:84%
Now, that guardian angel
maybe an archangel,

00:46:00.525 --> 00:46:02.393 align:middle line:84%
but generally speaking
is an emissary

00:46:02.393 --> 00:46:04.696 align:middle line:90%
of the archangelic communion.

00:46:04.696 --> 00:46:06.664 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yes, there are many,
many guides and angels.

00:46:06.664 --> 00:46:08.366 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: Millions of
thoughts of God.

00:46:08.366 --> 00:46:08.867 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:46:08.867 --> 00:46:10.068 align:middle line:90%
Yes. Yes.

00:46:10.068 --> 00:46:12.537 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: But if we can just
call in this guardian,

00:46:12.537 --> 00:46:16.574 align:middle line:84%
and we will always, always be
directed, and then if we reach

00:46:16.574 --> 00:46:19.344 align:middle line:84%
into Michael as the
great leader,

00:46:19.344 --> 00:46:23.982 align:middle line:84%
Metatron as the great teacher,
Jofrial as the great liberator,

00:46:23.982 --> 00:46:27.252 align:middle line:84%
and Gabriel as the great
messenger, so to speak,

00:46:27.252 --> 00:46:31.122 align:middle line:84%
that these beings are
immensely practical.

00:46:31.122 --> 00:46:34.425 align:middle line:84%
They of course have
this venerated position

00:46:34.425 --> 00:46:38.363 align:middle line:84%
that they are immensely
powerful plasmic forces

00:46:38.363 --> 00:46:42.066 align:middle line:84%
but at the same time, Metatron
comes flashing on the screen.

00:46:42.066 --> 00:46:43.468 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:46:43.468 --> 00:46:46.437 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: And here is the -- these
are the -- this is the situal.

00:46:46.437 --> 00:46:48.673 align:middle line:84%
A situal is a very
ancient symbole

00:46:48.673 --> 00:46:52.844 align:middle line:84%
that captures geometic principle
that captures the essence

00:46:52.844 --> 00:46:54.979 align:middle line:90%
of the being of an entity,

00:46:54.979 --> 00:46:57.815 align:middle line:84%
and so this is literally
Metatron's heart.

00:46:57.815 --> 00:47:00.151 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Which is the
diamond, and purity, white.

00:47:00.151 --> 00:47:02.654 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: Which is the
diamond, yeah, yeah,

00:47:02.654 --> 00:47:05.590 align:middle line:84%
and here we see Metatron
as the supernal teacher.

00:47:05.590 --> 00:47:09.460 align:middle line:84%
So Metatron as we know,
was the prophet Inuk,

00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:12.330 align:middle line:84%
who is seen to be gracious
in the eyes of the Lord,

00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:16.968 align:middle line:84%
and I think began to transit
when he was 950, or something,

00:47:16.968 --> 00:47:20.138 align:middle line:84%
950 years of age, and was
asked by the Infinite One

00:47:20.138 --> 00:47:23.174 align:middle line:84%
to literally move in
his body into heaven,

00:47:23.174 --> 00:47:26.911 align:middle line:84%
and through the device that
we now know as the Mirkabar.

00:47:26.911 --> 00:47:31.316 align:middle line:84%
In Ziku, I believe, through
her is the Chariot of Fire,

00:47:31.316 --> 00:47:34.319 align:middle line:84%
surrounded by the seraphin
and the Urim and the Thumin.

00:47:34.319 --> 00:47:39.824 align:middle line:84%
He actually ascends into
heaven and has become Metatron,

00:47:39.824 --> 00:47:43.161 align:middle line:84%
just as the prophet
Elijah became Sandlefon,

00:47:43.161 --> 00:47:45.596 align:middle line:84%
which Sandlefon means Twin
Brother because Metatron

00:47:45.596 --> 00:47:47.966 align:middle line:84%
and Sandlefon twin up
together and they work

00:47:47.966 --> 00:47:50.535 align:middle line:90%
as a sort of wonderful duo.

00:47:50.535 --> 00:47:56.841 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Because a lot of people
claim to be channeling Metatron,

00:47:56.841 --> 00:47:58.810 align:middle line:84%
I think some of them
are genuinely channeling

00:47:58.810 --> 00:48:00.411 align:middle line:90%
that information very clearly.

00:48:00.411 --> 00:48:01.379 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: Yes.

00:48:01.379 --> 00:48:02.447 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: You're receiving
information

00:48:02.447 --> 00:48:04.682 align:middle line:84%
and direct communication
very clearly.

00:48:04.682 --> 00:48:08.720 align:middle line:84%
What is this being -- first
of all, what did they become

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:12.657 align:middle line:84%
after the Atlantan period
through Egypt and so forth?

00:48:12.657 --> 00:48:17.061 align:middle line:84%
And what is he here, "it,"
he, the being here to do?

00:48:17.061 --> 00:48:18.429 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: His being.

00:48:18.429 --> 00:48:20.231 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: His being here to do at
this time and to hold for us

00:48:20.231 --> 00:48:21.566 align:middle line:90%
and allow us access to?

00:48:21.566 --> 00:48:22.633 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: Yes.

00:48:22.633 --> 00:48:24.569 align:middle line:84%
Because we love to
project human qualities

00:48:24.569 --> 00:48:25.837 align:middle line:90%
onto these forces, don't we?

00:48:25.837 --> 00:48:28.873 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: We do, and - and
Metatron's everywhere right now.

00:48:28.873 --> 00:48:30.274 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: Yeah, yeah,
so we say he or she.

00:48:30.274 --> 00:48:31.542 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: He, she.

00:48:31.542 --> 00:48:34.412 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: And to me they're
nonsexual, completely nonsexual.

00:48:34.412 --> 00:48:35.346 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:48:35.346 --> 00:48:37.815 align:middle line:84%
It just sounds so
odd to say "it,"

00:48:37.815 --> 00:48:39.450 align:middle line:90%
because we're so conditioned.

00:48:39.450 --> 00:48:41.419 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I try to refer
to them as being "they."

00:48:41.419 --> 00:48:42.587 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: They, yes, better.

00:48:42.587 --> 00:48:44.355 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: The orb wanderers.

00:48:44.355 --> 00:48:51.462 align:middle line:84%
So for me the teaching
that Metatron gives me is

00:48:51.462 --> 00:48:56.401 align:middle line:84%
that they is a divine
intelligence that is awakening

00:48:56.401 --> 00:48:58.102 align:middle line:90%
within us at the moment.

00:48:58.102 --> 00:49:01.706 align:middle line:84%
We know very remarkable things
are taking place on our planet,

00:49:01.706 --> 00:49:04.409 align:middle line:84%
as we sit almost in the
middle of this vortex

00:49:04.409 --> 00:49:06.878 align:middle line:90%
of the spiritual revolution,

00:49:06.878 --> 00:49:09.280 align:middle line:84%
where immense things
are being revealed to us

00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:11.049 align:middle line:84%
about our physical
emotional mentor

00:49:11.049 --> 00:49:14.318 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual capabilities.

00:49:14.318 --> 00:49:20.058 align:middle line:84%
The wisdom of this I believe,
is of a divine bueprint status,

00:49:20.058 --> 00:49:23.294 align:middle line:84%
and so I believe
that what Metatron,

00:49:23.294 --> 00:49:26.898 align:middle line:84%
who sits on the right-hand
side of divine, as it were,

00:49:26.898 --> 00:49:31.302 align:middle line:90%
has is the key into the Akashic.

00:49:31.302 --> 00:49:34.605 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, Metatronic
energy, metatronic teaching,

00:49:34.605 --> 00:49:37.341 align:middle line:84%
all the healing processes that
are emerging at this time,

00:49:37.341 --> 00:49:40.344 align:middle line:84%
is because of this
infinite connection.

00:49:40.344 --> 00:49:43.448 align:middle line:84%
Words fail in an
infinite connection,

00:49:43.448 --> 00:49:49.454 align:middle line:84%
this supernal celestial movement
into the very technology that is

00:49:49.454 --> 00:49:52.723 align:middle line:84%
at the core of this
infinite cosmos.

00:49:52.723 --> 00:49:54.092 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: Yes.

00:49:54.092 --> 00:49:56.728 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: That the source is an
infinitely unfolding creative

00:49:56.728 --> 00:49:59.764 align:middle line:84%
possibility full of love and
joy and that we I believe,

00:49:59.764 --> 00:50:03.568 align:middle line:84%
are here to embody our
divine status in human form,

00:50:03.568 --> 00:50:05.703 align:middle line:84%
that this is the only
planet of choice.

00:50:05.703 --> 00:50:06.704 align:middle line:90%
So how are we doing?

00:50:06.704 --> 00:50:09.507 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're getting
there, maybe,

00:50:09.507 --> 00:50:13.711 align:middle line:84%
at least my positivism
always leads us to the fact

00:50:13.711 --> 00:50:16.748 align:middle line:84%
that we are moving in the right
direction, and that we're here

00:50:16.748 --> 00:50:19.851 align:middle line:84%
to optimize our creative
energy full of love and joy.

00:50:19.851 --> 00:50:21.619 align:middle line:90%
So how do we optimize that?

00:50:21.619 --> 00:50:24.055 align:middle line:84%
Firstly, it seems that
we're technological beings

00:50:24.055 --> 00:50:26.224 align:middle line:84%
that have developed
our left brains

00:50:26.224 --> 00:50:28.192 align:middle line:84%
in the most extraordinary
way, and of course,

00:50:28.192 --> 00:50:30.895 align:middle line:84%
technology today is advancing
and advancing and advancing,

00:50:30.895 --> 00:50:34.232 align:middle line:84%
and we know that the technology
that is hidden from us

00:50:34.232 --> 00:50:36.901 align:middle line:84%
by our world governments
is infinitely more advanced

00:50:36.901 --> 00:50:38.102 align:middle line:84%
than anything we
actually have in...

00:50:38.102 --> 00:50:40.605 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: What do they
say, 50 to 100 years,

00:50:40.605 --> 00:50:41.873 align:middle line:90%
and that's exponential.

00:50:41.873 --> 00:50:44.709 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yeah, and particularly
within the intelligence

00:50:44.709 --> 00:50:45.743 align:middle line:90%
of this great continent.

00:50:45.743 --> 00:50:46.577 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: Yes.

00:50:46.577 --> 00:50:47.745 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Because there is a reason

00:50:47.745 --> 00:50:49.814 align:middle line:84%
for why this great
continent is the way it is,

00:50:49.814 --> 00:50:54.318 align:middle line:84%
and that it will become
a huge pioneering force

00:50:54.318 --> 00:50:57.822 align:middle line:84%
within the redevelopment
of, or the recalibration,

00:50:57.822 --> 00:51:00.858 align:middle line:84%
of the way that we're beginning
to live our lives through truth,

00:51:00.858 --> 00:51:02.326 align:middle line:84%
through the essence
of authenticity,

00:51:02.326 --> 00:51:03.995 align:middle line:84%
through the essence
of transparency,

00:51:03.995 --> 00:51:06.130 align:middle line:90%
and by recognizing actually

00:51:06.130 --> 00:51:09.534 align:middle line:84%
that the heart is
at the core of this.

00:51:09.534 --> 00:51:12.403 align:middle line:84%
So the technology comes
in, but in conjunction

00:51:12.403 --> 00:51:15.473 align:middle line:84%
with what we're establishing
through our right brains,

00:51:15.473 --> 00:51:19.277 align:middle line:84%
or through the knowledge of
our connection with spirit,

00:51:19.277 --> 00:51:23.681 align:middle line:84%
which I believe is the
wonderment of our beings,

00:51:23.681 --> 00:51:27.151 align:middle line:84%
that Metatron allows us
to balance these forces,

00:51:27.151 --> 00:51:32.657 align:middle line:84%
so it brings in, they bring in,
this extraordinary intelligence,

00:51:32.657 --> 00:51:36.427 align:middle line:84%
which allows us to see
that we are much more

00:51:36.427 --> 00:51:40.198 align:middle line:84%
than we perhaps initially
dreamed of being,

00:51:40.198 --> 00:51:42.900 align:middle line:84%
that we are the stuff
that dreams are made of,

00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:45.937 align:middle line:84%
and that we are star
seeds in connection

00:51:45.937 --> 00:51:50.174 align:middle line:90%
with this supraintelligence,

00:51:50.174 --> 00:51:53.644 align:middle line:84%
that goes beyond
words [inaudible].

00:51:53.644 --> 00:51:57.215 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: And at the same time they
begin, they also are charged

00:51:57.215 --> 00:52:01.752 align:middle line:84%
with helping us to go back
into memory of technology even.

00:52:01.752 --> 00:52:03.054 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah, yeah.

00:52:03.054 --> 00:52:04.388 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: The technologies that
would be brought forward

00:52:04.388 --> 00:52:06.490 align:middle line:84%
that do make some
major adjusments

00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:07.525 align:middle line:90%
on the planet in the future.

00:52:07.525 --> 00:52:08.226 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Absolutely.

00:52:08.226 --> 00:52:08.859 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: In a good way.

00:52:08.859 --> 00:52:09.393 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Absolutely.

00:52:09.393 --> 00:52:10.728 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: Yes.

00:52:10.728 --> 00:52:12.096 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And of course, you know,
there maybe may be viewers

00:52:12.096 --> 00:52:13.464 align:middle line:84%
who are thinking, "Well, what's
the Akashic," and I believe

00:52:13.464 --> 00:52:15.700 align:middle line:84%
that -- my understanding of
the Akashic in terms of the way

00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:18.069 align:middle line:84%
that they teach me, is
that it's a memory belt...

00:52:18.069 --> 00:52:18.903 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: Yes.

00:52:18.903 --> 00:52:19.737 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: ...of all the forces...

00:52:19.737 --> 00:52:21.005 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: A collective memory, yes.

00:52:21.005 --> 00:52:23.908 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: ...being, being
thought within the substance...

00:52:23.908 --> 00:52:25.876 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: And that includes
the blueprints for many,

00:52:25.876 --> 00:52:28.079 align:middle line:84%
many things, including
technology.

00:52:28.079 --> 00:52:29.647 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Absolutely, absolutely.

00:52:29.647 --> 00:52:33.484 align:middle line:84%
And so whatever was stashed
away because of the cataclysm

00:52:33.484 --> 00:52:35.753 align:middle line:84%
that we were referring
to earlier, that that,

00:52:35.753 --> 00:52:38.923 align:middle line:84%
so much of that information
is now coming back to us,

00:52:38.923 --> 00:52:42.994 align:middle line:84%
but is coming back with
a worthiness, I pray,

00:52:42.994 --> 00:52:46.197 align:middle line:84%
whereby we can understand
the substance

00:52:46.197 --> 00:52:52.536 align:middle line:84%
of how this technology can
assist us to be better people

00:52:52.536 --> 00:52:56.407 align:middle line:84%
and not to disempower
ourselves, our connective,

00:52:56.407 --> 00:52:58.409 align:middle line:84%
or indeed other people in
other areas of [inaudible].

00:52:58.409 --> 00:53:01.946 align:middle line:84%
>> Or to be used for distraction
and Tesla certainly has

00:53:01.946 --> 00:53:04.248 align:middle line:90%
to be one of those figures.

00:53:04.248 --> 00:53:07.385 align:middle line:84%
He plays prominently into
that remembrance, certainly.

00:53:07.385 --> 00:53:10.755 align:middle line:84%
So give us an idea
now, Metatrons,

00:53:10.755 --> 00:53:15.793 align:middle line:84%
the change of perception of
his being, and the re-imaging

00:53:15.793 --> 00:53:18.929 align:middle line:84%
and such became what, as
we came into Greece and --

00:53:18.929 --> 00:53:21.265 align:middle line:84%
Egypt, Greece and
Rome -- Metatron?

00:53:21.265 --> 00:53:26.370 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: Well, we go straight into
the Greek philosophic schools,

00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:29.573 align:middle line:84%
the great mystery schools of
Greece, that this I believe is

00:53:29.573 --> 00:53:34.078 align:middle line:84%
where -- because we can argue,
in Western civilization,

00:53:34.078 --> 00:53:36.580 align:middle line:84%
that Greece and Rome
were arugably the origins

00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:37.615 align:middle line:90%
of western civilization.

00:53:37.615 --> 00:53:38.783 align:middle line:84%
Okay, we know we're
going to be...

00:53:38.783 --> 00:53:39.917 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: You take it
back to Egypt,

00:53:39.917 --> 00:53:41.519 align:middle line:84%
which takes it back
to Atlantis, yes.

00:53:41.519 --> 00:53:43.654 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: Exactly, and then to
Mary Ann and then [inaudible].

00:53:43.654 --> 00:53:47.858 align:middle line:84%
So I just wanted to drop
that in, because we are...

00:53:47.858 --> 00:53:48.793 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Very important.

00:53:48.793 --> 00:53:50.761 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: ...exploding thought.

00:53:50.761 --> 00:53:54.332 align:middle line:84%
So what Metatron does I believe
through the Greek formation

00:53:54.332 --> 00:53:58.302 align:middle line:84%
of ideas, is to really bring in
the essence of the philosophic,

00:53:58.302 --> 00:54:04.075 align:middle line:84%
and initiate the Goddess Sophia,
who is the Goddess of Wisdom,

00:54:04.075 --> 00:54:06.711 align:middle line:84%
hence, the root of
the Greek word Philos

00:54:06.711 --> 00:54:08.612 align:middle line:90%
so the love of wisdom.

00:54:08.612 --> 00:54:11.115 align:middle line:84%
The love of Sophia is
the love of wisdom.

00:54:11.115 --> 00:54:13.317 align:middle line:84%
And the practicability
of the way

00:54:13.317 --> 00:54:16.721 align:middle line:84%
that the philosophies were
handed down, through initiation

00:54:16.721 --> 00:54:20.324 align:middle line:84%
after initiation, through
collective rituals,

00:54:20.324 --> 00:54:26.063 align:middle line:84%
but were a way of being able
to draw the infinite technology

00:54:26.063 --> 00:54:28.999 align:middle line:84%
into the experience of
what it is to be human,

00:54:28.999 --> 00:54:31.268 align:middle line:84%
so that the idea
is, the notions,

00:54:31.268 --> 00:54:35.039 align:middle line:84%
the ways of being literally
became embodied substances.

00:54:35.039 --> 00:54:36.273 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:54:36.273 --> 00:54:39.643 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: The other -- in
fact, the illustration here

00:54:39.643 --> 00:54:42.413 align:middle line:84%
that we've used, that
Metatron asked me to use,

00:54:42.413 --> 00:54:43.647 align:middle line:90%
is Gothic architecture.

00:54:43.647 --> 00:54:45.282 align:middle line:90%
It's actually the ceiling

00:54:45.282 --> 00:54:49.053 align:middle line:84%
of King's Cottage --
of King's Cambridge.

00:54:49.053 --> 00:54:51.021 align:middle line:84%
And so what's extraordinary
about this is

00:54:51.021 --> 00:54:53.324 align:middle line:84%
that we see the substance
of geometry.

00:54:53.324 --> 00:54:56.660 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: That was technology and
sacred geometry combined, yes.

00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:57.561 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: Exactly.

00:54:57.561 --> 00:54:58.562 align:middle line:90%
And you know, Gerta said

00:54:58.562 --> 00:55:00.998 align:middle line:84%
that all architecture
is frozen music,

00:55:00.998 --> 00:55:02.833 align:middle line:84%
so there is vibration
within this.

00:55:02.833 --> 00:55:06.003 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I'm there -- I know we
hear great sound acoustically

00:55:06.003 --> 00:55:08.606 align:middle line:84%
from the choir singing at
King's, but whenever I'm there

00:55:08.606 --> 00:55:11.175 align:middle line:90%
in silence, I hear a vibration.

00:55:11.175 --> 00:55:13.244 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And there's
the perfusion of orbs.

00:55:13.244 --> 00:55:16.614 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: And there's orbs,
orbs, orbs, orbs, orbs.

00:55:16.614 --> 00:55:20.451 align:middle line:84%
And I believe it's Eben
Alexander who in Proof

00:55:20.451 --> 00:55:22.086 align:middle line:90%
of Heaven, refers to the fact

00:55:22.086 --> 00:55:25.890 align:middle line:84%
that he continuously
hears this celestial sound

00:55:25.890 --> 00:55:29.193 align:middle line:84%
of the ohm spinning
melodies surrounded by orbs.

00:55:29.193 --> 00:55:30.861 align:middle line:90%
So it's the same thing.

00:55:30.861 --> 00:55:32.062 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:55:32.062 --> 00:55:34.698 align:middle line:84%
Okay, let's talk a little
bit about - there was --

00:55:34.698 --> 00:55:37.968 align:middle line:84%
I think it was Raphael, because
so many people are in crisis,

00:55:37.968 --> 00:55:41.138 align:middle line:84%
so many people need healing,
and I thought, we only have

00:55:41.138 --> 00:55:42.807 align:middle line:84%
about three or four
minutes left.

00:55:42.807 --> 00:55:47.678 align:middle line:84%
Give us an idea of what Raphael
is here to provide for humanity.

00:55:47.678 --> 00:55:49.280 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: Well, we see
it in this icon,

00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:51.916 align:middle line:84%
because here we have this
Tree of Life, and so I believe

00:55:51.916 --> 00:55:56.821 align:middle line:84%
that what we're waking up to
is that our bodies are opening

00:55:56.821 --> 00:55:59.156 align:middle line:84%
to their genetic blueprints,
so that we're beginning to see

00:55:59.156 --> 00:56:01.725 align:middle line:90%
that yes, I have created cancer,

00:56:01.725 --> 00:56:05.262 align:middle line:84%
but at the same time I have the
possibility if I have the wit

00:56:05.262 --> 00:56:07.865 align:middle line:84%
to do it, if the
initiation is rightful

00:56:07.865 --> 00:56:11.268 align:middle line:84%
within my incarnateful
process, I can cure this,

00:56:11.268 --> 00:56:12.436 align:middle line:90%
I can turn this around.

00:56:12.436 --> 00:56:14.672 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we
know many miracles

00:56:14.672 --> 00:56:18.375 align:middle line:84%
where people turn the disharmony
into harmony, because we know

00:56:18.375 --> 00:56:22.513 align:middle line:84%
that our bodies in terms of the
tree of Life and the evocation

00:56:22.513 --> 00:56:25.182 align:middle line:84%
of what it is to
ascend and descend,

00:56:25.182 --> 00:56:26.884 align:middle line:84%
descend through the
Tree of Life,

00:56:26.884 --> 00:56:28.919 align:middle line:84%
that our bodies are
actually blueprinted for help

00:56:28.919 --> 00:56:32.156 align:middle line:84%
and not blueprinted for
disease, and so we can shift it.

00:56:32.156 --> 00:56:35.192 align:middle line:84%
And so what we have here
are I hope vieweres can see,

00:56:35.192 --> 00:56:37.995 align:middle line:84%
these two beautiful hands,
these feminine hands,

00:56:37.995 --> 00:56:41.098 align:middle line:84%
holding the grace
of the Tree of Life,

00:56:41.098 --> 00:56:45.302 align:middle line:84%
and then of course the doves of
peace flying through the air.

00:56:45.302 --> 00:56:49.707 align:middle line:84%
And so what Raphael is asking us
to do is to really get healthy

00:56:49.707 --> 00:56:53.777 align:middle line:84%
with our bodies, and once more
substance of that, for example,

00:56:53.777 --> 00:56:56.947 align:middle line:84%
to be to "Why are
we eating meat?"

00:56:56.947 --> 00:56:58.716 align:middle line:84%
This is what the angels
keep saying to me,

00:56:58.716 --> 00:57:02.253 align:middle line:84%
"Please communicate
that meat is dead flesh.

00:57:02.253 --> 00:57:04.154 align:middle line:90%
There is no light within it."

00:57:04.154 --> 00:57:06.156 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that they want to do is

00:57:06.156 --> 00:57:08.759 align:middle line:84%
to literally get deep
within the alimentary canal,

00:57:08.759 --> 00:57:10.661 align:middle line:84%
because that's the
darkest area of our beings

00:57:10.661 --> 00:57:12.997 align:middle line:84%
so that we become
filled with light.

00:57:12.997 --> 00:57:16.233 align:middle line:84%
And so again with the tree of
Life we're being asked to look

00:57:16.233 --> 00:57:18.536 align:middle line:84%
into the flora and
the fauna of nature

00:57:18.536 --> 00:57:20.070 align:middle line:84%
and start eating more
vegetables and fruit.

00:57:20.070 --> 00:57:21.472 align:middle line:90%
It's very simple.

00:57:21.472 --> 00:57:24.542 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And as people have viewed
into the future, I've had some

00:57:24.542 --> 00:57:26.110 align:middle line:90%
of those instances myself.

00:57:26.110 --> 00:57:27.978 align:middle line:84%
What I keep seeing
is the same thing.

00:57:27.978 --> 00:57:31.282 align:middle line:84%
Our diet becomes more light
filled, it becomes more green,

00:57:31.282 --> 00:57:32.650 align:middle line:90%
it becomes more liquid.

00:57:32.650 --> 00:57:33.684 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: Yes.

00:57:33.684 --> 00:57:35.953 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And that I
have also been told

00:57:35.953 --> 00:57:39.290 align:middle line:84%
that our digestive tracts
will begin atrophying toward

00:57:39.290 --> 00:57:40.691 align:middle line:90%
that end.

00:57:40.691 --> 00:57:43.494 align:middle line:84%
So I can understand that what
they're saying has a great deal

00:57:43.494 --> 00:57:44.828 align:middle line:90%
of truth, even though we're

00:57:44.828 --> 00:57:46.931 align:middle line:84%
in that incredible cross-over
period of time where some

00:57:46.931 --> 00:57:49.833 align:middle line:84%
of our bodies are still craving
protein at the time we're trying

00:57:49.833 --> 00:57:51.635 align:middle line:90%
to take this on board.

00:57:51.635 --> 00:57:54.805 align:middle line:84%
And so what about the
whole notion of going back

00:57:54.805 --> 00:57:58.576 align:middle line:84%
to a 12-stranded DNA
matrix as humans?

00:57:58.576 --> 00:57:59.643 align:middle line:90%
What about that?

00:57:59.643 --> 00:58:01.412 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: Well, we're
gestating, I believe.

00:58:01.412 --> 00:58:04.214 align:middle line:84%
We're really evolving at
this time, so we're moving

00:58:04.214 --> 00:58:06.417 align:middle line:84%
from a double helix
into a triple helix.

00:58:06.417 --> 00:58:09.653 align:middle line:84%
But I guess that that's the
fruit of another conversation.

00:58:09.653 --> 00:58:11.622 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yes, I think
it probably is.

00:58:11.622 --> 00:58:17.394 align:middle line:84%
Any final thoughts in terms
of -- having the faith,

00:58:17.394 --> 00:58:20.397 align:middle line:84%
because it does come down
to faith, to understand,

00:58:20.397 --> 00:58:24.001 align:middle line:84%
for people who don't see,
like the diamond sparks

00:58:24.001 --> 00:58:27.771 align:middle line:84%
around your head and such -- if
we're not seeing these things,

00:58:27.771 --> 00:58:31.075 align:middle line:84%
how do you tell people
in just a minute or so

00:58:31.075 --> 00:58:34.244 align:middle line:84%
to give themselves permission to
please call upon these forces?

00:58:34.244 --> 00:58:35.579 align:middle line:90%
They're there for them.

00:58:35.579 --> 00:58:38.349 align:middle line:84%
>> SP: Thank you so much,
because I wanted to drop this

00:58:38.349 --> 00:58:42.286 align:middle line:84%
in because we're using
fairly lofty thoughts,

00:58:42.286 --> 00:58:45.222 align:middle line:84%
and what I wanted to drop in,
so that we really bet back

00:58:45.222 --> 00:58:48.492 align:middle line:84%
to the Earth, is the nature
of the fact that these beings

00:58:48.492 --> 00:58:51.395 align:middle line:84%
of light are immensely
practical.

00:58:51.395 --> 00:58:53.497 align:middle line:90%
They can be really ordinary.

00:58:53.497 --> 00:58:57.301 align:middle line:84%
For example, Michael, who's been
with me for many, many years,

00:58:57.301 --> 00:58:58.936 align:middle line:90%
is really Greg with electrics.

00:58:58.936 --> 00:59:02.506 align:middle line:84%
So -- let's see if I can
be really fast with this --

00:59:02.506 --> 00:59:05.409 align:middle line:84%
about three years ago, I
was finishing writing one

00:59:05.409 --> 00:59:09.246 align:middle line:84%
of my books, and I stayed
in the house in London

00:59:09.246 --> 00:59:11.515 align:middle line:90%
to finish this at Eastertime.

00:59:11.515 --> 00:59:14.551 align:middle line:84%
And I normally love
Easter in New York City

00:59:14.551 --> 00:59:15.986 align:middle line:84%
because I love the
spring in New York City.

00:59:15.986 --> 00:59:19.323 align:middle line:84%
However, I stayed in London to
finish the book, very dutifully,

00:59:19.323 --> 00:59:21.925 align:middle line:90%
and on Mournday thursday,

00:59:21.925 --> 00:59:24.728 align:middle line:84%
the Thursday before
Easter the electrics

00:59:24.728 --> 00:59:27.031 align:middle line:84%
in the house went haywire --
I have no central heating.

00:59:27.031 --> 00:59:29.433 align:middle line:84%
It suddenly became
immensely cold.

00:59:29.433 --> 00:59:31.268 align:middle line:84%
So of course, I called
an engineer

00:59:31.268 --> 00:59:36.240 align:middle line:84%
to fix this combination central
heating/hot water/boiler thing

00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:39.910 align:middle line:84%
that I had, and the engineer
came in said, "Aw, no, sorry,

00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:42.279 align:middle line:84%
Gaffner, no, there's
this special part, right,

00:59:42.279 --> 00:59:44.848 align:middle line:84%
I fine I have to fix it and
I won't be able to get it

00:59:44.848 --> 00:59:46.984 align:middle line:84%
for the next five days,
whatever, you know what I mean."

00:59:46.984 --> 00:59:48.352 align:middle line:90%
And so what am I going to do?

00:59:48.352 --> 00:59:49.953 align:middle line:90%
It was literally freezing cold.

00:59:49.953 --> 00:59:51.321 align:middle line:90%
I'll have to move into a hotel.

00:59:51.321 --> 00:59:57.061 align:middle line:84%
I got on my knees and I prayed
to Michael, please fix this.

00:59:57.061 --> 01:00:00.064 align:middle line:84%
Five minutes later, I was
back into the book surrounded

01:00:00.064 --> 01:00:02.733 align:middle line:84%
by coats and scarves,
and I thought,

01:00:02.733 --> 01:00:04.668 align:middle line:84%
"I've got to get
to the bathroom."

01:00:04.668 --> 01:00:05.936 align:middle line:84%
Walking through the
house, thinking,

01:00:05.936 --> 01:00:07.404 align:middle line:90%
"Why is it so hot in here?"

01:00:07.404 --> 01:00:09.006 align:middle line:84%
And all the heating
had come back on.

01:00:09.006 --> 01:00:10.641 align:middle line:90%
So Michael will fix it.

01:00:10.641 --> 01:00:12.643 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: You had stories
in your book like this,

01:00:12.643 --> 01:00:15.179 align:middle line:84%
but also personally you
have many, many more.

01:00:15.179 --> 01:00:17.648 align:middle line:84%
So we just have to
know they're there.

01:00:17.648 --> 01:00:21.385 align:middle line:84%
We need to take the
responsibility to ask.

01:00:21.385 --> 01:00:22.519 align:middle line:90%
Right? Thank you so much,

01:00:22.519 --> 01:00:24.188 align:middle line:84%
and I hope we do have
another conversation.

01:00:24.188 --> 01:00:25.456 align:middle line:90%
>> SP: Bless you.

01:00:25.456 --> 01:00:26.790 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I know you have
another book coming out soon.

01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:28.992 align:middle line:84%
So Stewart has written books,
recorded sound healing CDs

01:00:28.992 --> 01:00:32.796 align:middle line:84%
and gives workshops on healing
with the angel and voice.

01:00:32.796 --> 01:00:36.500 align:middle line:84%
You can go to his website at the
alchemyofvoice.com to connect

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:38.035 align:middle line:90%
with all of these tools.

01:00:38.035 --> 01:01:03.827 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaim TV.
