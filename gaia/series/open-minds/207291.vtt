00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.680 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.490 align:middle line:90%


00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.740 align:middle line:84%
STEVEN ROSS: Steven, would
you like to visit a castle.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:12.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm from Los Angeles.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:14.060 align:middle line:90%
It's like, yeah.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.860 align:middle line:90%
I guess.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.670 align:middle line:84%
As an alchemist, von
Bernus was so powerful,

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.550 align:middle line:84%
during World War
II, the Nazis were

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.920 align:middle line:84%
afraid to even go
into the castles.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.000 align:middle line:90%
His wife is still alive.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.180 align:middle line:90%
She's 95 years old.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.010 align:middle line:84%
When she answers the door,
she looks at me and she says,

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.468 align:middle line:90%
I've been waiting for you.

00:00:34.468 --> 00:00:36.010 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
Everybody does this.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.040 align:middle line:84%
All these famous people do
this as soon as they see you.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.830 align:middle line:84%
ROSS: I was kind of in shock,
and I said, we're all staying?

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:43.630 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.780 align:middle line:84%
She wants you to
stay for three days.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.450 align:middle line:84%
I open the trunk and
there's parchment

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:55.240 align:middle line:90%
and scrolls dated 1300s, 1400s.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.480 align:middle line:84%
So when I say I could
feel these energies,

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.460 align:middle line:84%
I could pick things
up from books,

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.230 align:middle line:84%
I want everybody to
understand, so can they.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.190 align:middle line:84%
One does not have to go and
stay in the alchemist's castle.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.980 align:middle line:84%
It's dramatic enough
to get me on your show

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.050 align:middle line:84%
to share with your audience
that anything in this world

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.850 align:middle line:90%
can happen.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.960 align:middle line:90%


00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.460 align:middle line:10%
REGINA: There's a
world of knowledge

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.730 align:middle line:10%
in books out there that most of
us will never have access to.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.920 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, our
friend, Steven Ross,

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.020 align:middle line:84%
has had a lily
gilded life when it

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.570 align:middle line:84%
comes to being led to
precious and profound books

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:32.560 align:middle line:90%
and documents.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.270 align:middle line:84%
In our last
conversation, we spoke

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.280 align:middle line:84%
about his meeting
with Manly P Hall

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.520 align:middle line:84%
and being given access to
his famed vault. Today,

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.610 align:middle line:84%
we're going to hear the story
of Alexander von Bernus who--

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.160 align:middle line:84%
he lived in Germany in
a castle, and Steven

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.680 align:middle line:84%
was given access to
more than just books

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.790 align:middle line:90%
when you visited his castle.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.100 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know this story
until maybe six months ago.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.830 align:middle line:84%
You and I were talking and I
said, we have to do a show.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.890 align:middle line:84%
Because it always
essentially comes

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.740 align:middle line:84%
to the same place,
the same things

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.260 align:middle line:84%
that are required of us to
engage in our own lives,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.840 align:middle line:84%
but your stories are also
quirky and different.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.880 align:middle line:90%
So welcome back, Steven.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.880 align:middle line:90%
ROSS: Thank you, Regina.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.340 align:middle line:10%
And I always have to
hold something back

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.738 align:middle line:10%
so I can be re-invited again.

00:02:14.738 --> 00:02:16.780 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Oh, so this is
strategic or otherwise, we

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.487 align:middle line:90%
would have done this years ago.

00:02:18.487 --> 00:02:19.570 align:middle line:90%
ROSS: Yes, it was planned.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:20.370 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.080 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So, first of all, let's
talk about the time when--

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.660 align:middle line:84%
we mentioned this before--
you and I were both wandering

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.870 align:middle line:84%
around Europe looking for
stories on alternative,

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.300 align:middle line:84%
or particularly, energy
and color healing.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.670 align:middle line:10%
So people know this if
they've seen us before.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.280 align:middle line:10%
And we're bumping into
the same characters.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.160 align:middle line:10%
But you were there regularly
because you actually

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.980 align:middle line:10%
had an office in Stuttgart where
I was just there to pick up

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.210 align:middle line:10%
a few stories.

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And so you-- so you had a
couple of friends that you met,

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:48.760 align:middle line:90%
Karl and Heidi, right?

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:49.560 align:middle line:90%
ROSS: Yes.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.280 align:middle line:90%
They were my staff,

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.810 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: They were your staff.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.220 align:middle line:84%
So they said, Steven,
psst, there's this castle.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And so pick up the
story from there

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.390 align:middle line:84%
and tell us what
happened as you were

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.810 align:middle line:84%
on your search for
alternative healing therapies.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.120 align:middle line:84%
ROSS: Regina, let
me start by saying,

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.110 align:middle line:84%
thank you for having
me as a guest today.

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.910 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Always.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.760 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.450 align:middle line:84%
ROSS: Karl and Heidi and I
would take two-week journeys

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.740 align:middle line:84%
throughout Europe investigating
healers and clinics.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.550 align:middle line:84%
So in fact, we were
going to leave on a trip,

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.250 align:middle line:84%
and Heidi says to
me, Steven, would you

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.370 align:middle line:90%
like to visit a castle?

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.520 align:middle line:90%
I'm from Los Angeles.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.310 align:middle line:90%
It's like, yeah, the castle, OK.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.340 align:middle line:84%
So as we're driving
to this castle,

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.950 align:middle line:84%
Heidi tells me she
grew up in this area.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.810 align:middle line:84%
It's the von Bernus Castle,
and Alexander von Bernus

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.000 align:middle line:84%
was a very famous alchemist
who lived in the 1900s

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.700 align:middle line:90%
to about 1950.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And we visit, we
come to the door,

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.520 align:middle line:84%
and they say his
wife is still alive.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:04.420 align:middle line:84%
She's 95 years old and she
doesn't speak any English.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.590 align:middle line:90%
We'll translate.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:11.380 align:middle line:84%
But when she answers the door,
she looks at me and she says,

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.183 align:middle line:90%
I've been waiting for you.

00:04:13.183 --> 00:04:14.350 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Everybody does this.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.320 align:middle line:84%
All these famous people do
this as soon as they see you.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.180 align:middle line:90%
ROSS: I don't mind.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm very forth-- hey, I live
a very blessed, magical life.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And Karl and Heidi
look at each other,

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.220 align:middle line:84%
because the Baroness von
Bernus was speaking English.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.020 align:middle line:84%
We sat down, and in this room
were floor to ceiling books,

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.390 align:middle line:84%
and on a coffee table is a book
about Paracelsus from the 1600s

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.370 align:middle line:90%
just sitting open there.

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm glancing around,
it's unbelievable

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.170 align:middle line:90%
with the paintings.

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:48.610 align:middle line:90%
They're all speaking German.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And even though
you and I traveled,

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.220 align:middle line:84%
I only speak two languages,
English and Pig Latin,

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.110 align:middle line:84%
so I did not understand
any of the German.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.440 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: I can Speak English
and Pig French, I guess.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.010 align:middle line:84%
ROSS: But you and I still were
able to make these journeys.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.927 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah, we were.

00:05:03.927 --> 00:05:07.150 align:middle line:84%
ROSS: So they spoke
for a couple hours,

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.910 align:middle line:84%
and we were all getting
up, I saw them get up,

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.590 align:middle line:84%
and as we're going
through the door,

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.810 align:middle line:90%
the baroness puts her arm--

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.640 align:middle line:90%
her hand on my arm.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.610 align:middle line:84%
So I look at my staff
people and they go,

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.230 align:middle line:90%
she doesn't want you to go.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.010 align:middle line:90%
I said, what?

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:23.870 align:middle line:90%
She wants you to stay.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.690 align:middle line:84%
I was kind of in shock, and
I said, we're all staying?

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:28.490 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.640 align:middle line:84%
She wants you to
stay for three days.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course,
I had my suitcase

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.150 align:middle line:84%
because we're going
to be traveling.

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:40.640 align:middle line:84%
Karl and Heidi said to me,
we will return in three days

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.650 align:middle line:90%
and we will pick you up again.

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.980 align:middle line:84%
The baroness says, you have full
access to the entire castle,

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.560 align:middle line:84%
which was 3 stories,
and we will at least

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.240 align:middle line:84%
show you where your room
is on the very top floor.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.510 align:middle line:84%
So we go up, and
there was a room

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:00.310 align:middle line:84%
on the top floor of the castle,
and there was a trunk there.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.800 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I
was wondering, am I

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.380 align:middle line:84%
allowed to open
this trunk or not?

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.340 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: She said you have
access to everything.

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.850 align:middle line:84%
ROSS: And what did
I do that night?

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:12.610 align:middle line:84%
I open the trunk,
and there's parchment

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:18.760 align:middle line:90%
and scrolls dated 1300s, 1400s.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.070 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: In Latin or German?

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:25.180 align:middle line:84%
ROSS: In Latin, in German,
just an incredible collection

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.380 align:middle line:90%
of materials.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.100 align:middle line:84%
And throughout the
castle are, again,

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:34.000 align:middle line:84%
floor to ceiling books,
paintings of some

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.920 align:middle line:90%
of the old masters in there.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.140 align:middle line:90%
It was incredible.

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:41.530 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to stop
there to take a breath

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:42.697 align:middle line:90%
and not go on and on and on.

00:06:42.697 --> 00:06:44.280 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Oh, I want
you to go on and on

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.850 align:middle line:90%
because what I'm going to say--

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:47.200 align:middle line:90%
I'll just prompt you further.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.000 align:middle line:90%
ROSS: OK

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.380 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: OK, she also told
you you could have access

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.310 align:middle line:90%
to his office.

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:55.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, his office was kept
100% intact, it sounds like.

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:57.400 align:middle line:84%
Nothing had been
touched since his death.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.130 align:middle line:84%
How long had it been
since he had died?

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:07.070 align:middle line:84%
ROSS: He had died 30 years
before I went into the room.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:15.530 align:middle line:84%
But for clarity, when Karl
and Heidi were to pick me up,

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.640 align:middle line:84%
they did pick me up,
we were walking out,

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:21.930 align:middle line:84%
and once again, the baroness
put her hand on my arm,

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:25.300 align:middle line:84%
and I thought another
three or four days,

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:32.410 align:middle line:84%
but she told them she wanted me
at that time to go follow her.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:37.180 align:middle line:84%
And I followed her down
corridors, hallways,

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:38.660 align:middle line:90%
she takes out a big key--

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:39.250 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Hidden passageways.

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:39.770 align:middle line:90%
ROSS: Exactly.

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:40.810 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: You mean one
of those huge ones

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:42.100 align:middle line:90%
you see in the movies?

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.090 align:middle line:90%
ROSS: A big key.

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:44.020 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:48.940 align:middle line:84%
ROSS: And unlocks this room,
and that was his office.

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:54.040 align:middle line:84%
No other person had been in that
room other than the baroness

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.650 align:middle line:90%
since her husband had died.

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:59.380 align:middle line:90%
And I'm just looking around.

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:02.860 align:middle line:84%
Karl and Heidi didn't say,
she's taking you to the office,

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.810 align:middle line:84%
they just said, she
wants you to go with her.

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And I did, because
I always follow

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:09.310 align:middle line:90%
what women tell me to do.

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:10.352 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Of course you do.

00:08:10.352 --> 00:08:11.185 align:middle line:90%
ROSS: There you go.

00:08:11.185 --> 00:08:13.450 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: You're a good son.

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:15.110 align:middle line:90%
ROSS: I sat there.

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:16.150 align:middle line:90%
She was meditating.

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:17.530 align:middle line:90%
I meditated.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:19.120 align:middle line:90%
Just sat quietly.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.810 align:middle line:84%
About 15 minutes later,
she touched me again

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:24.160 align:middle line:90%
and we walked out.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:28.450 align:middle line:84%
And driving home, Heidi
says, Steve, that is amazing.

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:34.693 align:middle line:84%
Nobody has ever been in that
room other than the two.

00:08:34.693 --> 00:08:35.860 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: What did you absorb?

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:37.809 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of other
things to absorb here you're

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:40.510 align:middle line:84%
going to tell us about, but what
did you absorb in that room?

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:44.140 align:middle line:84%
ROSS: Well, in
that room, I could

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:47.950 align:middle line:84%
feel the energy, which
was very profound,

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:52.600 align:middle line:84%
because as an alchemist,
von Bernus was

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:57.160 align:middle line:84%
so powerful that
during World War II,

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.550 align:middle line:84%
Jewish citizens would
be in the castle

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:04.250 align:middle line:84%
and the Nazis were
afraid to even mess--

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:05.050 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: With him.

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:08.020 align:middle line:84%
ROSS: With Alexander von
Bernus or go into the castle.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:10.460 align:middle line:90%
So that was his zone.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:14.050 align:middle line:84%
It was very powerful
because the three days

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:18.040 align:middle line:84%
before that final
time in his office,

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:23.140 align:middle line:84%
I was getting downloads
all the time, the energy.

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:26.530 align:middle line:84%
I was to find out that
von Bernus had access

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:32.290 align:middle line:84%
to all of Goethe's library,
who is also very famous,

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:37.960 align:middle line:84%
and Paracelsus material,
and that they had found--

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:41.370 align:middle line:84%
people after von
Bernus had left--

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:44.700 align:middle line:84%
special diaries
that von Bernus had

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:51.390 align:middle line:84%
written in of Paracelsian
formulas and old manuscripts

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:55.920 align:middle line:84%
handed down for years
that this alchemist had.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:02.250 align:middle line:84%
And being a sensitive type,
I just was picking up,

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:06.030 align:middle line:84%
there is a lot going on
in here, and I would just

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:07.410 align:middle line:90%
wander through.

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:12.290 align:middle line:84%
And this hasn't always
happened in my life,

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:14.090 align:middle line:84%
but I would touch
some of the books that

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:18.225 align:middle line:84%
were in other languages, and
I could feel the essence.

00:10:18.225 --> 00:10:19.350 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Of the information?

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:19.490 align:middle line:90%
ROSS: Yeah.

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:21.200 align:middle line:10%
REGINA: And it's fair
to note here, too,

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:25.790 align:middle line:10%
that in your own library, your
beautiful, beautiful library

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:28.670 align:middle line:10%
in Sedona, Arizona, World
Research Foundation,

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:32.355 align:middle line:10%
you, too, have some
original works of Goethe.

00:10:32.355 --> 00:10:33.155 align:middle line:90%
ROSS: Yes.

00:10:33.155 --> 00:10:34.572 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: And also Paracelsus.

00:10:34.572 --> 00:10:35.372 align:middle line:90%
ROSS: Yes.

00:10:35.372 --> 00:10:38.840 align:middle line:84%
And I do want to add,
because one thing

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.150 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to accomplish
on the show today

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:43.320 align:middle line:90%
is to be empowering people.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:47.120 align:middle line:84%
So when I say, I could
feel these energies,

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.100 align:middle line:84%
I could pick things
up from books,

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:54.290 align:middle line:84%
I want everybody to
understand, so can they.

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:59.180 align:middle line:84%
It's a matter of people
understanding they can do it.

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:01.385 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, we'll get into
it a little bit later.

00:11:01.385 --> 00:11:02.510 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: No, we're going to.

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:03.440 align:middle line:90%
ROSS: --with the three keys.

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.523 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Want to hear the
rest of this story first.

00:11:05.523 --> 00:11:07.730 align:middle line:90%


00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:09.290 align:middle line:90%
So let's go back.

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:12.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're sleeping there
and stuff starts happening.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:13.490 align:middle line:90%
ROSS: Yes.

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:14.990 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Let's talk
about some of it.

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:17.570 align:middle line:84%
ROSS: Well, some of the things
where I was really journeying,

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:20.690 align:middle line:84%
and I-- of course, you're
aware of a book on dreams.

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:24.680 align:middle line:84%
I've been guided by dreams
since I was 23 years old.

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm 73, so that makes 50 years.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And in those dreams,
taken different places.

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:35.240 align:middle line:84%
But while I was there, it
was kind of interdimensional,

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:39.680 align:middle line:84%
because that's who
this individual was.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:45.740 align:middle line:84%
And the environment, the place,
the castle, the vibrations

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:52.370 align:middle line:84%
were really set up to elicit
experiences like that.

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:53.547 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:11:53.547 --> 00:11:54.380 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.588 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yeah,
staying in the home overnight.

00:11:56.588 --> 00:11:58.970 align:middle line:84%
STEVEN ROSS: Yes, I mean,
it was very profound.

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:05.150 align:middle line:84%
But I was picking up a lot
of the Paracelsian concepts,

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:10.730 align:middle line:84%
even though Paracelsus lived
late 1400s, middle 1500s.

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:11.840 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:15.170 align:middle line:84%
Because that energy
was permeating place.

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's good for the
listeners to understand.

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:22.980 align:middle line:90%
Environment is everything.

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:26.500 align:middle line:84%
Vibrations permeate
environments,

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:31.530 align:middle line:84%
which is why this alchemist
was a great alchemist.

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:35.400 align:middle line:84%
But he was able to do even
more because the environment is

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.420 align:middle line:90%
conducive.

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:39.600 align:middle line:84%
So if we want to do
beautiful things,

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.850 align:middle line:84%
it would help if we have
a beautiful environment.

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:43.200 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: What you do--

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.527 align:middle line:90%
beauty is very high.

00:12:44.527 --> 00:12:46.110 align:middle line:84%
STEVEN ROSS: Beauty
is very important,

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:51.720 align:middle line:84%
as you know, in my life and
what we share with individuals.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:55.890 align:middle line:84%
And while we may have a library,
I always encourage people,

00:12:55.890 --> 00:13:01.500 align:middle line:84%
have a spot in your house that
just is so high in vibrations.

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:05.100 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't necessarily need
to have all kinds of statues

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:05.910 align:middle line:90%
and whatever.

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.040 align:middle line:90%
It can.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.510 align:middle line:84%
But if you have
beautiful thoughts--

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:12.510 align:middle line:84%
if you permeate and
just say, in this spot,

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:16.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to think or talk
about politics or religion

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:22.940 align:middle line:84%
or negativity, I am just
going to enliven this area

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:24.320 align:middle line:90%
with beauty--

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.510 align:middle line:90%
it will grow.

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:28.640 align:middle line:90%
It will become more powerful.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:33.470 align:middle line:84%
The Paracelsian the
concept is you resonate.

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:35.390 align:middle line:90%
As above, so below.

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:38.990 align:middle line:84%
We have within us
these parts of us

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:41.150 align:middle line:90%
that resonate with the cosmos.

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:46.220 align:middle line:84%
So if we think about beauty,
we can draw all the beauty that

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:53.020 align:middle line:84%
exists in our geographical area,
in our state, in the country,

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:56.045 align:middle line:90%
in the world, in the universe.

00:13:56.045 --> 00:13:56.920 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.495 align:middle line:84%
We can concentrate
it into our space.

00:13:59.495 --> 00:14:00.370 align:middle line:90%
STEVEN ROSS: Correct.

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:03.400 align:middle line:84%
So getting back to
the castle, being

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:06.370 align:middle line:84%
in that kind of
environment, immersed--

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:10.750 align:middle line:84%
and I don't think it was an
accident it was three days.

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:13.237 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot in literature
about three days.

00:14:13.237 --> 00:14:14.320 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Triplets.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:14.570 align:middle line:90%


00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:15.370 align:middle line:90%
STEVEN ROSS: Yup.

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:20.860 align:middle line:84%
So those days allowed me to
get into this incredible space.

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.590 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere I looked-- and
here was the baroness.

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:25.750 align:middle line:90%
Of course, I saw her frequently.

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:28.882 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't communicate, but
she was smiling all the time.

00:14:28.882 --> 00:14:31.090 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: She's a
beautiful little thing, just

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:32.210 align:middle line:90%
a beautiful little flower.

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:33.010 align:middle line:90%
STEVEN ROSS: Yes.

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:39.860 align:middle line:84%
And when she finally passed
about six or seven years later,

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:45.310 align:middle line:84%
the state where she lived really
confiscated all of the library,

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:48.773 align:middle line:84%
because those were archival
books and treasures.

00:14:48.773 --> 00:14:50.440 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: I
was going to ask you.

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.060 align:middle line:90%
So that stuff's gone.

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:55.420 align:middle line:84%
STEVEN ROSS: It's gone
into a place where

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:57.190 align:middle line:90%
it's a little bit harder.

00:14:57.190 --> 00:15:00.372 align:middle line:84%
Although, again, not everybody
could go into the castle.

00:15:00.372 --> 00:15:01.330 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Right.

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:04.240 align:middle line:84%
STEVEN ROSS: But when
materials like this

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:12.160 align:middle line:84%
disappear into universities
or government locations,

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.290 align:middle line:84%
you don't always
have access to it.

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:16.350 align:middle line:90%
And that becomes a shame.

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:18.600 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Which is
why the amount of dedication

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:21.210 align:middle line:84%
you've had to putting into
keeping your library together,

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:24.030 align:middle line:84%
so people can come and see
all of this displayed in one

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:25.530 align:middle line:90%
place in peace is amazing.

00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:27.000 align:middle line:90%
But so it's gone now.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.210 align:middle line:84%
But so let's talk about the
baron reaching out toward you.

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:32.010 align:middle line:90%
STEVEN ROSS: Yes.

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:39.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, after my experience
in his office, we decided--

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:41.260 align:middle line:90%
Karl, Heidi, and I--

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:46.980 align:middle line:84%
I needed to go back to Stuttgart
to get my bearings again.

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:49.650 align:middle line:84%
And then we would proceed
throughout Europe.

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:51.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, I go back
that evening, and I

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:53.580 align:middle line:90%
was staying in Karl's house.

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:59.370 align:middle line:84%
And Karl had actually
like a three-story house

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:00.390 align:middle line:90%
with an attic.

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:03.600 align:middle line:84%
So that night-- the
attic was really nice.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:04.860 align:middle line:90%
I was staying up there.

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle of the
night, I hear footsteps.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.920 align:middle line:90%


00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.017 align:middle line:90%
And I said--

00:16:12.017 --> 00:16:13.350 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Who goes there?

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:15.500 align:middle line:84%
STEVEN ROSS: Yeah,
who goes there?

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:16.300 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:17.880 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And I heard, "von
Bernus is here."

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, whoa,
because I don't--

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:28.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm fully awake when I'm awake.

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:30.870 align:middle line:84%
He was there, and
I couldn't wait.

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:32.580 align:middle line:84%
So the next morning,
I call Heidi,

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:35.850 align:middle line:84%
and I go, Heidi, Heidi,
please call the baroness.

00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:37.620 align:middle line:90%
Tell her what happened.

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:40.500 align:middle line:84%
30 minutes later, Heidi gets
back, and she's laughing.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:44.970 align:middle line:84%
She goes, Elsa von
Bernus-- she already knew.

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:49.240 align:middle line:84%
She said, Steven visited
my husband in his office.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:52.327 align:middle line:84%
So my husband decided to
visit Steven where he was.

00:16:52.327 --> 00:16:54.660 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: So she knew
about that before the call?

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:55.260 align:middle line:90%
STEVEN ROSS: She did.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:56.177 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yeah.

00:16:56.177 --> 00:16:58.050 align:middle line:84%
STEVEN ROSS: And what
did I get out of it?

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:00.420 align:middle line:90%
The continuation of life.

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:03.750 align:middle line:84%
That's already a premise
in my philosophy.

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:05.609 align:middle line:90%
I believe very strongly in that.

00:17:05.609 --> 00:17:09.420 align:middle line:84%
But that was made
very, very evident.

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:10.470 align:middle line:90%
He visited me.

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:12.400 align:middle line:90%
I decided to visit Steven.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.714 align:middle line:84%
So I said, yes, it
was very profound.

00:17:14.714 --> 00:17:15.839 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: I love it.

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:19.710 align:middle line:84%
And so as we go through
this, in some of his--

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:22.079 align:middle line:84%
some of the
alchemical information

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:24.390 align:middle line:84%
you're most permeated
with in this lifetime

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:25.950 align:middle line:90%
is that of Paracelsus.

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:28.710 align:middle line:84%
And so I would like us to
be able to go into that

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:31.420 align:middle line:84%
a little bit now because I see
you brought along something

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:32.220 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:33.210 align:middle line:90%
STEVEN ROSS: Yes, so--

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:33.750 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: A little gift.

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:34.800 align:middle line:90%
Let's put it toward the front.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.060 align:middle line:84%
STEVEN ROSS: Rather than
just being a talking head,

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:40.770 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to have something
here, something tangible.

00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:47.100 align:middle line:84%
Paracelsus said the key to all
of the acts of the disciples,

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:51.840 align:middle line:84%
the key to all manifestations,
all materializations,

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:56.610 align:middle line:84%
is not by some sort
of language, not sort

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:59.910 align:middle line:90%
of gyrations, not symbols.

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:06.520 align:middle line:10%
Three things-- imagination,
faith, and will.

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:09.310 align:middle line:10%
You must imagine what you
would like to manifest

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:10.840 align:middle line:10%
or have happen.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:15.940 align:middle line:84%
You must know that it is going
to happen and have the will

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:20.980 align:middle line:84%
to continue on the course
until it actually manifests.

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:24.460 align:middle line:90%
Now he said that in the--

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:28.510 align:middle line:90%
probably around 1510, 1515.

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:34.640 align:middle line:84%
But that has been passed down
for a very, very long time.

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:36.830 align:middle line:90%
Everybody has access.

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:39.890 align:middle line:84%
This is what, again,
I was so happy to be

00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:44.510 align:middle line:84%
on this show is to point
out to people that we all

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:47.150 align:middle line:90%
have these abilities within us.

00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:50.990 align:middle line:84%
We don't necessarily
need to have gurus

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:54.590 align:middle line:84%
or go to special places
or have endless courses

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:56.780 align:middle line:90%
or go to six-level courses.

00:18:56.780 --> 00:19:00.635 align:middle line:84%
Those are just three words, but
they're very, very powerful.

00:19:00.635 --> 00:19:02.260 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
They're very powerful.

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And this goes far beyond
some of the programs we've

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.190 align:middle line:84%
been exposed to, like
"The Secret" and "How

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:11.600 align:middle line:90%
to Get What You Want in Life."

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:16.070 align:middle line:84%
No, this is a very high
order of application

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:17.220 align:middle line:90%
of these three things.

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:18.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
really important

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:24.010 align:middle line:84%
that you tell us about that and
clarify what that even means.

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:25.930 align:middle line:84%
STEVEN ROSS: When you
really think-- now,

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:30.640 align:middle line:84%
imagination today
has a connotation--

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:32.530 align:middle line:90%
oh, you just imagine.

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:34.420 align:middle line:90%
The person just imagined that.

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:35.900 align:middle line:90%
It's not really real.

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:39.340 align:middle line:84%
But that is not what
the ancients conceived.

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:43.720 align:middle line:84%
Imagination, when you go
back to the times of Plato

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:45.820 align:middle line:90%
and Pythagoras--

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:48.340 align:middle line:90%
500 BC, 300 BC--

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:54.160 align:middle line:84%
the greatest gift given to
humanity is imagination.

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:57.520 align:middle line:84%
Now jump forward to people
like Albert Einstein.

00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:00.310 align:middle line:84%
With imagination, there
are no boundaries.

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:05.110 align:middle line:84%
With imagination,
you can go anywhere.

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:08.360 align:middle line:84%
Imagination is
very, very powerful.

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:13.090 align:middle line:84%
Now many, many years ago, I
read one of my greatest sources

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:15.940 align:middle line:90%
of collecting.

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And in that newspaper, which
some people would call a "rag,"

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:25.120 align:middle line:84%
it talked about if
you want to dream

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:30.820 align:middle line:84%
about skiing, just jam your
imagination, jam your reading.

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:33.190 align:middle line:84%
"The National
Enquirer" had this.

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:37.680 align:middle line:84%
You can have skiing in
your dreams all night.

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:42.720 align:middle line:84%
That is jamming this conduit,
this imagination conduit.

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:47.880 align:middle line:84%
But when we clear it out, when
we allow it to do what it does,

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:49.950 align:middle line:90%
we can go anywhere.

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:52.800 align:middle line:84%
We can travel to the
ends of the world.

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And the ancient said, we
don't need to go into space.

00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:59.430 align:middle line:84%
This was obviously
before spaceships.

00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:02.730 align:middle line:84%
We can go because our
imagination takes us there.

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:07.320 align:middle line:84%
So using the imagination,
being complete

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:10.270 align:middle line:84%
in what you might
want to manifest--

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:13.720 align:middle line:84%
you want to manifest
whatever it is.

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:15.270 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's loaves of bread.

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:20.490 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that individual reached
that state so highly, so

00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:24.310 align:middle line:84%
proficiently,
whatever is imagined

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:28.480 align:middle line:84%
will manifest when
you absolutely know.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:31.180 align:middle line:84%
But now it goes back
to trust, Regina.

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:33.790 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: It does, and
trust then leads in to faith.

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:35.920 align:middle line:90%
And let's talk about the trust.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:41.060 align:middle line:84%
But I think for a
moment, oftentimes

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:42.680 align:middle line:84%
because of society
and what we've

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:46.940 align:middle line:84%
been taught institutionally,
we have a great limitation put

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:49.000 align:middle line:90%
on our imagination.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And this is part of that
illness of society today

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:56.180 align:middle line:84%
is that lack of true, profound,
from-the-soul imagination.

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:57.070 align:middle line:90%
STEVEN ROSS: Yes.

00:21:57.070 --> 00:22:00.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, most of the
things we have,

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:01.632 align:middle line:90%
people are put into a box.

00:22:01.632 --> 00:22:02.590 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Right.

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:04.190 align:middle line:84%
STEVEN ROSS: You
can only do this.

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:07.360 align:middle line:84%
You can only do that if
this is your background.

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:10.600 align:middle line:84%
And people are believing
that to the extent

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:13.630 align:middle line:84%
that they don't
trust themselves.

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:16.805 align:middle line:84%
And it's going back to
trust and the faith.

00:22:16.805 --> 00:22:17.680 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:20.282 align:middle line:84%
STEVEN ROSS: If people
understood-- and I know

00:22:20.282 --> 00:22:21.740 align:middle line:84%
we were going to
get to this later,

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:23.410 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to
kind of jump to it.

00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:24.070 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Go for it.

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.870 align:middle line:90%
STEVEN ROSS: Good.

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:26.200 align:middle line:90%
You're so sweet.

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:27.970 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
I'm just following.

00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:30.040 align:middle line:84%
STEVEN ROSS: When
is enough enough?

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:32.210 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Big question.

00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:33.710 align:middle line:84%
STEVEN ROSS: We're
not smart enough,

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:36.140 align:middle line:84%
not handsome enough,
not pretty enough,

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:37.500 align:middle line:90%
don't have enough money.

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:38.300 align:middle line:90%
The billionaires--

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:39.967 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Don't
have enough hair.

00:22:39.967 --> 00:22:41.600 align:middle line:84%
STEVEN ROSS: Don't
have enough hair.

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.400 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:48.410 align:middle line:84%
When is enough enough, where
people will be content?

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:51.800 align:middle line:84%
The billionaires don't
have enough billions.

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:53.480 align:middle line:90%
They're always striving.

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:57.170 align:middle line:84%
They're always looking for more
because who's more powerful?

00:22:57.170 --> 00:22:58.160 align:middle line:90%
Who's faster?

00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:59.330 align:middle line:90%
Who's stronger?

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:00.770 align:middle line:90%
All of our competitions.

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:02.600 align:middle line:10%
Hey, I have a sports background.

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:04.370 align:middle line:10%
I understand.

00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:08.660 align:middle line:10%
But we've been locked
into not thinking

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:15.080 align:middle line:10%
we're good enough who we
are, where we are, right now.

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:19.400 align:middle line:84%
That is the strongest message I
want to leave with your viewers

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:20.510 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:23.300 align:middle line:90%
They are enough right now.

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:27.830 align:middle line:84%
We are all exactly
where we should be.

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And the people that we idolize,
the people on TV and the movie

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:35.670 align:middle line:84%
stars and even the speakers
and the people who said,

00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:38.780 align:middle line:84%
hey, I transcribed those
chicken scratches on the wall,

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:41.330 align:middle line:84%
and it means this and
that, and you sit and go,

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:43.600 align:middle line:90%
wow, that person's really smart.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:46.400 align:middle line:90%
I wish I was that smart.

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:49.708 align:middle line:84%
If you really see the lives
of some of these people today,

00:23:49.708 --> 00:23:52.000 align:middle line:84%
they're going through the
same thing everybody else is.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.120 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: I see
a lot of their lives

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:55.610 align:middle line:84%
and, yeah, they're going through
the same thing as everybody

00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:55.760 align:middle line:90%
else.

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:56.635 align:middle line:90%
STEVEN ROSS: Exactly.

00:23:56.635 --> 00:24:02.870 align:middle line:84%
So my point of all this is,
believe that you are enough,

00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:05.810 align:middle line:84%
that you are right,
and you're good.

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:09.770 align:middle line:84%
And keys like this-- the
imagination, faith, and will--

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:13.310 align:middle line:84%
you don't need to take a
million courses to learn this.

00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:14.900 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: No, not at all.

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:18.210 align:middle line:84%
The truth's paths are usually
very simple, but not always

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:19.010 align:middle line:90%
easy.

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:19.810 align:middle line:90%
STEVEN ROSS: Yes.

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:22.640 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: And
so in determining that,

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:28.400 align:middle line:84%
there has to be a more
direct path for someone

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.530 align:middle line:90%
understanding what is enough.

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And that gets down to
understanding your true values

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:36.950 align:middle line:84%
in life-- true
values, if we still

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:41.250 align:middle line:84%
have any besides consumerism,
which has been shattered.

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:43.460 align:middle line:84%
The whole COVID
thing and that era

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:46.020 align:middle line:84%
has shattered consumerism
in certain ways.

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:46.820 align:middle line:90%
STEVEN ROSS: Yes.

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:49.237 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: It's been
fascinating to watch how people

00:24:49.237 --> 00:24:51.404 align:middle line:84%
respond where you cannot
have instant gratification.

00:24:51.404 --> 00:24:52.204 align:middle line:90%
STEVEN ROSS: Yes.

00:24:52.204 --> 00:24:55.010 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: You can't just
go buy the car in the color

00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:57.950 align:middle line:84%
you want when you want,
or even a toaster,

00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:00.230 align:middle line:84%
because of the
shortage of these--

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:01.630 align:middle line:90%
the electronic chips.

00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:02.510 align:middle line:84%
STEVEN ROSS: But
maybe that's just

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:03.830 align:middle line:84%
part of the reason
this happened.

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:04.997 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: I think so.

00:25:04.997 --> 00:25:06.975 align:middle line:84%
There is something
in it, where, OK,

00:25:06.975 --> 00:25:08.600 align:middle line:84%
if that's not where
you're going to get

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:11.660 align:middle line:84%
your satisfaction
from in this crazed

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:14.270 align:middle line:90%
last 50 years of consumerism--

00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:16.700 align:middle line:90%
pause-- what does matter?

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:17.570 align:middle line:90%
STEVEN ROSS: Yes.

00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:19.945 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: And so I
would like you to share with us

00:25:19.945 --> 00:25:22.210 align:middle line:84%
how you feel if you
were talking to someone

00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:24.800 align:middle line:84%
and guiding, coaching them,
because you're a good coach.

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:28.340 align:middle line:84%
How do you determine what
your true values are so

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:30.650 align:middle line:84%
that you can determine
when enough is enough?

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:32.570 align:middle line:84%
STEVEN ROSS: Well,
that is the question

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:35.260 align:middle line:90%
I would ask the individual.

00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:38.170 align:middle line:90%
What are you striving for?

00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:41.380 align:middle line:84%
What are you looking
to reach or to achieve

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:47.280 align:middle line:84%
by going to a million
psychics or going

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.050 align:middle line:90%
to all these conferences?

00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to say at
any time anything is bad.

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:55.530 align:middle line:84%
But that's how I would
begin with someone.

00:25:55.530 --> 00:25:59.280 align:middle line:84%
What are you expecting
to find there?

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:04.020 align:middle line:84%
What will show you
that you have reached

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:05.490 align:middle line:90%
what you're looking for?

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time, the person
will go, I don't know.

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:10.170 align:middle line:90%
I just want to learn.

00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:14.340 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, when would
that reach a point

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:17.260 align:middle line:90%
where you could be satisfied?

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:19.280 align:middle line:90%
What will make you happy?

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:23.190 align:middle line:90%
What will make you feel content?

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And then say to somebody,
have you reached that state?

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:28.890 align:middle line:90%
What makes you feel good?

00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:32.760 align:middle line:84%
Now one thing that I
will share with people--

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:37.350 align:middle line:84%
how many people will say, if
they are involved in something

00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:40.680 align:middle line:84%
beautiful, or if they are
looking at something beautiful,

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:42.570 align:middle line:90%
I want more of that?

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:43.560 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.600 align:middle line:84%
You're looking at a
beautiful picture.

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:47.910 align:middle line:84%
You're looking at
a beautiful scene.

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:50.460 align:middle line:90%
You're taken into that beauty.

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:52.180 align:middle line:90%
You don't sit there and go--

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:53.388 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: I want more.

00:26:53.388 --> 00:26:55.290 align:middle line:84%
STEVEN ROSS: I wanted
it more intensified.

00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:56.665 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
Yeah, no, that's

00:26:56.665 --> 00:26:59.220 align:middle line:84%
true, because you're having
a fulfilling experience.

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:00.600 align:middle line:90%
STEVEN ROSS: Exactly.

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:04.260 align:middle line:84%
So somebody needs
to determine what

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:10.870 align:middle line:84%
is going to make you
satisfied and fulfilled.

00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:13.230 align:middle line:84%
Now that kind of shakes
people to their foundation.

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:17.520 align:middle line:84%
They go, whoa, I just have
never thought about that.

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:21.440 align:middle line:90%
But I then would wait.

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:25.100 align:middle line:84%
As Paracelsus said, if you
want to learn about any herb,

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:32.380 align:middle line:84%
flower, tree, individual,
sit humbly, quietly

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:34.180 align:middle line:90%
in front of them.

00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:36.490 align:middle line:90%
Don't think and just listen.

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:40.270 align:middle line:84%
So normally what I
do in that situation

00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:44.590 align:middle line:84%
is just wait to hear what
the person's inner self is

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:46.870 align:middle line:84%
feeding back to
me at that moment

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:51.390 align:middle line:90%
because we've stirred the pot.

00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:53.910 align:middle line:90%
And in stirring that, they--

00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:55.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going into them.

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.660 align:middle line:90%
They are releasing.

00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:00.240 align:middle line:90%
They are sending out vibrations.

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:03.240 align:middle line:84%
Their higher self is
sending out energy.

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And then for that particular
person, I can say,

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:11.762 align:middle line:84%
didn't this particular
event give you pleasure?

00:28:11.762 --> 00:28:13.790 align:middle line:90%
And they go, yes.

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:17.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, why aren't you
doing more of that?

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:21.573 align:middle line:84%
Well, because people
say I should be--

00:28:21.573 --> 00:28:23.240 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
You're not big on the S

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:24.820 align:middle line:90%
word, the "should" word.

00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:26.140 align:middle line:90%
STEVEN ROSS: Exactly.

00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:31.360 align:middle line:84%
Now here's one of the
greatest quotes of Paracelsus.

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:35.290 align:middle line:84%
"Do not belong to another
when you can be your own."

00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:38.900 align:middle line:90%


00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:41.270 align:middle line:84%
And if people allowed
that to really resonate--

00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:45.162 align:middle line:84%
"Do not belong to another
when you can be your own."

00:28:45.162 --> 00:28:47.120 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Well,
a bumper-sticker version

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:49.160 align:middle line:84%
of that today is, "You
might as well be yourself

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:51.528 align:middle line:90%
because everyone else is taken."

00:28:51.528 --> 00:28:52.820 align:middle line:90%
STEVEN ROSS: That's a good one.

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:54.695 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: So talk
about the profundity

00:28:54.695 --> 00:28:56.750 align:middle line:90%
of what that actually means.

00:28:56.750 --> 00:29:00.440 align:middle line:84%
STEVEN ROSS: It is having
the faith and trust

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:07.040 align:middle line:84%
in your own self that who
you are and what you're doing

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:09.530 align:middle line:90%
is right and is good.

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:13.730 align:middle line:84%
And my belief is we are
always put in the places

00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:18.060 align:middle line:84%
where we need to be and
have the experiences that we

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:18.860 align:middle line:90%
need to have.

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:21.710 align:middle line:90%


00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:27.170 align:middle line:84%
If an individual is always
looking at somebody else--

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:29.000 align:middle line:90%
why can't I be like them?

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.740 align:middle line:90%
Why can't I have that?

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:35.430 align:middle line:84%
A person is not realizing that
there's other dynamics involved

00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:37.080 align:middle line:90%
with those people also.

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And you had mentioned
earlier, if people really

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:43.650 align:middle line:84%
knew the lives that
some of these superstars

00:29:43.650 --> 00:29:44.517 align:middle line:90%
are going through--

00:29:44.517 --> 00:29:46.350 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: They
would not choose that.

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:47.580 align:middle line:84%
STEVEN ROSS: That's
exactly right.

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:48.450 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: And
meanwhile, you're

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:50.490 align:middle line:84%
dispersing all your
energy, projecting it

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:53.490 align:middle line:84%
onto someone else, and
amassing none of this

00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:55.440 align:middle line:90%
for your own betterment.

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:56.280 align:middle line:90%
STEVEN ROSS: Yes.

00:29:56.280 --> 00:30:00.960 align:middle line:90%
And so this is the big message.

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.280 align:middle line:90%
Be confident in yourself.

00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:04.710 align:middle line:90%
Trust yourself.

00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:07.710 align:middle line:90%
And know you are unique.

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:10.170 align:middle line:84%
You are exactly
where you should be.

00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:14.190 align:middle line:84%
And you have unlimited
capabilities.

00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:15.720 align:middle line:90%
Too many people feel--

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:21.060 align:middle line:84%
and, again, getting back to the
imagination, faith, and will--

00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:22.470 align:middle line:90%
they can't do it.

00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:24.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm here to tell
people they can.

00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:31.730 align:middle line:84%
I started off-- you and I
joke a lot about, Steven,

00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:33.390 align:middle line:84%
you have all these
things happen.

00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:35.270 align:middle line:90%
But I was extremely shy.

00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:38.540 align:middle line:84%
I was so shy growing
up, during my day,

00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:42.638 align:middle line:84%
you would call the operator,
or you would dial a number,

00:30:42.638 --> 00:30:44.930 align:middle line:84%
and the operator would say,
that number's been changed.

00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:46.730 align:middle line:90%
The new number is--

00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:50.660 align:middle line:84%
I was so shy, I didn't even
call the information operator,

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:52.100 align:middle line:90%
because I didn't like to talk.

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:53.540 align:middle line:90%
I was very shy.

00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:56.660 align:middle line:84%
But as I progressed,
one thing I always

00:30:56.660 --> 00:31:01.700 align:middle line:84%
did, if something came into
my mind, I just did it.

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:03.390 align:middle line:90%
I would follow it through.

00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:06.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's a matter of
following through

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:07.640 align:middle line:90%
with the things that come.

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:10.010 align:middle line:84%
How many of your
audience go, you know,

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:13.160 align:middle line:84%
I thought about that invention
three years before it came out.

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:14.118 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Right.

00:31:14.118 --> 00:31:17.670 align:middle line:84%
STEVEN ROSS: Well, did
somebody follow through?

00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:24.670 align:middle line:84%
So it is a matter of following
through, trusting the self.

00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:29.440 align:middle line:84%
One does not have to go and
stay in an alchemist's castle.

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:32.170 align:middle line:84%
It's dramatic enough
to get me on your show

00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:35.320 align:middle line:84%
to share with your audience
that anything in this world

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:36.530 align:middle line:90%
can happen.

00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:38.950 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: And now we
have the application of will

00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:42.400 align:middle line:84%
because will can often be
abused and misused as well

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:45.260 align:middle line:90%
as used correctly.

00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:49.510 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the
correct use of will,

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:51.130 align:middle line:90%
compared to what we often do.

00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:53.740 align:middle line:84%
STEVEN ROSS: Well, to me, the
will is staying the course.

00:31:53.740 --> 00:32:01.100 align:middle line:84%
For me, will means that you must
give things time to manifest.

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:07.660 align:middle line:84%
So the will means I know
it is going to happen.

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:12.730 align:middle line:84%
Now I stay the course
until it manifests visibly.

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:16.567 align:middle line:84%
People don't realize that
what you're imagining exists.

00:32:16.567 --> 00:32:18.400 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: It
already exists, and then

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:21.015 align:middle line:84%
phased off only this much
from the dimension we're in.

00:32:21.015 --> 00:32:21.890 align:middle line:90%
STEVEN ROSS: Exactly.

00:32:21.890 --> 00:32:22.780 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: It exists.

00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:23.560 align:middle line:90%
STEVEN ROSS: Exactly.

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:25.102 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
It's waiting to drop

00:32:25.102 --> 00:32:27.020 align:middle line:84%
into our third-dimensional
physical reality.

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:29.860 align:middle line:84%
STEVEN ROSS: So what's
going to make that happen?

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:35.070 align:middle line:90%
Knowing, realizing your intent.

00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And what's going to
help more is when

00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:40.260 align:middle line:84%
it's going to benefit the
most amount of people.

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:41.250 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:43.680 align:middle line:84%
STEVEN ROSS: That is the
little caveat on here.

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:45.480 align:middle line:84%
I can imagine, oh, I
want to be powerful

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:46.620 align:middle line:90%
and control everything.

00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:49.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, that may
not happen for you

00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:52.800 align:middle line:84%
in this metaphysical
spiritual way.

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:55.770 align:middle line:84%
But it will happen
if your intent

00:32:55.770 --> 00:33:01.140 align:middle line:84%
is to assist, to help people,
to bring beauty into the world,

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:05.670 align:middle line:84%
because then the spiritual realm
will kick in their energy that

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:07.267 align:middle line:90%
will help things manifest.

00:33:07.267 --> 00:33:09.225 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: I couldn't
agree more, Steven.

00:33:09.225 --> 00:33:11.430 align:middle line:84%
And I've noticed that
certainly throughout my life,

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:13.890 align:middle line:84%
is when something-- when
I touch with something

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:16.860 align:middle line:84%
and think, oh, this would
be a worthy project,

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:20.940 align:middle line:84%
and it has that element to
it, where this is information

00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:22.560 align:middle line:90%
that needs to come through now.

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:25.210 align:middle line:84%
People need to have a
deeper understanding.

00:33:25.210 --> 00:33:27.510 align:middle line:84%
You know, angels'
wings start flapping.

00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:29.130 align:middle line:90%
Everything falls into place.

00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:30.690 align:middle line:90%
I don't really have to do a lot.

00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:31.860 align:middle line:90%
And it does start--

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:34.960 align:middle line:84%
the train starts leaving
the station in a good way,

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:35.760 align:middle line:90%
with me on it.

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:36.560 align:middle line:90%
STEVEN ROSS: Right.

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And I would hope that people
realize you are the star.

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:43.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm on your show.

00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And people shouldn't
just believe,

00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:47.340 align:middle line:84%
oh, it only happens
to those people.

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:49.510 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: No,
no, no, no this happens.

00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:52.320 align:middle line:84%
I see it when people have
what you're talking about--

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:55.890 align:middle line:84%
this identification and passion
about whatever this thing is,

00:33:55.890 --> 00:33:57.600 align:middle line:90%
and especially if it serves.

00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And they're not doing
it to serve their ego.

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:00.090 align:middle line:90%
STEVEN ROSS: Yes.

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:01.560 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: This is
a big component of it.

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:02.935 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
think, no, I want

00:34:02.935 --> 00:34:04.950 align:middle line:90%
to be better known for this.

00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:08.820 align:middle line:84%
No, this is important if
it has value to humanity.

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:11.400 align:middle line:84%
To be better known part
does not have value

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:14.800 align:middle line:84%
to humanity in the way
we're talking about.

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:16.590 align:middle line:84%
STEVEN ROSS: About
a week ago, there

00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:19.380 align:middle line:84%
was a story about
a football player

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:21.630 align:middle line:90%
who has been very successful--

00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:27.000 align:middle line:84%
NFL pro-- who called
9-1-1 and was looking--

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.389 align:middle line:84%
he said he was going
to commit suicide.

00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:34.800 align:middle line:84%
My point of that is that,
again, what we think

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:37.469 align:middle line:90%
people's actual lives are--

00:34:37.469 --> 00:34:40.469 align:middle line:90%
the athletes, the movie stars--

00:34:40.469 --> 00:34:47.100 align:middle line:84%
is very, very different
than what people imagine.

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And I wish that people
could understand

00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:56.850 align:middle line:84%
that as opposed to what we
see on every TV commercial.

00:34:56.850 --> 00:34:58.290 align:middle line:90%
You got to look thin.

00:34:58.290 --> 00:35:00.270 align:middle line:90%
You have to have this.

00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:01.530 align:middle line:90%
You got to have this body.

00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:04.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm working my exercise bike.

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:10.920 align:middle line:84%
It's this competitive, nonstop,
trying to get to a place-- yes,

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:13.830 align:middle line:84%
trying to get to a place
where we're not right now.

00:35:13.830 --> 00:35:16.200 align:middle line:84%
Why not just look at
where you are right now

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:21.050 align:middle line:90%
and say, wow, this is great?

00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:22.880 align:middle line:90%
But that's being in the moment.

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:25.960 align:middle line:84%
That's been totally
in the moment.

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:28.000 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: So
to me, that is one

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.630 align:middle line:90%
of the travesties of humanity.

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's a travesty of
the media in general--

00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:35.710 align:middle line:84%
that it's perpetuating
this season of discontent

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:38.950 align:middle line:84%
in everyone all the
time, because, eh, fa-la,

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:40.000 align:middle line:90%
there's a product.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.045 align:middle line:90%
There's a service.

00:35:41.045 --> 00:35:42.670 align:middle line:84%
There's a person on
the other side that

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:44.740 align:middle line:90%
will cure that for you, right?

00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:48.280 align:middle line:84%
And so left-- really,
never encouraged

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:52.000 align:middle line:84%
to take time and just be with
ourselves and our own thoughts

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.110 align:middle line:84%
and let them take
us where they will.

00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:56.110 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you to talk
about that for a moment

00:35:56.110 --> 00:35:58.690 align:middle line:84%
because that can start
feeding into the imagination

00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:02.650 align:middle line:84%
to begin with if you
get some quiet time.

00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:04.330 align:middle line:84%
STEVEN ROSS: Well,
I'd like to share

00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:07.060 align:middle line:90%
with your audience two things.

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:08.800 align:middle line:90%
What makes me happy?

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:12.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, when my checkbook balances
at the end of the month,

00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:13.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm ecstatic.

00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:15.190 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: There you go.

00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:17.380 align:middle line:84%
STEVEN ROSS: Now
I'm a guy who lives

00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:19.330 align:middle line:90%
in castles for three days.

00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:21.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm a guy who has
great adventures.

00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:22.810 align:middle line:84%
But you know what
makes me happy?

00:36:22.810 --> 00:36:23.860 align:middle line:90%
My checkbook balances.

00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:25.735 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Steven,
I have to tell you--

00:36:25.735 --> 00:36:27.910 align:middle line:84%
you know how many
people I've interviewed.

00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:31.570 align:middle line:84%
And some of them have
gotten out there and made it

00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:34.390 align:middle line:84%
onto mainstream media,
even, and documentaries

00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:35.810 align:middle line:90%
have been done about.

00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:38.530 align:middle line:84%
But that's the one
thing I hear most often.

00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:41.710 align:middle line:84%
This kind of work
off the beaten path

00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:46.000 align:middle line:84%
is not richly rewarded
financially always.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And people don't understand
these people struggle

00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:52.070 align:middle line:84%
alongside them with
the same things.

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:55.030 align:middle line:84%
But the difference is you
are doing the thing you're

00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:56.433 align:middle line:90%
born to do and love.

00:36:56.433 --> 00:36:58.600 align:middle line:84%
They're doing the thing
they're born to do and love.

00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:02.150 align:middle line:84%
So we all have to struggle
in one way or another.

00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:05.720 align:middle line:84%
So why not start moving that
direction in our own lives?

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:06.520 align:middle line:90%
STEVEN ROSS: Yes.

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:08.950 align:middle line:84%
And people are going
to find that it

00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:12.430 align:middle line:90%
makes life more enjoyable.

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:17.260 align:middle line:84%
Before I got into
esoterics and philosophy,

00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:20.590 align:middle line:84%
I was a sprinter
at my university.

00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:22.840 align:middle line:90%
And one thing--

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:28.310 align:middle line:84%
I was running at
a level that there

00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:30.450 align:middle line:90%
were some very good athletes.

00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:36.230 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of my races, the
world record for 100-yard dash

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:37.640 align:middle line:90%
was tied.

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:40.160 align:middle line:84%
It was the worst
defeat I had ever had.

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:41.780 align:middle line:90%
I was three yards behind.

00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:44.000 align:middle line:84%
But my coach runs
up to me and goes,

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.510 align:middle line:84%
wow, you broke
our school record!

00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:48.650 align:middle line:90%
And I go, what did that guy run?

00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And he goes-- they
announced the time.

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And I go, hmm, that
was a world record.

00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:58.310 align:middle line:84%
But my feeling was
if I ran faster

00:37:58.310 --> 00:38:04.430 align:middle line:84%
than I did before, I was
content, even though, quote,

00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:05.390 align:middle line:90%
"I'd lost."

00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:06.348 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Right.

00:38:06.348 --> 00:38:09.590 align:middle line:84%
STEVEN ROSS: I couldn't
have gone any faster

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:11.810 align:middle line:90%
than I did that day.

00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:18.400 align:middle line:84%
And so my point of this is
start with the little things

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:20.800 align:middle line:90%
to be content with.

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:24.010 align:middle line:84%
You asked earlier if somebody
comes for counseling.

00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:28.365 align:middle line:84%
I would ask them, again,
what makes you happy?

00:38:28.365 --> 00:38:29.490 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: That's it.

00:38:29.490 --> 00:38:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, this journey
called life, of which I believe

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:35.640 align:middle line:90%
we-- is a cycle of life.

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:37.470 align:middle line:90%
We have many, and it continues.

00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:39.990 align:middle line:84%
Each time, we pick up
some grace, some beauty,

00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:41.730 align:middle line:90%
some information along the way--

00:38:41.730 --> 00:38:43.150 align:middle line:90%
stumble a little bit, too.

00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:46.630 align:middle line:84%
But the whole notion that
we're here for something maybe

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:47.430 align:middle line:90%
simple.

00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:50.880 align:middle line:84%
Like maybe we're here
to help rescue dogs who

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:52.350 align:middle line:90%
have lost their homes.

00:38:52.350 --> 00:38:54.330 align:middle line:90%
That's a beautiful thing.

00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:57.540 align:middle line:84%
Look at what a little canine
critter adds to our lives--

00:38:57.540 --> 00:38:59.790 align:middle line:84%
to dedicate yourself
to caring for your dog

00:38:59.790 --> 00:39:03.390 align:middle line:84%
or caring for dogs in a more
public sense, all the way up

00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:06.630 align:middle line:84%
through someone like you,
creating this library

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:09.300 align:middle line:84%
and being able to help people
find their purpose in life,

00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:12.090 align:middle line:84%
and even connect with the
whisperings of the soul.

00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:15.720 align:middle line:84%
And everything in between
is valuable and beautiful.

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And we just throw ourselves
in front of the bus

00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:20.820 align:middle line:84%
all the time, thinking
we're not enough.

00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:22.950 align:middle line:84%
STEVEN ROSS: We can
continue striving.

00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And again, when
is enough enough?

00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:32.190 align:middle line:84%
It seems so simple,
those two little words.

00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:37.410 align:middle line:84%
But if people really got
themselves into that thought,

00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:38.850 align:middle line:90%
do you know--

00:39:38.850 --> 00:39:41.310 align:middle line:84%
of course, there would be
less prescriptions used.

00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:42.185 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:39:42.185 --> 00:39:46.640 align:middle line:84%
STEVEN ROSS: But not everybody
wants less prescriptions used.

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:50.720 align:middle line:84%
The idea is there is
a simplicity to life--

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:53.630 align:middle line:84%
the simplicity of these
three words that could

00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:59.180 align:middle line:84%
manifest great things for
people, the simplicity of love

00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:03.260 align:middle line:90%
and beauty and contentment.

00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:05.120 align:middle line:90%
People talk about that.

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:08.900 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just going to go
out on a limb here and say

00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:13.730 align:middle line:84%
the majority of the very
well-known people that make all

00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:16.360 align:middle line:90%
these circuits--

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:18.980 align:middle line:84%
they are not living the
things that they talk about.

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:20.230 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: That is true.

00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:21.070 align:middle line:90%
I will say that.

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:23.380 align:middle line:84%
STEVEN ROSS: They
talk good stories.

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:25.990 align:middle line:90%
Their lives are a mess.

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:27.882 align:middle line:90%
They can talk about calmness.

00:40:27.882 --> 00:40:29.590 align:middle line:84%
And when you meet
them, they're sometimes

00:40:29.590 --> 00:40:34.420 align:middle line:84%
bouncing off the walls if
their ego isn't big enough.

00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:39.160 align:middle line:84%
The idea is it's just
not the right message.

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:42.940 align:middle line:84%
Why can't we just go
back to the simple?

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:46.630 align:middle line:84%
If somebody says, you want
enlightenment, go to Tibet.

00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:51.160 align:middle line:84%
Meditate for 10 years, and
you're going to reach nirvana.

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:52.150 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:54.760 align:middle line:84%
But what were the
Transcendentalists doing?

00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:57.590 align:middle line:84%
They were hugging a tree and
getting cosmic consciousness.

00:40:57.590 --> 00:41:04.080 align:middle line:84%
So there are easier
ways to do these things.

00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:06.233 align:middle line:84%
And I think they're
just as much fun.

00:41:06.233 --> 00:41:07.400 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Absolutely.

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:10.580 align:middle line:84%
STEVEN ROSS: Maybe people
will say, well, no, no,

00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:12.950 align:middle line:84%
the only way I'm
going to get a--

00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:15.380 align:middle line:84%
this brings us back
to no pain, no gain.

00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:17.200 align:middle line:90%
Means you have to struggle.

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:18.200 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Suffer.

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:19.040 align:middle line:90%
STEVEN ROSS: And-- oh, not that.

00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:20.420 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Now, I'm
not a fan of suffering.

00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:20.930 align:middle line:90%
STEVEN ROSS: No.

00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:22.555 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: I
do not think that it

00:41:22.555 --> 00:41:24.410 align:middle line:84%
is an obligatory element
to walk the Earth.

00:41:24.410 --> 00:41:25.430 align:middle line:90%
STEVEN ROSS: Right.

00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:27.530 align:middle line:84%
So what are people
going to get out

00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:31.110 align:middle line:90%
of our sharing today of real--

00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:33.260 align:middle line:90%
I can take this and use it?

00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:36.470 align:middle line:84%
I would say the
most important thing

00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:43.470 align:middle line:84%
is be content with what you
have and realize who you are

00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:48.060 align:middle line:84%
and that you are as great
as anybody else walking

00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:49.140 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:56.450 align:middle line:84%
Nobody has any more access
to wisdom than you do.

00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:58.960 align:middle line:84%
They may have uncovered
a little bit more.

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:00.640 align:middle line:90%
They don't give it to you.

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:02.710 align:middle line:90%
You already have it.

00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:07.120 align:middle line:84%
It's up to us to just
kind of relax and allow

00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:09.730 align:middle line:90%
it to manifest in our presence.

00:42:09.730 --> 00:42:10.840 align:middle line:90%
How?

00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:12.670 align:middle line:90%
By beauty.

00:42:12.670 --> 00:42:16.120 align:middle line:84%
Plato's banquet on
love talked about how

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:19.820 align:middle line:84%
to reach the highest
stages of love.

00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:21.740 align:middle line:90%
The same thing goes with beauty.

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:26.330 align:middle line:84%
Once we begin to
understand-- why can't I

00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:29.660 align:middle line:84%
take that feeling
that I had looking

00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:33.410 align:middle line:84%
at that beautiful picture,
and why not understand

00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:38.050 align:middle line:84%
that I'm living in this
beautiful world with access

00:42:38.050 --> 00:42:40.190 align:middle line:90%
to all of this?

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:45.020 align:middle line:84%
Understand that we do
have beauty all around us,

00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:47.210 align:middle line:90%
and we will become beautiful.

00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:49.040 align:middle line:84%
We're back to my
opening statement

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:51.260 align:middle line:90%
about environment is everything.

00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:53.450 align:middle line:90%
What was the castle?

00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:56.390 align:middle line:84%
The castle was a
perfect environment.

00:42:56.390 --> 00:43:00.800 align:middle line:84%
What makes the supreme
healers on the planet?

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:03.185 align:middle line:84%
Is it just their
energy, or is it

00:43:03.185 --> 00:43:07.190 align:middle line:84%
that they create an environment
where you and I believe

00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:09.020 align:middle line:90%
we are going to get healed?

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:11.530 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Right,
right, it supports them.

00:43:11.530 --> 00:43:15.660 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that
you have held as a core

00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:17.030 align:middle line:90%
to your being your whole life.

00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.540 align:middle line:90%
STEVEN ROSS: Yes.

00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:19.248 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: And
as a result of that,

00:43:19.248 --> 00:43:23.750 align:middle line:84%
you have been able to have,
quote, "magical things happen,"

00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:26.570 align:middle line:84%
have access to all this
wonderful stuff, have learned

00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:29.370 align:middle line:84%
the keys and the
secrets to healing,

00:43:29.370 --> 00:43:33.350 align:middle line:84%
which you have helped many,
many people heal themselves.

00:43:33.350 --> 00:43:35.300 align:middle line:84%
All of this-- and
I think, in part,

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:37.190 align:middle line:90%
because you have created this.

00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:38.460 align:middle line:90%
And I've been in your home.

00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:39.620 align:middle line:90%
I've been in your library.

00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:42.470 align:middle line:84%
You have created this
environment of absolute beauty,

00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:45.740 align:middle line:84%
from the thoughts down to
the objects in the house.

00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:47.930 align:middle line:84%
And as you say, it can
be the tiniest space.

00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:48.730 align:middle line:90%
STEVEN ROSS: Right.

00:43:48.730 --> 00:43:51.330 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: We all have
the power to create beauty.

00:43:51.330 --> 00:43:52.470 align:middle line:90%
It starts with this.

00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:53.270 align:middle line:90%
STEVEN ROSS: Yes.

00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:55.970 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: So final
thought before we sign off,

00:43:55.970 --> 00:43:56.870 align:middle line:90%
Steven.

00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:58.540 align:middle line:84%
STEVEN ROSS: Our
time is almost up?

00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:01.860 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my gosh.

00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:04.220 align:middle line:84%
I think my final thought
has been my thoughts

00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:06.440 align:middle line:90%
all the way through--

00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:13.170 align:middle line:84%
to tell people they are
love, they are beauty,

00:44:13.170 --> 00:44:14.940 align:middle line:90%
they are so unique.

00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:17.910 align:middle line:84%
Why not share their love
and beauty with others?

00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:21.840 align:middle line:84%
Because no one else can
share your love and beauty

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:24.660 align:middle line:90%
like you do or like I do.

00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:28.920 align:middle line:84%
To be content and
know that we are

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:33.230 align:middle line:90%
each unlimited in our potential.

00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:37.610 align:middle line:10%
We're exactly where
we should be, and not

00:44:37.610 --> 00:44:42.378 align:middle line:10%
keep trying to gather
more and more and more.

00:44:42.378 --> 00:44:43.920 align:middle line:10%
REGINA MEREDITH:
Couldn't agree more.

00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And to have the
boldness to even think--

00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:49.890 align:middle line:84%
shocking how many times people
won't even think a new thought.

00:44:49.890 --> 00:44:50.690 align:middle line:90%
Like, oh, no.

00:44:50.690 --> 00:44:51.565 align:middle line:90%
That won't come true.

00:44:51.565 --> 00:44:53.210 align:middle line:90%
No, that's frivolous.

00:44:53.210 --> 00:44:56.540 align:middle line:84%
To have the boldness to even
think a new thought, especially

00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:59.420 align:middle line:84%
if it's something that attends
to beauty of some kind.

00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:01.190 align:middle line:84%
Think a new thought
which can let and lead

00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:05.600 align:middle line:84%
to an imaginal type of
creation of something.

00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:09.320 align:middle line:84%
STEVEN ROSS: Trust, trust,
trust, trust yourself.

00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:10.250 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:10.790 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:11.340 align:middle line:90%
STEVEN ROSS: Thank you.

00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:12.320 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Thank
you so much for that,

00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:14.540 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of people
need it right now, Steven.

00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:17.258 align:middle line:84%
We're all thinking we're not
enough, especially after, yeah,

00:45:17.258 --> 00:45:18.800 align:middle line:84%
a year and a half,
two years of COVID

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:22.340 align:middle line:84%
and picking up that,
on average, 29 pounds.

00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:24.830 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's beating
themselves up-- lethargy.

00:45:24.830 --> 00:45:26.960 align:middle line:84%
So this is a really good
time to hear this message.

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:28.108 align:middle line:90%
And I love you.

00:45:28.108 --> 00:45:29.900 align:middle line:84%
It's so good to see
you in the flesh again.

00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:30.733 align:middle line:90%
STEVEN ROSS: Thanks.

00:45:30.733 --> 00:45:32.162 align:middle line:90%
I love you, and take care.

00:45:32.162 --> 00:45:33.620 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
Thank you, Steven.

00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:35.900 align:middle line:84%
As always, I'm grateful
for our time with Steven.

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:37.460 align:middle line:84%
If you want to reach
out to him, you

00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:41.720 align:middle line:84%
can go to WRF, World
Research Foundation, dot org.

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:45.200 align:middle line:84%
And what a treasure trove,
including his own books there,

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:46.640 align:middle line:90%
which you'll have access to.

00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And can they buy
them on Amazon now?

00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:50.510 align:middle line:10%
STEVEN ROSS: I have
some, but my books

00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:53.300 align:middle line:10%
are on lesscomplicated.net.

00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:54.890 align:middle line:10%
