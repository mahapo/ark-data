00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:21.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: If
you're watching this,

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.880 align:middle line:84%
you're probably aware of the
double-edged sword of Homeland

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:24.880 align:middle line:90%
Security.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.040 align:middle line:10%
Allegedly established to protect
our freedom from terrorism,

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.720 align:middle line:10%
this little scrutinized
act rushed through Congress

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.620 align:middle line:10%
without a read, has been
used for heinous actions.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.240 align:middle line:10%
Actions against
American citizens.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.190 align:middle line:10%
No American citizen is more
aware of the illegal nature

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.770 align:middle line:10%
of this arm of the government
than former CIA asset Susan

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:43.750 align:middle line:10%
Lindauer.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.320 align:middle line:84%
She worked for nine years
to assist in negotiations

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.630 align:middle line:84%
and gathering information on
behalf of the US government

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.420 align:middle line:84%
through the Iraqi
and Libyan Embassies

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.650 align:middle line:90%
and abroad as a peace activist.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.220 align:middle line:84%
Had her assessments,
along with those

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.120 align:middle line:84%
of other very brave individuals
been evaluated and implemented,

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.740 align:middle line:84%
we would never have
gone into Iraq.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.080 align:middle line:84%
Instead, she was thrown into
federal prison without a trial.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.820 align:middle line:90%
Susan is with us today.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.150 align:middle line:84%
Susan, you are the hero
of certainly everyone

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.034 align:middle line:90%
in this building.

00:01:09.034 --> 00:01:10.950 align:middle line:84%
They're practically
applauding as you walk in.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:11.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SUSAN LINDAUER: Thank you.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have
been to hell and back

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.920 align:middle line:84%
and it is a story that, I
think, many people watching,

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.990 align:middle line:84%
if they're not already
familiar with your case,

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.850 align:middle line:84%
would not believe could
happen in America.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:24.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: That's true.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.660 align:middle line:10%
That's absolutely true.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.720 align:middle line:10%
I was the second non-Arab
American ever indicted

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.300 align:middle line:10%
on the Patriot Act.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.650 align:middle line:10%
I was subjected to secret
charges, secret evidence,

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.690 align:middle line:10%
secret grand jury testimony.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.690 align:middle line:84%
I was never allowed to
know who had accused me

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.110 align:middle line:84%
of what crime or what--
and the government

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.900 align:middle line:84%
had no obligation to provide any
evidence that it had actually

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.750 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
this is the stuff

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.840 align:middle line:84%
that we used to
read in spy novels,

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.890 align:middle line:84%
you know, Clancy and
Ludlum types of spy novels

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.750 align:middle line:84%
where someone is
just thrown away

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.160 align:middle line:84%
and everyone abandons
them, and they're

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.619 align:middle line:90%
left to more or less rot.

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, the good thing is you're
a scrapper and a fighter

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.290 align:middle line:84%
and you're incredibly
intelligent

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:06.460 align:middle line:90%
and you're connected.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.550 align:middle line:84%
You were able to help
yourself where even

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.370 align:middle line:84%
some others in this
situation have not

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.260 align:middle line:84%
been able to help themselves
and are still in prison.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Yes.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.410 align:middle line:84%
I am also one of the very few
people who's out of prison

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.526 align:middle line:84%
on the Patriot Act,
because I stood up to them

00:02:20.526 --> 00:02:21.900 align:middle line:84%
and I fought as
hard as I've ever

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.320 align:middle line:90%
fought anything in my life.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.090 align:middle line:84%
But I've met
terrorists who are not

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.919 align:middle line:84%
as frightening as
this situation.

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:28.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:29.750 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to just take a
moment, if you don't mind,

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.420 align:middle line:84%
to talk about what could have
happened because you were

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.600 align:middle line:84%
negotiating in earnest prior
to 9/11 and after 9/11, right?

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: My problem was that
I was politically inconvenient,

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.490 align:middle line:90%
grossly inconvenient.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.400 align:middle line:84%
There was a peace option
on the table, which

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.730 align:middle line:84%
I had negotiated on
behalf of the CIA

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.589 align:middle line:84%
and the Defense Intelligence
Agency, which got the United

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:59.630 align:middle line:84%
States everything you
could possibly have wanted.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I have it written
down here point by point.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.160 align:middle line:84%
Should I go ahead
and share that?

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.868 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Sure.

00:03:03.868 --> 00:03:04.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.440 align:middle line:84%
Weapons inspectors would
have walked into Iraq

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.060 align:middle line:90%
with no resistance whatsoever.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.080 align:middle line:90%
They were offering it.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.760 align:middle line:90%
US--

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Sorry.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.091 align:middle line:84%
They were offering it from
the very end of the Clinton

00:03:14.091 --> 00:03:14.716 align:middle line:90%
administration.

00:03:14.716 --> 00:03:15.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: And we
were in a position

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.400 align:middle line:84%
where the weapons inspections
could have started

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.470 align:middle line:84%
the first few weeks of
the Bush administration,

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.690 align:middle line:84%
and it was offered to Bush
as a-- the comparison was

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.520 align:middle line:84%
to the rescue of
the hostages in Iran

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.780 align:middle line:84%
to allow the new administration
to show a major foreign policy

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.320 align:middle line:84%
victory that would
have put them off

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.925 align:middle line:84%
on a strong footing from the
very opening days of the Bush

00:03:42.925 --> 00:03:43.820 align:middle line:90%
administration.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.335 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that was
already on the table.

00:03:45.335 --> 00:03:45.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: It was guaranteed.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No one was
trying to keep them out.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Guaranteed.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.385 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: US
corporations could have

00:03:49.385 --> 00:03:51.290 align:middle line:84%
had most of the
post-sanction reconstruction

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.590 align:middle line:84%
contracts, telecommunications,
health care, pharmaceuticals,

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:55.700 align:middle line:90%
and other contracts.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.850 align:middle line:84%
Building contracts, construction
contracts of different kinds.

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.097 align:middle line:84%
That was being made
available to Americans.

00:04:01.097 --> 00:04:03.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: They were going
to guarantee that the United

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.830 align:middle line:84%
States would profit from
the reconstruction of Iraq

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.370 align:middle line:84%
just like the reconstruction
of Japan and Germany

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.850 align:middle line:90%
after World War II.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.840 align:middle line:84%
We were going to have the lion's
share of all reconstruction

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.880 align:middle line:84%
contracts, even though United
States had enforced sanctions

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.040 align:middle line:84%
that killed 2 million Iraqis,
and 1 million children

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.840 align:middle line:90%
under the age of five.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.060 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to add the
United Nations refused

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.820 align:middle line:90%
to count six-year-olds.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.200 align:middle line:90%
They only counted the babies.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.282 align:middle line:84%
And 1 million children
had died in 13 years.

00:04:35.282 --> 00:04:37.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is really part
of the reason you were there.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.080 align:middle line:84%
As a peace activist,
you had great compassion

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.094 align:middle line:84%
for what the sanctions had
done to that population.

00:04:44.094 --> 00:04:44.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Yes.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they knew to
be very afraid of the United

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.194 align:middle line:90%
States by this point.

00:04:49.194 --> 00:04:49.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Yes.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Really, they could
see the only option was

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:53.070 align:middle line:90%
corporation.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: Well, the Iraqis
were giving the United States

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.800 align:middle line:84%
everything we could
possibly ask for.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.850 align:middle line:84%
They also promised
the United States

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.590 align:middle line:84%
that the FBI could send a
terrorism task force into Iraq

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.266 align:middle line:84%
nine months before
9/11 happened.

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:09.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
reason for that

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.400 align:middle line:84%
was because Saddam Hussein,
himself, was very afraid

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.050 align:middle line:90%
of Islamic fundamentalists.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.160 align:middle line:84%
Contrary to what
people might believe,

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.582 align:middle line:90%
he was terrified of them.

00:05:19.582 --> 00:05:21.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: Saddam's
government had

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.310 align:middle line:84%
been one of the best sources
for anti-terrorism intelligence

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.480 align:middle line:84%
throughout the 1990s,
because he was convinced

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.460 align:middle line:84%
that all these young Arab
jihadies would eventually

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.710 align:middle line:84%
become terrorists who would
try to undermine his secular

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.180 align:middle line:90%
society.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.140 align:middle line:84%
So since he could
not arrest them

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:42.990 align:middle line:84%
without being accused of
peace or humanitarian crimes

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.940 align:middle line:84%
against the Iraqi
people, he wanted

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.934 align:middle line:84%
to evict them and deport them,
and send them out to-- he

00:05:49.934 --> 00:05:51.600 align:middle line:84%
wanted the United
States to arrest them.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.183 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:05:52.183 --> 00:05:55.060 align:middle line:84%
And, well, you have to remember
that he was an ally of the US.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Absolutely.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:56.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this
has been obscured.

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: He
was a strong ally.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.530 align:middle line:84%
And he was very anxious to
be a bulwark against Iran.

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:03.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: And if you
look at Iraq today,

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.770 align:middle line:84%
and you look at the alliance
between the Iranians

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:12.430 align:middle line:84%
and the Shiites and
the fall of the Sunnis,

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.460 align:middle line:84%
we can see that Saddam
actually had a better plan.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: OK, and
let's continue on.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:19.748 align:middle line:84%
We're only halfway
through the list

00:06:19.748 --> 00:06:21.870 align:middle line:84%
of what was on the
table at that time.

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:26.259 align:middle line:84%
They would also have been
given the full exploration

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:27.550 align:middle line:90%
rights to the oil fields there.

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:28.508 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Absolutely.

00:06:28.508 --> 00:06:32.330 align:middle line:84%
The Iraqis promised the United
States priority contracts

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:37.490 align:middle line:84%
in oil construction,
rebuilding the pipeline.

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.570 align:middle line:84%
It's important to understand the
sanctions had degraded Iraq's

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:45.360 align:middle line:84%
oil fields and oil production
facilities very badly.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.840 align:middle line:84%
The pipelines were in
terrible condition.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.290 align:middle line:84%
The pumping stations were
in terrible condition.

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:54.410 align:middle line:84%
They were producing far
below the production capacity

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.020 align:middle line:90%
that they were capable of.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.850 align:middle line:84%
And so, the United
States was going

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.610 align:middle line:84%
to have huge profits
in rebuilding

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:03.620 align:middle line:84%
all of Iraq's oil
infrastructure.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when
people say, oh, we just

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.174 align:middle line:84%
went in-- the ones that are
starting to get onto it say,

00:07:08.174 --> 00:07:09.840 align:middle line:84%
well, we just went
in there for the oil.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.700 align:middle line:84%
It had nothing to do
with anything else.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:13.786 align:middle line:84%
The fact was, that was already
being made available to us.

00:07:13.786 --> 00:07:14.780 align:middle line:90%
We didn't go in for the oil.

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:15.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Guaranteed.

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:15.905 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Gauranteed.

00:07:15.905 --> 00:07:18.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: And the war and
sanctions have degraded the oil

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:22.650 align:middle line:84%
infrastructure so badly that
now they cannot get the oil

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.500 align:middle line:90%
because it's cost prohibitive.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:28.100 align:middle line:84%
They literally have to-- now the
burden, instead of benefiting

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.390 align:middle line:84%
from contracts
from the Iraqis, we

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:32.320 align:middle line:84%
have to pretty much
pay for this ourselves.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:36.090 align:middle line:90%


00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:40.620 align:middle line:84%
Iraq is down for the
count, as it were.

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And in addition,
as just another little bonus

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:46.600 align:middle line:84%
icing on the cake,
the Iraqis offered

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:50.170 align:middle line:84%
to purchase 1
million US-made cars

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:52.801 align:middle line:84%
a year, just to help give a
little back to our economy

00:07:52.801 --> 00:07:53.300 align:middle line:90%
after that.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.341 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: That's right.

00:07:54.341 --> 00:07:57.200 align:middle line:84%
1 million American manufactured
automobiles every year

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.020 align:middle line:90%
for 10 years.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And also, there was one more
thing that the people who say,

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.350 align:middle line:84%
well, we had to do
it for democracy.

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:06.790 align:middle line:90%
No, you didn't.

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:12.000 align:middle line:84%
Saddam Hussein was willing
to step back and retire

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.360 align:middle line:90%
to a villa.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:17.430 align:middle line:84%
He only asked-- he did
not ask for $1 billion.

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:20.850 align:middle line:84%
That was a propaganda ploy that
was put out at the last minute

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:23.220 align:middle line:90%
by the Bush administration.

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:27.450 align:middle line:84%
He only wanted to retire
with a small contingent

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:29.525 align:middle line:90%
of Revolutionary Guard to--

00:08:29.525 --> 00:08:31.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Basically, to
protect his own life.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.899 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: To
protect his own life.

00:08:32.899 --> 00:08:34.880 align:middle line:84%
And he compared it
to President Clinton

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.470 align:middle line:84%
receiving Secret
Service protection

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:40.530 align:middle line:84%
after his tenure
in the White House.

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And he said, it's very
reasonable and I'll step back

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:47.650 align:middle line:84%
and you can have elections
within 18 months.

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:51.820 align:middle line:84%
The Iraqi exiles were invited
to return home and live

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:55.960 align:middle line:84%
in expanded embassy domiciles
with the embassy security.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:59.630 align:middle line:84%
They were invited to set
up a campaign headquarters

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:04.450 align:middle line:84%
and have media,
opposition newspapers.

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:06.680 align:middle line:90%
All of this was on the table.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And so you can imagine--
and the thing is,

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:13.060 align:middle line:84%
my cousin was the deputy
was the-- excuse me.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:17.350 align:middle line:84%
My cousin, Andrew Card,
was the Chief of Staff

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:22.130 align:middle line:84%
to President George Bush, and
this becomes very important

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:26.180 align:middle line:84%
because not only was I reporting
this to my CIA handler,

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:28.680 align:middle line:84%
all of these developments
which were happening

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.020 align:middle line:84%
from the end of the Clinton
administration right

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:34.000 align:middle line:84%
through the first two years
of the Bush administration,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.690 align:middle line:84%
all of this was being
reported directly

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:40.590 align:middle line:84%
to my cousin, Chief
of Staff Andrew Card.

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:42.530 align:middle line:84%
The White House
was fully apprised

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:45.150 align:middle line:90%
of every single detail of it.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And that was good
politics because they

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:49.960 align:middle line:84%
needed to know what
Iraq was doing, too.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And the CIA was determined to
take control of the situation

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:57.940 align:middle line:84%
so that as sanctions collapsed,
international loathing

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:01.920 align:middle line:84%
of sanctions was--
because of the genocide,

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.810 align:middle line:84%
this was recognized as
a mass murder policy

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:08.540 align:middle line:84%
and the international community
considered it abhorrent.

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:15.980 align:middle line:84%
And so, there was a big
push to throw them out.

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:20.816 align:middle line:84%
If you ever wonder if a single
individual, a small anonymous

00:10:20.816 --> 00:10:22.190 align:middle line:84%
individual can
make a difference,

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:24.150 align:middle line:90%
let me just give you an example.

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:29.180 align:middle line:84%
Two German pilots began
to break the blockade.

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:35.490 align:middle line:84%
They were flying humanitarian
missions into Baghdad Airport,

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:38.310 align:middle line:84%
and they refused to
obey the sanctions.

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:42.470 align:middle line:84%
They carried in medicines,
doctors, nurses, transport

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:45.090 align:middle line:90%
for health equipment.

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:47.650 align:middle line:84%
And when the CIA saw
this-- to this day,

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:50.700 align:middle line:84%
I do not know their names,
but when the CIA saw this,

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:54.611 align:middle line:84%
we knew that the
sanctions were over.

00:10:54.611 --> 00:10:55.235 align:middle line:90%
It was history.

00:10:55.235 --> 00:10:57.200 align:middle line:90%
It was just a matter of time.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.700 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the
CIA did the thing

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:02.480 align:middle line:84%
that-- whether you
hate the CIA or not,

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:05.240 align:middle line:84%
I realize a lot of
people do, the CIA

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:08.710 align:middle line:84%
jumped in to try to take control
of the situation for the United

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:09.614 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:11:09.614 --> 00:11:12.030 align:middle line:84%
And they had to guarantee that
the United States would not

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:15.012 align:middle line:84%
lose power in Iraq
after the sanctions.

00:11:15.012 --> 00:11:16.470 align:middle line:84%
And you can hate
the United States,

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:18.790 align:middle line:84%
but that is what the
CIA is supposed to do.

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, the
CIA began to build

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:24.860 align:middle line:84%
this platform, this
comprehensive framework,

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:28.150 align:middle line:84%
and what was so amazing
was every single thing

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:31.700 align:middle line:84%
that the United States demanded,
Iraq immediately agreed.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd take it back
to Washington and say, hey,

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:35.670 align:middle line:90%
you wanted this.

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:36.360 align:middle line:90%
You've got it.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.930 align:middle line:90%
What else do you want?

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:39.140 align:middle line:90%
And that's how it went.

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:40.580 align:middle line:90%
That's how it went.

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.620 align:middle line:84%
So the reason that
I was arrested

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:48.130 align:middle line:84%
was that when the war
started to go badly,

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:51.720 align:middle line:84%
to tie this back into the bigger
picture of why they attacked

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:55.820 align:middle line:84%
me, the Congress and the White
House, the Bush administration,

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:59.840 align:middle line:84%
were desperate to hide the
real facts of Iraqi prewar

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.180 align:middle line:90%
intelligence from the people.

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:05.030 align:middle line:84%
Every word they
told you was a lie.

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:07.750 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing-- I
mean, everything about 9/11

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:08.340 align:middle line:90%
was a lie.

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:10.430 align:middle line:90%
We did know about 9/11.

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:13.630 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about that later
on, but from the standpoint

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:17.570 align:middle line:84%
of the peace option, we had
sent American soldiers out

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:20.980 align:middle line:84%
to die for nothing,
for no reason at all.

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:24.780 align:middle line:84%
There was no reason to
bankrupt our country,

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:26.780 align:middle line:84%
except that Halliburton
wanted profits.

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:27.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:29.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: But no American
soldier had to die.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.560 align:middle line:90%
No Iraqi citizen had to die.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.050 align:middle line:84%
There was no reason to
have sectarian violence

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:35.710 align:middle line:90%
and a bloodbath.

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:38.770 align:middle line:84%
Every single item that
you could possibly

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:41.290 align:middle line:84%
have desired to
achieve had already

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:45.220 align:middle line:84%
been articulated by the CIA,
we had already addressed it,

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.680 align:middle line:84%
and won acceptance
from the Iraqis,

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.430 align:middle line:84%
even to the point of having
general elections that

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:53.080 align:middle line:84%
would be monitored
by Jimmy Carter.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And we all know Jimmy Carter
and his tremendous reputation

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:03.824 align:middle line:84%
for guaranteeing the sanctity
of elections worldwide.

00:13:03.824 --> 00:13:04.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:05.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: And the
Iraqis said that they'd

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:07.440 align:middle line:84%
be happy to invite
him to come in

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:10.810 align:middle line:84%
as an election monitor
for them as well.

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And if there had been
any problems, imagine

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:18.380 align:middle line:84%
we could have, by the time
the war was going badly,

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:20.680 align:middle line:84%
there would have been a whole
new government in Baghdad

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.649 align:middle line:90%
through peaceful means.

00:13:22.649 --> 00:13:24.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So in your
assessment then,

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:26.315 align:middle line:84%
we know it wasn't the oil,
because that was already

00:13:26.315 --> 00:13:29.260 align:middle line:84%
made available to them and other
things we've just talked about.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.580 align:middle line:84%
It couldn't possibly
have simply been

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:34.270 align:middle line:84%
about getting some private
contractors in to rake

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:36.305 align:middle line:84%
in hundreds of
billions of dollars.

00:13:36.305 --> 00:13:37.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Oh, yes it was.

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Seriously?

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:38.578 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Absolutely.

00:13:38.578 --> 00:13:40.280 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely, it was greed.

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:42.270 align:middle line:90%
Halliburton's greed.

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:44.520 align:middle line:90%
Yes, Blackwater's greed.

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:47.970 align:middle line:84%
The defense contractors
made out like bandits.

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:48.630 align:middle line:90%
They are--

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:49.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we
know they're all--

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:49.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: These
are mercenaries.

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.765 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and they're
all in bed with each other.

00:13:51.765 --> 00:13:54.370 align:middle line:84%
We know that the Carlyle Group
and the Bush family go back.

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:57.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we know this is a very
incestuous affair with politics

00:13:57.510 --> 00:13:59.074 align:middle line:90%
of that day probably still.

00:13:59.074 --> 00:13:59.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Yes.

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:00.240 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:04.600 align:middle line:84%
Yes, even daddy Bush's
advisers James Baker,

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.360 align:middle line:84%
Brent Scowcroft said
don't make this mistake.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.970 align:middle line:84%
This is a huge
catastrophe coming.

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:12.460 align:middle line:84%
But what was really
horrible from my perspective

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:16.770 align:middle line:84%
as the asset was-- and
what was unfair about it,

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:20.050 align:middle line:84%
it was mostly unfair
for the Iraqi people

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:22.640 align:middle line:84%
and it was mostly unfair
for the American soldiers.

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.320 align:middle line:84%
I have to tell you
that what I suffered

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:29.490 align:middle line:84%
and what they suffered,
it's light years apart.

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:31.680 align:middle line:84%
The American soldiers
who are now paralyzed,

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:35.230 align:middle line:84%
who have head injuries, who have
served in these tours of duty

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:37.770 align:middle line:84%
in these horrible conditions,
post traumatic stress,

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:40.134 align:middle line:84%
the breakup of their
families, it's--

00:14:40.134 --> 00:14:42.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The abandonment
by their government.

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:43.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: Abandonment
by their government.

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:45.680 align:middle line:90%
The betrayal.

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:50.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean you send people--
I am ashamed, particularly

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:53.530 align:middle line:84%
ashamed of Secretary
of State Colin Powell,

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:57.570 align:middle line:84%
former four star general
and former head of the Joint

00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:01.205 align:middle line:90%
Chiefs, who lied to America.

00:15:01.205 --> 00:15:04.720 align:middle line:90%


00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:08.090 align:middle line:84%
He had gone on a
book tour and he

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:12.300 align:middle line:84%
complained that no one at
the CIA, no mid-level people,

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:14.870 align:middle line:84%
ever tried to warn
him that there would

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:17.550 align:middle line:84%
be no weapons of mass
destruction in Iraq

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:21.480 align:middle line:84%
and that the Iraqi exiles
were completely untrustworthy,

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:25.620 align:middle line:84%
that they were total-- that
they were abject liars,

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:32.160 align:middle line:84%
and that their reporting was
just blatant fabrications.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.910 align:middle line:90%
Nobody except me.

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:36.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
that's interesting

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:40.060 align:middle line:84%
because you actually took
a very proactive stance

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:40.870 align:middle line:90%
in doing your job.

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:42.536 align:middle line:84%
First of all, when
you started getting--

00:15:42.536 --> 00:15:45.120 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to go into
this in just a sec, what led up

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:48.540 align:middle line:84%
to this, what your background
was, but the fact that you were

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:51.270 align:middle line:84%
screaming from rooftops when
you realized, hold on a minute,

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:53.070 align:middle line:84%
it looks like no one is going
to listen to this stuff.

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:53.680 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:55.792 align:middle line:90%
You were naive in a way.

00:15:55.792 --> 00:15:56.656 align:middle line:90%
You believed.

00:15:56.656 --> 00:15:58.687 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: I believed
in the system.

00:15:58.687 --> 00:15:59.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:01.462 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: I believed
that we were the good guys.

00:16:01.462 --> 00:16:02.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:03.545 align:middle line:90%
You believed it.

00:16:03.545 --> 00:16:05.045 align:middle line:84%
You believed it
with all your heart.

00:16:05.045 --> 00:16:05.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: I did.

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:07.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You were
a peace activist.

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:09.170 align:middle line:84%
You did everything in
your power to do your part

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:11.725 align:middle line:84%
in trying to bring this
agreement to the table.

00:16:11.725 --> 00:16:12.225 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:16:12.225 --> 00:16:14.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: And to make
sure that, for example,

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:19.220 align:middle line:84%
in the case of Colin Powell,
Colin Powell lived next door

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:22.360 align:middle line:84%
to my CIA handler,
Dr. Richard Fuisz.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.190 align:middle line:90%
He was his next door neighbor.

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:30.560 align:middle line:84%
So in January of 2003, two
months before the war starts,

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:33.440 align:middle line:90%
I went to Colin Powell twice.

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.280 align:middle line:84%
I went to him at the
beginning of January

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:37.880 align:middle line:84%
with the peace framework,
and I assured him

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.500 align:middle line:84%
the peace framework
would still be achieved.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And to be perfectly
honest with you,

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:46.150 align:middle line:84%
and this should make everyone
happy about Iran and Syria,

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:51.120 align:middle line:84%
there is never a time when
diplomacy cannot achieve

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.030 align:middle line:90%
results.

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:55.370 align:middle line:84%
You always start off with
something very small,

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:57.690 align:middle line:84%
like getting
weapons inspections,

00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:01.010 align:middle line:84%
and you expand out
from it very rapidly.

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:04.550 align:middle line:84%
And you find that the first
conversations are the hardest,

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:07.200 align:middle line:84%
and then you find you have a
lot more common ground than you

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.020 align:middle line:90%
imagined.

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden
you're achieving

00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:11.500 align:middle line:90%
wonderful great things.

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:15.960 align:middle line:84%
And if you've got the
courage and vision to do it,

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.119 align:middle line:90%
you can always achieve results.

00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:21.560 align:middle line:84%
There is no reason
that Chuck-- I'd

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:26.119 align:middle line:84%
like to say in favor of
hope to be soon Secretary

00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:29.200 align:middle line:84%
of Defense Chuck Hagel and
the new Secretary of State,

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:32.840 align:middle line:84%
John Kerry, both of these
men have been criticized

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:37.110 align:middle line:84%
in Washington, criticized
for supporting diplomacy

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:39.537 align:middle line:90%
as if diplomacy is a weakness.

00:17:39.537 --> 00:17:40.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:42.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: And as if
communication and negotiations

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:46.450 align:middle line:84%
are going to weaken the
United States' position,

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:49.780 align:middle line:84%
and that we will have
to sacrifice our goals.

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:52.880 align:middle line:90%
That is absolutely wrong.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.960 align:middle line:84%
Just as we have just shown
on the Iraqi situation,

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:59.380 align:middle line:84%
you will achieve much more
than you had hoped for,

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:01.060 align:middle line:90%
than you start off hoping for.

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:03.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean really, that's
your overarching message that

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:05.500 align:middle line:84%
continues to this
day and that you

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:08.531 align:middle line:84%
had to live with in some
very cold and dank times.

00:18:08.531 --> 00:18:10.280 align:middle line:84%
That was all there was
to warm your heart,

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.580 align:middle line:84%
was that you had
done the right thing

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:13.130 align:middle line:84%
and that this is
the proper path.

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And the reality
is, you personally

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:18.330 align:middle line:84%
created an atmosphere of trust
and respect with these people.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:20.590 align:middle line:84%
That's how you were
able to accelerate

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:22.340 align:middle line:84%
what they were able
to bring to the table.

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:24.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Yes, absolutely.

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And we could have achieved
every goal that we had.

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And we can do it
again with Iran.

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:30.054 align:middle line:90%
I'm convinced of it.

00:18:30.054 --> 00:18:32.011 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now let's
go back because they're

00:18:32.011 --> 00:18:33.950 align:middle line:84%
wondering who is
this woman by now.

00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:34.904 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Yes.

00:18:34.904 --> 00:18:36.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Who is this woman?

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:39.360 align:middle line:84%
How did she end up in a position
to be talking to these people

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:40.440 align:middle line:90%
to begin with?

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.410 align:middle line:84%
So if you'll give
us, I mean, you

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:44.380 align:middle line:84%
don't have to do it
in a sound bites.

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:48.281 align:middle line:84%
Give us a background of
your original involvement--

00:18:48.281 --> 00:18:50.030 align:middle line:84%
because it was a nine
year process for you

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:51.304 align:middle line:90%
from '93 to '92.

00:18:51.304 --> 00:18:52.970 align:middle line:84%
What happened during
that period of time

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:54.470 align:middle line:90%
that put you in that position?

00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:57.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: I live
in Washington,

00:18:57.270 --> 00:19:04.790 align:middle line:84%
and I, through fate-- fate
has played a role in my life

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:10.790 align:middle line:84%
so many times-- I gave advance
warning about the 1993 World

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:11.960 align:middle line:90%
Trade Center attack.

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And how
did you have that?

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:16.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: There is
some parts of my life

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:18.450 align:middle line:90%
that have to be classified.

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:20.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm very sorry to
do this to you.

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:23.840 align:middle line:84%
I know everybody always
says, well, how did you know?

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:28.050 align:middle line:84%
What matters is that I
did know and I reported it

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:31.170 align:middle line:90%
to the Tunisian Embassy.

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:35.340 align:middle line:84%
I went to the Tunisians because
they represented Yasser Arafat,

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:39.580 align:middle line:84%
and I told the ambassador-- the
diplomat-- the senior diplomat

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:42.160 align:middle line:84%
that I thought that his
embassy would probably

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.470 align:middle line:84%
know how to handle terrorism,
and they would probably

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:49.150 align:middle line:90%
know who to tell.

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:49.960 align:middle line:90%
Because I didn't.

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:52.330 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have a clue what to do.

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:55.640 align:middle line:84%
I just knew that somebody had
to do something about this.

00:19:55.640 --> 00:20:00.650 align:middle line:84%
And we also know in retrospect
that the FBI had infiltrated

00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:04.090 align:middle line:84%
this as well, and that
the FBI had infiltrated

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:07.690 align:middle line:84%
that conspiracy, and they were
feeding it and creating it.

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:10.590 align:middle line:84%
I was ignorant of the
FBI's involvement.

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:12.150 align:middle line:90%
I have to tell you that.

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:13.670 align:middle line:90%
I did not know that part of it.

00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:18.400 align:middle line:84%
All I knew was that suddenly I
was aware of this information,

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:23.080 align:middle line:84%
and I had a responsibility
to take action.

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:25.820 align:middle line:84%
So even though I didn't know
everything, I knew enough.

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:28.430 align:middle line:84%
I knew what the
target was, certainly.

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that it involved
Egyptian fundamentalists trying

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:34.790 align:middle line:84%
to overthrow and
assassinate Hosni Mubarak.

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:37.300 align:middle line:84%
And beyond that, I
didn't know what to do.

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:39.506 align:middle line:84%
So I went to Yasser
Arafat's embassy

00:20:39.506 --> 00:20:41.380 align:middle line:84%
because I thought they
would know what to do.

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:42.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:43.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: And so I was very--

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:46.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now you're rising up
in profile a bit after that.

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:48.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: Well, right
after that I became

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.840 align:middle line:84%
what they call a
person of interest

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:53.370 align:middle line:84%
in a terrorism
investigation, which

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:57.432 align:middle line:84%
is a very scary situation,
because if you have-- you know,

00:20:57.432 --> 00:20:58.890 align:middle line:84%
if you're a person
of interest, you

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:01.910 align:middle line:84%
could go to jail for
the rest of your life

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:05.010 align:middle line:90%
and I was very, very frightened.

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:07.330 align:middle line:84%
But they realized that
I had done my very best

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:10.290 align:middle line:84%
and I had tried to stop the
attack, and that's what you do.

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:12.420 align:middle line:84%
I didn't go to the
normal people because I

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:15.680 align:middle line:84%
didn't know who--
I was 29 years old,

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:18.350 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know who the
right people were, but I

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:20.640 align:middle line:84%
had tried to do
something and that

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:23.890 align:middle line:84%
impressed the CIA and the
Defense Intelligence Agency.

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:28.490 align:middle line:84%
I was assigned a Defense
Intelligence Handler,

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:32.090 align:middle line:84%
who I became what they call a
captured asset at that point.

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:33.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's that mean?

00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:35.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: That means
that they had decided

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:38.720 align:middle line:84%
that I needed to be watched
over, that I would not

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:41.717 align:middle line:84%
be wandering around
Washington unaccompanied.

00:21:41.717 --> 00:21:43.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so you
were a little too

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:44.810 align:middle line:84%
vocal and a little
too passionate.

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:45.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: A little
too passionate.

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:46.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Intensely
smart, you're

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:48.217 align:middle line:90%
able to figure things out.

00:21:48.217 --> 00:21:49.550 align:middle line:90%
But you could be a loose cannon.

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:54.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: Well, not a
loose cannon, but that I--

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:58.270 align:middle line:84%
the people that I was dealing
with that I needed to have

00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:01.497 align:middle line:84%
a conduit in case there
was ever anything that I--

00:22:01.497 --> 00:22:04.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and you weren't
clear on protocols or anything

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:04.480 align:middle line:90%
at this point.

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:05.146 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Yes.

00:22:05.146 --> 00:22:06.630 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea what
protocols were.

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:10.300 align:middle line:84%
I needed somebody--
obviously, I was

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:14.900 align:middle line:84%
receiving extraordinary
intelligence and somebody

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:16.574 align:middle line:84%
better be there to
grab it from me.

00:22:16.574 --> 00:22:17.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:18.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: That's
how to look at it.

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:18.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:20.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: But I was
just very young and naive.

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:24.450 align:middle line:90%
And then I-- and I was naive.

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:26.400 align:middle line:84%
I was introduced to
Dr. Richard Fuisz,

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:30.690 align:middle line:84%
who had been in Lebanon
during the civil war.

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And he said that he
had been on the ground

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:36.700 align:middle line:84%
when the Lockerbie bombing,
the bombing of Pan Am 103,

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:38.210 align:middle line:90%
was being planned.

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:44.820 align:middle line:84%
And that, in fact, it involved--
the CIA had infiltrated heroin

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:48.130 align:middle line:84%
trafficking out of the
Bekaa Valley in Lebanon

00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:52.410 align:middle line:84%
and that it was the
Islamic jihadists,

00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:55.600 align:middle line:84%
now called Hezbollah, were
using heroin trafficking

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.720 align:middle line:90%
to pay for their operations.

00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:59.595 align:middle line:84%
And it was a big
war against Israel.

00:22:59.595 --> 00:23:01.960 align:middle line:90%
It was an ugly civil war.

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:05.870 align:middle line:84%
The Lebanese people's society
was destroying itself.

00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:10.120 align:middle line:10%
And they had taken 96
high-profile Western hostages,

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:13.140 align:middle line:10%
including Terry Anderson,
who was the Associated Press

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:17.480 align:middle line:10%
reporter, Jerry Levin, who was
the CNN bureau chief, William

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:21.530 align:middle line:10%
Buckley, who was the CIA
station chief of Beirut,

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:25.970 align:middle line:10%
and like the heads of the
American School in Lebanon.

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:28.950 align:middle line:84%
Very powerful, very
famous Westerners.

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:32.390 align:middle line:84%
Terry Waite, who was
the Anglican emissary,

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:35.390 align:middle line:84%
and these people
were held for years.

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:38.700 align:middle line:84%
Like Terry Anderson was
held for seven years.

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:42.710 align:middle line:84%
So the CIA had a legitimate
goal, to find these people

00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:43.730 align:middle line:90%
and rescue them.

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:50.250 align:middle line:84%
The problem was that somebody
on the CIA side had gone rogue,

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:53.650 align:middle line:84%
and they were now profiting
from the heroin trafficking.

00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:55.410 align:middle line:90%
And any time the CIA started--

00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:58.154 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like
that's a new story.

00:23:58.154 --> 00:23:58.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Yes.

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:01.500 align:middle line:84%
And any time the team
started to close in

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:05.460 align:middle line:84%
so that they could actually
rescue the hostages,

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:09.284 align:middle line:84%
the rogue CIA agent
was warning Hezbollah,

00:24:09.284 --> 00:24:11.450 align:middle line:84%
and then all of a sudden
the hostages would be moved

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:14.000 align:middle line:84%
and they'd have to
start all over again.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And so Richard Fuisz said
that the Defense Intelligence

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:25.207 align:middle line:84%
Agency, Dennis McKee, reported
to Washington that they

00:24:25.207 --> 00:24:26.790 align:middle line:84%
had better do an
investigation, they'd

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:28.244 align:middle line:84%
better come out
and clean this up.

00:24:28.244 --> 00:24:29.660 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise,
they were never

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:31.040 align:middle line:90%
going to get the hostages out.

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And so the FBI and the CIA sent
a team out from Washington,

00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:36.340 align:middle line:90%
they gathered evidence.

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:41.480 align:middle line:84%
They boarded Pan Am
flight 103 to come home.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold, they
were blown out of the sky.

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:49.450 align:middle line:10%
And it was because, sure enough,
the rogue CIA agent had warned

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:51.930 align:middle line:10%
Hezbollah that they
were coming back

00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:54.846 align:middle line:10%
and they put the
bomb on the plane

00:24:54.846 --> 00:24:56.720 align:middle line:10%
so that they could kill
off the intelligence,

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.810 align:middle line:10%
you know destroy the
evidence and kill off

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:01.830 align:middle line:10%
the people who'd done
the investigation.

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:03.840 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So how did
Fuisz become involved,

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:06.840 align:middle line:10%
because I remember
reading in your book

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:10.160 align:middle line:10%
in one area you were talking
about the fact he claimed not

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:12.880 align:middle line:10%
only did he know exactly who
was responsible at the Lockerbie

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.440 align:middle line:10%
trial, the Lockerbie
trial, getting to that,

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.400 align:middle line:10%
he knew all these people's
names, where they lived,

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:20.250 align:middle line:10%
what time they went
to lunch each day.

00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:21.100 align:middle line:90%
He knew everything.

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:22.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: The man
who put the bomb

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:25.310 align:middle line:84%
on Pan Am 103 lives
in northern Virginia

00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:27.380 align:middle line:90%
about six miles from my house.

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:33.770 align:middle line:84%
He's been protected by the
FBI, the CIA since the 1980s.

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:36.470 align:middle line:90%
The late 1980s, yes.

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:38.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:38.831 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:38.831 --> 00:25:40.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: I laugh,
but it's like--

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:41.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it's not funny.

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:42.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's one of
those things that's

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:43.489 align:middle line:84%
so dark and sick
you laugh at it.

00:25:43.489 --> 00:25:45.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: It's so dark
and sick that you laugh,

00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:50.630 align:middle line:84%
because it's-- I never really
developed a sense of humor

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:51.914 align:middle line:90%
until I got to prison.

00:25:51.914 --> 00:25:54.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and well,
that's a whole other story

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:55.204 align:middle line:90%
we are going to talk about.

00:25:55.204 --> 00:25:59.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: And the tragedy
is these horrible things,

00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:02.340 align:middle line:84%
and people sometimes get
very upset when they hear me.

00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:04.320 align:middle line:84%
They hear me, they think
I'm being flippant,

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:05.957 align:middle line:90%
but it is my own--

00:26:05.957 --> 00:26:07.915 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's your
survival mechanism, really.

00:26:07.915 --> 00:26:09.695 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: It's my
survival mechanism.

00:26:09.695 --> 00:26:11.700 align:middle line:90%
It's a survival mechanism.

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:13.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, how
did you and Fuisz then

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:15.250 align:middle line:84%
come together
during all of this?

00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:17.680 align:middle line:84%
We know he was very
important, and it

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:20.680 align:middle line:84%
appears he was working
very closely with, for?

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:23.210 align:middle line:90%
Who was he to the CIA?

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:26.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: Richard Fuisz
was a long time operative.

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:29.180 align:middle line:84%
He had been outed
by Syria when he

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:31.370 align:middle line:84%
stole the blueprints
for Syria's brand

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:33.440 align:middle line:90%
new telecommunications system.

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:36.230 align:middle line:84%
So he was exposed in
their world and he

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:39.280 align:middle line:84%
had to come back to
Washington, and he could never

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:41.700 align:middle line:84%
go back into the Middle East
because they would kill him.

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:42.325 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:26:42.325 --> 00:26:43.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: But I
did not out him.

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:47.340 align:middle line:90%
He'd already been outed.

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:50.030 align:middle line:84%
But he needed-- he had--
this was his passion,

00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:51.535 align:middle line:84%
it was his gift,
it was his strength

00:26:51.535 --> 00:26:53.610 align:middle line:84%
and he needed
somebody who could be

00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:57.930 align:middle line:84%
a front for his operations
dealing with these people.

00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:01.780 align:middle line:84%
So what he suggested to me,
they knew the CIA had already

00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:06.760 align:middle line:84%
vetted me, and I'd been
heavily scrutinized.

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:10.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my heavens, during the
investigation of the 1993 World

00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:13.980 align:middle line:84%
Trade Center attack, I'd been
put under a magnifying glass.

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:15.960 align:middle line:84%
I could not go
anywhere in my house

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:19.590 align:middle line:84%
and run my fingers
over the furniture.

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:22.500 align:middle line:90%
It was dusted absolutely clean.

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:25.740 align:middle line:84%
My apartment, my house has
never been so clean ever again.

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:28.589 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As when the FBI or CIA
vets you and dusts everything.

00:27:28.589 --> 00:27:30.464 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: They dusted
down for fingerprints

00:27:30.464 --> 00:27:31.760 align:middle line:90%
and it was spotless.

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:34.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, hidden
unintended benefit.

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: Hidden
unintended benefit.

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:38.690 align:middle line:84%
But they knew that
I was passionately

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:40.220 align:middle line:90%
opposed to sanctions.

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:44.780 align:middle line:84%
I had been outspoken against
the Iraqi sanctions, which

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:48.490 align:middle line:84%
were destroying health
care, education,

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:50.890 align:middle line:84%
literacy was wiped
out in a generation.

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:55.410 align:middle line:84%
Iraq performed the second
heart transplant in the world,

00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:57.560 align:middle line:90%
and now the children were dying.

00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:58.770 align:middle line:90%
They had no incubators.

00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:00.570 align:middle line:90%
They had no oxygen tanks.

00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:03.210 align:middle line:84%
Everything-- there
was a catastrophe.

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:03.877 align:middle line:90%
It was genocide.

00:28:03.877 --> 00:28:05.376 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's
what fueled you.

00:28:05.376 --> 00:28:07.430 align:middle line:84%
You really were compassionate
about the sanctions

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:08.060 align:middle line:90%
and their effect.

00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:10.351 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: That was my
passion, and it was very honest

00:28:10.351 --> 00:28:11.590 align:middle line:90%
and they knew this.

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And they said to
me, well, here's

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:15.960 align:middle line:84%
an opportunity--
they also knew that I

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:18.440 align:middle line:90%
was very good at anti-terrorism.

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:22.540 align:middle line:84%
I am very, very,
very good at this.

00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:25.100 align:middle line:84%
I did one of the very first
investigations of Osama bin

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:26.460 align:middle line:90%
Laden.

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:29.210 align:middle line:84%
By the time my career was
over, I gave advance warning

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:34.900 align:middle line:84%
about the USS Cole
and the 9/11 attack.

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:41.490 align:middle line:84%
I also worked on the Lockerbie
negotiations with Libya,

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:44.930 align:middle line:84%
and ran an operation
that persuaded Qaddafi

00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:48.520 align:middle line:84%
to evict all terrorists
from his borders.

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:51.710 align:middle line:84%
So I had a tremendous
track record

00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:54.520 align:middle line:84%
by the very end
in anti-terrorism.

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.650 align:middle line:90%
I was very, very good at it.

00:28:56.650 --> 00:29:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I could be so
good at it was part of the CIA

00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:05.660 align:middle line:84%
is very strategic
and they realized

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:09.240 align:middle line:84%
what I hope the American
people will start to realize.

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:14.110 align:middle line:84%
The Arabs respond best if you
are consistent in your approach

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:15.210 align:middle line:90%
to violence.

00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:18.030 align:middle line:84%
I oppose violence
in all directions;

00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:21.090 align:middle line:84%
therefore, I'm opposed to anyone
killing Arab children just

00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:24.510 align:middle line:84%
like I'm opposed-- and
Palestinian children,

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:26.820 align:middle line:84%
just like I'm opposed
to anyone killing

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:29.630 align:middle line:84%
American children or
American soldiers.

00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:32.010 align:middle line:90%
I deeply oppose violence.

00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:34.080 align:middle line:90%
And so they respected me.

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And the CIA was willing to
take this chance with me.

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And they said, why
don't you go to Libya

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:43.620 align:middle line:84%
and make an approach
to these countries

00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:46.890 align:middle line:84%
and see if you could
set up a back channel

00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:50.090 align:middle line:84%
and start negotiations
for the Lockerbie trial.

00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:52.560 align:middle line:84%
And you can tell--
Richard Fuisz said to me,

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:55.990 align:middle line:84%
he said, you can tell them that
I am available as a witness

00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:58.340 align:middle line:90%
and I know who did this crime.

00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And if they will agree
to the Lockerbie trial,

00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:05.150 align:middle line:84%
they can call me as a
witness and I will happily

00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:10.340 align:middle line:84%
lay out how this whole thing
works and this whole thing

00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:11.660 align:middle line:90%
can be cleared up.

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And so we started negotiations
for the Lockerbie trial.

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:18.340 align:middle line:84%
And it ended up Libya
absolutely did not

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:21.000 align:middle line:90%
trust the United States at all.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.950 align:middle line:84%
I have to tell you, the first
conversation the diplomat

00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:27.270 align:middle line:90%
said to me, oh, thank you CIA.

00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:30.180 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much CIA.

00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:34.580 align:middle line:84%
We are so grateful the CIA wants
to help us and our sanctions.

00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:36.390 align:middle line:84%
If you know that
we're innocent, why

00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:39.040 align:middle line:84%
are you demanding that
we have a trial at all?

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:40.950 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you tell
your families--

00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:44.260 align:middle line:84%
why don't you tell the
families of Pan Am 103

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:46.750 align:middle line:84%
that we had nothing
to do with it,

00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:48.270 align:middle line:84%
and why don't you
turn your focus

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:49.830 align:middle line:84%
on the people who
really did this?

00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:51.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And why didn't they?

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:55.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: Because the
families of Pan Am 103 refused

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:57.922 align:middle line:90%
to listen, and this was a very--

00:30:57.922 --> 00:30:58.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The families?

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:00.926 align:middle line:84%
Well, that would have
had to be an effect

00:31:00.926 --> 00:31:02.094 align:middle line:90%
of the media at that point.

00:31:02.094 --> 00:31:03.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: The
families attacked,

00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:07.230 align:middle line:84%
aggressively attacked
anyone who tried

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:09.170 align:middle line:90%
to say that Libya didn't do it.

00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:11.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Were the families
given other information

00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:13.317 align:middle line:90%
and encouraged to do that?

00:31:13.317 --> 00:31:15.692 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: Yes, they were
given a lot of disinformation.

00:31:15.692 --> 00:31:16.358 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:31:16.358 --> 00:31:18.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: They were
also promised money.

00:31:18.770 --> 00:31:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And I will tell you that any
time you start promising people

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:27.140 align:middle line:84%
money, and they were paid
$10 million per death.

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:28.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:32.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: And even when
I visited family members

00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:37.925 align:middle line:84%
and said, look, the
Libyans are innocent.

00:31:37.925 --> 00:31:39.880 align:middle line:84%
They had nothing
to do with this.

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:41.890 align:middle line:90%
They're like, well, gosh.

00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:44.734 align:middle line:84%
Do we have to give
back the money?

00:31:44.734 --> 00:31:45.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:47.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: Do we have
to give back the money?

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:48.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: And
it's like they were

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:50.090 align:middle line:84%
willing-- I'm ashamed
of those people,

00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:51.990 align:middle line:90%
to be perfectly honest with you.

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:54.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't have very much
respect for those people.

00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:56.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But maybe
just draw it out for us.

00:31:56.630 --> 00:32:00.510 align:middle line:84%
Why would the US want
that kind of outcome?

00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:04.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: Well, it was
a very stupid outcome.

00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:08.030 align:middle line:84%
What happened was,
originally, the investigation

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:11.190 align:middle line:84%
pointed straight to
Syria and Lebanon.

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:13.790 align:middle line:84%
It pointed right
where it needed to be.

00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:20.470 align:middle line:84%
But when George Bush Sr. decided
that he needed Syria's help

00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:22.174 align:middle line:90%
with the first Iraqi war--

00:32:22.174 --> 00:32:22.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:23.340 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:26.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: And they
needed fly-over rights,

00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:27.574 align:middle line:84%
and they needed
Syria to back down.

00:32:27.574 --> 00:32:28.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So he
couldn't hang this

00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:31.150 align:middle line:84%
where it belonged because
he needed their cooperation.

00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:32.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: He needed
their cooperation--

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:32.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it was
hung on the Libyans.

00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:34.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: -so they
switched it over,

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:37.770 align:middle line:84%
and overnight they
switched it to the Libyans.

00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And Qaddafi played
his part as a martyr,

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:45.260 align:middle line:84%
because Qaddafi was like,
well, if you want to accuse me

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:49.736 align:middle line:84%
of this crime, I will
gladly bear any--

00:32:49.736 --> 00:32:54.540 align:middle line:84%
the martyrdom of Islam says
that they will bear any price,

00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:57.560 align:middle line:84%
any suffering that
the West inflicts,

00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:01.800 align:middle line:84%
any suffering inflicted by the
infidels adds to your nobility.

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:09.360 align:middle line:84%
So Qaddafi did himself no favors
by standing tall and saying,

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:11.170 align:middle line:90%
we refuse to bend.

00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:12.980 align:middle line:90%
We will not help you.

00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:14.220 align:middle line:90%
We will not do anything.

00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:17.050 align:middle line:84%
He didn't protest the way
that an innocent man would

00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:21.140 align:middle line:84%
protest because
he was a jihadist.

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:22.520 align:middle line:90%
He was a jihadist.

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:25.720 align:middle line:84%
But he was not a radical
Islamist jihadist.

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:29.590 align:middle line:90%
He was a Che Guevara jihadist.

00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:30.810 align:middle line:90%
And that's very different.

00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:33.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's the thing you have to
understand in the current Libya

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:38.730 align:middle line:84%
crisis, is that the radical
Islamists did not like Qaddafi

00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:40.810 align:middle line:90%
because he was a socialist.

00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:44.070 align:middle line:84%
But Qaddafi always supported
liberation theologies

00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:47.070 align:middle line:84%
everywhere in the world, for
all over Latin America, all

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:48.520 align:middle line:90%
over Africa.

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:52.250 align:middle line:84%
He enjoyed being a thorn
in Washington's side.

00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And it was only when Hosni
Mubarak was under attack

00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:01.345 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt-- Egypt and
Libya are right next door

00:34:01.345 --> 00:34:02.870 align:middle line:84%
to each other for
those of you who

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:07.830 align:middle line:84%
forget your geography--
that the message came home

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:14.530 align:middle line:84%
that Qaddafi's support for
radical revolutionaries

00:34:14.530 --> 00:34:17.260 align:middle line:84%
would cause a threat
to his one and only

00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:19.459 align:middle line:90%
friend in the Middle East.

00:34:19.459 --> 00:34:20.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:24.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: And therefore, that
was my operation with Libya

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:29.070 align:middle line:84%
and I was intensely
involved with the Egyptians,

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:34.360 align:middle line:84%
and the troubles that
Hosni Mubarak was facing

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:39.710 align:middle line:84%
with the Muslim
Brotherhood to persuade

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:44.020 align:middle line:84%
these people that
Libya needed to evict

00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:45.889 align:middle line:84%
its terrorists from
its own borders

00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:48.420 align:middle line:84%
because they might use
Libya as a launching pad

00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:50.659 align:middle line:90%
to attack Hosni Mubarak.

00:34:50.659 --> 00:34:52.449 align:middle line:90%
And that's how we did it.

00:34:52.449 --> 00:34:57.370 align:middle line:84%
That's how we actually
persuaded Libya to act.

00:34:57.370 --> 00:34:57.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:01.050 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for that
wonderful history

00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:03.642 align:middle line:84%
lesson that is not
normally shared.

00:35:03.642 --> 00:35:04.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Yes, sorry.

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:06.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I really
appreciate that because it now

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:07.670 align:middle line:84%
starts setting up
the complexities.

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:08.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: OK, but if
you need to cut that out,

00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:09.400 align:middle line:90%
you can cut that out.

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:09.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:10.060 align:middle line:90%
Gosh no.

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:11.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: But
nobody knows that.

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:12.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, they
don't know that.

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:13.770 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I truly appreciate it.

00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:15.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: I'm trying to give
you like something nobody has.

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm hanging
on every word;

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:20.529 align:middle line:84%
however, I do want to move
forward into your story.

00:35:20.529 --> 00:35:22.820 align:middle line:10%
And so, thank you for setting
up the background of what

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:24.910 align:middle line:10%
was going on, how
that was playing out,

00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:27.030 align:middle line:10%
why you were where
you were, what

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:30.270 align:middle line:10%
you were doing, who
Dr. Richard Fuisz was.

00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:31.820 align:middle line:10%
And now we have
another fellow that

00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:33.910 align:middle line:10%
enters the scene, Paul Hoven.

00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And I want to lay
that foundation first

00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:39.140 align:middle line:84%
because this is really
kind of critical to what

00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:41.600 align:middle line:90%
happens in a little bit.

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:45.080 align:middle line:10%
>>LINDAUER: Paul Hoven was my
Defense Intelligence handler.

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:48.540 align:middle line:10%
And he actually is the one who
introduced me to Richard Fuisz.

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:53.300 align:middle line:10%
Paul had been responsible for
outing Oliver North an Iran

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:53.830 align:middle line:10%
contra.

00:35:53.830 --> 00:35:57.540 align:middle line:84%
He played a major role
with Daniel Sheehan

00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:00.935 align:middle line:84%
at the Christic Institute,
providing critical guidance

00:36:00.935 --> 00:36:04.070 align:middle line:84%
at exactly the right point
so that Danny Sheehan could

00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:05.912 align:middle line:90%
launch his brilliant attack--

00:36:05.912 --> 00:36:06.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Indeed.

00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:09.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: -and fantastic
attack on Oliver North.

00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:15.060 align:middle line:84%
And Paul Hoven was part of
something called the Project

00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:17.470 align:middle line:84%
for Military Procurement,
which was exposing

00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:19.870 align:middle line:90%
fraud in the defense budget.

00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And that was intelligence coming
from the Pentagon underground,

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:27.170 align:middle line:84%
who complained that weapons
systems were not properly

00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:31.590 align:middle line:84%
tested, they were
overcharging the military,

00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:34.870 align:middle line:84%
the military was being forced
to buy things they didn't want.

00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:40.490 align:middle line:84%
OK, so Paul was a
whistleblower in his own right.

00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:43.460 align:middle line:84%
But at the time, we
still saw whistleblowers

00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:50.280 align:middle line:84%
as necessary, good, helpful,
protecting democracy.

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:52.760 align:middle line:84%
Whistleblowers were
protecting democracy.

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:56.220 align:middle line:84%
Nowadays if Paul Hoven
outed Oliver North,

00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:58.220 align:middle line:90%
he might get arrested.

00:36:58.220 --> 00:36:59.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:03.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: But I was coming
out of that tradition.

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:05.410 align:middle line:84%
And the tradition
that Paul showed me

00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:12.470 align:middle line:84%
was that it is patriotic to
defend the United States,

00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:15.560 align:middle line:84%
even if you have to
expose unpleasant things.

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:18.160 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you have to
expose what's unpleasant

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:21.840 align:middle line:84%
so you can safeguard your
country and the values,

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:24.420 align:middle line:90%
and to protect the soldiers.

00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:26.830 align:middle line:90%
It's not a malicious thing.

00:37:26.830 --> 00:37:29.600 align:middle line:90%
It's not a hurtful thing.

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:35.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now we get down to
a very terrifying day for you.

00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:37.790 align:middle line:84%
We get an idea of
what you were up to.

00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:39.090 align:middle line:84%
At the very top of
the show, we talked

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:41.090 align:middle line:84%
about what you had already
started hammering out

00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:44.610 align:middle line:84%
on behalf of the people
of both countries.

00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:48.326 align:middle line:84%
And the FBI shows up at
your door, a bunch of them.

00:37:48.326 --> 00:37:50.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Yeah, well.

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:52.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:55.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: 30 days before
my arrest on the Patriot Act,

00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:59.220 align:middle line:84%
I contacted the offices of
Senator John McCain and Senator

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:01.890 align:middle line:84%
Trent Lott and
requested to testify

00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:05.550 align:middle line:84%
on Capitol Hill under
oath about my experiences

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:09.232 align:middle line:84%
as the chief CIA asset covering
Iraq at the United Nations.

00:38:09.232 --> 00:38:10.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's
bring up, there

00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:15.090 align:middle line:84%
were 5,000 CIA assets
that were in operation

00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:17.440 align:middle line:84%
around the world at that
time, but only three

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:18.930 align:middle line:90%
through the Iraqi Embassy.

00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:20.285 align:middle line:90%
And you were one of the three.

00:38:20.285 --> 00:38:21.330 align:middle line:90%
All three of you were arrested.

00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:21.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: All three of us.

00:38:21.810 --> 00:38:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we'll talk
about that in a bit.

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:24.510 align:middle line:84%
So there weren't
very many of you

00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:26.192 align:middle line:84%
that had access to
this information.

00:38:26.192 --> 00:38:27.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Absolutely.

00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:29.439 align:middle line:84%
And I was the most
senior of the lot.

00:38:29.439 --> 00:38:29.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:33.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: The others
were the sons of diplomats

00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:38.080 align:middle line:84%
and they had special access,
but they were very young.

00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:39.610 align:middle line:90%
They were in their 20s.

00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And by this time, I'd worked
in anti-terrorism for a decade,

00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:46.920 align:middle line:84%
and I was very
proud and I wanted

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:49.010 align:middle line:90%
to testify about my experiences.

00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And George Bush had just
appointed the Presidential

00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:54.130 align:middle line:84%
Commission on Iraqi
Prewar Intelligence,

00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:56.480 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to tell
what really happened.

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:59.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you approached
Lott and McCain's offices.

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: That was
the appropriate way.

00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:06.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, I am a huge supporter
of Bradley Manning,

00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:07.830 align:middle line:90%
OK, and WikiLeaks.

00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:09.830 align:middle line:90%
I believe in democracy.

00:39:09.830 --> 00:39:12.480 align:middle line:84%
I believe in the rights of
the people to know the truth.

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:13.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:15.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: But
at the same time,

00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:18.530 align:middle line:84%
I did not pull a Bradley Manning
and go straight to the media.

00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:20.090 align:middle line:84%
I did not know
how at that point.

00:39:20.090 --> 00:39:21.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You went
through the right channels

00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:23.614 align:middle line:84%
that you knew to be the
right channels at that time.

00:39:23.614 --> 00:39:25.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: People say why
did you go to Trent Lott?

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:27.885 align:middle line:84%
It was like that was
the way you did it.

00:39:27.885 --> 00:39:28.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:30.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: If you wanted
to testify on Capitol Hill,

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:32.830 align:middle line:84%
you went to the people who
controlled the testimony.

00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:33.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:35.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: I had
never expected--

00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:37.880 align:middle line:84%
I knew that I was going to
make them uncomfortable.

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:40.140 align:middle line:84%
I also expected to
be very professional

00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:44.580 align:middle line:84%
in how I handled my situation,
myself in this light.

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:47.810 align:middle line:84%
But I believed the people had a
right to know and I was coming.

00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:52.500 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, Oliver
North and I was

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:55.510 align:middle line:84%
from a tradition of the
intelligence community that's

00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:59.810 align:middle line:84%
very proud that you
protect America first,

00:39:59.810 --> 00:40:01.730 align:middle line:84%
and you're protecting
the society,

00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:05.160 align:middle line:84%
you're protecting-- that if you
tell an uncomfortable truth,

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:08.200 align:middle line:84%
sometimes you have to do those
things to protect the greater

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:09.030 align:middle line:90%
good.

00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:12.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So under that spirit,
you went to these offices

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:14.400 align:middle line:84%
and it was no time flat
after you approached them.

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: 30 days
later, I woke up

00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:21.040 align:middle line:84%
to hear the FBI pounding on my
door with an arrest warrant.

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And I thought they
had made a mistake.

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:25.160 align:middle line:84%
I was like, what
are you doing here?

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:25.555 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:40:25.555 --> 00:40:27.240 align:middle line:84%
In your book, you
were saying, I've only

00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:29.100 align:middle line:84%
had a couple
speeding infractions,

00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:31.090 align:middle line:90%
minor, I mean, what did I do?

00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:32.750 align:middle line:90%
You really didn't know?

00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:35.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: I had no
idea, had no idea.

00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you're under
arrest on the Patriot Act.

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:41.270 align:middle line:84%
And then I knew whatever
it was, it was very bad.

00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:44.480 align:middle line:84%
But even then, even when
he told me Susan Lindauer,

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:46.670 align:middle line:84%
you're under arrest
on the Patriot Act,

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:49.881 align:middle line:90%
I was like what does that mean?

00:40:49.881 --> 00:40:51.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
what does that mean?

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:52.713 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: What does that mean?

00:40:52.713 --> 00:40:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And the problem
is the Patriot Act

00:40:54.830 --> 00:40:59.690 align:middle line:84%
is now a protocol for how
to handle national security

00:40:59.690 --> 00:41:04.370 align:middle line:84%
cases where you are dealing with
unpleasant intelligence that

00:41:04.370 --> 00:41:07.510 align:middle line:90%
will not hurt the people.

00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:09.950 align:middle line:84%
I absolutely deny
that anything I

00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:12.780 align:middle line:84%
would have told the American
people would have hurt them.

00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:15.400 align:middle line:84%
It wouldn't hurt
the politicians who

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:17.410 align:middle line:84%
were trying to
escape responsibility

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:18.930 align:middle line:90%
for what they had done.

00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:23.780 align:middle line:84%
Congress was cowardly, and these
are Republicans and Democrats

00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:30.170 align:middle line:84%
alike, were ashamed to take
responsibility for the actions.

00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:32.200 align:middle line:84%
They did not have the
courage of conviction

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:34.180 align:middle line:84%
to stand by their
decision to send

00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:36.160 align:middle line:90%
American soldiers into war.

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:39.040 align:middle line:84%
Colin Powell, whom
I had warned, I

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:41.810 align:middle line:84%
had pleaded with him
that the Iraqi exiles

00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:43.210 align:middle line:90%
were totally untrustworthy.

00:41:43.210 --> 00:41:46.330 align:middle line:84%
I said it is my professional
assessment as the asset who

00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:49.070 align:middle line:84%
has been covering this, Iraq has
been trying to get the weapons

00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:51.730 align:middle line:84%
inspectors in for the
past 2 and 1/2 years,

00:41:51.730 --> 00:41:53.740 align:middle line:90%
and they have nothing to hide.

00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:55.487 align:middle line:84%
They've always said
that this could

00:41:55.487 --> 00:41:56.820 align:middle line:90%
start within two to three weeks.

00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:58.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we all remember
at his famous press conference,

00:41:58.590 --> 00:42:01.050 align:middle line:84%
he lied through his teeth
to the American public.

00:42:01.050 --> 00:42:02.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: And lied
to American soldiers.

00:42:02.830 --> 00:42:03.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And the soldiers.

00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:05.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: He should have
been court martialed for it.

00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:06.861 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He should have.

00:42:06.861 --> 00:42:09.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: Because his
lies, his deception,

00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:13.280 align:middle line:84%
harmed American soldiers who
were asked to go fight and die.

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:14.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You bet.

00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:15.696 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: And if
you're going to court

00:42:15.696 --> 00:42:19.440 align:middle line:84%
martial a military officer
for having an affair,

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:23.340 align:middle line:84%
an adulterous affair,
which is nonsense, garbage.

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:25.710 align:middle line:84%
You're going to force
General Petraeus to resign

00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:27.170 align:middle line:90%
from the head of the CIA?

00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:28.320 align:middle line:90%
That's a coup.

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:34.770 align:middle line:84%
General Allen has been
asked not to submit his name

00:42:34.770 --> 00:42:36.980 align:middle line:90%
to head the NATO forces.

00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:39.210 align:middle line:84%
These are illustrious
generals, who

00:42:39.210 --> 00:42:40.930 align:middle line:84%
whether you like
the military or not,

00:42:40.930 --> 00:42:43.810 align:middle line:90%
they've done-- they're leaders.

00:42:43.810 --> 00:42:46.090 align:middle line:84%
They're the best of America
and we're destroying them

00:42:46.090 --> 00:42:49.700 align:middle line:84%
over stupid adulterous
claims of adultery.

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:56.760 align:middle line:84%
But then you have Colin Powell,
whose malicious lies result

00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:58.660 align:middle line:84%
in the deaths of
American soldiers

00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:01.040 align:middle line:84%
and you don't do
anything to him at all.

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:03.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, so here we go.

00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:04.580 align:middle line:90%
Now your journey begins.

00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:07.610 align:middle line:84%
They did nothing,
you were arrested.

00:43:07.610 --> 00:43:11.560 align:middle line:84%
Now during the arrest, if I
recall correctly in your book,

00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:14.590 align:middle line:84%
Paul Hoven had told you
if anything ever goes down

00:43:14.590 --> 00:43:17.411 align:middle line:84%
or goes wrong, scream at
the top of your lungs.

00:43:17.411 --> 00:43:17.910 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:18.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Yes.

00:43:18.130 --> 00:43:19.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you did.

00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:20.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Yes, I did.

00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:23.940 align:middle line:84%
When they took me
out in handcuffs,

00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:26.140 align:middle line:90%
they took me for the perp walk.

00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:31.730 align:middle line:84%
And the FBI opened the door and
there were a few cameras there

00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:35.820 align:middle line:84%
and I shouted, I
said, I am innocent.

00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:38.290 align:middle line:84%
I am a lifelong peace
activist and everything

00:43:38.290 --> 00:43:42.030 align:middle line:84%
I've done-- I've done more on
anti-terrorism than anybody

00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:44.920 align:middle line:84%
else, and everything
I have done was always

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:46.905 align:middle line:84%
good for the security
of the United States

00:43:46.905 --> 00:43:48.780 align:middle line:84%
and good for the security
of the Middle East.

00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:49.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To make sure
the cameras got that.

00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:52.278 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: To make sure that
the American people got that.

00:43:52.278 --> 00:43:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And what Americans
didn't realize was,

00:43:54.310 --> 00:43:55.269 align:middle line:90%
that was actually true.

00:43:55.269 --> 00:43:55.893 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:55.893 --> 00:43:58.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: That was not
even an exaggeration.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.870 align:middle line:84%
By that time, I had worked
on every single terrorism

00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:04.430 align:middle line:84%
case going back to the '93
World Trade Center attack.

00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:06.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
they hauled you off.

00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:09.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: Hauled me off
and immediately the Bush

00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:12.990 align:middle line:84%
administration-- now realize,
my cousin was the Chief of Staff

00:44:12.990 --> 00:44:15.710 align:middle line:84%
to George Bush, and
within hours they

00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:19.400 align:middle line:84%
knew they had made a terrible
mistake because I would have

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:22.890 align:middle line:84%
been-- the tragedy
is, and I've got

00:44:22.890 --> 00:44:25.120 align:middle line:84%
to make a pitch for
WikiLeaks and Julian

00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:28.380 align:middle line:84%
Assange and poor Bradley
Manning right now.

00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:31.150 align:middle line:84%
I had been raised as a
child of the black ops,

00:44:31.150 --> 00:44:33.370 align:middle line:84%
I was a creature
of the black ops.

00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:40.100 align:middle line:84%
I had no capability to deal
with corporate media, CNN.

00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:43.030 align:middle line:84%
I needed a Julian
Assange and WikiLeaks.

00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:45.570 align:middle line:84%
For those of you who
hate WikiLeaks, just

00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:49.130 align:middle line:84%
realize that those of
us who are indoctrinated

00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:54.050 align:middle line:84%
in the cult of CIA, it is a
cult of national security,

00:44:54.050 --> 00:44:57.050 align:middle line:84%
it is a cult of
paranoia where you're

00:44:57.050 --> 00:45:00.230 align:middle line:84%
trained to question whether
the American people are

00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:04.280 align:middle line:84%
capable of understanding
what's happening around them.

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's very insulting
to the American people

00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:09.219 align:middle line:84%
to say that we know better
than you and we're going

00:45:09.219 --> 00:45:11.510 align:middle line:84%
to make this decision as to
whether you can handle this

00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:11.950 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:45:11.950 --> 00:45:12.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:13.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: So we needed--

00:45:13.090 --> 00:45:14.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very arrogant.

00:45:14.090 --> 00:45:16.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: Very, very
arrogant and stupid.

00:45:16.450 --> 00:45:18.510 align:middle line:84%
We are dumbing
down our population

00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:20.730 align:middle line:84%
in the name of
national security.

00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:26.880 align:middle line:84%
It is vastly superior if
the American people have

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:30.797 align:middle line:84%
a knowledge of the issues and
you can make educated choices.

00:45:30.797 --> 00:45:32.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They think
that people don't

00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:34.744 align:middle line:84%
have any understanding
that is nuanced.

00:45:34.744 --> 00:45:35.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Yes.

00:45:35.410 --> 00:45:37.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's going
to be fundamentalist

00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:38.726 align:middle line:90%
in nature, the reactions.

00:45:38.726 --> 00:45:40.100 align:middle line:84%
They don't give
people any credit

00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:42.700 align:middle line:84%
for looking at a complex
array of variables involved

00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:46.030 align:middle line:84%
in any of these situations and
a complex array of options,

00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:48.624 align:middle line:84%
so they just say,
stamp it stupid, right?

00:45:48.624 --> 00:45:49.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Yes.

00:45:49.290 --> 00:45:50.410 align:middle line:90%
Stamp it stupid.

00:45:50.410 --> 00:45:52.990 align:middle line:84%
That's the best way-- that's
a very good expression,

00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:54.630 align:middle line:90%
stamp it stupid.

00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:56.140 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly what happens.

00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:58.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now,
it's not convenient

00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:00.699 align:middle line:84%
for you to be talking
about this publicly now.

00:46:00.699 --> 00:46:01.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Well, no, no.

00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:04.190 align:middle line:90%
I needed a Julian Assange.

00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:05.910 align:middle line:84%
Even if you don't
like-- for those of you

00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:07.410 align:middle line:84%
in your audience
who don't like him,

00:46:07.410 --> 00:46:09.160 align:middle line:84%
I realize he's
very controversial.

00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:10.720 align:middle line:84%
You'd be surprised
how many people

00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:14.500 align:middle line:84%
are really angry at WikiLeaks
for telling us what we know.

00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:17.690 align:middle line:84%
But the facts are
that somebody like me

00:46:17.690 --> 00:46:21.710 align:middle line:84%
needs a Julian Assange
to walk us through it.

00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And Julian Assange and
the WikiLeaks people

00:46:24.610 --> 00:46:25.380 align:middle line:90%
have the skills--

00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:27.421 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Too bad you
didn't have him in the day.

00:46:27.421 --> 00:46:29.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: Oh, if I
had him in the day,

00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:33.670 align:middle line:84%
you would have known about
the 9/11 warnings in advance.

00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:36.150 align:middle line:84%
You would've-- you,
the people, the public,

00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:38.930 align:middle line:84%
the electorate would have
had knowledge to make better

00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:41.160 align:middle line:84%
choices in your own
decision making.

00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:44.590 align:middle line:84%
You would-- you would have known
about the Iraqi peace option.

00:46:44.590 --> 00:46:47.150 align:middle line:84%
You would have had the power
to force the government

00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:49.034 align:middle line:90%
to accept it, or to improve it.

00:46:49.034 --> 00:46:49.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:51.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: If there was
more that you wanted,

00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:53.780 align:middle line:84%
you would have been able to
articulate what that was.

00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:54.446 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:46:54.446 --> 00:46:57.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: But you would've
had the full knowledge and all

00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:59.690 align:middle line:84%
the power that comes
with that knowledge.

00:46:59.690 --> 00:47:01.267 align:middle line:90%
Knowledge is power, believe me.

00:47:01.267 --> 00:47:03.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Instead, we
were kept in the dark.

00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:06.500 align:middle line:84%
Now the Bush
administration sees oops,

00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:08.350 align:middle line:84%
maybe they shouldn't
have moved in on her.

00:47:08.350 --> 00:47:08.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Yes.

00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:09.306 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:47:09.306 --> 00:47:09.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Yes.

00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
they did something

00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:15.390 align:middle line:90%
that I consider unforgivable.

00:47:15.390 --> 00:47:17.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you bring
charges against somebody,

00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:20.810 align:middle line:84%
that individual has
a God given right

00:47:20.810 --> 00:47:24.080 align:middle line:84%
to have a trial in any
country of the world.

00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:26.230 align:middle line:90%
And a trial is very unpleasant.

00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:29.660 align:middle line:84%
It is a very scary thing
to be accused of treason,

00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:31.520 align:middle line:84%
and to be accused
of-- but treason,

00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:34.720 align:middle line:84%
as Cardinal Richelieu put it,
treason is a matter of dates

00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:36.490 align:middle line:90%
as my case proves.

00:47:36.490 --> 00:47:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Or in this case,
a matter of hours.

00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:42.180 align:middle line:84%
Because they realized that no
sooner had they arrested me,

00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:45.300 align:middle line:84%
than they realized that
once my story got out,

00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:47.440 align:middle line:84%
the people would
gain-- the trial

00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:49.190 align:middle line:84%
would be the best thing
that could happen.

00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:49.856 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:47:49.856 --> 00:47:53.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: Because I would
stand there and face everyone,

00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:54.810 align:middle line:90%
face the community.

00:47:54.810 --> 00:47:58.330 align:middle line:84%
And we would call witnesses,
we'd have subpoena power.

00:47:58.330 --> 00:48:01.320 align:middle line:84%
We could run our very own
investigation right live

00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:02.284 align:middle line:90%
on Court TV.

00:48:02.284 --> 00:48:02.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:05.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: And the American
people would get an eye opener.

00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:07.780 align:middle line:84%
They would learn about
the 9/11 warnings.

00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:09.760 align:middle line:84%
They would learn about
the peace option.

00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:14.270 align:middle line:84%
They would be able to say-- it
wasn't the place I would have

00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:16.280 align:middle line:84%
chosen to do it,
but a courtroom is

00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:20.724 align:middle line:84%
very effective for addressing
these issues as well.

00:48:20.724 --> 00:48:21.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:24.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: And so George Bush
and my own cousin, Andy Card,

00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:28.820 align:middle line:84%
decided that they--
within hours,

00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:33.440 align:middle line:84%
they decided they would paint
me as a psychiatric case.

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:39.290 align:middle line:84%
And I was-- no sooner did I
get to my bail arraignment

00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:44.620 align:middle line:84%
than they made the announcement
that I had threatened suicide,

00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:47.320 align:middle line:90%
which was an absolute lie.

00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:48.740 align:middle line:90%
Never in my life.

00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:50.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
not your nature.

00:48:50.330 --> 00:48:51.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Not even.

00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:52.620 align:middle line:90%
Oh my heavens.

00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And if anybody ever hears
that I've committed suicide,

00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:58.380 align:middle line:84%
let me just tell you
that's such garbage.

00:48:58.380 --> 00:49:01.970 align:middle line:84%
If you hear that I'm dead and
they try to pass this off,

00:49:01.970 --> 00:49:05.440 align:middle line:84%
just remember I have fought with
my-- I've ripped, I've torn,

00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:09.750 align:middle line:84%
I've fought with my
teeth and my fingernails,

00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:12.770 align:middle line:84%
and I've cut off a
piece of his ear.

00:49:12.770 --> 00:49:13.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You have.

00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:14.600 align:middle line:90%
You have.

00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:16.141 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: Anyone
who comes after me

00:49:16.141 --> 00:49:17.457 align:middle line:90%
is gonna lose a body part.

00:49:17.457 --> 00:49:18.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:19.607 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: It
will never happen.

00:49:19.607 --> 00:49:21.440 align:middle line:84%
Even on my worst day,
it would never happen.

00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:22.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So they accused you.

00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:23.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: They
accused me of being

00:49:23.930 --> 00:49:26.320 align:middle line:84%
suicidal several weeks
before my arrest.

00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:27.990 align:middle line:90%
I laughed.

00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:32.630 align:middle line:84%
I roared with laughter in the
courtroom, because I said,

00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:34.760 align:middle line:84%
you must have the
wrong Susan Lindauer

00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:37.380 align:middle line:84%
because I would never--
never in my lifetime.

00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:39.400 align:middle line:90%
I welcome this opportunity.

00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:40.675 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to beat the--

00:49:40.675 --> 00:49:41.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Out of you.

00:49:41.550 --> 00:49:42.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: -out of you.

00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:44.290 align:middle line:90%
You're going to pay for this.

00:49:44.290 --> 00:49:48.840 align:middle line:84%
And I had already realized
several hours after my arrest

00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:51.410 align:middle line:84%
that I was now in
control of the situation

00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:54.650 align:middle line:84%
and that they were going to have
to-- not that I was in-- no,

00:49:54.650 --> 00:49:56.515 align:middle line:84%
I was not in control
of the situation,

00:49:56.515 --> 00:49:58.140 align:middle line:84%
but I was going to
be able to give them

00:49:58.140 --> 00:49:59.669 align:middle line:90%
a beating very publicly.

00:49:59.669 --> 00:50:00.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So you thought.

00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:01.751 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: So I thought.

00:50:01.751 --> 00:50:04.210 align:middle line:84%
And they had realized
it too, so they demanded

00:50:04.210 --> 00:50:06.580 align:middle line:84%
that my bail would require
a psych evaluation.

00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:10.110 align:middle line:90%


00:50:10.110 --> 00:50:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And they made up a story
that I was suicidal,

00:50:13.450 --> 00:50:14.660 align:middle line:90%
and I said that's garbage.

00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:16.990 align:middle line:84%
I went in and I told
the psychiatrist

00:50:16.990 --> 00:50:19.350 align:middle line:84%
that I was absolutely
not suicidal

00:50:19.350 --> 00:50:20.745 align:middle line:84%
and that it was
a political case.

00:50:20.745 --> 00:50:24.400 align:middle line:90%


00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:29.240 align:middle line:84%
The psychiatrist recommended
that I have six to eight weeks

00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:33.310 align:middle line:84%
of counseling, just to see how
I handled my indictment in case

00:50:33.310 --> 00:50:34.080 align:middle line:90%
it upset me.

00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:36.500 align:middle line:84%
I had never been under
arrest before in my life.

00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:37.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It would be upsetting.

00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: And I had no
idea how I would respond.

00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:40.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:50:40.030 --> 00:50:42.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: But I said this
is just ridiculous garbage.

00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And they said, so they--
but by the time they

00:50:45.110 --> 00:50:48.140 align:middle line:84%
got me in front
of Judge Mukasey,

00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:53.350 align:middle line:84%
they decided that I would have
to have psychology counseling

00:50:53.350 --> 00:50:55.040 align:middle line:90%
right up until the trial.

00:50:55.040 --> 00:51:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And so they had done their best
to slam, defame my reputation.

00:51:02.310 --> 00:51:05.870 align:middle line:84%
But the more they
looked at the evidence,

00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:08.390 align:middle line:84%
they found that they
had no evidence.

00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:10.250 align:middle line:84%
They could now-- I
was like unbending.

00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:12.380 align:middle line:90%
I was like unyielding.

00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:13.840 align:middle line:84%
I told them I would
never give them

00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:16.140 align:middle line:84%
a guilty plea under
any circumstances

00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:19.860 align:middle line:84%
and that I was happy to fight
every single charge against me

00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:23.790 align:middle line:84%
in court, and they could drop
the charges or go to trial.

00:51:23.790 --> 00:51:26.190 align:middle line:90%
And then they had a problem.

00:51:26.190 --> 00:51:31.710 align:middle line:84%
Congress, the war in Iraq was
going very, very, very, very

00:51:31.710 --> 00:51:38.321 align:middle line:84%
badly, and Congress decided that
they were going to blame me.

00:51:38.321 --> 00:51:39.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As an
asset, that was part

00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:43.710 align:middle line:84%
of the report on the poor
intelligence on the ground.

00:51:43.710 --> 00:51:46.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: Poor
intelligence on the ground

00:51:46.110 --> 00:51:49.050 align:middle line:84%
was responsible for the
mistakes on Capitol Hill.

00:51:49.050 --> 00:51:50.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:53.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: Jane Harman,
who was a Democrat, who

00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:58.510 align:middle line:84%
chaired the House Intelligence
Committee as a Democrat,

00:51:58.510 --> 00:52:02.180 align:middle line:84%
declared that if assets had
only spoken up and corrected

00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:06.270 align:middle line:84%
mistakes in the intelligence,
the Congress would never

00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:08.390 align:middle line:84%
have rushed into
this terrible war.

00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And that if our intelligence
was being wrongly misreported,

00:52:14.070 --> 00:52:15.410 align:middle line:90%
that we had failed.

00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:20.700 align:middle line:84%
And what you again didn't
know was that I had written,

00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:25.810 align:middle line:84%
as an anti-war activist, I
had written dozens of papers

00:52:25.810 --> 00:52:28.700 align:middle line:84%
and distributed
them throughout--

00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:30.630 align:middle line:84%
I started something
called the Citizens

00:52:30.630 --> 00:52:34.075 align:middle line:84%
for Public Integrity I
was so offended about 9/11

00:52:34.075 --> 00:52:35.050 align:middle line:90%
and the lies.

00:52:35.050 --> 00:52:37.770 align:middle line:84%
I called it Citizens
for Public Integrity,

00:52:37.770 --> 00:52:43.700 align:middle line:84%
and I had blasted Congress
with anti-war papers explaining

00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:46.760 align:middle line:84%
all the problems and mistakes
that would come from this war.

00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:49.097 align:middle line:84%
And so again, you
had the Congress--

00:52:49.097 --> 00:52:49.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They knew.

00:52:49.930 --> 00:52:50.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: They knew.

00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:52.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The CIA knew, the
Justice Department knew,

00:52:52.660 --> 00:52:55.710 align:middle line:84%
the Office of
Counter-terrorism knew.

00:52:55.710 --> 00:52:57.130 align:middle line:90%
Everybody knew.

00:52:57.130 --> 00:52:59.199 align:middle line:84%
They all had
advantage of knowledge

00:52:59.199 --> 00:53:00.740 align:middle line:84%
of the intelligence
you had gathered.

00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:01.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Absolutely.

00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:02.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So this is all a lie.

00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:04.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: And they knew
about the 9/11 warnings.

00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:04.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:53:04.650 --> 00:53:07.108 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: And I was ready to
talk about the 9/11 warnings

00:53:07.108 --> 00:53:08.010 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:53:08.010 --> 00:53:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And so you have all
of these things,

00:53:10.590 --> 00:53:14.530 align:middle line:84%
and so-- but Congress
was determined

00:53:14.530 --> 00:53:16.779 align:middle line:84%
to blame the assets
for bad intelligence.

00:53:16.779 --> 00:53:18.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now
they have a problem.

00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:18.920 align:middle line:90%
Just as--

00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:19.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: An absolute lie.

00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:20.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -this
comes up, now they

00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:24.000 align:middle line:84%
have to somehow
impugn your character.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.870 align:middle line:84%
And so we have a
complex situation.

00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:29.680 align:middle line:84%
If you testify, meaning
if there's a trial,

00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:31.130 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
blow the whistle.

00:53:31.130 --> 00:53:33.664 align:middle line:84%
You're going to say hello,
you guys already know this

00:53:33.664 --> 00:53:34.955 align:middle line:90%
and you're going to tell what--

00:53:34.955 --> 00:53:36.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: And
I'm going to prove.

00:53:36.210 --> 00:53:36.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
going to prove it,

00:53:36.700 --> 00:53:37.770 align:middle line:90%
and you had a lot of witnesses.

00:53:37.770 --> 00:53:38.978 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: -the accusations.

00:53:38.978 --> 00:53:42.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, the accusations
themselves that I was a quote,

00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:48.430 align:middle line:84%
Iraqi agent, accused me of
telling Congress and Colin

00:53:48.430 --> 00:53:52.114 align:middle line:84%
Powell and Andy Card that
the war would be catastrophic

00:53:52.114 --> 00:53:54.030 align:middle line:84%
and there'd be no weapons
of mass destruction.

00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:54.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:56.860 align:middle line:84%
You called exactly what
the ramifications would be.

00:53:56.860 --> 00:53:58.490 align:middle line:90%
And I saw that document.

00:53:58.490 --> 00:54:01.850 align:middle line:84%
So you have people ready to
corroborate your story, people

00:54:01.850 --> 00:54:04.120 align:middle line:84%
who are highly credible
and at high levels.

00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:07.840 align:middle line:84%
Plus, you had your
handlers, your CIA handlers.

00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:09.570 align:middle line:84%
So they couldn't
let you go to trial.

00:54:09.570 --> 00:54:11.060 align:middle line:10%
>>LINDAUER: There's
even a letter

00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:13.070 align:middle line:10%
that I gave to Colin Powell.

00:54:13.070 --> 00:54:15.462 align:middle line:10%
All of this would have
been released at trial,

00:54:15.462 --> 00:54:17.170 align:middle line:10%
and it would have been
shown to the media

00:54:17.170 --> 00:54:23.190 align:middle line:10%
and it would've been a very
lively jury deliberations.

00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:26.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, and this was not
going to be allowed to happen.

00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:29.440 align:middle line:10%
You were not going to
have your say in court.

00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:32.190 align:middle line:10%
This story gets really complex
and it gets really ugly.

00:54:32.190 --> 00:54:35.260 align:middle line:84%
This isn't the ugly--
this is not the ugly part,

00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:37.584 align:middle line:84%
we're just talking about
the run up to what happened.

00:54:37.584 --> 00:54:39.750 align:middle line:84%
They come in-- we only have
about five minutes left,

00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:41.624 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to have
a second conversation

00:54:41.624 --> 00:54:43.850 align:middle line:84%
about your experience
after this.

00:54:43.850 --> 00:54:46.970 align:middle line:84%
So you're arrested, you
go to your arraignment

00:54:46.970 --> 00:54:48.659 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, and
then what happens?

00:54:48.659 --> 00:54:50.075 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: And
then they declared

00:54:50.075 --> 00:54:53.940 align:middle line:84%
that I required a
psychiatric evaluation.

00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And they tell the
media, oh, she's

00:54:56.670 --> 00:54:58.320 align:middle line:84%
just this little
peace activist who

00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:03.110 align:middle line:84%
is a little manic depressive,
she's a little goofy.

00:55:03.110 --> 00:55:07.027 align:middle line:84%
Some people have looked
at the TV series Homeland.

00:55:07.027 --> 00:55:08.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know,
when I watched it,

00:55:08.610 --> 00:55:10.690 align:middle line:84%
because I read your book
a year and a half ago, I

00:55:10.690 --> 00:55:14.130 align:middle line:84%
was thinking about this
and I thought, oh my god.

00:55:14.130 --> 00:55:15.600 align:middle line:90%
This is so similar.

00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:17.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: A number
of people have

00:55:17.230 --> 00:55:20.940 align:middle line:84%
suggested that the character
played by Claire Danes

00:55:20.940 --> 00:55:24.799 align:middle line:84%
might be based on the
perception of what I was.

00:55:24.799 --> 00:55:27.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not the details or
reality, but a perception.

00:55:27.090 --> 00:55:28.256 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Not the reality.

00:55:28.256 --> 00:55:30.020 align:middle line:84%
Not the reality,
but the story that

00:55:30.020 --> 00:55:33.900 align:middle line:84%
was created about me, that
I was some manic depressive,

00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:35.790 align:middle line:90%
insane lunatic.

00:55:35.790 --> 00:55:37.067 align:middle line:90%
How did she get into the CIA?

00:55:37.067 --> 00:55:38.650 align:middle line:84%
How does somebody
who's this unstable.

00:55:38.650 --> 00:55:39.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yet,
nonetheless brilliant

00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:40.900 align:middle line:90%
and you were calling it right.

00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:42.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: And I
was calling it right.

00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:43.555 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Fairness
to the series,

00:55:43.555 --> 00:55:45.770 align:middle line:84%
they do give her that,
that crazy woman.

00:55:45.770 --> 00:55:47.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: Yes,
that crazy woman.

00:55:47.220 --> 00:55:48.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:55:48.820 --> 00:55:51.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we have
about three minutes

00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:52.980 align:middle line:84%
left, let's talk
about how you ended up

00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:56.120 align:middle line:84%
at Carswell, because in
our next conversation

00:55:56.120 --> 00:56:01.090 align:middle line:84%
we're going to talk about the
incredible criminal behavior

00:56:01.090 --> 00:56:06.680 align:middle line:84%
of the psychiatric
industry, the humiliation.

00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:09.520 align:middle line:84%
What you went through
really had me in tears.

00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:12.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: This is
a very scary story.

00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:17.471 align:middle line:84%
After my arrest, I was
free on $500,000 bail

00:56:17.471 --> 00:56:18.720 align:middle line:90%
and I was required to attend--

00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:20.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Funny for a
little peace activist.

00:56:20.450 --> 00:56:20.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Yeah.

00:56:20.730 --> 00:56:20.980 align:middle line:90%
Goofy.

00:56:20.980 --> 00:56:21.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Delusional.

00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:23.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Yeah.

00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And it was just-- I
was required to attend

00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:28.510 align:middle line:84%
these stupid
psychology meetings,

00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:32.050 align:middle line:84%
and every single month,
my psychologist person

00:56:32.050 --> 00:56:34.965 align:middle line:84%
or psychiatrist person
would prepare reports,

00:56:34.965 --> 00:56:37.060 align:middle line:90%
Susan Lindauer is stable.

00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:41.130 align:middle line:84%
No symptoms of psychosis,
no symptoms of mania,

00:56:41.130 --> 00:56:43.150 align:middle line:90%
no symptoms of depression.

00:56:43.150 --> 00:56:44.840 align:middle line:90%
She's perfectly fine.

00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And he documented
this for a year.

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.490 align:middle line:84%
However, at the
same time that he

00:56:50.490 --> 00:56:53.315 align:middle line:84%
was documenting that there
was absolutely nothing

00:56:53.315 --> 00:56:53.940 align:middle line:90%
wrong with me--

00:56:53.940 --> 00:56:54.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Who was this?

00:56:54.990 --> 00:56:57.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: This was a man
by the name of Dr. Bruke

00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:01.360 align:middle line:84%
Tedesse from Family Health
Services in Maryland,

00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:03.640 align:middle line:84%
a local guy who
was not political.

00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:04.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:06.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: OK, at the same
time that he was doing that,

00:57:06.970 --> 00:57:12.350 align:middle line:84%
I was summoned to appear for
a major psychiatric evaluation

00:57:12.350 --> 00:57:14.670 align:middle line:90%
in New York.

00:57:14.670 --> 00:57:18.565 align:middle line:84%
And I had a very
famous psychiatrist who

00:57:18.565 --> 00:57:21.280 align:middle line:84%
had been the director
of admissions

00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:28.400 align:middle line:84%
at Bellevue Hospital, who
interviewed me for two hours

00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:33.420 align:middle line:84%
only, and he gave me a
Rorschach Inkblot Test, which

00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:36.890 align:middle line:84%
I proclaimed to be the stupidest
thing I'd ever seen and I said,

00:57:36.890 --> 00:57:38.650 align:middle line:90%
it looks like inkblots to me.

00:57:38.650 --> 00:57:40.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm not impressed by you at all.

00:57:40.450 --> 00:57:42.910 align:middle line:84%
I do not want to use a
psychiatric evaluation.

00:57:42.910 --> 00:57:45.540 align:middle line:84%
I have no intention
of allowing my case

00:57:45.540 --> 00:57:48.920 align:middle line:84%
to be distracted by
stupid psychiatry.

00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:51.580 align:middle line:84%
I have zero tolerance
for this stuff.

00:57:51.580 --> 00:57:52.080 align:middle line:90%
As far--

00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:53.663 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
was his name again?

00:57:53.663 --> 00:57:55.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: Dr.
Sanford Drob, who

00:57:55.900 --> 00:57:57.795 align:middle line:84%
later went to work
in Santa Barbara

00:57:57.795 --> 00:58:00.720 align:middle line:84%
at Fielding Graduate
University teaching

00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:03.249 align:middle line:84%
how to perform
psychiatric evaluations.

00:58:03.249 --> 00:58:05.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So he gave
you your inkblot test.

00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:06.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: He did.

00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote in
the court something

00:58:08.930 --> 00:58:11.140 align:middle line:90%
that horrifies me to this day.

00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:16.110 align:middle line:84%
He said that the desire to
disapprove the allegations

00:58:16.110 --> 00:58:20.350 align:middle line:84%
against me and to prove that
I had been an asset working

00:58:20.350 --> 00:58:23.990 align:middle line:84%
under the supervision of
Dr. Richard Fuisz, that

00:58:23.990 --> 00:58:27.910 align:middle line:84%
in itself qualified
as a mental defect.

00:58:27.910 --> 00:58:32.060 align:middle line:84%
Because I was 95%
convinced of my innocence,

00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:34.210 align:middle line:84%
I could not
appreciate the gravity

00:58:34.210 --> 00:58:36.250 align:middle line:90%
of the charges against me.

00:58:36.250 --> 00:58:40.090 align:middle line:84%
So long as I continued
to demand a trial,

00:58:40.090 --> 00:58:42.400 align:middle line:84%
that the act of
demanding the right

00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:46.720 align:middle line:84%
to challenge the
allegations and to disprove

00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:50.410 align:middle line:84%
the evidence-- in other
words, I wanted to face them,

00:58:50.410 --> 00:58:55.650 align:middle line:84%
he said that in itself qualifies
as a mental defect that

00:58:55.650 --> 00:58:59.526 align:middle line:84%
renders Ms. Lindauer
incapable of standing trial.

00:58:59.526 --> 00:59:00.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, by
now, most people

00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:03.640 align:middle line:84%
should be tearing their hair
out, screaming, laughing,

00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:04.325 align:middle line:90%
or crying.

00:59:04.325 --> 00:59:05.533 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Well, it's Kafka.

00:59:05.533 --> 00:59:07.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's right out
of like Cold War era.

00:59:07.690 --> 00:59:09.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDAUER: The only
thing that would

00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:12.980 align:middle line:84%
make me competent
to stand trial would

00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:15.780 align:middle line:84%
be if I agreed to
take a guilty plea.

00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:16.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not an option.

00:59:16.990 --> 00:59:19.480 align:middle line:84%
We can see that in your
eyes, that wasn't an option.

00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:20.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Never.

00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:21.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And so now--

00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:21.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDAUER: Never.

00:59:21.790 --> 00:59:24.470 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: -they say delusions
of grandeur, making all this up,

00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:26.660 align:middle line:10%
thinks she was a CIA asset and--

00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:28.660 align:middle line:10%
>>LINDAUER: And I said I
was willing to prove it

00:59:28.660 --> 00:59:31.064 align:middle line:10%
because the Justice
Department had documents.

00:59:31.064 --> 00:59:31.730 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:59:31.730 --> 00:59:32.930 align:middle line:10%
>>LINDAUER: The
Justice Department.

00:59:32.930 --> 00:59:33.090 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You could prove it.

00:59:33.090 --> 00:59:33.881 align:middle line:10%
You had everything.

00:59:33.881 --> 00:59:35.480 align:middle line:10%
I mean, just look at the book.

00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:36.930 align:middle line:10%
You can see the proof was there.

00:59:36.930 --> 00:59:39.020 align:middle line:90%
Now, to be continued.

00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:42.120 align:middle line:84%
As unfair as all of this
sounds, up to this point,

00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:44.880 align:middle line:84%
nothing topped what happened
in Carswell Federal Prison

00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:46.410 align:middle line:90%
at the hands of a psychiatrist.

00:59:46.410 --> 00:59:48.060 align:middle line:84%
This warrants a
second conversation,

00:59:48.060 --> 00:59:50.760 align:middle line:84%
which we will be having, so keep
an eye out for that interview

00:59:50.760 --> 00:59:51.890 align:middle line:90%
in the near future.

00:59:51.890 --> 00:59:54.240 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, to familiarize
yourself with Susan's case,

00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:56.420 align:middle line:84%
you can find her book
Extreme Prejudice

00:59:56.420 --> 00:59:58.500 align:middle line:90%
on Amazon and other booksellers.

00:59:58.500 --> 01:00:01.050 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
