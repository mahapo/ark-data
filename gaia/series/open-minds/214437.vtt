00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.680 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: The debate
over whether we humans do or do

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.500 align:middle line:10%
not have free will,
thus, choice has raged

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.280 align:middle line:10%
on for thousands of years.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.020 align:middle line:10%
But the conversation intensified
when a book titled "Determined"

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.050 align:middle line:10%
came out in 2023, saying,
we have no free will.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.960 align:middle line:84%
All the major news
outlets picked it up

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.970 align:middle line:84%
and I thought it was
a sad day and decided

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.130 align:middle line:84%
to get more clarification
on this subject

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.050 align:middle line:84%
by talking with Sheila
Gillette and the THEO Group.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.973 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back, Sheila.

00:00:43.973 --> 00:00:45.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEILA GILLETTE:
Thanks, Regina.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.270 align:middle line:90%
So good to see you again.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.130 align:middle line:90%
What a great topic.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.190 align:middle line:90%
It's so good to see you again.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.870 align:middle line:84%
You wrote this book "The
Art of Relationship."

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:52.670 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:59.520 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And I think one of the
most confusing parts of life,

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.860 align:middle line:10%
one of the great conundrums
is we get into relationships

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.730 align:middle line:10%
and then when we
get out, we say,

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.150 align:middle line:10%
what the heck was I thinking?

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.560 align:middle line:90%
How did I--

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.740 align:middle line:90%
I chose that.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.870 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.500 align:middle line:84%
And we start questioning
what we've done, why

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.190 align:middle line:90%
we make the decisions we do.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.000 align:middle line:90%
We do it in a lot of things.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.875 align:middle line:84%
And then when you have something
like this book "Determined"

00:01:21.875 --> 00:01:24.250 align:middle line:84%
come out and say, oh, you
never had a choice in anything.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.690 align:middle line:84%
It was all
predetermined for you.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.090 align:middle line:84%
You were just going to be
there no matter what you did.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.340 align:middle line:90%
And I think, mm.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.680 align:middle line:84%
So first of all,
your book is lovely.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.180 align:middle line:84%
"The Art of
Relationship" is lovely.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.670 align:middle line:10%
And I thought we'd apply
free will to the subject.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.610 align:middle line:84%
So before we go
to the THEO group

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.510 align:middle line:84%
in a little bit, any thoughts
that you have prior to our

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.100 align:middle line:84%
talking with THEO about this
subject, choosing your partner.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.110 align:middle line:10%
>>GILLETTE: Well, it's
first and foremost

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.730 align:middle line:10%
how we feel about ourselves,
how we choose the people

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.240 align:middle line:10%
we're in relationship with.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.100 align:middle line:90%
Everything's relationship-based.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.600 align:middle line:90%
Everything we do.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.920 align:middle line:84%
So to say it's
predetermined, in a way,

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.500 align:middle line:84%
I would agree with
that only because we

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.540 align:middle line:84%
have particular beliefs that
we hold about ourselves that

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.290 align:middle line:84%
keep repeating a similar
pattern over and over again

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.110 align:middle line:90%
until we change the belief.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.590 align:middle line:10%
And then recognize we
do have the choice,

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:30.630 align:middle line:10%
and we can choose not to
be in that pattern of lack

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.380 align:middle line:10%
of self-worth and know
that we deserve love,

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.850 align:middle line:10%
to love and be loved, and
that's loving ourselves.

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And when we can love
ourselves, our whole life

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.500 align:middle line:84%
changes in all of our
relationships, in everything

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.860 align:middle line:90%
that we choose.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:54.690 align:middle line:84%
We become more aware, not
in this myopic vision.

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.150 align:middle line:84%
Our perception can
broaden the aperture

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.200 align:middle line:84%
of our perceptivity broadens,
and we can change those beliefs

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.920 align:middle line:84%
to loving beliefs,
which then attracts more

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.650 align:middle line:90%
opportunity and more choices.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:08.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Indeed.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, this book goes into great
detail, and I give him credit.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.060 align:middle line:90%
He's a neuroscientist.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.290 align:middle line:84%
I give him credit for all
of the past conditioning

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.850 align:middle line:84%
environment, all of
the standard arguments,

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.840 align:middle line:84%
neurochemical responses,
epigenetics, everything,

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.350 align:middle line:90%
he makes all those arguments.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.580 align:middle line:90%
All of them are true.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.220 align:middle line:84%
But what doesn't
happen is there's

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.500 align:middle line:90%
no potential to change that.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.120 align:middle line:84%
There's no potential
to grow beyond it.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: The interesting
thing with scientists,

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.990 align:middle line:84%
they can give you all the data
and all the brain chemistry

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.683 align:middle line:84%
and all that, but they
leave the soul out.

00:03:39.683 --> 00:03:41.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, there's
no soul in this.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: There's
no soul in it.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.620 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like
body, mind, spirit.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.770 align:middle line:90%
We hear that in medicine.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And the spirit's been
left out of that, too.

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.680 align:middle line:84%
That's why functional medicine
is coming on so strongly now,

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.690 align:middle line:84%
because it's inclusive of
our spirituality, our soul,

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.190 align:middle line:84%
participation in our health,
in our relationships,

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.300 align:middle line:90%
in our life explaining it.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's us.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.130 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, this kind of
said it, I think

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.230 align:middle line:90%
it was in the first 50 pages.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.640 align:middle line:84%
When he said, OK, the
subject of consciousness,

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.430 align:middle line:84%
it's like consciousness,
smonsciousness.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.349 align:middle line:90%
What's that?

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:19.149 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:22.500 align:middle line:84%
That's all that was devoted
to consciousness in the book.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.980 align:middle line:90%
But the media loved it.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.990 align:middle line:84%
Every major news outlet picked
that book up at the time,

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.208 align:middle line:90%
and I thought, what the heck?

00:04:29.208 --> 00:04:31.250 align:middle line:84%
You don't see them picking
up anything that would

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.880 align:middle line:90%
say something to the contrary.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.813 align:middle line:84%
A few outlets will
allow articles

00:04:36.813 --> 00:04:38.730 align:middle line:84%
to be printed on the
subject of consciousness.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.910 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes
to free will, that

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.600 align:middle line:84%
should be tantamount importance
in writing a book like that.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.230 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Oh, I think so, too.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:47.813 align:middle line:84%
But that's the old
paradigm, isn't it?

00:04:47.813 --> 00:04:48.613 align:middle line:90%
It's the old--

00:04:48.613 --> 00:04:50.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh,
Newtonian physics and--

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:51.100 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: --belief systems.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And they're
being upended as we

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.150 align:middle line:90%
now in this chaos in the world.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.070 align:middle line:84%
As you know, Regina, we've
known each other a long time.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.580 align:middle line:84%
THEO has been talking about
these changes that are happening

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.070 align:middle line:90%
for five decades now.

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:07.670 align:middle line:90%
Literally.

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.720 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: And it's happening.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
consciousness shift,

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.910 align:middle line:84%
the broadening of the aperture,
the ability to see life not from

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.620 align:middle line:84%
the 3D, the third dimensional
physical reality that's been

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.790 align:middle line:90%
quite harsh on this planet.

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And those patterns
have been passed along

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:27.880 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of years.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.660 align:middle line:84%
That's what's getting changed
now inside of us, but externally

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:33.550 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.150 align:middle line:84%
So of course, those who want
to stay in the old paradigm

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.025 align:middle line:90%
will push against it.

00:05:40.025 --> 00:05:42.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you can find all
the evidence for it because it's

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.028 align:middle line:90%
old, it's existed a long time.

00:05:44.028 --> 00:05:45.320 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Thousands of years.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You just don't
have to-- thousands of years.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.950 align:middle line:84%
You just don't
have to push beyond

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:50.650 align:middle line:90%
to look for the deeper answers.

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:51.450 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:52.940 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's pretty simple.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.620 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, there
are enough scientists

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:55.920 align:middle line:90%
in the world of quantum--

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.980 align:middle line:84%
the field of quantum
mechanics, quantum physics

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.180 align:middle line:84%
that are beginning to
put it all together.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.530 align:middle line:90%
And that is exciting.

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.070 align:middle line:84%
But still, we are
left with the notion

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.440 align:middle line:90%
of how we make these decisions?

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.550 align:middle line:90%
When these decisions begin?

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And then trying to
discover the wherefore

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.750 align:middle line:84%
and why we come together
with very specific people

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.770 align:middle line:84%
in our lives at
very specific times.

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And I have a couple
questions I'll

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.300 align:middle line:84%
end up asking THEO that
are kind of funny, really,

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.420 align:middle line:84%
when you think about
and I want to see

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:24.720 align:middle line:90%
what they have to say about it.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.040 align:middle line:84%
But before we do
that, what was--

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.100 align:middle line:84%
when you wrote the book
"The Art of Relationship",

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.940 align:middle line:84%
did THEO have you
write this book?

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.420 align:middle line:84%
Did he say, you've
got to do this?

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:35.700 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: They did.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:40.530 align:middle line:84%
Because a few years ago, I
would say maybe five years ago,

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:43.700 align:middle line:84%
we said to THEO,
well, what's next?

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:44.940 align:middle line:90%
What do you want?

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.980 align:middle line:90%
What do you want to focus on?

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.770 align:middle line:84%
What do the angels want
to talk to us about?

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:52.130 align:middle line:90%
And they said relationships.

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:56.450 align:middle line:84%
So we created a
relationship retreat.

00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:00.650 align:middle line:84%
And did this whole program
on soul integration

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:04.010 align:middle line:84%
and relationship to
the self and then

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:07.410 align:middle line:84%
how that affects our
relationships with others.

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:09.680 align:middle line:90%
And we film those.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And THEO interacted with
people in those retreats.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:16.590 align:middle line:90%
So we had that film.

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:18.660 align:middle line:90%
And then we took the book.

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.960 align:middle line:84%
There are 12 chapters,
every area of life,

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.440 align:middle line:84%
starting with the
relationship to the self

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.470 align:middle line:84%
first, because that
colors everything.

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:32.640 align:middle line:84%
And then all primary
relationships, children, family,

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.310 align:middle line:90%
work, end of life.

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:39.020 align:middle line:84%
So it touches on
every relationship

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:43.620 align:middle line:84%
we have during our lifetime
and how we interact with it,

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:48.980 align:middle line:84%
how we change those
beliefs and how we end up

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:53.614 align:middle line:84%
being in relationship
in a very integrous way

00:07:53.614 --> 00:07:58.280 align:middle line:84%
and finding those people
that we resonate with.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:03.790 align:middle line:84%
And one of the big
things was core values.

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:08.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if people say,
what are your core values?

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.070 align:middle line:90%
It's how you live your life.

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:14.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, do your core values
match the people you're with?

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.245 align:middle line:90%
Even in work.

00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:19.015 align:middle line:90%


00:08:19.015 --> 00:08:23.490 align:middle line:84%
It's important that the--
that's how businesses succeed

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:25.060 align:middle line:84%
because the people
that work there,

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:27.990 align:middle line:90%
the core values are the same.

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:34.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting as this has
evolved us seeing this play out.

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:38.830 align:middle line:84%
But it's a wonderful book
to touch on all those.

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:39.789 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:40.740 align:middle line:90%
I read it.

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.663 align:middle line:90%
So I can vouch for that.

00:08:42.663 --> 00:08:44.580 align:middle line:84%
So meanwhile, we're going
to look in the piece

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:47.530 align:middle line:84%
that you just talked
about a moment ago,

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:50.910 align:middle line:84%
and that is when we decide
we're ready to start working

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:53.670 align:middle line:84%
on the self-changing,
being able to change

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:58.660 align:middle line:84%
our own perception of self and
identify core values and such.

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:02.530 align:middle line:84%
This really is where we have
freedom to make choices.

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to get through the
subject of free will with them

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:07.300 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of quirky
different ways.

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And so hopefully,
it will augment

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.660 align:middle line:84%
what we already know about
relationship in the book, OK?

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.040 align:middle line:90%
Are you ready to go to THEO?

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:14.840 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: I am.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:15.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:15.950 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Let's do it.

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:16.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All righty.

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:17.508 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Here we go.

00:09:17.508 --> 00:09:31.950 align:middle line:90%


00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:34.240 align:middle line:90%
It is the beginning, is it not?

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.630 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, THEO.

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:40.210 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: We are appreciative
of the opportunity to serve.

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:41.260 align:middle line:90%
You may ask.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:42.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.770 align:middle line:84%
I thought we'd start at
the beginning as you can--

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:50.400 align:middle line:84%
whether we read sci-fi books
or watch sci-fi movies, or even

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.230 align:middle line:84%
in certain philosophical
literature.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:57.880 align:middle line:84%
Earth is often referred to
as the free will planet.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.330 align:middle line:84%
Can you give us a
broader view of what that

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:03.550 align:middle line:90%
means from your point of view?

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:06.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: In the
beginning, the free will

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:11.770 align:middle line:84%
is the choice of each individual
incarnating in the body

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:14.760 align:middle line:84%
that they choose
to incarnate in.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:21.610 align:middle line:84%
So the soul chooses
to be on Earth.

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And you're all lucky
you got a body.

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:25.160 align:middle line:90%
It's like the lottery.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:33.465 align:middle line:84%
There are billions of souls
that are wanting the experience.

00:10:33.465 --> 00:10:34.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I
would assume that

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:38.650 align:middle line:84%
with the privilege of having the
body as the privilege of having

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:42.310 align:middle line:84%
a body in relationship with
another human being, which we'll

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:47.650 align:middle line:84%
get into because it brings so
much experience to the table

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:49.540 align:middle line:90%
of every kind.

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:50.440 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And to have a body, you have
all the sensory perceptivity

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.360 align:middle line:90%
of a body.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:04.450 align:middle line:84%
And the love, the
touch, the experience

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:08.720 align:middle line:84%
of knowing what emotions are,
which is the greater learning.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:15.370 align:middle line:84%
So it is a gift your body, your
Earth vehicle, your Earth suit

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:19.000 align:middle line:90%
is a gift of those experiences.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And so, how--

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.190 align:middle line:84%
OK, now we're incarnating
into a physical body

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:26.840 align:middle line:84%
and we understand that
in many dimensions,

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.320 align:middle line:84%
it's not physical as it
is here, certainly not

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.960 align:middle line:90%
as densely physical.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:35.470 align:middle line:84%
So does free will work in a
similar way in other places

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:38.760 align:middle line:90%
throughout the cosmos?

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:43.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Similarly in
some and not in others.

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:49.925 align:middle line:84%
But the will, as we said,
firstly, is incarnation itself.

00:11:49.925 --> 00:11:51.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hmm-mm.

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:51.880 align:middle line:90%
Huge.

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:52.680 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And your soul is larger
than your physical body.

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:59.700 align:middle line:84%
And what gives your
brain life is your soul.

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:04.120 align:middle line:84%
For an example, if the body
is not working any longer,

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.953 align:middle line:90%
what they would call death.

00:12:05.953 --> 00:12:09.020 align:middle line:90%


00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:14.760 align:middle line:84%
When there's a pronunciation
of death for an individual.

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.960 align:middle line:90%
It's the brain not functioning.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:19.410 align:middle line:90%
Why is it not functioning?

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:21.160 align:middle line:90%
The soul has gone.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:22.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's withdrawn.

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:24.530 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:27.540 align:middle line:90%
So that's the difference.

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:32.525 align:middle line:84%
The soul is the
decider, if you would.

00:12:32.525 --> 00:12:35.160 align:middle line:90%


00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about from your perspective

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:44.100 align:middle line:84%
because we really don't know
much about you and your group

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.360 align:middle line:90%
and how it works where you are.

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Is there any sense
of physicality

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:51.520 align:middle line:90%
in the dimension you're in?

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.920 align:middle line:84%
Do you have physicality
with one another?

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And how does free will
work where you are,

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.280 align:middle line:90%
or is it even necessary?

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.733 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: It's not necessary.

00:13:01.733 --> 00:13:04.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And if you could
tell us a little bit about what

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:05.120 align:middle line:90%
that's like.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:09.220 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So what we
are, are mentors teachers

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:11.690 align:middle line:90%
for the human experience.

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And we get the experience
of physicality through you.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:21.990 align:middle line:84%
You're the courageous
ones, are you not?

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:27.930 align:middle line:84%
But were keen observers of the
experiences of human condition

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:33.320 align:middle line:90%
on Earth and the observers.

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:39.410 align:middle line:84%
That's how we keenly know
how to answer your questions.

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And we know you well because of
your vibration, your frequency,

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:48.790 align:middle line:90%
which is a solid state.

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:52.750 align:middle line:84%
Your soul frequency
is continuous.

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:54.160 align:middle line:90%
It's eternal.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:14:01.420 align:middle line:84%
Your physical vibration can
change, but your soul does not.

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:03.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Have any
in your group ever

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:07.750 align:middle line:84%
taken this wild joy ride of
actually incarnating as a human

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:09.670 align:middle line:90%
into a physical body?

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:13.150 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Some angelic
beings have, yes, we have not.

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:14.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:18.970 align:middle line:84%
So you get a deep enough taste
of it just being around us

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:19.820 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:20.620 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And we resonate on your
vibrational frequency

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:27.750 align:middle line:84%
to know what you
are experiencing.

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:30.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So years
ago, I was listening

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:34.330 align:middle line:84%
to a channeling from my soul
group toward another person,

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:37.260 align:middle line:84%
and I knew a fair amount
about the person getting

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:38.370 align:middle line:90%
the channeling.

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:41.220 align:middle line:84%
And they were having
a lot of trouble

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:44.010 align:middle line:84%
being on Earth in
particularly when

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:48.990 align:middle line:84%
it came to inequity,
unfairness, cruelty,

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:52.200 align:middle line:84%
he would break
down and have to be

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:55.900 align:middle line:84%
taken into a facility
for mental care.

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And this happened
quite a few times

00:14:57.510 --> 00:15:00.280 align:middle line:84%
and he just didn't understand
why he wasn't handling it.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:03.050 align:middle line:84%
And when he had this
channeling, they said,

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:06.450 align:middle line:84%
you are from another place
that is here on Earth.

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:10.620 align:middle line:84%
And examining over
some lifetimes

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:14.670 align:middle line:84%
the value and nature of
free will and whether

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:18.780 align:middle line:84%
or not to bring this back when
you report back to where you're

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:21.580 align:middle line:84%
from, to bring this back
to where you're from

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:25.060 align:middle line:84%
to determine if this is
something that would be desired.

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:26.650 align:middle line:90%
Any thoughts on that?

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:27.550 align:middle line:90%
Does this happen?

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:29.560 align:middle line:84%
Are there other
planets that would like

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:32.000 align:middle line:90%
to play this experience out?

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: There are
billions of planets.

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:38.890 align:middle line:84%
If you look out into your
universe, look at the stars.

00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And now with the
photographs, you can see.

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:50.080 align:middle line:90%
You can see how vast it is.

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:57.470 align:middle line:84%
In your universe, there
are billions of planets

00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:59.900 align:middle line:90%
that could sustain life.

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:02.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And how
many do sustain life

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:05.280 align:middle line:90%
and have species operating?

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:06.760 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Several thousand.

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:07.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Several thousand?

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:08.610 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:09.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:10.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Earth
is only one choice.

00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:11.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And that is also my
understanding that often people

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:19.270 align:middle line:84%
think, what do I
do if I'm not here

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:22.750 align:middle line:84%
when you might say to someone,
you're not stuck here.

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:24.510 align:middle line:90%
This is not a prison planet.

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:26.340 align:middle line:84%
I have a problem
with people write

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:29.080 align:middle line:84%
books about how we're
living on a prison planet,

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.050 align:middle line:90%
and I do not see it that way.

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And not only that,
once you disincarnate,

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:36.030 align:middle line:84%
once you leave the
body, we have choices

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:39.030 align:middle line:84%
to go elsewhere as long as we're
a vibratory match, do we not?

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:40.300 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's to understand
people are thinking

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.240 align:middle line:90%
about the extraterrestrials.

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.040 align:middle line:90%
Do they exist?

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.410 align:middle line:90%
Of course, they do.

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And they've been seen
and we'll be seeing more.

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:56.590 align:middle line:84%
But can you imagine
your neighbor is one?

00:16:56.590 --> 00:17:00.750 align:middle line:84%
Because you all have choices
to be extraterrestrial as well.

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:02.980 align:middle line:84%
Imagine you go to
another planet to them,

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:05.143 align:middle line:84%
you would be an
extraterrestrial.

00:17:05.143 --> 00:17:06.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And does this is--

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:08.319 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: You
find it humorous.

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:10.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, it is humorous.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:16.040 align:middle line:84%
So do people on Earth once
we get out of the body

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.579 align:middle line:84%
and we're away from the strain
and stress of what we've just

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:22.480 align:middle line:84%
been through and have a
chance to look back on it.

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.390 align:middle line:84%
Is-- Does it happen very
often that we would choose

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:28.610 align:middle line:84%
to move on to another
place as a soul

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:30.400 align:middle line:84%
or do most people
incarnating here

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:34.650 align:middle line:84%
continue the pattern
for a good while?

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:36.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Again, it's
not demanded of you.

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:38.252 align:middle line:90%
It's a choice.

00:17:38.252 --> 00:17:41.040 align:middle line:84%
But because once
not embodied, you

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:44.340 align:middle line:84%
realize what an exquisite
opportunity the Earth

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:49.350 align:middle line:84%
is, the beauty of the
planet, and the physicality

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:52.830 align:middle line:84%
and what can be
experienced in the physical

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:59.100 align:middle line:84%
and all of the emotions that can
be experienced are quite unique,

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:05.860 align:middle line:84%
so that's why you keep coming
back to have those experiences.

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:08.750 align:middle line:84%
This is a planet
of great beauty.

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:12.090 align:middle line:84%
And as this
consciousness shifts,

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:14.090 align:middle line:84%
there will be a
greater realization

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:17.900 align:middle line:84%
because that perception
will exist in you.

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:20.780 align:middle line:84%
But, yes, many who
go through challenge

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:25.590 align:middle line:84%
then feel that it
is a punishment.

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:27.870 align:middle line:84%
But that's just a
perception, isn't it?

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:29.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm.

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:32.270 align:middle line:84%
So in the end, after you get
out and get a little rest,

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:33.145 align:middle line:90%
we usually come back.

00:18:33.145 --> 00:18:33.945 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:18:33.945 --> 00:18:36.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS] I think
it's important to get that

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.440 align:middle line:84%
on the table for
people who say--

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:41.410 align:middle line:84%
so many people say, I'm out of
here, I'm never coming back.

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:45.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: That's because their
challenges have been great.

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:49.160 align:middle line:84%
They view them as
challenge and hard.

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:51.370 align:middle line:90%
That perception can change.

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:55.000 align:middle line:84%
If you're challenged, that's
just the curriculum of the life

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.130 align:middle line:90%
that the soul has chosen.

00:18:57.130 --> 00:19:00.050 align:middle line:10%
But in viewing it as
a gift and a blessing,

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:03.940 align:middle line:10%
and what can be learned
from that intensity

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:11.020 align:middle line:10%
can change from suffering
to anticipation, curiosity,

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:13.100 align:middle line:10%
and advancement, and fun.

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:14.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hmm-mm.

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.293 align:middle line:84%
Just by changing their
perception of it.

00:19:16.293 --> 00:19:17.585 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Changing your mind.

00:19:17.585 --> 00:19:18.210 align:middle line:90%
Hmm-mm.

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:19.110 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:22.293 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so, I've often
said when people say I didn't--

00:19:22.293 --> 00:19:23.710 align:middle line:84%
I would not have
chosen this life.

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:24.670 align:middle line:90%
I did not choose this.

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:25.870 align:middle line:90%
This is not for me.

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And I just simply say, well, you
can't stuff a soul in a body.

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:32.830 align:middle line:84%
There has to be an
agreement that goes on.

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:35.950 align:middle line:84%
So this is, I think, where we
begin our free will discussion.

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:37.770 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
the notion no one

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:41.370 align:middle line:84%
can stuff a soul in a
body against its will

00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:44.430 align:middle line:84%
and our choice of
coming in and how

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:48.430 align:middle line:84%
we choose the location,
the astrology, the family,

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:49.270 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:53.010 align:middle line:84%
That's a lot of free will
before we're ever born.

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:55.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It is and
groups incarnate together

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.990 align:middle line:90%
to support each other's growth.

00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:04.060 align:middle line:84%
So those are choices as
well that you meet people

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:07.490 align:middle line:84%
that you know you've
known many times over,

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:11.830 align:middle line:84%
and you can be assured of that
if you have a response to them.

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:14.470 align:middle line:84%
I think in the tens
of thousands of people

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:17.500 align:middle line:84%
one meets in a
lifetime, particularly

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.840 align:middle line:90%
now with all the mobility.

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:23.020 align:middle line:84%
How many are you
truly attracted to?

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:27.580 align:middle line:84%
So those you are attracted to
whether positively or negatively

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:29.860 align:middle line:90%
you've known them before.

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:33.850 align:middle line:84%
Because they've been
a part of that growth

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:38.230 align:middle line:90%
time whenever it was.

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:43.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So is it fair to
say when you are incarnating

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:46.720 align:middle line:84%
as a group where you come
around back and forth together

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.660 align:middle line:84%
over the course of
history that is it

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:53.860 align:middle line:84%
a similar frequency that
you possess that draws

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:58.070 align:middle line:84%
you back together then into
a certain tribe, bloodline,

00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:59.158 align:middle line:90%
location, et cetera?

00:20:59.158 --> 00:21:00.825 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Yes, we
call it soul family.

00:21:00.825 --> 00:21:01.625 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hmm-mm.

00:21:01.625 --> 00:21:02.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, soul family.

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:03.100 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:04.795 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a frequency,
though, it's frequency-based.

00:21:04.795 --> 00:21:05.500 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: It's a vibration.

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:06.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:08.440 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: That's a match.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And so when you are
in relationship,

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:14.090 align:middle line:84%
that's another thing
that you can look at.

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:18.358 align:middle line:84%
Not all of your
relationships are a match.

00:21:18.358 --> 00:21:24.850 align:middle line:84%
And many in mismatched
frequencies often

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:27.920 align:middle line:84%
struggle or have
disagreements and think,

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.160 align:middle line:90%
why did I choose that?

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:34.220 align:middle line:84%
It's you're looking
for the match,

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:38.390 align:middle line:84%
but you cannot match
which is that unknown.

00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:41.290 align:middle line:84%
You need to know what
your frequency is.

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:46.930 align:middle line:84%
And that has to do with your
core values, your vibration,

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:49.810 align:middle line:90%
how much you love yourself.

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And we're not talking about
self-centeredness or narcissism.

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:58.145 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
soul-centered.

00:21:58.145 --> 00:21:58.945 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:21:58.945 --> 00:22:03.280 align:middle line:84%
So now on this journey,
we're going to incarnate.

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.500 align:middle line:90%
We're with our soul family.

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:07.790 align:middle line:84%
We've already chosen the
time and circumstance.

00:22:07.790 --> 00:22:09.980 align:middle line:84%
We're going to connect
with some key figures.

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:12.610 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
what happens when

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:16.120 align:middle line:84%
we're going to connect with very
key figures who we have chosen

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:19.840 align:middle line:84%
to come in and perhaps have an
intimate long-term relationship

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:22.710 align:middle line:84%
with and bring children
into the world with.

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:28.370 align:middle line:84%
Does it often happen before
birth between an arrangement,

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:30.330 align:middle line:84%
between the two souls
before we're born?

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:31.130 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yeah.

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:35.510 align:middle line:84%
So you call them soul
mates, soul travelers.

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:39.560 align:middle line:84%
But it's been
romanticized, hasn't it?

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:43.110 align:middle line:84%
Some of the soul mates could
be your greatest challengers.

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:44.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, indeed.

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:47.060 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:52.280 align:middle line:84%
But there is a desire for
growth and understanding

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:55.670 align:middle line:84%
in this evolutionary
process of consciousness

00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:57.410 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about.

00:22:57.410 --> 00:22:59.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
have the choice still

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.290 align:middle line:84%
in the moment when you
encounter this person,

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:04.190 align:middle line:90%
you all the feelings are there.

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:06.110 align:middle line:90%
You know this is important.

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:08.000 align:middle line:84%
And you can say, I
don't want to do it.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:08.960 align:middle line:90%
Not going there.

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:10.240 align:middle line:90%
You could walk away.

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.238 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: You could.

00:23:11.238 --> 00:23:12.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And people do--

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:13.693 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And
that's free will.

00:23:13.693 --> 00:23:14.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is free will.

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:15.660 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:18.670 align:middle line:84%
Or you can engage and if
it's a challenging one,

00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:20.690 align:middle line:84%
we don't need to ask
the question later.

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:22.090 align:middle line:90%
We chose to engage.

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:23.740 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And through the interaction
and the growth therein

00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:30.470 align:middle line:84%
and the contract
that had been made,

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:35.500 align:middle line:84%
the completion of that
learning, it can be released.

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:39.640 align:middle line:10%
And know with longevity, how
many relationships could one

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:44.560 align:middle line:10%
have, especially when
longevity was 30 years

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:47.660 align:middle line:10%
and now it can be 150.

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:50.402 align:middle line:84%
You can have three
lifetimes in one lifetime.

00:23:50.402 --> 00:23:51.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Getting up to that.

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:54.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: In the
sense of relationships.

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:56.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:56.530 --> 00:23:59.680 align:middle line:90%
I'll pick up on that later--

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:00.820 align:middle line:90%
life spans.

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:03.260 align:middle line:84%
Maybe not in this
conversation, actually,

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:07.130 align:middle line:84%
because what I want to know now
is what it's like for our guides

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:10.520 align:middle line:84%
and what it's like
for our mind/soul

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:15.530 align:middle line:84%
when it's time to bring
two people together.

00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:19.740 align:middle line:84%
I love the idea of films and
novels being written about this.

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:23.180 align:middle line:84%
How is it engineered to
get two people together

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:25.220 align:middle line:84%
at the right moment
to meet when--

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:26.840 align:middle line:84%
maybe they live in
different countries

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:30.420 align:middle line:84%
or halfway around across
their own country.

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:33.260 align:middle line:84%
How challenging is
it from your side

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:35.730 align:middle line:84%
to try to get these
people together?

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:36.840 align:middle line:90%
Is it touch and go?

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:38.770 align:middle line:84%
It seems like it'd
be very touch and go.

00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:40.178 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Not really.

00:24:40.178 --> 00:24:41.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, explain it.

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:45.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: There's time
is not time as you know it

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.980 align:middle line:90%
in a linear senses.

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:51.780 align:middle line:90%
We call it perfect soul time.

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:56.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's often when
you least expect it,

00:24:56.070 --> 00:25:03.510 align:middle line:84%
yes, it's like serendipitous
or coincidental.

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:08.540 align:middle line:84%
We find those words humorous
because they aren't.

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:10.670 align:middle line:90%
They are so planned.

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:14.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And sometimes it can
be almost silly and literal.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:18.360 align:middle line:84%
The father of my son, I won a
lottery ticket for his business.

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:19.610 align:middle line:90%
And I knew I was going to win.

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:21.900 align:middle line:84%
I knew my number was
going to be called,

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:24.890 align:middle line:84%
so it was all lined up
perfectly in that moment

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:26.970 align:middle line:84%
to win the lotto
ticket to connect

00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:29.510 align:middle line:84%
and voila, an impossible
thing happened when

00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:30.952 align:middle line:90%
my son came into the world.

00:25:30.952 --> 00:25:32.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Isn't
that interesting?

00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:33.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hmm-mm.

00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:36.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Yes, but
that's the quantum field

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:38.340 align:middle line:90%
working on your behalf.

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:39.140 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:39.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:41.155 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: What
you call the law

00:25:41.155 --> 00:25:44.090 align:middle line:90%
of attraction or manifestation.

00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:46.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We humans often
say, though, oh, my God,

00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:48.740 align:middle line:84%
what if I hadn't changed
my mind and decided

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:52.043 align:middle line:84%
to go to that event at the last
moment, we would have never met.

00:25:52.043 --> 00:25:53.210 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Not necessarily.

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:56.100 align:middle line:90%


00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:56.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:56.970 --> 00:26:00.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: If it's
meant to happen,

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:03.840 align:middle line:84%
it will and when
you least expect it.

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:06.120 align:middle line:84%
If you didn't go
to the event, you

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:10.210 align:middle line:84%
would bump into
them on the street.

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:11.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And so what aspect
of our being are

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:17.020 align:middle line:84%
we utilizing when we
recognize, this is a deep

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:20.590 align:middle line:84%
and maybe even feels
like a karmic situation

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:22.750 align:middle line:90%
in our understanding of it?

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:25.322 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It's that soul
agreement, soul contract.

00:26:25.322 --> 00:26:28.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's just the feeling,
the strength of the feeling of I

00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:29.140 align:middle line:90%
can't walk away.

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:30.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: It's knowing.

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:32.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:36.740 align:middle line:84%
So when we're engineering
this, as we were going back now

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:38.940 align:middle line:84%
to choosing our
circumstance of birth,

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:45.600 align:middle line:84%
we choose our soul, family,
our location, our bloodline,

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:48.380 align:middle line:84%
and often come back
in because we're still

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:51.030 align:middle line:84%
working on things with
people within that bloodline.

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:52.810 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:55.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how
about the moment

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:57.070 align:middle line:84%
we're born because
a lot of people

00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:59.800 align:middle line:84%
now can interfere
with the moment

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:02.650 align:middle line:90%
a child is going to be born.

00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:04.730 align:middle line:84%
That's all compensated
for already.

00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:06.430 align:middle line:84%
It's already known
that the mother

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:10.870 align:middle line:84%
is going to want to have the
baby early and have a C-sections

00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:13.450 align:middle line:84%
and not have to go through
labor, whatever the woman has

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:14.510 align:middle line:90%
decided.

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:19.240 align:middle line:84%
How important is it that
we get our astrology right?

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:21.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: You will
hear stories also

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:23.440 align:middle line:84%
where they've planned
the timing for the baby

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:25.930 align:middle line:90%
and it comes when it wants to.

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:29.570 align:middle line:84%
If a C-section, as you
put it, is planned,

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:33.970 align:middle line:84%
the baby comes a day
early or so forth.

00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:39.420 align:middle line:84%
So ultimately, the individual
soul chooses its time,

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:44.460 align:middle line:84%
however they get
into the body fully.

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:47.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so, let's look
at that and relationships.

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:50.440 align:middle line:84%
And I bring it up
on a personal level,

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:52.540 align:middle line:84%
puts me in a bit of a
vulnerable position,

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:55.560 align:middle line:84%
but also because I was talking
with a friend who says,

00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:58.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm the woman was
saying, I'm 63 years old.

00:27:58.570 --> 00:28:00.070 align:middle line:90%
I've never been married.

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And the house of marriage and
her astrological chart is empty.

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:05.560 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing there.

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:07.030 align:middle line:90%
And no planets there.

00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:10.840 align:middle line:84%
So what would you
say to that scenario,

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:14.100 align:middle line:84%
if you were looking at
them astrologically?

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:16.800 align:middle line:84%
Is it that's not what
they came to work on

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:19.800 align:middle line:90%
or it's just kind of open-ended?

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:21.570 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: It's open-ended.

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:23.800 align:middle line:84%
But those things
can change as well.

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:28.720 align:middle line:90%
Astrological charting is energy.

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:30.970 align:middle line:90%
And it changes.

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:36.280 align:middle line:10%
If you look at a cartography
map for an individual,

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:41.080 align:middle line:10%
the energy changes
as the Earth turns.

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And so those things that
were predicted at birth

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:50.400 align:middle line:84%
can change over a lifetime,
depending on the energy

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:53.500 align:middle line:90%
and how one works with it.

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:56.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, on a personal
note, I was born with the Sun,

00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:59.760 align:middle line:84%
Venus, Mercury, all in
Scorpio in the seventh house

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:00.560 align:middle line:90%
of marriage.

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:01.840 align:middle line:90%
And I've done that a lot.

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:05.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and I think, am
I a slow learner or what?

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:08.830 align:middle line:84%
Or am I simply
choosing to crunch

00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:11.510 align:middle line:84%
a lot of learning
into one lifetime?

00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's probably a bit
of all of the above.

00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:16.090 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: It is, yes.

00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And some are monogamous and have
one relationship, one marriage

00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:23.380 align:middle line:90%
for an entire lifetime.

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:23.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:24.480 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It's all
the soul's choosing.

00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:27.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:30.140 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people
put judgment on it

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:33.220 align:middle line:84%
if you have not chosen one
person for one lifetime.

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:36.080 align:middle line:84%
That's we need to let go
of these notions as well.

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:36.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.640 align:middle line:84%
Many of the
judgments are falling

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:45.040 align:middle line:84%
to the wayside now for they hold
no energy any longer because

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:48.010 align:middle line:84%
of this shift of
consciousness and awareness

00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:50.800 align:middle line:90%
that is now coming to fruition.

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:58.820 align:middle line:84%
And to see those limiting
perceptions not true anymore.

00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:00.750 align:middle line:90%
Not ever, actually.

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:06.260 align:middle line:84%
But seeing through different
lenses one then knows choice,

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:10.310 align:middle line:90%
knows one's free will.

00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:12.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's the
thing knowing oneself.

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And there, I'm sure I'm not the
only person that's like this.

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:18.380 align:middle line:84%
I think there are a lot of
people like me that in a sense

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:20.820 align:middle line:84%
is very fungible,
it's like, just

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:24.660 align:middle line:84%
like you said, knowing your core
values, knowing who you are,

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:27.330 align:middle line:84%
knowing what you believe
you'll be compatible with.

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:30.140 align:middle line:84%
When you have
people like me, it's

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:32.770 align:middle line:84%
quite different because it's
like, sure, I could do that.

00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:33.570 align:middle line:90%
I can try that.

00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:35.570 align:middle line:90%
I could be that.

00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:37.530 align:middle line:90%
It's like, why not?

00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:39.450 align:middle line:90%
I can do that.

00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's not really
finding your own core.

00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:45.650 align:middle line:84%
It's having this,
I don't even know

00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:51.130 align:middle line:84%
this ability or this
pattern or whatnot

00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:55.545 align:middle line:84%
to flow with whatever is
thinking, I can do that.

00:30:55.545 --> 00:30:57.420 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Well, it's
a curiosity, isn't it?

00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:59.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, it is that.

00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:01.670 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Of life itself.

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And saying yes to life because
life will always want more life

00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:09.150 align:middle line:84%
lived through you
for you as you.

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:09.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:11.670 align:middle line:90%
And that's a good way to put it.

00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:13.860 align:middle line:84%
There is a book written
called the "Yes Man",

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:17.070 align:middle line:84%
which I think is an
absolutely fabulous book.

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's a journalist
wrote it in London

00:31:19.670 --> 00:31:21.480 align:middle line:90%
and his life had closed down.

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:22.920 align:middle line:90%
He was saying no to everything.

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:25.770 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't even go to a
dinner with friends anymore,

00:31:25.770 --> 00:31:27.750 align:middle line:90%
just grumpy and closed down.

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And a man on the bus
looked at him and said,

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:32.970 align:middle line:84%
an Asian man said,
I know your problem.

00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:35.400 align:middle line:90%
You don't say yes to life.

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:37.350 align:middle line:84%
He started saying
yes to everything.

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:39.620 align:middle line:84%
Got him in some pretty
strange circumstances

00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:43.140 align:middle line:84%
by the end of the day, because
anything presented to him,

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:44.670 align:middle line:90%
he said, yes to.

00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:47.700 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, and
I do that a lot.

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:50.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've done that certainly
in all kinds of relationships.

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:53.690 align:middle line:84%
But, yes, it can take
you strange places,

00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:55.340 align:middle line:84%
and you can have
strange experiences

00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:59.220 align:middle line:84%
and strange learnings, but
what you just said is so true

00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:02.110 align:middle line:90%
so much opens up in your field.

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:04.480 align:middle line:90%
It becomes so interesting.

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:06.730 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And that's
what you've come for.

00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:10.360 align:middle line:10%
That's what we're talking
about the myopic view

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:13.090 align:middle line:10%
or opening that
aperture to the broader

00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:16.962 align:middle line:10%
perception of possibility.

00:32:16.962 --> 00:32:18.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you for that.

00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:19.628 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk
about something else

00:32:19.628 --> 00:32:23.860 align:middle line:84%
that is interesting that's
happening now in society.

00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:26.810 align:middle line:84%
People are coming
together and every age,

00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:29.140 align:middle line:84%
we have ways in which
we bring our children

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:35.100 align:middle line:84%
into the world the way their
place is made within a family.

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:38.760 align:middle line:84%
Their chores, responsibilities,
duties, that changes over time.

00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:42.200 align:middle line:84%
But now we're in
a time where there

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:45.890 align:middle line:84%
isn't that kind of
challenge for the children.

00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And parents tend to, you could
say, over give, over, manage.

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing some very
interesting things happen

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:56.440 align:middle line:90%
as a result of this trend.

00:32:56.440 --> 00:33:00.570 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about what
happens if a child doesn't

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:05.100 align:middle line:84%
get the freedom to just be
themselves, feel themselves?

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:10.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: They eventually
will in a later stage of life

00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:13.150 align:middle line:90%
by acting out.

00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:15.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, this
is what I'm speaking

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:16.900 align:middle line:84%
of a lot of articles
are coming out

00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:22.120 align:middle line:84%
now about millennial generation
and Gen Z, as it's called,

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:24.040 align:middle line:84%
choosing to separate
from their families

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:26.395 align:middle line:84%
and not want to be
around them anymore.

00:33:26.395 --> 00:33:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And the parents are very
wounded because they

00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:31.510 align:middle line:84%
think they've literally laid out
the red carpet for their child

00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:32.960 align:middle line:90%
in every way they know how.

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:35.810 align:middle line:84%
Please talk to us a little
bit about this dynamic.

00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:41.760 align:middle line:10%
>>GILLETTE: Every
soul has come to learn

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:44.920 align:middle line:10%
and have their experience.

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:47.750 align:middle line:84%
And the greatest
sin, if there is one,

00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:51.970 align:middle line:84%
is taking away that
opportunity for an individual

00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:56.390 align:middle line:84%
to learn, as you might
say, their lessons.

00:33:56.390 --> 00:33:59.160 align:middle line:90%
Their challenge is a gift.

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:01.160 align:middle line:90%
It's a curriculum of life.

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:07.900 align:middle line:84%
And to take away challenge from
another is not appropriate.

00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:10.820 align:middle line:90%
It's like the butterfly.

00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:15.719 align:middle line:84%
The caterpillar goes
into the chrysalis.

00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:17.190 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:19.900 align:middle line:84%
And then it breaks
out of the chrysalis.

00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:22.650 align:middle line:90%
It looks like it's struggling.

00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:24.389 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:26.620 align:middle line:84%
But if it did not
have that struggle,

00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:30.540 align:middle line:84%
it would not build its
musculature to fly.

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:36.600 align:middle line:84%
So that struggle is
necessary for life itself.

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:43.020 align:middle line:84%
Children need their struggle,
their challenge to grow from--

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:44.560 align:middle line:90%
everybody does.

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:47.583 align:middle line:84%
That's what you have
a human life for.

00:34:47.583 --> 00:34:49.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm watching a
couple little children now.

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:53.370 align:middle line:84%
My little grand nieces
and nephews, darling.

00:34:53.370 --> 00:34:55.650 align:middle line:90%
But they're never alone, never.

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:57.490 align:middle line:84%
They're always
engaging with adults.

00:34:57.490 --> 00:34:59.100 align:middle line:84%
There's always someone
reading to them

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:01.960 align:middle line:84%
or doing something
with them or for them.

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:06.480 align:middle line:84%
And I'm wondering what happens
when you don't have time

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:11.650 align:middle line:84%
to be alone, to be bored, to
observe the world around you?

00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:12.900 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Or to be creative.

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:14.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or to be creative.

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:15.493 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:35:15.493 --> 00:35:17.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And these
are the young ones

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:19.920 align:middle line:84%
that you're speaking
about that wish

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:27.450 align:middle line:84%
to separate from that
suffocation to experience life.

00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:28.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So it's natural.

00:35:28.810 --> 00:35:31.140 align:middle line:84%
It's natural that this is
going to continue happening

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:35.670 align:middle line:84%
until we let them have a little
patch of dirt and go play again.

00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:37.210 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And
that will happen.

00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:38.127 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it will.

00:35:38.127 --> 00:35:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think in some
cases, it's already--

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:42.302 align:middle line:84%
we're starting to see
the beginnings of it.

00:35:42.302 --> 00:35:44.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So the generations
you're speaking about,

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:50.720 align:middle line:84%
the younger generations now will
feel that for their children

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:53.490 align:middle line:84%
and let them do it because
that's what they wanted.

00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:55.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hmm-mm.

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:59.810 align:middle line:90%
So here's another question.

00:35:59.810 --> 00:36:02.200 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people in
the older generations

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:04.100 align:middle line:84%
are watching the
younger generations.

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:07.870 align:middle line:84%
And we're only seeing what
appears to be superficial.

00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:11.300 align:middle line:84%
We know there's depth and a
lot of these beings coming in,

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:14.780 align:middle line:84%
but we see the superficial,
the addiction to social media,

00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:17.080 align:middle line:84%
cell phones where they can't
let their mind just roam

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:19.430 align:middle line:90%
or be free for even a moment.

00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:27.170 align:middle line:84%
What happens here that brings
in the mental acuity, clarity,

00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:30.730 align:middle line:84%
whatever's going to be required
to be a future generation that

00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:34.250 align:middle line:84%
are the leaders,
what intervenes?

00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:36.140 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Their curiosity.

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:41.610 align:middle line:84%
They'll become bored because
there's so much of the same.

00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:42.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good.

00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:45.310 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: There's
nothing different.

00:36:45.310 --> 00:36:49.090 align:middle line:84%
So you speak of the
influences that they

00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:50.680 align:middle line:90%
see on their social media.

00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:52.130 align:middle line:84%
They're all the
same, aren't they?

00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:53.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:53.900 align:middle line:90%
Pretty much.

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:57.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So
it'll become boring.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.890 align:middle line:90%
And they'll become interested.

00:36:58.890 --> 00:37:03.270 align:middle line:84%
For a while, they could
not be in the out of doors.

00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And that was because of the
pandemic, this overprotection.

00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:15.730 align:middle line:84%
But they will want to see
the beauty of the planet

00:37:15.730 --> 00:37:21.070 align:middle line:84%
to have the experience of
the dirt as you say it.

00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:24.760 align:middle line:90%
The creativity is in them.

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:29.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So finally, looking
at this generationally

00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:32.110 align:middle line:84%
and coming in as sole
tribes and coming in

00:37:32.110 --> 00:37:34.870 align:middle line:84%
in certain time periods where
you have the opportunity

00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:37.430 align:middle line:84%
to learn certain
lessons as well.

00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:40.190 align:middle line:84%
The new ones coming in
now the little ones.

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:43.490 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them seem to
be incredibly smart.

00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:45.980 align:middle line:90%
I mean, their brains are lit up.

00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:47.380 align:middle line:90%
And can you talk about--

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:50.670 align:middle line:84%
I think they're now calling
that the alpha-generation after

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:51.470 align:middle line:90%
the Z's.

00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:56.230 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk a little bit about
what these frequencies and times

00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:59.860 align:middle line:84%
are imbuing that youngest
generation with that we

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:01.930 align:middle line:84%
can look forward to and
maybe even incarnate back

00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:05.050 align:middle line:84%
into as a grandchild
or a great grandchild?

00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:10.802 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: What they're
coming in as very bright souls

00:38:10.802 --> 00:38:15.600 align:middle line:84%
to navigate and to steer
this new world that's

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:19.800 align:middle line:84%
birthing now in this
fifth dimensionary energy.

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:29.600 align:middle line:10%
And they have the capabilities
of the new innovations

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:32.570 align:middle line:10%
for the world to come forward.

00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:34.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, they must
have the frequencies that

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:36.510 align:middle line:90%
can incarnate back in here.

00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:39.860 align:middle line:84%
And maybe is it fair to
say that these are either

00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:43.160 align:middle line:84%
souls that are coming in anew
or maybe haven't been here

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:45.200 align:middle line:84%
since other very,
very high times

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:47.270 align:middle line:84%
vibrationally that
are now choosing

00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:51.320 align:middle line:84%
to come back with the big push
forward into the new world?

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:52.450 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:53.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And it seems important
to me that we

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:58.820 align:middle line:84%
understand when we
often say, well, what

00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:00.600 align:middle line:90%
are we leaving our children?

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:02.760 align:middle line:90%
And some people don't care.

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:04.050 align:middle line:90%
They don't have children.

00:39:04.050 --> 00:39:06.258 align:middle line:84%
It's like, who cares what
we're leaving our children,

00:39:06.258 --> 00:39:07.100 align:middle line:90%
I'll be out of here.

00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:09.540 align:middle line:90%
But no, you'll be back.

00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:13.500 align:middle line:84%
And what you're laying down
is actually your own future.

00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:14.780 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:16.250 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:18.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And if you want to
share just a little bit of that

00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:21.770 align:middle line:84%
and anything else you have
to say before we sign off.

00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:26.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So you're seeing
all of this transition, if you

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:31.110 align:middle line:84%
would, in mindsets, those
that are trying to hold on

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:34.320 align:middle line:84%
to the old ways of being
and those that are bringing

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:37.470 align:middle line:90%
the new innovations forward.

00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:42.940 align:middle line:10%
And as with all of
the old paradigms,

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:47.260 align:middle line:10%
the old industrial
age, let's say,

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:51.390 align:middle line:10%
all of these things
that don't work anymore

00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:53.850 align:middle line:10%
aren't a value anymore.

00:39:53.850 --> 00:39:57.662 align:middle line:84%
They were a value in the
moment in the movement forward.

00:39:57.662 --> 00:39:58.462 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:39:58.462 --> 00:40:04.230 align:middle line:84%
And the innovations continue
and will for its time.

00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:11.850 align:middle line:84%
If you think how little time
less than 100 years that you've

00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:15.300 align:middle line:84%
been able to communicate
globally like you

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:21.170 align:middle line:84%
do now and travel
and communicate.

00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:22.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And mix blood.

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:24.450 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:31.030 align:middle line:84%
So it is this movement
forward is quite dramatic.

00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:33.410 align:middle line:84%
The things you take
for granted now

00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:36.330 align:middle line:90%
haven't been here for very long.

00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:39.860 align:middle line:84%
And that will continue
new innovations.

00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:43.910 align:middle line:84%
Improving upon the
innovations that are here now.

00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:45.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But also,
I would assume

00:40:45.350 --> 00:40:51.540 align:middle line:84%
our inner spiritual technology,
as we continue to as you say,

00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:54.830 align:middle line:84%
begin to truly
understand and love self,

00:40:54.830 --> 00:40:58.970 align:middle line:84%
and we start living closer
to our true soul's desire

00:40:58.970 --> 00:41:02.090 align:middle line:84%
and passion and what we've laid
out for ourselves even prior

00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:03.520 align:middle line:90%
to incarnation.

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:07.520 align:middle line:84%
This has to be just a much
more beautiful game on Earth

00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:08.680 align:middle line:90%
as time goes on.

00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:09.710 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:12.650 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a
magnificent time to be

00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:17.190 align:middle line:84%
embodied in this transformation
that's occurring now.

00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:19.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So is it fair to
say all souls who are here now

00:41:19.830 --> 00:41:22.340 align:middle line:84%
hands on deck, you
chose this, you

00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:25.350 align:middle line:84%
chose to be part of
this great expansion?

00:41:25.350 --> 00:41:27.390 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:30.880 align:middle line:90%
And don't be afraid of it.

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:37.030 align:middle line:84%
Many are negative about
the birth of this new time.

00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:39.370 align:middle line:90%
The new world, as it were.

00:41:39.370 --> 00:41:43.470 align:middle line:90%
It is a global world.

00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:48.620 align:middle line:84%
It's not individualized or
nationalized or insular.

00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:52.580 align:middle line:84%
You're one species
on this planet.

00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And in recognizing and
becoming a globalist,

00:41:57.510 --> 00:42:01.270 align:middle line:84%
the world will give
you its fruits.

00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:04.930 align:middle line:10%
It's those that stay in
the myopic vision that

00:42:04.930 --> 00:42:11.340 align:middle line:10%
will choke out life
for themselves,

00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:14.290 align:middle line:10%
for there's no
expansion within them.

00:42:14.290 --> 00:42:17.970 align:middle line:84%
As we said, life
is always desiring.

00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:24.700 align:middle line:84%
More life lived through
you, by you, for you as you.

00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:26.713 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Don't be
afraid to make mistakes.

00:42:26.713 --> 00:42:28.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: There
aren't mistakes.

00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:29.360 align:middle line:90%
There's only feedback.

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:30.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:42:30.910 --> 00:42:31.850 align:middle line:90%
And that's part of it.

00:42:31.850 --> 00:42:34.670 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to think we've
screwed up our opportunity

00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:37.960 align:middle line:84%
and so people tend to become a
little too conservative in what

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:41.370 align:middle line:90%
they'll choose to explore.

00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:45.030 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Because they don't
want to feel negative feelings.

00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:48.120 align:middle line:84%
But if you understand,
all feelings

00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:51.490 align:middle line:84%
are exquisite, even the
ones that are uncomfortable,

00:42:51.490 --> 00:42:56.460 align:middle line:84%
maybe even so, more so
because of the richness that

00:42:56.460 --> 00:43:00.970 align:middle line:84%
is gained through the
experience of knowing.

00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:01.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:03.430 align:middle line:90%
THEO, thank you.

00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:06.120 align:middle line:90%
THEO, that's all I have for now.

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:09.400 align:middle line:84%
Those are some
wonderful explanations

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:10.970 align:middle line:90%
that we can all mull over.

00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:14.390 align:middle line:84%
Always said very eloquently,
and I thank you, all of you,

00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:16.330 align:middle line:90%
for being here with us today.

00:43:16.330 --> 00:43:19.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: We are appreciative
of the opportunity.

00:43:19.450 --> 00:43:22.450 align:middle line:90%
God's love unto you.

00:43:22.450 --> 00:43:23.250 align:middle line:90%
Good day.

00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:24.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good day.

00:43:24.050 --> 00:43:33.780 align:middle line:90%


00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:34.962 align:middle line:90%
Hey, Sheila.

00:43:34.962 --> 00:43:35.920 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Hi, Regina.

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:36.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That was fun.

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:38.970 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things I just love

00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:42.410 align:middle line:84%
is that THEO continually
reflects back to us.

00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:46.480 align:middle line:84%
You have no idea which is the
same thing my soul group says,

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:48.780 align:middle line:84%
you have no idea
what a privilege

00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:52.060 align:middle line:84%
it is to be there in
all of this right now.

00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And so we talked off
camera a little bit,

00:43:55.870 --> 00:43:58.740 align:middle line:84%
and one of the things you said
and if you could share again

00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:02.880 align:middle line:84%
that I think is also important
is the notion of being amidst

00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:06.220 align:middle line:84%
it, but somehow taking
it in, participating,

00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:08.850 align:middle line:90%
but remaining calm.

00:44:08.850 --> 00:44:13.830 align:middle line:10%
>>GILLETTE: Well, it reminds me
and THEO even likes this quote

00:44:13.830 --> 00:44:18.570 align:middle line:10%
from Eleanor Roosevelt, "All the
water in the ocean can't drown

00:44:18.570 --> 00:44:21.150 align:middle line:10%
you, unless you let it in."

00:44:21.150 --> 00:44:23.940 align:middle line:90%
And it's true about the chaos.

00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:27.270 align:middle line:90%


00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:29.520 align:middle line:84%
Is it affecting
you, really, or is

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:31.950 align:middle line:90%
it just how you think about it?

00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:35.570 align:middle line:90%
And that's letting it in.

00:44:35.570 --> 00:44:40.190 align:middle line:10%
And what are you going
to do inside of you

00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:44.150 align:middle line:10%
with all that chaos, and
a lot of people get sick

00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:48.900 align:middle line:10%
and just it changes their
mood and they become angry.

00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of like the
empaths, THEO talks to empaths

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:55.820 align:middle line:84%
about let it pass through
you, like the wind goes

00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:58.070 align:middle line:90%
through the screen of a window.

00:44:58.070 --> 00:44:59.760 align:middle line:90%
Don't hold on to it.

00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:03.140 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to hold
on to that energy.

00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:07.610 align:middle line:84%
So I think we just need to
be mindful and pay attention

00:45:07.610 --> 00:45:10.100 align:middle line:90%
to what's ours and what's not.

00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:10.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:14.240 align:middle line:84%
And some people feel that their
humanity is their emotions

00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:18.440 align:middle line:84%
and they almost feel
obliged to take it all on.

00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:20.320 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I feel so
terrible for what's

00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:21.570 align:middle line:90%
happening over here and there.

00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:24.630 align:middle line:84%
It's hard not to in
some circumstances,

00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:28.790 align:middle line:84%
but in reality to be
aware of it, to clock it.

00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:32.270 align:middle line:84%
If you can do something, do
something, but don't let that

00:45:32.270 --> 00:45:34.340 align:middle line:90%
fill up your emotional body.

00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:37.820 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Well, if
we believe, as I do,

00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:43.590 align:middle line:84%
that we've chosen our bodies,
our place where we live in,

00:45:43.590 --> 00:45:49.900 align:middle line:84%
there's a reason for everything
in the sense of personal growth

00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:52.690 align:middle line:84%
for those individuals
or soul growth,

00:45:52.690 --> 00:45:55.750 align:middle line:84%
even though we think
I couldn't do that.

00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:59.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, good, because
you're not there to do it.

00:45:59.330 --> 00:46:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And bless everybody in their own
experience of this evolution.

00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:08.330 align:middle line:84%
We're all here locking
arms, doing it together,

00:46:08.330 --> 00:46:10.707 align:middle line:90%
and have our own--

00:46:10.707 --> 00:46:11.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Own peace.

00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:11.990 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: --peace.

00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:13.907 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And some chose
a harder tour of duty

00:46:13.907 --> 00:46:15.530 align:middle line:90%
for this incarnation.

00:46:15.530 --> 00:46:17.980 align:middle line:84%
That's not a reflection
of who the soul is.

00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:20.870 align:middle line:90%
It's this glimpse for now.

00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:24.170 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, my dear, well,
it's so good to see you again.

00:46:24.170 --> 00:46:26.047 align:middle line:84%
It was so good
talking with THEO.

00:46:26.047 --> 00:46:27.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It's
good to see you, too.

00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:27.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:46:27.830 --> 00:46:30.120 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know what our
next subject will be,

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:32.727 align:middle line:84%
but I'm sure I'll be seeing
you in a year or so time, OK?

00:46:32.727 --> 00:46:33.810 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: I'd love that.

00:46:33.810 --> 00:46:34.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, great.

00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:35.595 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Sheila.

00:46:35.595 --> 00:46:36.720 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: You're welcome.

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:38.803 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Again, the title
of the book is "The Art

00:46:38.803 --> 00:46:42.600 align:middle line:84%
of Relationship, Discover the
Magic of Unconditional Love."

00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:45.410 align:middle line:84%
It's always wonderful to have
Sheila and THEO here in the room

00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:46.650 align:middle line:90%
with us, as you know.

00:46:46.650 --> 00:46:47.940 align:middle line:90%
So until next time.

00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:49.850 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining
us here on Open Minds.
