00:00:28.139 --> 00:00:30.180 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Perhaps
the strangest and most

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.910 align:middle line:10%
misunderstood
dance on the planet

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.590 align:middle line:10%
is that between men and women.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.820 align:middle line:10%
As we sit on the precipice of
deep, cosmically-influenced

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.400 align:middle line:10%
reconfiguration,
our relationships

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.360 align:middle line:10%
are becoming more at
the center of our need

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.730 align:middle line:10%
to awaken the
highest in ourselves.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.730 align:middle line:84%
In my last conversation
with channeler Joan Walker,

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.510 align:middle line:84%
we spoke about the human species
and the whole notion of spirit

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.250 align:middle line:84%
merging with matter, and as all
things, there are polarities.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.050 align:middle line:84%
So today, we will discuss
the masculine and feminine

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.280 align:middle line:84%
polarities, their divine nature,
and what we're evolving into.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.540 align:middle line:84%
And Joan, we probably
won't go into your past

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.250 align:middle line:84%
again because we did
that in the last session

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.470 align:middle line:90%
when we were together.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.986 align:middle line:84%
And instead, I'd
like to just get

00:01:09.986 --> 00:01:14.450 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of your
own perception of how

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.640 align:middle line:84%
you see this dance between
male and female unfolding.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.570 align:middle line:84%
Because we're in physical
form, we procreate,

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.410 align:middle line:84%
so we're at the densest
level of the polarities

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:25.940 align:middle line:90%
of masculine and feminine.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And then after we
chat a little bit,

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.700 align:middle line:84%
then we'll go into
a channeling and see

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.560 align:middle line:84%
what they have to say about
this dance on a cosmic level

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.750 align:middle line:84%
to a very personal level,
other planets and beyond.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.180 align:middle line:90%
So yes.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.000 align:middle line:10%
>>JOAN WALKER: Well, I
think that this shift

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.450 align:middle line:10%
in consciousness that is
part of what is happening now

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:55.980 align:middle line:10%
on our planet, the
masculine-feminine perception

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.870 align:middle line:10%
is very much a part
of that change.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And because we are in
physical bodies that

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.770 align:middle line:84%
are either masculine
or feminine,

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:13.370 align:middle line:84%
that further exemplifies the
polarization and the split

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.440 align:middle line:84%
in that because we
can only associate

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.240 align:middle line:84%
from a bodily
perspective rather than

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.290 align:middle line:84%
from what goes on
in the psyche, what

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.340 align:middle line:84%
goes on in the emotional body
in higher levels of our being

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.090 align:middle line:90%
at a energetic level.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.070 align:middle line:84%
And at that level, that all has
to shift and change because,

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.100 align:middle line:84%
as individualized
expressions of the divine,

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.490 align:middle line:84%
we are completely
balanced and unified

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.270 align:middle line:84%
in all parts of
ourself, including

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.190 align:middle line:84%
the masculine-feminine
expression.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.150 align:middle line:84%
But that's not what has been
exemplified on our planet

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.700 align:middle line:84%
for hundreds of thousands
of years because

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.560 align:middle line:84%
of the densification of that
third-dimensional matrix,

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.400 align:middle line:84%
of polarization, which is
exemplified in the body.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.600 align:middle line:84%
So it's now time to
change all of that

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.780 align:middle line:84%
as we begin to unify our
system that we spoke about

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.830 align:middle line:84%
in the last session, unify
our thoughts and our emotions,

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.830 align:middle line:90%
the way our body functions.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:29.005 align:middle line:84%
This is a very, very important
part of that unification.

00:03:29.005 --> 00:03:29.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.300 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking off
camera a little bit,

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.830 align:middle line:84%
because you channel a variety
of beings from the other realms,

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.290 align:middle line:84%
including a couple of the beings
from the archangelic realm.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And as you were
saying, those beings

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.025 align:middle line:90%
are not masculine or feminine.

00:03:45.025 --> 00:03:49.150 align:middle line:84%
We tend to genderize everything,
so we'll always say she or he.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.750 align:middle line:84%
But in truth, you were
saying it's not that.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.310 align:middle line:84%
When you're looking at
them on an essence level,

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.010 align:middle line:90%
it's very balanced.

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.530 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Perfectly balanced.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.070 align:middle line:84%
And I did ask that question
of one of the archangels.

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:09.530 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was Gabriel
I asked that question of.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:16.140 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that we always see the
archangels as mainly masculine?

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.060 align:middle line:84%
Everything that's depicted, all
the pictures that are painted,

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.050 align:middle line:90%
are all masculine entities.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.250 align:middle line:84%
And see, I see Gabriel has a
very strong feminine presence

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.390 align:middle line:90%
in my space.

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.470 align:middle line:84%
And I know it's balanced, but
that's the way I perceive her.

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it's always
depicted as a male.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:38.710 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: As a male.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And Gabriel said to me that
all of the archangelic realm,

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.880 align:middle line:84%
all of the angels, regardless
what realm, they are perfectly

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.950 align:middle line:84%
balanced in that
masculine-feminine aspect,

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.250 align:middle line:90%
as is source.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.350 align:middle line:84%
That is a perfectly
balanced expression

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.125 align:middle line:84%
of the divine is the
masculine-feminine.

00:05:06.125 --> 00:05:11.050 align:middle line:84%
At the fall of
consciousness, in that split,

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:16.930 align:middle line:84%
at first there was this big
presence of the feminine

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.710 align:middle line:84%
as the dominant
role because it was

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.650 align:middle line:84%
necessary to preserve
humanity at a physical level.

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.780 align:middle line:84%
So the feminine took
the dominant role.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.840 align:middle line:84%
Eventually that was switched
to the masculine, which

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.520 align:middle line:84%
is more recent and
current in our awareness.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.130 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, it's depicted
we have a patriarchal society.

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's depicted as
masculine because of the fact

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.390 align:middle line:84%
that everything that
comes through what's

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:56.630 align:middle line:84%
been written in our sacred
texts are from that viewpoint.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:04.760 align:middle line:84%
Gabriel also said that in that
masculine-feminine expression,

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.530 align:middle line:84%
they come and appear
to different beings who

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:12.740 align:middle line:84%
have that type of
sight or experience

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.250 align:middle line:84%
with them in the way
that they can best

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.390 align:middle line:90%
accept it and integrate that.

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:24.610 align:middle line:84%
So if that person would
be more comfortable

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.180 align:middle line:84%
with a feminine
aspect, that's what's

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.050 align:middle line:90%
projected in their space.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:33.850 align:middle line:84%
If they're more comfortable
with a more masculine,

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:37.990 align:middle line:84%
powerful energetic,
that's what's expressed.

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.420 align:middle line:84%
But they themselves, as are
the masters, as all the higher

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.690 align:middle line:84%
realms of creation,
are perfectly

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.405 align:middle line:90%
in that unity balance.

00:06:46.405 --> 00:06:47.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That makes sense.

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:50.147 align:middle line:84%
And of course, our depictions
are always very human-like.

00:06:50.147 --> 00:06:51.230 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Well, of course.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:53.021 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because that's
what we relate to.

00:06:53.021 --> 00:06:55.630 align:middle line:84%
But in reality,
when you see some

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.650 align:middle line:84%
of the other artists
from the last 100 years,

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.730 align:middle line:84%
for example, paint
their depictions

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:05.330 align:middle line:84%
of the archangelic realm,
it is not anything.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:09.540 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing human-looking or
masculine or feminine about it.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:14.750 align:middle line:84%
It's patterns of colors and
lights and radiant light.

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:16.590 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: To depict
their energy.

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:20.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, now when
you're channeling them,

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:23.090 align:middle line:84%
do you mostly feel
or see or both?

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.660 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: I feel and I hear.

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:32.610 align:middle line:84%
I may have a visual in my mind's
eye, but I don't have visions.

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:35.180 align:middle line:90%
I don't see pictures.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:41.600 align:middle line:84%
So it's mostly colors and
light, or just a feeling

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:46.500 align:middle line:84%
I get to know after they
use me a number of times,

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:50.540 align:middle line:90%
or they are around me.

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:56.027 align:middle line:84%
I get to discern their
energetic signature.

00:07:56.027 --> 00:07:56.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:57.760 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's a good point.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to talk about
that for just a moment

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:03.320 align:middle line:84%
before we go into the
subject of the polarities

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.750 align:middle line:90%
of masculine and feminine.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:08.240 align:middle line:84%
Because many people who have
been meditating for a while now

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.630 align:middle line:84%
and have started connecting
with their guides,

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:15.530 align:middle line:84%
angels, spirits, whatever
we choose to call them,

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:19.270 align:middle line:84%
have gone through this process
and may not be noticing.

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:21.480 align:middle line:84%
Some people may not
be paying attention.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.930 align:middle line:84%
But there are these
energetic signatures.

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:26.312 align:middle line:84%
And can you talk about how
you first experienced those,

00:08:26.312 --> 00:08:27.770 align:middle line:84%
and then what it's
like when you're

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:31.600 align:middle line:90%
getting to know a new presence?

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.400 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: Well,
after a while, there

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:38.450 align:middle line:84%
is a familiarity
that develops because

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:41.820 align:middle line:90%
of their consistent presence.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And they may not always channel
through me, through my voice,

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:51.230 align:middle line:84%
but they may speak to me
because I'm clairaudient.

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And they may be in my field,
not to the point where

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.670 align:middle line:90%
it's obtrusive or interfering.

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:00.250 align:middle line:84%
But I will begin to
notice that there

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:05.000 align:middle line:84%
is a presence near me
or in the room with me,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.530 align:middle line:84%
especially-- I have a
room that I set aside just

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:12.750 align:middle line:84%
for my meditation, and so I will
sense that as I'm meditating.

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And over the years, I've just
begun to recognize and discern

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:19.620 align:middle line:90%
that there are variances.

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.790 align:middle line:90%
They're not all the same.

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:30.405 align:middle line:84%
They have distinct energetic
templates, I guess,

00:09:30.405 --> 00:09:33.870 align:middle line:84%
and one is quite different
and unique from another.

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And when I don't channel
a being very often,

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:46.220 align:middle line:84%
like El Morya, Master El Morya,
I don't channel him very often.

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:49.850 align:middle line:90%
He very rarely comes through me.

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:54.590 align:middle line:84%
So I am not real familiar
with his energy signature

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:57.190 align:middle line:90%
until he tells me.

00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:04.570 align:middle line:84%
I know it's a being, and
I'm not concerned about it,

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:09.080 align:middle line:84%
but until he tells me who he
is, I don't recognize it early,

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.700 align:middle line:90%
right away.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Years
ago, when I first

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:17.710 align:middle line:84%
started connecting with
guides and such and beings,

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:20.860 align:middle line:84%
I noticed there would be
even physical sensations.

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:24.110 align:middle line:84%
And where there might
be a particular, say,

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:26.860 align:middle line:84%
a tingling on a certain part
of the body or head when

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:29.090 align:middle line:84%
a particular being was
there, and then, again,

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:31.810 align:middle line:84%
through that
repetition, I would know

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:33.380 align:middle line:90%
who was knocking at the door.

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And again, even in this
conversation, we genderize it.

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:42.360 align:middle line:84%
So if it had a more kind of
heavy or firm kind of energy,

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.370 align:middle line:84%
I always took that
as more masculine.

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:46.600 align:middle line:84%
If that particular
being showed up

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:50.060 align:middle line:84%
and the energy was softer or
on a certain side of the body,

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:52.400 align:middle line:84%
for example, I would
take that as feminine.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.180 align:middle line:90%
But not necessarily so.

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:58.150 align:middle line:84%
It's just the unique nature
of each of those beings.

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:02.860 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: The one being that
I have channeled a while,

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:12.240 align:middle line:84%
since about 2003 or '04, when
Master Kuthumi started to come,

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:18.610 align:middle line:84%
he is the most balanced
energetically that I perceive.

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:23.540 align:middle line:84%
Because he can be very soft
and loving and compassionate,

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:28.170 align:middle line:84%
but he can also be very
direct and firm and assertive,

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:31.220 align:middle line:84%
and I have seen
both sides of that.

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And most of the time
now, it's just a very

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:39.460 align:middle line:90%
even energetic that I recognize.

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:43.430 align:middle line:84%
Unless he's bringing
forth a specific message

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:47.730 align:middle line:84%
about something, he can be very,
very dynamic and very firm.

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And then he exhibits more
of, what I would perceive,

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:51.910 align:middle line:90%
a masculine quality.

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:56.740 align:middle line:84%
But most, it's a very-- there's
no discernment masculine or

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:57.240 align:middle line:90%
feminine.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:00.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that means that
the essence of each one of us

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.520 align:middle line:84%
is the same, that
same balance part.

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:05.494 align:middle line:84%
But we're a long way
from living that.

00:12:05.494 --> 00:12:06.160 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Right.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So with that
in mind, looking at it

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:12.330 align:middle line:84%
from the cosmic to the
personal, why don't we

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:17.630 align:middle line:84%
go ahead and let you go
into your channeling.

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:19.830 align:middle line:84%
And we'll give you a couple
minutes to get settled.

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:21.910 align:middle line:84%
So we'll be back
in just a minute.

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And when you're ready to go,
and we'll see who's there.

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:24.695 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: OK.

00:12:24.695 --> 00:12:25.236 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:12:25.236 --> 00:12:30.920 align:middle line:90%


00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:32.160 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Greetings.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.380 align:middle line:90%
It is I, Anna.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:42.726 align:middle line:84%
I have come to converse
with you about the balance

00:12:42.726 --> 00:12:43.975 align:middle line:90%
of the masculine and feminine.

00:12:43.975 --> 00:12:47.220 align:middle line:90%


00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:53.130 align:middle line:84%
These are very auspicious
times in which you live.

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:57.850 align:middle line:84%
Many changes are
occurring within the body

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:00.140 align:middle line:84%
and on your planet
at a physical level.

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:03.320 align:middle line:90%


00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:11.260 align:middle line:84%
Unity within the system must
be accomplished in order

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:16.230 align:middle line:84%
to begin to navigate
very efficiently

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:19.713 align:middle line:84%
at a fifth, sixth,
seventh-dimensional level

00:13:19.713 --> 00:13:20.546 align:middle line:90%
in your physicality.

00:13:20.546 --> 00:13:25.860 align:middle line:90%


00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:29.360 align:middle line:84%
We have spoken to you
previously in regards

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:36.950 align:middle line:84%
to the unification within
the brain, the DNA,

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:42.630 align:middle line:84%
the mental-emotional body, and
within your energetic system.

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:49.360 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that I want
to speak with you concerning

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:54.770 align:middle line:84%
is this masculine-feminine
perspective.

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:59.450 align:middle line:84%
It is not
gender-related, but it is

00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:04.530 align:middle line:84%
a part of who you are
as a soul spirit having

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:09.820 align:middle line:90%
a complete combined expression.

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:14.160 align:middle line:84%
One not being more
valuable than another,

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:19.990 align:middle line:84%
but working in unison
in the creative process

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:23.759 align:middle line:84%
to exemplify who you
are at a spirit level.

00:14:23.759 --> 00:14:30.330 align:middle line:90%


00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:39.290 align:middle line:84%
In this expression, there
are exact exemplifications

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:47.470 align:middle line:84%
that take place as you express
yourself in a body in relation

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:52.500 align:middle line:84%
to feminine aspects
or masculine aspects.

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:56.690 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to do with
the gender of the body,

00:14:56.690 --> 00:15:01.900 align:middle line:84%
but is the expression
of the soul spirit

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:06.320 align:middle line:84%
as it is expressed
through the body.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:11.660 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a
feminine body, within

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:16.070 align:middle line:84%
that energetic configuration
at a physical level,

00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:22.170 align:middle line:84%
you have both masculine and
feminine qualities operating

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:26.420 align:middle line:84%
at the same time, if
you will allow it,

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:31.450 align:middle line:84%
or if you will notice
and be conscious of it.

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:34.190 align:middle line:90%


00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:39.080 align:middle line:84%
This is exemplified in the way
you create your life experience

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:45.580 align:middle line:84%
and in which you exhibit who
you are at a physical level.

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:51.370 align:middle line:84%
By the same token,
those who have

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:57.010 align:middle line:84%
chosen to take on a masculine
body in this embodiment

00:15:57.010 --> 00:16:01.650 align:middle line:84%
have both masculine
and feminine qualities

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:07.570 align:middle line:84%
that they use consistently
in the creative process.

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:12.180 align:middle line:84%
Both aspects are present
within their soul spirit

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:19.300 align:middle line:84%
in that expression, if they will
allow it at a conscious level

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:22.020 align:middle line:90%
and use it.

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:31.140 align:middle line:84%
There is great value in having
that balanced exemplification

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:34.120 align:middle line:90%
of who you are in the body.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.790 align:middle line:90%


00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:42.960 align:middle line:84%
It empowers you to a
much greater degree

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.320 align:middle line:90%
in the physical realm.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:47.160 align:middle line:90%


00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:51.470 align:middle line:84%
The first step in
this integration

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:59.120 align:middle line:84%
is getting past what you see
from a bodily perspective.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:03.900 align:middle line:84%
You have been taught
over eons of time

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:08.609 align:middle line:84%
that men do this
and women do this.

00:17:08.609 --> 00:17:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps men are
more dominant or better

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:15.640 align:middle line:90%
than the woman.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:23.530 align:middle line:84%
Or the woman has more intuitive
qualities, or more compassion,

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:25.910 align:middle line:90%
or more love.

00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:29.066 align:middle line:84%
Nothing could be
further from the truth.

00:17:29.066 --> 00:17:32.440 align:middle line:90%


00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:37.250 align:middle line:84%
The masculine, when
is it expressed

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:47.860 align:middle line:84%
from that divine image, is
full of love, compassion,

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:55.400 align:middle line:84%
and has a knowing of things
as they are embodied because

00:17:55.400 --> 00:18:02.740 align:middle line:84%
of the presence, that divine
image presence, within them.

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:08.730 align:middle line:84%
That knowing, advanced
knowing of many things,

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:13.280 align:middle line:84%
is present as a
masculine attribute

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.335 align:middle line:90%
just as it is as a feminine.

00:18:15.335 --> 00:18:17.920 align:middle line:90%


00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:25.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, in a body, that
operates slightly different

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:31.230 align:middle line:84%
because the energy is
managed differently,

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:35.570 align:middle line:84%
first of all, because of
what is taught and programmed

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:39.180 align:middle line:84%
within the individual
from a very young age

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:47.710 align:middle line:84%
and, secondly, because of
the physicality of the body.

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:56.220 align:middle line:84%
So a masculine attribute, as it
expresses its divine imaging,

00:18:56.220 --> 00:19:02.980 align:middle line:84%
can be more assertive,
more direct, and exemplify

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:09.560 align:middle line:84%
a power that is needed
to bring into fruition,

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:17.780 align:middle line:84%
into manifestation, a
creative response in a very

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:21.950 align:middle line:90%
direct, efficient way.

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:24.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can see,
if you look at this

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:30.070 align:middle line:84%
from the proper perspective,
that within that feminine,

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:34.490 align:middle line:84%
there is that-- also that
power, and that power

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:37.150 align:middle line:90%
can be very assertive.

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:42.102 align:middle line:84%
But because of programming
of the feminine,

00:19:42.102 --> 00:19:47.260 align:middle line:84%
it is also misaligned
in many ways

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:52.750 align:middle line:84%
so that it can't be
properly exemplified

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:57.010 align:middle line:84%
as assertive, but more
from the perspective

00:19:57.010 --> 00:20:01.026 align:middle line:84%
of a fallen energetic
of manipulation.

00:20:01.026 --> 00:20:04.300 align:middle line:90%


00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:06.100 align:middle line:90%
I will manipulate.

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:16.180 align:middle line:84%
I will seduce to
project my power.

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:19.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's a fallen
state of consciousness,

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:22.540 align:middle line:90%
and it's a perfect example.

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:26.680 align:middle line:84%
Just as in the masculine,
I must be assertive

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:31.760 align:middle line:84%
because I am powerful, and
therefore, I must dominate.

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:35.220 align:middle line:84%
This is a fallen state
of consciousness,

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:37.510 align:middle line:84%
and this is how
it is exemplified.

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:40.810 align:middle line:84%
Neither masculine
nor feminine get

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:47.160 align:middle line:84%
projected in that fallen
state of consciousness

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:51.830 align:middle line:90%
in a divine image perspective.

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:54.930 align:middle line:90%
Can you see that?

00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:56.249 align:middle line:90%
So you have questions.

00:20:56.249 --> 00:20:57.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, I
have some questions.

00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:00.400 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that, Anna.

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:03.960 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at it on a
cosmic level of creation

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:09.020 align:middle line:84%
and the function of the
masculine versus the feminine,

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:11.840 align:middle line:84%
or the two in consort
with each other,

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:15.750 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the
creative process, what

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:19.000 align:middle line:84%
each is charged
with, so to speak.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: There is no
separation at that level.

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:26.540 align:middle line:84%
At that higher dimensional
frequency range,

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:30.480 align:middle line:84%
once you pass that
seventh-dimensional frequency

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:33.820 align:middle line:84%
range, there is no
separation, so it

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:38.360 align:middle line:84%
is totally unified
in its expression.

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:48.130 align:middle line:84%
When source expresses
itself fully and completely,

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:53.255 align:middle line:84%
you do not see
masculine-feminine.

00:21:53.255 --> 00:21:57.820 align:middle line:84%
It is just this
powerful creative energy

00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:02.530 align:middle line:90%
that comes forth and manifests.

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:08.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: At what level do we
move beyond the basic building

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.930 align:middle line:84%
blocks, say, of
electromagnetism, for example?

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:15.070 align:middle line:84%
My understanding is
that electromagnetism

00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:20.270 align:middle line:84%
is the combination of a
masculine and feminine dynamic

00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:23.120 align:middle line:84%
from which physical
reality is created.

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:26.810 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: And that's at that
lower dimensional level.

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:29.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So
electromagnetism then

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:32.710 align:middle line:84%
ceases to exist at
which dimensional level?

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:34.890 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: When you get
into that eighth and above.

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:35.512 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:22:35.512 --> 00:22:36.720 align:middle line:90%
That's what I wanted to know.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:39.600 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: So not
only is it expressed

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:44.770 align:middle line:84%
masculine-feminine perspectives
at these lower levels,

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:52.050 align:middle line:84%
it has to do with that component
of your physicality, which

00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:54.820 align:middle line:90%
is your mental-emotional body.

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:57.970 align:middle line:90%
Thoughts are electrical.

00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:01.910 align:middle line:90%
Feelings, emotions are magnetic.

00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And when they come
together in that expression

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:13.790 align:middle line:84%
at an energetic level,
it creates the field

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:23.140 align:middle line:84%
that holds the example
or the manifestation

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:26.590 align:middle line:90%
in form, the experience.

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:32.990 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, the
masculine component

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:39.380 align:middle line:84%
is viewed more at a mental level
and has more electrical charges

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:40.310 align:middle line:90%
to it.

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:49.220 align:middle line:84%
Where the feminine is viewed
or thought of as more feeling

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:53.865 align:middle line:84%
or emotional or intuitive,
and it is magnetic.

00:23:53.865 --> 00:23:57.040 align:middle line:90%


00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:59.750 align:middle line:90%
Both perspectives are incorrect.

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:02.210 align:middle line:84%
Yes, that thoughts
and feelings do

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:05.490 align:middle line:84%
create the
electromagnetic field.

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And it is the perception
of whether it's

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:14.440 align:middle line:84%
masculine or
feminine expressions,

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:19.940 align:middle line:84%
or a perception of that,
that gets manifested and held

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:24.130 align:middle line:84%
within an environment of that
electromagnetic field, which

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:30.890 align:middle line:84%
is what holds your
creative expression

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:33.940 align:middle line:90%
in the realm of form.

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:35.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
we always hear you

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:39.890 align:middle line:84%
need to have a very clear
focused thought that is upheld

00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:42.670 align:middle line:84%
by the feelings that
you wish to express

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:46.600 align:middle line:84%
in that manifestation that
makes manifest anything.

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:48.070 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Correct.

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:52.090 align:middle line:84%
So when the feminine
is misrepresented

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:55.710 align:middle line:84%
or in that fallen
state of consciousness,

00:24:55.710 --> 00:25:05.520 align:middle line:84%
because it is expected or
viewed as being very creative,

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:10.840 align:middle line:84%
it is also exemplified
in that there

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:13.310 align:middle line:84%
are many thoughts
floating around.

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:16.320 align:middle line:84%
There are many options
for that creation.

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.030 align:middle line:90%
So nothing is definite.

00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:20.530 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is directed.

00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:25.770 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, you must look
to the masculine to direct it

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:30.760 align:middle line:84%
and to bring it into a
more unified expression,

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:33.590 align:middle line:84%
in a more powerful
exemplification, that

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:37.970 align:middle line:90%
can be put into the experience.

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:40.680 align:middle line:90%


00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:43.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this is often,
in our parlance, aligned

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:45.890 align:middle line:84%
with the hemispheres
of the brain,

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:48.840 align:middle line:84%
where the right hemisphere would
be considered, in that context,

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:50.510 align:middle line:84%
more feminine,
and the left would

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:52.080 align:middle line:90%
be considered more masculine.

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:52.760 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Right.

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:58.780 align:middle line:84%
All of that is that division
in separation consciousness,

00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:03.550 align:middle line:84%
polarization, and all
of the programming that

00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:10.490 align:middle line:84%
stems from that through
judgment, guilt, fear, and just

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:13.750 align:middle line:84%
the teachings and
the exemplification,

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:17.280 align:middle line:84%
time after time
after time, creating

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:20.460 align:middle line:84%
that vast electromagnetic
field that

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:23.895 align:middle line:84%
holds an environment for
its expression in form.

00:26:23.895 --> 00:26:27.700 align:middle line:90%


00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:30.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now, I mean,
even in the world of the brain

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:34.610 align:middle line:84%
sciences and research and such,
everything is about coherence.

00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:37.120 align:middle line:84%
So the word "coherence"
between the hemispheres

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.147 align:middle line:90%
is what's coming up most often.

00:26:39.147 --> 00:26:39.730 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Yes.

00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And that will shift and
be altered substantially

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:51.610 align:middle line:84%
as people begin to understand
the functioning of the brain

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:55.000 align:middle line:84%
and that it can be
altered, and sections

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.420 align:middle line:84%
of the brain that haven't been
functioning for eons of time

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:01.180 align:middle line:90%
begin to function.

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:05.220 align:middle line:10%
So that coherence
throughout the brain,

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:09.200 align:middle line:10%
through the neurological
system, and through the neurons

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:14.380 align:middle line:10%
of the cells of the brain
will better exemplify

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:19.220 align:middle line:10%
that unification, starting
with that division

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:21.950 align:middle line:10%
within the hemispheres
of the brain

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:30.160 align:middle line:10%
and that physical division that
is part of the brain structure

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:33.160 align:middle line:10%
that was put in
play-- was created

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:40.900 align:middle line:10%
at the fall of consciousness so
that the thoughts were divided,

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:47.510 align:middle line:10%
polarized, and could not
be adequately communicated

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:49.447 align:middle line:10%
throughout the system.

00:27:49.447 --> 00:27:50.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And we're certainly
living in that right now.

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:54.390 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Yes, yes.

00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:57.790 align:middle line:90%
But not totally.

00:27:57.790 --> 00:27:59.770 align:middle line:90%
You are seeing vast changes.

00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:07.020 align:middle line:84%
These new generations coming up
are living their lives totally.

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:11.310 align:middle line:84%
The programming is
not there to hold

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:14.150 align:middle line:90%
the rigidity of that separation.

00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:19.360 align:middle line:84%
You are seeing the masculine
taking more of a role

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:24.510 align:middle line:84%
in family life, being the
nurturer many, many times.

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And you are seeing the
feminine using their power very

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:35.070 align:middle line:84%
dynamically, not
through manipulation,

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:39.130 align:middle line:84%
but because they
recognize who they are

00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:40.630 align:middle line:90%
and that they do have power.

00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:43.107 align:middle line:90%


00:28:43.107 --> 00:28:43.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:47.150 align:middle line:84%
I see many examples of this
in my son's generation, who

00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:49.430 align:middle line:84%
is in his early '30s,
and then younger.

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:54.292 align:middle line:84%
It's really quite beautiful,
much more balanced

00:28:54.292 --> 00:28:57.701 align:middle line:84%
within themselves, certainly,
than the previous generations

00:28:57.701 --> 00:28:58.200 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:58.783 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Yes.

00:28:58.783 --> 00:29:02.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so I want to get
into some specifics about men

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:05.620 align:middle line:84%
and women, polarization,
and sexuality,

00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:07.380 align:middle line:84%
and the continuance
of our species,

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:10.430 align:middle line:84%
and let's reflect it back
out maybe to other planetary

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:12.010 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:14.800 align:middle line:84%
The whole notion of
extreme polarities

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:17.510 align:middle line:84%
between the male and
female physicality,

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:20.690 align:middle line:84%
is that something that
happens in other quadrants

00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:24.230 align:middle line:84%
of the universe and other
star systems and so forth?

00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:28.460 align:middle line:84%
Is this common, having
female and male bodies?

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And are there other
iterations of that?

00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:33.670 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Yes, of course.

00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:36.400 align:middle line:84%
There are many iterations
throughout creation

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:42.020 align:middle line:84%
in the many different
galaxies and solar systems,

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:47.550 align:middle line:84%
many different expressions
because these planetary systems

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:51.400 align:middle line:84%
have varying states of
consciousness present

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:57.030 align:middle line:84%
and operate in varying
dimensional frequency ranges.

00:29:57.030 --> 00:30:03.760 align:middle line:84%
So those who have form,
have a more humanoid form,

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:07.880 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily exactly
like what we see or you

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:13.000 align:middle line:84%
see on Earth, but
are humanoid, they

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.670 align:middle line:84%
have more of that
division because

00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:21.880 align:middle line:90%
of the nature of their body.

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:27.650 align:middle line:84%
As they begin to operate
in those higher frequency

00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:31.610 align:middle line:84%
ranges of the
dimensions, there will

00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:35.810 align:middle line:84%
be physical changes
within those human bodies,

00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:38.910 align:middle line:90%
as the human bodies on Earth.

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And they will begin to
merge, not only energetically

00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:48.710 align:middle line:84%
and in the way in which
they create and exemplify

00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:52.250 align:middle line:84%
themselves, but the body,
the functioning of the body.

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:59.040 align:middle line:84%
As it begins to upgrade to a
higher dimensional frequency

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:05.560 align:middle line:84%
range, it will
become more in unity

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:11.600 align:middle line:84%
and will not have that
division of male-female body.

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:14.280 align:middle line:84%
At the original
conception of Earth,

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:21.730 align:middle line:84%
when Earth was originally
created, there was not,

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:25.320 align:middle line:90%
early on, that division.

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:30.380 align:middle line:90%
That's my understanding as well.

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:33.040 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: So there
are some solar systems

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:39.180 align:middle line:84%
that have a physical
expression, a body, if you will,

00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:43.520 align:middle line:84%
that is not humanoid and
operate at a much different

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:46.610 align:middle line:90%
dimensional level.

00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And they do not have
that male-female division

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:58.660 align:middle line:84%
within their bodily function,
but it functions as a unit

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:01.140 align:middle line:84%
and is neither
masculine or feminine,

00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:04.185 align:middle line:84%
but is a very coherent
energy within itself.

00:32:04.185 --> 00:32:05.006 align:middle line:90%
It's androgynous.

00:32:05.006 --> 00:32:08.430 align:middle line:90%


00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:14.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, first, as things
evolve on your planet, what

00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:17.570 align:middle line:84%
happens is, when
there becomes more

00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:21.760 align:middle line:84%
coherence within the
energetic system of the body

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:27.480 align:middle line:84%
and the consciousness,
then this androgynous state

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:33.450 align:middle line:84%
of the complete unification of
masculine-feminine expression

00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:35.560 align:middle line:90%
takes place first.

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:39.820 align:middle line:84%
As the hemispheres of
the brain are altered

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:42.370 align:middle line:84%
and more unification
takes place there,

00:32:42.370 --> 00:32:45.430 align:middle line:84%
more openings in the
brain, functionings

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:49.680 align:middle line:84%
within the body, the
consciousness of beings

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:53.036 align:middle line:84%
embodied on planet Earth
becomes more androgynous.

00:32:53.036 --> 00:32:56.310 align:middle line:90%


00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:59.140 align:middle line:84%
So to go back to your
question, are there

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:03.410 align:middle line:84%
other planetary
systems, other galaxies

00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:06.180 align:middle line:84%
that have that
androgynous state?

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:09.516 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is yes.

00:33:09.516 --> 00:33:11.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I think
when you're saying

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:14.200 align:middle line:84%
that, the first thing that
will pop to some people's minds

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:18.980 align:middle line:84%
right away is, what is the
process of perpetuating

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:22.050 align:middle line:84%
the species, as it's
not done in the way

00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:24.230 align:middle line:84%
that it's done on this
planet and other planets

00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:28.210 align:middle line:84%
with that masculine-feminine
polarity and procreation?

00:33:28.210 --> 00:33:30.960 align:middle line:84%
How do other species
propagate themselves?

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:35.570 align:middle line:84%
Or are we talking about species
that are beyond physicality?

00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:38.919 align:middle line:84%
Sounds like not, or you wouldn't
say they're androgynous, right?

00:33:38.919 --> 00:33:39.460 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: No.

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:41.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what is the
process of procreation

00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:43.660 align:middle line:90%
in androgynous species?

00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:49.550 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: First of all, it is
a chosen avenue of procreation.

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:52.930 align:middle line:84%
It is not accidental,
and it is not

00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:57.940 align:middle line:90%
dependent on the sexual act.

00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:05.285 align:middle line:84%
That's a third-dimensional
division,

00:34:05.285 --> 00:34:08.060 align:middle line:84%
where procreation,
because the way

00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:14.130 align:middle line:84%
the body functions was dependent
on the sexual unification

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:15.659 align:middle line:90%
within the system.

00:34:15.659 --> 00:34:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And most often, it
was not approached

00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:25.469 align:middle line:90%
from a very conscious decision.

00:34:25.469 --> 00:34:30.060 align:middle line:84%
It was a decision
that got made because

00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:35.120 align:middle line:84%
of the sexual act
from that lower

00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:38.830 align:middle line:84%
third-dimensional
functioning of the chakras

00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:43.350 align:middle line:84%
and the physical
addiction to pleasure.

00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:45.920 align:middle line:84%
Because at a
spiritual level, there

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:52.570 align:middle line:84%
was such a division
and a fragmentation

00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:56.469 align:middle line:84%
that joy could not--
and ecstasy could not

00:34:56.469 --> 00:35:00.450 align:middle line:84%
be experienced but could be
experienced at that lower

00:35:00.450 --> 00:35:05.710 align:middle line:84%
dimensional level, which
was very addictive,

00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:11.560 align:middle line:84%
and was the only way that
humans had to, in some way,

00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:15.020 align:middle line:90%
exemplify ecstasy.

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And so, as that
time and time took

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:27.660 align:middle line:84%
place, beings
evolved out of that.

00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And today, in your realms
of form and the way

00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:38.170 align:middle line:84%
you function on
Earth, most often

00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:44.470 align:middle line:84%
that decision is made very
consciously by parents deciding

00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:51.200 align:middle line:84%
whether to bring a child
into the world or not,

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:53.830 align:middle line:84%
which is where it
should be because there

00:35:53.830 --> 00:36:01.050 align:middle line:84%
is a huge responsibility
to that new being

00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:07.350 align:middle line:84%
coming into form for guidance,
not control, but guidance

00:36:07.350 --> 00:36:08.470 align:middle line:90%
and support.

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:14.720 align:middle line:84%
So they, as the divine
beings that they are,

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:21.010 align:middle line:84%
can come into the world
of form and create

00:36:21.010 --> 00:36:24.360 align:middle line:84%
what they desired
to create and have

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:31.060 align:middle line:84%
the experiences of themselves
at a soul spirit level

00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:35.990 align:middle line:84%
to exemplify their
individuality of their divinity.

00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:38.880 align:middle line:84%
So, too, it is in
these other cultures

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:42.690 align:middle line:84%
who have just an
androgynous body.

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:46.900 align:middle line:84%
There is an interior
decision that is made,

00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:52.870 align:middle line:84%
and it is also made within a
collective unit of many beings

00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:59.920 align:middle line:84%
within that cultural
system that will support

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:03.420 align:middle line:84%
the evolution of
that soul coming

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:06.720 align:middle line:84%
into being in some
form of physicality.

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:10.172 align:middle line:90%


00:37:10.172 --> 00:37:11.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And how
does that process

00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:14.770 align:middle line:90%
occur in an androgynous society?

00:37:14.770 --> 00:37:16.647 align:middle line:84%
I think I asked that
a little bit ago.

00:37:16.647 --> 00:37:17.480 align:middle line:90%
How does that occur?

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:18.521 align:middle line:90%
What does that look like?

00:37:18.521 --> 00:37:21.560 align:middle line:84%
Say, give us an example
of a planet or two

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:24.650 align:middle line:84%
that have androgynous
physical bodies

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:27.240 align:middle line:84%
but are able to replicate
their species, as you say,

00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:29.670 align:middle line:90%
consciously and by choice.

00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:34.820 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: These systems
are not humanoid,

00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:38.270 align:middle line:84%
and they are not within
your solar system,

00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:42.060 align:middle line:84%
and they are not
within your galaxy.

00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:48.526 align:middle line:84%
These beings are more 10th,
11th, 12th-dimensional beings

00:37:48.526 --> 00:37:54.700 align:middle line:84%
who procreate within
themselves with a decision that

00:37:54.700 --> 00:38:00.150 align:middle line:84%
is made within the unity
of their soul spirit

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:08.070 align:middle line:84%
and also within consultation
of a collective consciousness

00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:15.800 align:middle line:84%
of the many beings that they
are in relationship with.

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And that being then comes into
being through that individual's

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:29.720 align:middle line:84%
bodily system, whether
it be from within it

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:37.356 align:middle line:84%
or within a
webbing-type structure,

00:38:37.356 --> 00:38:42.970 align:middle line:84%
a cocoon-type structure, that
is created outside of the body

00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:49.660 align:middle line:84%
energetically, and then
infused by bodily fluids

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:53.155 align:middle line:90%
or bodily interaction.

00:38:53.155 --> 00:38:55.937 align:middle line:90%


00:38:55.937 --> 00:38:56.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:38:56.770 --> 00:38:57.330 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:38:57.330 --> 00:39:02.100 align:middle line:84%
I've always been curious
about how species replicate

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:04.805 align:middle line:84%
when they're not humanoid
species in particular.

00:39:04.805 --> 00:39:08.130 align:middle line:90%


00:39:08.130 --> 00:39:10.200 align:middle line:84%
So from what you're
saying, so as we bring

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:16.590 align:middle line:84%
our brain into alignment into
a higher state of coherence,

00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:22.500 align:middle line:84%
that starts bridging or unifying
the masculine and feminine

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:27.970 align:middle line:84%
polarities into a balanced
state within us from a soul

00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:30.770 align:middle line:84%
level into the emotional,
into the mental,

00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:33.120 align:middle line:84%
and then ultimately
into the physical.

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:36.710 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's look at
this over the next, say,

00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:39.910 align:middle line:84%
couple thousand years or however
long it takes of humanity,

00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:44.280 align:middle line:84%
how does that start expressing
itself in our own bodies?

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:47.240 align:middle line:84%
Because I would assume-- I
shouldn't assume anything--

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:50.200 align:middle line:84%
but do we become
then-- is this species

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:53.550 align:middle line:84%
destined to become also
an androgynous species?

00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:54.640 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Yes, it is.

00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:55.181 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:39:55.181 --> 00:39:56.630 align:middle line:90%
So how does that happen?

00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:59.770 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: Body will
change dramatically.

00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:03.250 align:middle line:84%
The body that you
are using today

00:40:03.250 --> 00:40:09.500 align:middle line:84%
is not the same
vehicle that was used

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:14.200 align:middle line:84%
early on at the
origination of the planet.

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And even at that
eighth-dimensional level

00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:23.460 align:middle line:84%
that was present in
times of Atlantis,

00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:26.270 align:middle line:90%
the body is different.

00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:28.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Explain the
differences to us.

00:40:28.610 --> 00:40:34.360 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: It's much more
separated in its configuration.

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:39.550 align:middle line:84%
Masculine-feminine qualities
are very apparent and dominant

00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:46.180 align:middle line:84%
in its configuration, as is
the operation of the brain.

00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:50.930 align:middle line:84%
The way in which the
DNA is configured,

00:40:50.930 --> 00:41:01.020 align:middle line:84%
the way in which the cells
function are vastly different.

00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:06.860 align:middle line:84%
The chemical components
that operate within the cell

00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:11.660 align:middle line:84%
and within the bodily
fluids are different.

00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And it brings about this
separated, dense, dense vehicle

00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:21.483 align:middle line:84%
that was not
present in Atlantis.

00:41:21.483 --> 00:41:23.755 align:middle line:90%


00:41:23.755 --> 00:41:25.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA:
Interestingly, when you

00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:27.930 align:middle line:84%
look at some of the
drawings, glyphs,

00:41:27.930 --> 00:41:30.940 align:middle line:84%
hieroglyphics, and such from
Egyptian times depicting

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:34.860 align:middle line:84%
the deep past, you see more
androgynous types of bodies.

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:38.130 align:middle line:84%
I think one that a
lot of people point

00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:42.460 align:middle line:84%
to is the physicality
of both the Pharaoh

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:45.140 align:middle line:84%
Akhenaten and
Nefertiti, who almost

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:48.270 align:middle line:84%
seem to have very similar
kinds of bodies that

00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:51.380 align:middle line:84%
were depicted in
the artwork then.

00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:55.080 align:middle line:84%
Is this something that was
deliberately being displayed,

00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:58.239 align:middle line:84%
or was this unique
to those beings?

00:41:58.239 --> 00:41:58.780 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: No.

00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:01.925 align:middle line:84%
It was displayed because
these beings were

00:42:01.925 --> 00:42:07.520 align:middle line:84%
eighth-dimensional beings
from the planet Sirius.

00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:11.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so this would be
more what a body type on Sirius

00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:13.720 align:middle line:90%
would look like even now?

00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:15.990 align:middle line:90%
Or have they changed also?

00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:17.720 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: They have
had some alterations,

00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:20.770 align:middle line:84%
because as the
Earth has evolved,

00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:24.800 align:middle line:84%
that all realms of
creation evolve.

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:31.700 align:middle line:84%
So not a whole lot of
changes, but some, yes.

00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:33.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now with
the younger people

00:42:33.610 --> 00:42:35.660 align:middle line:84%
coming in, as we talked
about a little bit ago,

00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:38.670 align:middle line:84%
they're bringing in this
more harmonious balance

00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:40.190 align:middle line:84%
to masculine and
feminine, the way

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:42.800 align:middle line:84%
they interact with
each other and so on.

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that I'm noticing

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:49.800 align:middle line:84%
a lot, just in general and
globally in that age group,

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:51.760 align:middle line:84%
there are a lot of
reactions to the times.

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:56.760 align:middle line:84%
In some countries,
you have shut-ins,

00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:58.380 align:middle line:84%
for example, becoming
very prominent,

00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:01.180 align:middle line:84%
where people don't really
want to go out and socialize,

00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:01.680 align:middle line:90%
per se.

00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:03.770 align:middle line:84%
They just want to
stay with themselves.

00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:05.890 align:middle line:84%
In others, the
boys and girls are

00:43:05.890 --> 00:43:11.060 align:middle line:84%
becoming more-- their
parents will often say,

00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:13.350 align:middle line:84%
I think they're
asexual because they

00:43:13.350 --> 00:43:16.160 align:middle line:84%
don't seem to have a
real desire for sex

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:19.730 align:middle line:84%
with girls or boys or
anyone really in particular.

00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:22.650 align:middle line:84%
Is this the beginning of
what we're seeing then

00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:25.610 align:middle line:84%
as that movement
toward that integration

00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:26.780 align:middle line:90%
of masculine-feminine?

00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:27.670 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Yes.

00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:31.260 align:middle line:84%
It's a very complex
subject that you

00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:37.470 align:middle line:84%
have chosen to discuss today and
has many, many layers, not just

00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:44.080 align:middle line:84%
the androgynous or the
asexual expression,

00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:51.870 align:middle line:84%
but the whole way in which
the body operates as a unit.

00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:57.320 align:middle line:84%
And as the unification
begins to happen

00:43:57.320 --> 00:44:00.440 align:middle line:84%
on all levels of
the physicality,

00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:04.740 align:middle line:84%
as well as the
mental-emotional body, the way

00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:13.930 align:middle line:84%
the thinking process
is used, the way

00:44:13.930 --> 00:44:18.310 align:middle line:84%
the emotions are
used, the ability

00:44:18.310 --> 00:44:24.690 align:middle line:84%
to create a unification within
the system, energetically as

00:44:24.690 --> 00:44:27.400 align:middle line:90%
well as conceptually.

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:30.210 align:middle line:84%
So there are many,
many complexities

00:44:30.210 --> 00:44:36.130 align:middle line:84%
to this-- the thinking
and the awareness

00:44:36.130 --> 00:44:41.070 align:middle line:84%
of self, of you as that
individualized expression, how

00:44:41.070 --> 00:44:46.290 align:middle line:84%
you think about yourself, how
you dialogue and communicate

00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:54.220 align:middle line:84%
with yourself, that inner
talk that you most often don't

00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:57.045 align:middle line:84%
pay attention to or
are not even conscious

00:44:57.045 --> 00:45:03.600 align:middle line:84%
of, how you think about yourself
from that masculine-feminine

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:05.660 align:middle line:90%
perspective.

00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:08.240 align:middle line:84%
If you are in a
male body, if you

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:14.710 align:middle line:84%
are fearful of expressing
your softer side for fear

00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:22.940 align:middle line:84%
of being judged as too
feminate-- effeminate,

00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:27.060 align:middle line:84%
then you will hide those
qualities from yourself,

00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:32.920 align:middle line:84%
and you will not allow
yourself to have compassion.

00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:35.430 align:middle line:84%
And there will be
great misuse of power,

00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:44.570 align:middle line:84%
as there has been, in your
times in a fallen state.

00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:49.110 align:middle line:84%
You will not allow,
that masculine will not

00:45:49.110 --> 00:45:54.296 align:middle line:90%
allow any intuitive response.

00:45:54.296 --> 00:45:56.910 align:middle line:90%


00:45:56.910 --> 00:46:02.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, creation, they
do allow that because

00:46:02.810 --> 00:46:05.310 align:middle line:84%
in that masculine
body, the programming

00:46:05.310 --> 00:46:12.160 align:middle line:84%
says that it is up to you to
create health and well-being

00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:15.860 align:middle line:90%
or sustenance for the family.

00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:19.510 align:middle line:84%
So you operate on that
rigid programming,

00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:25.060 align:middle line:84%
and you do not have this
inner dialogue with self

00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:31.200 align:middle line:84%
that exemplifies that balanced
divine essence of you,

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:37.550 align:middle line:84%
feeling your feelings,
being compassionate, opening

00:46:37.550 --> 00:46:43.600 align:middle line:84%
the heart, loving
unconditionally.

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:47.840 align:middle line:84%
By the same token, in the
woman, who is in a female body,

00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:49.810 align:middle line:90%
has been programmed.

00:46:49.810 --> 00:46:50.950 align:middle line:90%
She is less than.

00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:52.230 align:middle line:90%
She has no power.

00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:54.760 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, the
way to get power

00:46:54.760 --> 00:47:04.680 align:middle line:84%
is to manipulate, to seduce, to
argue, to cry, use the emotions

00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:10.110 align:middle line:84%
in a very negative
way, to not see

00:47:10.110 --> 00:47:16.590 align:middle line:84%
her beauty and her power as
the wisdom-holder of the family

00:47:16.590 --> 00:47:19.720 align:middle line:84%
and the director
of the family unit

00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:24.030 align:middle line:84%
to express themselves
as their divine essence.

00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And that communication within
the interior, within the mind,

00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:32.620 align:middle line:84%
is constantly being
of a kind that

00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:37.140 align:middle line:84%
is denigrating to their
femininity, and to their power,

00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:39.910 align:middle line:84%
and the wholeness
of who they are.

00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:41.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:43.390 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: So it's
that inner dialogue

00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:46.640 align:middle line:84%
and that inner communication
that has to be changed.

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:50.820 align:middle line:84%
And you have to pay attention
to what you're thinking

00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:52.754 align:middle line:90%
and what you're saying to you.

00:47:52.754 --> 00:47:54.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I want
to talk about that,

00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:56.790 align:middle line:84%
the whole masculine-feminine
communication thing

00:47:56.790 --> 00:48:00.470 align:middle line:84%
because this is something
that seems to be shifting very

00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:03.060 align:middle line:84%
radically and needs
to shift radically.

00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:07.780 align:middle line:84%
I want to finish up on one other
aspect of that conversation.

00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:10.260 align:middle line:84%
First, I'm going to do
two little backtracks.

00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:13.330 align:middle line:84%
One of them, you were talking
about that beautiful love

00:48:13.330 --> 00:48:17.000 align:middle line:84%
and compassion that is part
of the divine masculine.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.190 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going back again
to those depictions

00:48:20.190 --> 00:48:21.680 align:middle line:84%
because I've always
been fascinated

00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:24.240 align:middle line:90%
with Akhenaten and Nefertiti.

00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:27.070 align:middle line:84%
Same thing, you have
the little children

00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:29.180 align:middle line:90%
sitting on both of their laps.

00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:33.800 align:middle line:84%
You have both of them with
these more androgynous types

00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:35.120 align:middle line:90%
of bodies.

00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And both of them in
a nurturing state

00:48:38.610 --> 00:48:43.390 align:middle line:84%
with the children and their
family, and then the rays

00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:45.820 align:middle line:84%
of the sun reaching down
and nourishing all of them,

00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:48.130 align:middle line:84%
for example, in one of
the very famous ones.

00:48:48.130 --> 00:48:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to me that is
a depiction of what you're

00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:53.530 align:middle line:84%
talking about as to
where we are going.

00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:54.240 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Yes.

00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:57.617 align:middle line:84%
And you're seeing it now in
these recent generations.

00:48:57.617 --> 00:48:58.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:01.230 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: It will take
three more generations

00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:06.580 align:middle line:84%
for that masculine-feminine to
become more fully integrated

00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:11.640 align:middle line:84%
and stabilized in the
psychology, in the emotions.

00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:14.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As we go away
from those polarities then,

00:49:14.590 --> 00:49:17.630 align:middle line:84%
the manipulation on the female,
the dominance on the male,

00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:20.770 align:middle line:84%
and you go away from
the sexual charge that

00:49:20.770 --> 00:49:24.530 align:middle line:84%
happens in those
extremes there, is

00:49:24.530 --> 00:49:28.230 align:middle line:84%
what is going to occur
something that is more-- will we

00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:30.560 align:middle line:84%
have lower, for
example, lowered birth

00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:34.920 align:middle line:84%
rates over a period of time
where that charge won't be so

00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:36.800 align:middle line:84%
strong-- is the
planet going to start

00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:40.090 align:middle line:84%
reducing in population as
a result of moving more

00:49:40.090 --> 00:49:42.372 align:middle line:90%
toward an androgynous state?

00:49:42.372 --> 00:49:43.122 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Correct.

00:49:43.122 --> 00:49:45.780 align:middle line:90%


00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:53.560 align:middle line:84%
That will occur because
it will be decided,

00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:58.130 align:middle line:84%
procreation will be decided
on a very conscious level,

00:49:58.130 --> 00:50:00.220 align:middle line:84%
and there will be
a communication

00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:05.300 align:middle line:84%
with that soul within
that individual parent

00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:11.886 align:middle line:84%
before that merging
comes together to create.

00:50:11.886 --> 00:50:15.510 align:middle line:84%
You will see the teaching
of these new parents,

00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:18.970 align:middle line:84%
the programming, is being
altered substantially

00:50:18.970 --> 00:50:24.250 align:middle line:84%
because the modeling
is different.

00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:29.850 align:middle line:84%
They are being
taught differently.

00:50:29.850 --> 00:50:36.520 align:middle line:84%
They are being shown a different
way to operate in life.

00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:37.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:50:37.450 --> 00:50:40.050 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking at
three generations

00:50:40.050 --> 00:50:43.420 align:middle line:84%
before we start seeing this
real integration, so to speak,

00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:43.920 align:middle line:90%
occur.

00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:45.900 align:middle line:84%
And then after that,
we start seeing

00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:49.670 align:middle line:84%
physicality of the human
species begin to change.

00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And also, at this time,
as we spoke to Metatron

00:50:52.170 --> 00:50:55.550 align:middle line:84%
in the last conversation,
because of this integration

00:50:55.550 --> 00:51:00.610 align:middle line:84%
and unity of polarities,
of body-soul, mind-spirit

00:51:00.610 --> 00:51:06.170 align:middle line:84%
emotions, he was saying that our
lifespans will be considerably

00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:09.900 align:middle line:84%
different by that time, too,
which should be coinciding

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:12.140 align:middle line:90%
with a reduction in population.

00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:13.800 align:middle line:84%
So what kind of
lifespans will we

00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:18.210 align:middle line:84%
be living, as you say, a few
generations out, in, say, 1,000

00:51:18.210 --> 00:51:20.390 align:middle line:90%
or 2,000 years and beyond?

00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:23.620 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: Well, it will
not be unusual for a being

00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:28.870 align:middle line:84%
to take embodiment for
300, 500, 600 years,

00:51:28.870 --> 00:51:34.800 align:middle line:84%
because the body can maintain
itself and repair itself

00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:41.410 align:middle line:84%
at a cellular level, not
from the state of replicating

00:51:41.410 --> 00:51:50.070 align:middle line:84%
the aged diseased cell, but from
its original perfected state.

00:51:50.070 --> 00:51:53.180 align:middle line:90%
It replicates from that state.

00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:57.130 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the
decision to drop the body

00:51:57.130 --> 00:52:03.510 align:middle line:84%
or to leave the body will be
a very conscious decision.

00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:04.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:08.670 align:middle line:84%
So the bringing together
of all of these polarities,

00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:12.910 align:middle line:84%
masculine-feminine, drawing
the spirit into matter,

00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:16.220 align:middle line:84%
bridging the functions of
our brain, right and left

00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:18.970 align:middle line:84%
hemisphere, into a
coherent state, all of this

00:52:18.970 --> 00:52:23.800 align:middle line:84%
will result in this movement
toward this expanded

00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:27.510 align:middle line:84%
state of awareness,
health, and longevity,

00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:31.400 align:middle line:84%
and moving also toward
androgyny as a species,

00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:35.960 align:middle line:84%
as you say they do in the
eighth-dimensional area

00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:36.750 align:middle line:90%
on Sirius.

00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:37.500 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Correct.

00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:38.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:52:38.250 --> 00:52:39.270 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Correct.

00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:45.830 align:middle line:84%
So you see how devastating
it was to humanity

00:52:45.830 --> 00:52:49.900 align:middle line:84%
when the restriction of a
third-dimensional matrix

00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:55.810 align:middle line:84%
was put in place on the
Earth, how that split

00:52:55.810 --> 00:53:00.690 align:middle line:84%
every part of them, those
that decided to ride it out

00:53:00.690 --> 00:53:02.100 align:middle line:90%
and to make the difference.

00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:05.910 align:middle line:84%
It split every
part of themselves

00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:09.520 align:middle line:84%
on a physical as well
as a non-physical level.

00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:10.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:53:10.650 --> 00:53:14.920 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: And that split
has to come into unification

00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:19.530 align:middle line:84%
on all levels, at
every level, and it

00:53:19.530 --> 00:53:27.580 align:middle line:84%
will take great creative
power to do that.

00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:29.020 align:middle line:90%
It is being done.

00:53:29.020 --> 00:53:35.930 align:middle line:84%
If you will notice, watch,
look, it is being done now.

00:53:35.930 --> 00:53:36.810 align:middle line:90%
It is starting.

00:53:36.810 --> 00:53:38.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:40.380 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: It will take a while.

00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:43.630 align:middle line:90%
It didn't happen overnight.

00:53:43.630 --> 00:53:49.730 align:middle line:84%
But it will occur, and it
will give you the courage

00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:53.220 align:middle line:84%
to sustain your
life a little longer

00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:58.360 align:middle line:84%
and to contribute to this change
and alteration, the bringing

00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:05.890 align:middle line:84%
about of unification, the
bringing about of this love

00:54:05.890 --> 00:54:12.290 align:middle line:84%
element that is so much
a part of who you are.

00:54:12.290 --> 00:54:15.310 align:middle line:90%
And it is a very powerful.

00:54:15.310 --> 00:54:17.800 align:middle line:84%
You do not yet
understand the power

00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:22.370 align:middle line:84%
of love and the energetics
that it contains.

00:54:22.370 --> 00:54:25.310 align:middle line:90%
It is not just an emotion.

00:54:25.310 --> 00:54:26.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:26.350 --> 00:54:30.700 align:middle line:84%
As one physicist that we
know, William Tiller, says,

00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:36.000 align:middle line:84%
he calls it the universal
solvent, the thing

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.430 align:middle line:90%
that bridges all things.

00:54:38.430 --> 00:54:40.110 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Correct.

00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:42.684 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
which is beautiful.

00:54:42.684 --> 00:54:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And, Anna, before we
end this conversation,

00:54:47.050 --> 00:54:49.590 align:middle line:84%
I would like to talk
about the communication.

00:54:49.590 --> 00:54:52.390 align:middle line:84%
At this time, we tend
to still be very much

00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:55.820 align:middle line:84%
in left brain
dialogue in general.

00:54:55.820 --> 00:55:00.090 align:middle line:84%
It's respected over
the feminine aspect

00:55:00.090 --> 00:55:03.080 align:middle line:84%
of the dialogue, the
masculine over the feminine,

00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:04.870 align:middle line:90%
because it gives you facts.

00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:08.510 align:middle line:84%
It can tie things into our
timelines and so forth.

00:55:08.510 --> 00:55:11.030 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
what happens when

00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:13.100 align:middle line:84%
we start evolving
beyond that, what

00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:19.640 align:middle line:84%
our conversation between each
other starts looking like.

00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:23.630 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: The first
thing that happens in

00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:30.990 align:middle line:84%
that unification is the
value of each one engaged

00:55:30.990 --> 00:55:37.370 align:middle line:84%
in that conversation
having consideration, value

00:55:37.370 --> 00:55:42.880 align:middle line:84%
for the other, not being
in a position of dominance,

00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:51.740 align:middle line:84%
but allowing that perspective
to be shared without judgment.

00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:57.290 align:middle line:84%
So it is in the value of
that relationship that

00:55:57.290 --> 00:56:00.570 align:middle line:90%
shifts and changes.

00:56:00.570 --> 00:56:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And so there is not
this consideration of,

00:56:03.650 --> 00:56:07.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm in a masculine body,
therefore I am either dominant

00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:13.025 align:middle line:84%
or I'm better than because
I think more coherently.

00:56:13.025 --> 00:56:13.525 align:middle line:90%
Incorrect.

00:56:13.525 --> 00:56:18.180 align:middle line:90%


00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:20.550 align:middle line:90%
The same way for the feminine.

00:56:20.550 --> 00:56:26.100 align:middle line:84%
She can stand in her own power,
thinking her thoughts very

00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:33.590 align:middle line:84%
coherently, feeling her emotions
very coherently, and discussing

00:56:33.590 --> 00:56:39.750 align:middle line:84%
that, communicating that
within the relationship.

00:56:39.750 --> 00:56:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Not feeling superior
to, but just

00:56:43.770 --> 00:56:49.230 align:middle line:84%
in this wonderful dialogue,
this beautiful communication,

00:56:49.230 --> 00:56:53.920 align:middle line:84%
whether it be spoken or it's
an energetic interface that

00:56:53.920 --> 00:57:00.510 align:middle line:84%
takes place, valuing each
one engaged in that interface

00:57:00.510 --> 00:57:07.040 align:middle line:84%
for who they are and what they
bring to the relationship.

00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:13.920 align:middle line:84%
That value must be present in
order for this shift to occur,

00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:20.714 align:middle line:84%
valuing self first, and then
valuing the interaction.

00:57:20.714 --> 00:57:22.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, that
makes perfect sense.

00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:24.070 align:middle line:90%
We have to start where we can.

00:57:24.070 --> 00:57:27.110 align:middle line:84%
That's our responsibility, to
be respectful to one another

00:57:27.110 --> 00:57:29.920 align:middle line:90%
and fully hear one another.

00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:32.950 align:middle line:84%
Anna, is there anything
else before we sign off

00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:37.330 align:middle line:84%
on this conversation about
the essence of the polarities

00:57:37.330 --> 00:57:41.890 align:middle line:84%
of masculine-feminine
and their reunification?

00:57:41.890 --> 00:57:45.820 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: I would just
urge you, whether you

00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:51.040 align:middle line:84%
are in a feminine body
or a masculine body,

00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:55.300 align:middle line:84%
to consider what I have
said in this discussion

00:57:55.300 --> 00:58:00.180 align:middle line:84%
and consider the beauty,
the full beauty of you,

00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:04.340 align:middle line:84%
as it is layered in that
soul spirit of yours

00:58:04.340 --> 00:58:07.990 align:middle line:84%
and that expression
of the divine.

00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:15.360 align:middle line:84%
Honoring the fact that you have
both components within you,

00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:17.860 align:middle line:84%
and that you can
operate within that

00:58:17.860 --> 00:58:21.020 align:middle line:90%
in a very unified expression.

00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:24.830 align:middle line:84%
But first you must
value and recognize

00:58:24.830 --> 00:58:27.590 align:middle line:90%
that it is part of who you are.

00:58:27.590 --> 00:58:28.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:32.340 align:middle line:84%
>>WALKER: Not constantly
restricting yourself

00:58:32.340 --> 00:58:37.580 align:middle line:84%
because you have a masculine
or a feminine body,

00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:41.120 align:middle line:84%
where you have a faulty
perception that one

00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:48.650 align:middle line:84%
is better than another, when
in reality they are the same.

00:58:48.650 --> 00:58:54.240 align:middle line:84%
They are total expression
of that divine image.

00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:59.010 align:middle line:84%
So when you notice
yourself and how

00:58:59.010 --> 00:59:03.470 align:middle line:84%
you operate within a
more balanced expression

00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:07.080 align:middle line:84%
of your divine masculine
and feminine attributes,

00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:14.200 align:middle line:84%
then that becomes a
very ingrained program,

00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:18.100 align:middle line:84%
and it alters what
you have been taught

00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:20.710 align:middle line:84%
from that fallen state
of consciousness.

00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:29.960 align:middle line:84%
It alters your ability to stand
in your beauty and wholeness.

00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:33.320 align:middle line:90%


00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:35.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Anna, thank you
very much for coming through

00:59:35.690 --> 00:59:38.250 align:middle line:84%
and joining us to explain
some of these things.

00:59:38.250 --> 00:59:41.280 align:middle line:84%
I think there is some
definite new information

00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:43.210 align:middle line:90%
in there for many of us.

00:59:43.210 --> 00:59:47.630 align:middle line:84%
And again, thank you
for your presence .

00:59:47.630 --> 00:59:50.940 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: You are most welcome.

00:59:50.940 --> 00:59:53.750 align:middle line:90%
I will withdraw now.

00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:55.006 align:middle line:90%
Blessings.

00:59:55.006 --> 00:59:55.992 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:59:55.992 --> 01:00:00.430 align:middle line:90%


01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:01.275 align:middle line:10%
And she's back.

01:00:01.275 --> 01:00:02.930 align:middle line:10%
>>WALKER: And I'm back.

01:00:02.930 --> 01:00:04.950 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Joan, we
are out of time,

01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:07.310 align:middle line:10%
and that just kind
of flew by for me.

01:00:07.310 --> 01:00:10.360 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for joining me again.

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And there are always
such unique perspectives

01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:17.460 align:middle line:84%
when you're talking with various
beings from various realms,

01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:20.140 align:middle line:84%
and each one has their
way of expressing it.

01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:22.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
because it brings up in us

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:24.692 align:middle line:84%
all of the belief
systems we have.

01:00:24.692 --> 01:00:25.650 align:middle line:90%
We've been taught this.

01:00:25.650 --> 01:00:28.250 align:middle line:84%
We follow this system, this
religion, and so forth.

01:00:28.250 --> 01:00:31.350 align:middle line:84%
And so it's within each of
us to just go inside and find

01:00:31.350 --> 01:00:34.110 align:middle line:84%
what we resonate
with as our own truth

01:00:34.110 --> 01:00:36.820 align:middle line:90%
and beauty and all information.

01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:37.570 align:middle line:90%
>>WALKER: Correct.

01:00:37.570 --> 01:00:39.900 align:middle line:90%
It's about having an open mind.

01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:42.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
right, open minds.

01:00:42.590 --> 01:00:44.070 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Joan.

01:00:44.070 --> 01:00:45.190 align:middle line:10%
>>WALKER: You're welcome

01:00:45.190 --> 01:00:46.370 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And
please, I would like

01:00:46.370 --> 01:00:47.870 align:middle line:10%
you to let me know
if you would like

01:00:47.870 --> 01:00:49.300 align:middle line:10%
more of these conversations.

01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:52.230 align:middle line:10%
And you can let us know
through my Gaiam Facebook page.

01:00:52.230 --> 01:00:53.500 align:middle line:10%
