00:00:19.572 --> 00:00:21.030 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
To me, the point

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.920 align:middle line:10%
of the shamanic traditions
around the world

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.440 align:middle line:10%
should be to instill
a deep confidence

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.540 align:middle line:10%
in our own intuitive capacity.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.330 align:middle line:84%
Imagine how life on earth
would be if we could each tap

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.620 align:middle line:90%
into our essential truths.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.280 align:middle line:84%
Instead, we're led to follow
others' intuitive abilities

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.800 align:middle line:84%
and stories, perpetually
marginalizing

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.230 align:middle line:84%
our own capacities
for discerning truth.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.670 align:middle line:84%
Jean Slater is
here with me today

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.355 align:middle line:84%
to demonstrate that
everyone can have access

00:00:44.355 --> 00:00:46.230 align:middle line:84%
to higher intuition, no
matter whether you're

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.660 align:middle line:90%
right- or left-brain dominant.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.000 align:middle line:84%
Welcome, jean, it's good to
have you on the show again.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.280 align:middle line:84%
It's been about five years,
I think, since our last time.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:53.860 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN SLATTER: Oh, my gosh.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:54.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Yeah.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.305 align:middle line:90%
It's been a long time--

00:00:56.305 --> 00:00:56.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Nice to be here.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --when we were
over in the other studios.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.670 align:middle line:84%
And you know, we decided
to do this and then,

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.300 align:middle line:84%
in leading up to it, we
did a little experiment

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.790 align:middle line:84%
on a little live show with
a small audience just,

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.040 align:middle line:84%
playing with the
subject of intuition

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.340 align:middle line:90%
and how it comes to each of us.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.830 align:middle line:84%
And what was so cool is that it
was very clearly demonstrated

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.610 align:middle line:84%
that you and I have almost
180-degree opposite ways

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.390 align:middle line:84%
of coming at accessing
our intuition.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And so the people
were saying god,

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.112 align:middle line:84%
I love it because
I always think,

00:01:25.112 --> 00:01:27.570 align:middle line:84%
gee, I have to do it this way,
or I have to do it that way.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.830 align:middle line:90%
You're saying no.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.030 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Right.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.120 align:middle line:10%
The whole idea of intuition
can be very intimidating

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.340 align:middle line:10%
to many people.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, You think
you have to be gifted.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.630 align:middle line:90%
Not true.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: True.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.410 align:middle line:84%
Or go through a
near-death experience.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:40.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: No.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.180 align:middle line:84%
But the truth of it is that,
that voice of our higher

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.122 align:middle line:84%
guidance is alive and well
in each and every one of us.

00:01:48.122 --> 00:01:50.580 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, because
we are spiritual beings having

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.700 align:middle line:84%
a human experience, we are
never separated from it.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.795 align:middle line:90%
So it's always accessible.

00:01:54.795 --> 00:01:56.878 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, but we
sure know how to ignore it.

00:01:56.878 --> 00:01:57.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Oh, boy.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.420 align:middle line:84%
I think we're trained,
we're brainwashed

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.340 align:middle line:84%
into valuing our logic
and ignoring the one

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.908 align:middle line:90%
part of us that actually has--

00:02:06.908 --> 00:02:07.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --that matters.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: --so much
Information to get to.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:10.725 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:02:10.725 --> 00:02:12.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, no, it's interesting,
because I met you

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.080 align:middle line:90%
many years ago.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, you
were working full time

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.050 align:middle line:90%
as a naturopathic health coach.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.270 align:middle line:84%
And you were very
successful with people

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.070 align:middle line:84%
because you were
using divination

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.387 align:middle line:84%
as part of the practice,
which is why I originally

00:02:25.387 --> 00:02:26.970 align:middle line:84%
interviewed you and
your book, "Hiring

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.390 align:middle line:90%
the Heavens," of course.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.780 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk a
little bit about where

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.510 align:middle line:84%
you stumbled into
the use of divination

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.040 align:middle line:84%
to access your
higher consciousness.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.060 align:middle line:84%
Because you had been in jobs
prior and earlier in your life

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.320 align:middle line:90%
that were very left brain.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Well, I was
installing mainframe computers

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.060 align:middle line:84%
for heaven's sake's,
very left brain.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And I would never have
considered myself intuitive.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.450 align:middle line:84%
But working as a traditional
nature path kind of

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.530 align:middle line:90%
forced me into it.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.560 align:middle line:84%
Because wanting to help
my clients in the best way

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.050 align:middle line:84%
that I could, I soon
found out that I could not

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.000 align:middle line:90%
stick with just the physical.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.500 align:middle line:84%
I could not stick
but just talking

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.680 align:middle line:84%
about nutrition or biology
or nutrients or something

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.480 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.670 align:middle line:84%
I had to expand into what's
going on in your life?

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.750 align:middle line:84%
What would be the cause of
the particular condition

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:19.830 align:middle line:90%
that you have?

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.320 align:middle line:84%
You see, everybody's
got a life journey.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And whatever is
going on physically,

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.720 align:middle line:84%
there's usually an
emotional or mental belief

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.030 align:middle line:90%
or spiritual issue behind it.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And an example would be a client
that I was working with that

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.270 align:middle line:90%
was having thyroid issues.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.520 align:middle line:84%
Her doctor said they
were thyroid issues.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.340 align:middle line:84%
All her blood tests showed
they were thyroid issues.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.215 align:middle line:84%
And yet, when I began to work
with her, her guidance said,

00:03:45.215 --> 00:03:46.590 align:middle line:84%
you can take all
the supplements.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.780 align:middle line:84%
You want you can take all
the medication you want,

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.720 align:middle line:84%
and it's not going to resolve
the problem, because this

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.960 align:middle line:84%
has to do with
something her soul wants

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.370 align:middle line:90%
her to understand and to learn.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And so in checking in
with her higher guidance

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.440 align:middle line:84%
and using divination to find
out what was really happening,

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.780 align:middle line:84%
her guidance said that it
had to do with an issue that

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.590 align:middle line:90%
happened when she was 29.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.730 align:middle line:84%
I said, what happened
when you were 29?

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.550 align:middle line:90%
She said I got married.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.490 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, tell me
about what that means.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.769 align:middle line:90%
And she immediately knew.

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.890 align:middle line:84%
You see, when she
decided to get married,

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.050 align:middle line:90%
her husband was quite a player.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And she told
herself, things will

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.710 align:middle line:90%
change after they get married.

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.920 align:middle line:84%
She threw out all of
their married life,

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.060 align:middle line:84%
never spoke up about it, and
he continued to be a player.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you don't speak
up and tell your truth,

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.330 align:middle line:90%
that affects your throat chakra.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: And it
affects your thyroid.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.280 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: So here it is.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.160 align:middle line:84%
She has been on
medication for years, been

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.030 align:middle line:90%
doing all these different--

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.210 align:middle line:84%
herbology and
nutrient techniques

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.650 align:middle line:90%
to try to resolve the problem.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't have to
do with that at all.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.150 align:middle line:84%
So very early on, I learned
that, if you're really

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.100 align:middle line:84%
going to work with
healing, you have

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.430 align:middle line:84%
to bring an insight from
the one part of you that

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.320 align:middle line:90%
actually knows what's going on.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And that is your
higher guidance.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And your higher guidance
knows everything about you.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.125 align:middle line:84%
And yet we tend to
ignore that part.

00:05:11.125 --> 00:05:12.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
really what you're

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.940 align:middle line:84%
devoted to is helping
people access that.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.270 align:middle line:90%
That's my passion as well.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
we really connect,

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.185 align:middle line:84%
even though we have very
different ways of doing it.

00:05:20.185 --> 00:05:21.560 align:middle line:84%
So now, one of
the tools that you

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.910 align:middle line:84%
played with when you were
doing that, and you still use,

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:24.710 align:middle line:90%
which is--

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:25.220 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.553 align:middle line:90%
I have a couple of them at home.

00:05:26.553 --> 00:05:28.220 align:middle line:84%
You turned me on
to it 10 years ago.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.950 align:middle line:10%
This book, which
is by Dale Olson--

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.990 align:middle line:10%
and it's basically a
pendulum chart book, right?

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.790 align:middle line:10%
It's just--

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:34.360 align:middle line:10%
>>SLATTER: It is.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.340 align:middle line:84%
It's the Doorway to Knowing
Your Intuitive Mind.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.010 align:middle line:84%
So it has all these charts
and it, has nutrients,

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.380 align:middle line:84%
it has salts, it has
yes/nos, conditions,

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.200 align:middle line:90%
mental, physical, emotional.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.360 align:middle line:84%
So when you were working
with your clients,

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.430 align:middle line:84%
you could tap into
this, especially

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:50.390 align:middle line:90%
doing phone readings.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.070 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know
what was going on.

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.730 align:middle line:90%
You'd have your chart open.

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.600 align:middle line:84%
You'd have your pendulum
swinging and say,

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm hearing you,
but this is what

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting for you, right?

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:00.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Right.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.982 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
you're trying to do

00:06:01.982 --> 00:06:05.120 align:middle line:84%
is teach people how to go
and access this themselves.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Absolutely.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that is
so important about using

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.110 align:middle line:84%
any kind of divination
tool, whether it

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.990 align:middle line:84%
be the pendulum or
oracles, is understanding

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.650 align:middle line:84%
that there's a message
that's trying to be delivered

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:18.450 align:middle line:90%
by your guidance.

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:19.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All the time.

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: And so it's about
getting, what is that message?

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:28.252 align:middle line:84%
Avoiding yes and no answers
is of paramount importance.

00:06:28.252 --> 00:06:29.960 align:middle line:84%
Because if you don't
do that, if you just

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.030 align:middle line:84%
asked yes and no
questions, you're

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.390 align:middle line:84%
going to get misled and
confused and, ultimately,

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:36.650 align:middle line:90%
become disillusioned.

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.960 align:middle line:84%
For example, let's just say
that you have a new job offer,

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.130 align:middle line:84%
and you're wanting to know
from your higher guidance,

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:44.757 align:middle line:90%
should you take this job?

00:06:44.757 --> 00:06:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And so you get out your pendulum
and ask a yes or no question,

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.110 align:middle line:90%
should I do this?

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:52.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, what if your
guidance wants to say,

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.500 align:middle line:84%
the timing isn't right
to move into this job.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.470 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we want to
move into it later,

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.840 align:middle line:84%
five months down the
road, but not right now.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.290 align:middle line:84%
Or yes, we want you
to take this job,

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.540 align:middle line:90%
but it's not your ultimate job.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you're just
asking yes and no,

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.460 align:middle line:84%
and you get that
yes and no, you're

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:15.343 align:middle line:84%
going to run with that answer
and then may get confused later

00:07:15.343 --> 00:07:16.760 align:middle line:84%
on when you say,
well, my guidance

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.790 align:middle line:84%
said this or that when what
guidance was trying to do

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.500 align:middle line:90%
was convey a message to you.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.110 align:middle line:84%
So rather than asking
yes and no, things

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:27.650 align:middle line:84%
like, how strongly would my
higher guidance recommend

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:29.810 align:middle line:84%
on a scale of 1 to
100 then I shouldn't

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:32.520 align:middle line:90%
take this job at this time?

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.340 align:middle line:84%
So the quality of
your questions is

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.460 align:middle line:84%
going to determine how well you
understand what your guidance

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:38.660 align:middle line:90%
is trying to tell you.

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:39.535 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:07:39.535 --> 00:07:43.545 align:middle line:84%
And that book is just one tool
of many, but your own work--

00:07:43.545 --> 00:07:45.170 align:middle line:84%
I think that I admire
about what you've

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:48.350 align:middle line:84%
done is you have a
compendium of protocols that

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:53.670 align:middle line:84%
are so clean and so direct that
you, really, it's reference

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:56.390 align:middle line:84%
and cross-reference that
you can't screw up in terms

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:58.380 align:middle line:90%
of divining your truth.

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:01.970 align:middle line:84%
So that's because, again, for
you, you need a lot of proof.

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:04.550 align:middle line:84%
You tended to be very
left-brained in your approach,

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:05.960 align:middle line:90%
like, very logical.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.450 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at the
difference between, say,

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:12.380 align:middle line:84%
what left-brain intuition
looks like versus right-brain

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:13.830 align:middle line:90%
intuition.

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Well,
and you're going

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.270 align:middle line:84%
to be able to speak
to the right brain.

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:21.800 align:middle line:84%
But for me, left
brain is approach

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:26.000 align:middle line:84%
is, I want I want a
protocol of questions.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't necessarily, at
least in the beginning,

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:32.210 align:middle line:90%
didn't feel an answer.

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:35.630 align:middle line:84%
And instead, it was
something that I

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:38.240 align:middle line:84%
had to process
through my logic mind.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And so the questions
that I came up with

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:44.288 align:middle line:84%
were process-oriented
and logic-oriented.

00:08:44.288 --> 00:08:45.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, very
clear protocols.

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:47.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah, right.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And other people,
though, just are

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:53.090 align:middle line:84%
able to intuit an answer
immediately by how they feel.

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:56.330 align:middle line:84%
And it all comes down
to what works for you?

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:57.990 align:middle line:90%
What's right for you?

00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:03.890 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to someone
who is logic or even intuitive,

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:07.550 align:middle line:84%
the thing that's important to
understand is that the idea

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:09.890 align:middle line:84%
that we all have
our answers within,

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:14.450 align:middle line:84%
and if you just somehow quiet
yourself and get into that--

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:17.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That
wonderful zen place.

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:19.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: --that,
somehow, that truth is just

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.490 align:middle line:84%
going to appear to you, I
think that's very misleading.

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:26.390 align:middle line:84%
Because the truth of it is
that, if you don't have a way

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:29.635 align:middle line:84%
to get outside your mind
and get verification,

00:09:29.635 --> 00:09:31.010 align:middle line:84%
you actually don't
know if you're

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:32.670 align:middle line:90%
telling yourself the truth.

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:34.250 align:middle line:90%
And here's why.

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:35.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's
so many filters.

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:37.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: There's
so many filters.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.070 align:middle line:84%
There's actually like four
main reasons why we have

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:42.080 align:middle line:90%
difficulty accessing our truth.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And the first one is the
filters that we have.

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:46.280 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about
the experiment

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.260 align:middle line:90%
that was done with the gorilla.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:49.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:50.970 align:middle line:90%
That was embarrassing.

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:53.500 align:middle line:84%
I did that one, and although
there are a whole bunch of us.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:57.440 align:middle line:10%
And this is the video of the
basketball players throwing

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.880 align:middle line:10%
the balls back and forth
and the gorilla passing

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:00.680 align:middle line:10%
through the room.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:01.975 align:middle line:10%
So you can find it on YouTube.

00:10:01.975 --> 00:10:03.350 align:middle line:10%
I don't remember
what it's under,

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:05.210 align:middle line:10%
but I think using those
search words, you can find it.

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:06.020 align:middle line:10%
>>SLATTER: The Missing Gorilla.

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:07.160 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah, The
Missing Gorilla.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:08.060 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:08.860 align:middle line:10%
>>SLATTER: Yeah.

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:11.300 align:middle line:10%
So an audience
was asked to watch

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:15.080 align:middle line:10%
how often the people
in the white t-shirts

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.130 align:middle line:10%
passed the basketball.

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:19.130 align:middle line:10%
So they are focused in on that.

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:20.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way
our mind works.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.160 align:middle line:84%
We pick a focus, and we
don't see anything else.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile, a gorilla
walks into the room

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:28.350 align:middle line:84%
and thumps his chest
and then walks off.

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:32.165 align:middle line:84%
And then the audience is asked,
did you seek the gorilla?

00:10:32.165 --> 00:10:34.020 align:middle line:90%
And they go, what gorilla?

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:35.000 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You know.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.783 align:middle line:10%
I know because I
did it at the time

00:10:36.783 --> 00:10:39.200 align:middle line:10%
that-- you, of course, know
when-- you all, spoiler alert,

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.320 align:middle line:10%
you know what it is now.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.623 align:middle line:10%
But for those who haven't
done it, I did it,

00:10:43.623 --> 00:10:46.040 align:middle line:10%
and there were a few other
people in the room that did it.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.530 align:middle line:84%
Only one out of the group
of us saw the gorilla.

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:50.520 align:middle line:84%
I did not see the
gorilla, I was so focused.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:51.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yes.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.237 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it was so
embarrassing to think,

00:10:53.237 --> 00:10:56.300 align:middle line:84%
how can the brain trick
ourselves like that?

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:58.790 align:middle line:84%
It's really, that's-- I
thank you for bringing it up.

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:01.800 align:middle line:84%
It is one of the most shocking
demonstrations of the filters

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:02.600 align:middle line:90%
we use.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.725 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: We have filters.

00:11:03.725 --> 00:11:07.130 align:middle line:84%
We also create pictures
in our mind of what

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:08.990 align:middle line:90%
we are expecting to see.

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And this happened for
me fairly recently

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:14.660 align:middle line:84%
when I was looking in
my shelves of cookbooks

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.540 align:middle line:84%
for a particular book I
purchased three months prior.

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And my picture in my head
was, it was a large, 11

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:24.380 align:middle line:90%
by 14 hardbound cookbook.

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And so as I was looking
through my shelves,

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:29.010 align:middle line:90%
I could not find it.

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:31.310 align:middle line:84%
I asked my son's
girlfriend to look for it.

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:32.518 align:middle line:90%
She could not see it.

00:11:32.518 --> 00:11:34.310 align:middle line:84%
After I described what
it was looking like,

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:36.230 align:middle line:84%
she goes, OK, tell me
what it looks like.

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:39.320 align:middle line:84%
She looked through all the
shelves-- could not find it.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm frustrated,
so I asked my son.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.830 align:middle line:84%
Will you please look
for this cookbook.

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:47.210 align:middle line:84%
Here's the name, but this
time I didn't describe it.

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:50.025 align:middle line:84%
Immediately, he was
able to find it.

00:11:50.025 --> 00:11:51.150 align:middle line:90%
Why was he able to find it?

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:52.040 align:middle line:90%
Because he didn't have that.

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The mental
construct, yeah.

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:56.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Yeah,
so in my mind, I

00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:58.520 align:middle line:84%
had created a picture
of what it looked like.

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:03.500 align:middle line:84%
Turns out, it was a softbound,
small book about this size.

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.210 align:middle line:90%
So that's another reason.

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:08.120 align:middle line:84%
A third reason why we can't
tell ourselves the truth

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:12.260 align:middle line:84%
comes from ontology, which
is the study of being--

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:16.220 align:middle line:84%
you would think, as very
intelligent beings, what

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:20.690 align:middle line:84%
we would do is collect
data from our observations

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:23.570 align:middle line:84%
and make a conclusion
based upon that.

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:25.880 align:middle line:90%
That's not how our mind works.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:29.240 align:middle line:84%
What happens is, we come up
with the conclusion first,

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.550 align:middle line:84%
and then we selectively
pick out evidence

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:33.080 align:middle line:90%
that proves we are right.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's
what we do, yeah.

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:37.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: We are always
proving ourselves right.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.710 align:middle line:84%
And so what we
will do is, we will

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:44.580 align:middle line:84%
see evidence that supports our
conclusion, our point of view.

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we can't
tell ourselves the truth.

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And the last reason why we
can't tell ourselves the truth,

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:51.980 align:middle line:84%
and we don't even
know if we are,

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:53.570 align:middle line:84%
is because we
don't actually know

00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:55.370 align:middle line:90%
if our thoughts are our own.

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And the vast majority
of our thoughts aren't.

00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:00.530 align:middle line:84%
They are programmed,
programmed from our parents,

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:03.980 align:middle line:84%
from childhood, from
our peers, from society,

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:05.600 align:middle line:90%
from mass consciousness.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.630 align:middle line:84%
We don't even know if
our thoughts are our own.

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And so when we sit back in
that quiet space, and we say,

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:15.252 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm going to intuit
the truth here, how do we--

00:13:15.252 --> 00:13:16.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have to
bypass all of that.

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:17.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah.

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:20.060 align:middle line:84%
How do we know we're really
telling ourselves the truth?

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, you need to
get out of your head,

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:25.940 align:middle line:90%
out of your mind confirmation.

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'll give you an example
of how I recently got out

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:33.110 align:middle line:90%
of my mind confirmation here.

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:37.970 align:middle line:84%
I was asking and thinking
about a particular relationship

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:41.300 align:middle line:84%
in my life where
I felt that it had

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:45.350 align:middle line:84%
to do with the theme
of rescue, rescue,

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:48.470 align:middle line:84%
and the knight in
shining armor comes,

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:51.770 align:middle line:84%
and there's all this fantasy
that, if I'm rescued,

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:56.280 align:middle line:84%
then all my troubles are solved,
and I live happily ever after.

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:57.080 align:middle line:90%
So I thought--

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.538 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Believe it or not,
that's actually a bigger theme

00:13:59.538 --> 00:14:01.700 align:middle line:84%
than we think, in a
lot of women's lives.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:03.460 align:middle line:84%
Even though we oh,
I'm self-empowered.

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:05.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't need anybody
to rescue me.

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:09.380 align:middle line:84%
Deep at the core, over
lifetimes and thousands

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:11.812 align:middle line:84%
of years of programming
and dependency--

00:14:11.812 --> 00:14:13.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Not to
mention all the novels.

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.687 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That can be a
core belief-- and the novels

00:14:15.687 --> 00:14:18.380 align:middle line:84%
and fantasy, that is a more of a
core belief than a lot of women

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:20.450 align:middle line:90%
would ever care to see or admit.

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:21.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: It totally is.

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:26.580 align:middle line:84%
So I felt this relationship
had that theme behind it.

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:30.530 align:middle line:84%
So I asked my guidance,
can you explain to me

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:33.890 align:middle line:84%
what this theme is, completely
open to maybe it's something

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:36.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm not seeing, knowing
that you can't see something

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:38.090 align:middle line:90%
till you can see it, right?

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And you're not
aware of something

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:41.270 align:middle line:90%
until you're aware of it.

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:44.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, I have over 90
oracles in my home.

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:45.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:48.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Not that anyone
has to go to that extent.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.660 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I'm obsessed.

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:54.500 align:middle line:84%
But I want different
sources of words.

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.050 align:middle line:84%
The more sources of
words that I have,

00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:59.270 align:middle line:84%
the more accurately
my higher guidance

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:02.970 align:middle line:84%
can pick exactly what
they want to convey to me.

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:06.560 align:middle line:84%
So out of my 90 oracles,
I used my pendulum

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:09.170 align:middle line:84%
to dowse which oracle
had the answer.

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:11.510 align:middle line:84%
So is it on this shelf,
this shelf, this shelf.

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:15.080 align:middle line:84%
Narrow it down, pull the oracle
out, lay the cards out, pull

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.010 align:middle line:90%
the card, what is it called?

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:18.910 align:middle line:90%
Rescue.

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:20.633 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
this is amazing.

00:15:20.633 --> 00:15:22.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Yeah,
and it talked all

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:24.060 align:middle line:84%
about the knight
in shining armor,

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:26.370 align:middle line:90%
and are you waiting to be saved?

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:29.940 align:middle line:84%
So two things happen, Regina,
when you get that kind

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:35.820 align:middle line:84%
of out-of-your-head response
and confirmation, two things.

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:39.630 align:middle line:84%
One, you certainly
get confirmation

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:41.940 align:middle line:84%
about what you felt
was your truth.

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:45.180 align:middle line:84%
You have absolute
confirmation about that now.

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:48.840 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, and the more
profound thing is,

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:54.120 align:middle line:84%
you have no doubt
in your mind at all

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:57.380 align:middle line:84%
that you are being spoken to
by something beyond your logic.

00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:58.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:00.750 align:middle line:84%
Because the odds
choosing that card out

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:04.950 align:middle line:84%
what is it, what 50 cards in
a deck and 90 decks, yeah,

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:06.120 align:middle line:90%
the odds are against it.

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:09.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: You know that you are
being spoken to, that something

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:13.380 align:middle line:84%
beyond your intellect has
now been able to convey

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:14.640 align:middle line:90%
a message to you.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And this begins
to create a trust

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:21.600 align:middle line:84%
in that higher
intelligence, that higher

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.920 align:middle line:90%
mind, that is speaking to you.

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And once you have two
or three of those kinds

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:28.093 align:middle line:90%
of confirmations,

00:16:28.093 --> 00:16:29.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is the thing.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:29.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: It changes.

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:30.590 align:middle line:90%
your life.

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:32.123 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You have to practice.

00:16:32.123 --> 00:16:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And what I like
about your work is

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:38.400 align:middle line:84%
you have these very clear ways
of creating the questions.

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.800 align:middle line:84%
And because you,
yourself, as a person,

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.080 align:middle line:84%
you're one of the least
self-delusional people

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.100 align:middle line:90%
I've ever met.

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:46.770 align:middle line:84%
Because I know you pretty
well now over the years.

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And you're constantly
searching for the truth

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.120 align:middle line:90%
whether it's convenient or not.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.430 align:middle line:84%
And so that has allowed you
to create these very clean

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:54.600 align:middle line:90%
protocols, as I said.

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:57.900 align:middle line:84%
So when you go to get
words, you're even clearer.

00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:01.620 align:middle line:84%
You'll even divine, do I go to
the first, second, third shelf,

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:03.600 align:middle line:84%
and you'll come down,
how many books down?

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:04.810 align:middle line:90%
And then you open it up.

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:06.030 align:middle line:90%
You know what page.

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:08.760 align:middle line:84%
And all of this, you just
keep refining and refining

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.868 align:middle line:84%
and refining to look at what
an incredible result you got.

00:17:11.868 --> 00:17:14.550 align:middle line:84%
So now, a lot of people
who are left-brained

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:16.450 align:middle line:90%
feel, then, self-conscious.

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:18.869 align:middle line:84%
They'll think, oh, no,
that's for other people.

00:17:18.869 --> 00:17:20.829 align:middle line:84%
Only right-brained
people can get it right.

00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:23.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talented, skilled,
gifted in this way.

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:25.410 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people,
and most the world,

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:26.970 align:middle line:84%
of the Western
world in particular,

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:30.270 align:middle line:84%
were wired to be more dominant
in the left side of our brain

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:32.760 align:middle line:90%
and logical, that's most of us.

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And so they have a
self-consciousness

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:37.140 align:middle line:90%
around becoming intuitive.

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And I love what you do
because it basically blasts

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:42.360 align:middle line:90%
past that particular filter.

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.360 align:middle line:90%
I can't do it; I'm left-brained.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: That's one of
the reasons I love oracles.

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:52.650 align:middle line:84%
How much skill does it take
to pull a deck off your shelf,

00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:55.410 align:middle line:84%
shuffle the cards, and lay
them out, and pick them?

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:57.215 align:middle line:90%
How much skill does that take?

00:17:57.215 --> 00:17:59.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then, a lot
of times, you can do that

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:01.582 align:middle line:84%
and say, maybe it's
an Inconvenient truth.

00:18:01.582 --> 00:18:02.790 align:middle line:90%
It's like, I don't like that.

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:04.457 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do the
spread, and then you

00:18:04.457 --> 00:18:05.590 align:middle line:90%
draw the same card again.

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:08.200 align:middle line:84%
And that happens fairly
frequently, right?

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: It does.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
say, OK, I get it.

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:14.320 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I didn't want this to
be my answer, but here it is.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And so you and I were
talking about this,

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:19.590 align:middle line:84%
and I showed a different way
that I had done it because I

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:21.630 align:middle line:90%
operate opposite to you, right?

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And so an example for me in
my own life with that that

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:28.530 align:middle line:84%
was just kind of crazy
and embarrassing is,

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:29.950 align:middle line:90%
I had met this man.

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:32.427 align:middle line:84%
And we were just starting
to get to know each other.

00:18:32.427 --> 00:18:33.510 align:middle line:90%
And he lived in Vancouver.

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:35.135 align:middle line:84%
I was going to fly
out for the weekend,

00:18:35.135 --> 00:18:37.260 align:middle line:84%
and we just kind of have
fun, have dinner talk,

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:38.410 align:middle line:90%
get to know each other.

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:40.650 align:middle line:84%
But he didn't show up,
and he wasn't available,

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:42.360 align:middle line:90%
and it's like, ooh, I met--

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:44.520 align:middle line:84%
and when is the
designated meeting place,

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:45.900 align:middle line:90%
didn't answer the phone.

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:49.420 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm feeling like a
chump, like I've been played.

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:50.730 align:middle line:90%
And it's kind of embarrassing.

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:52.240 align:middle line:90%
It's, like, what happened?

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.960 align:middle line:84%
So I had time on my hands,
and I went to a bookstore.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.070 align:middle line:84%
It was called
Chapters at the time.

00:18:57.070 --> 00:19:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And there was this big table
of books that had the faces up.

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:03.420 align:middle line:84%
It was probably a sale
table or something.

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:06.790 align:middle line:84%
Just had lots of books
on this big long table.

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:10.120 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought, hmm, let's
see if there's a message here.

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:12.420 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm very oriented
toward the feeling you

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:16.010 align:middle line:84%
side of intuition,
right, And I guess

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:17.920 align:middle line:90%
clairsentience or whatever.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:20.880 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going like this
with my hand over the table

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.445 align:middle line:84%
until I felt a stickiness,
and my hand stopped.

00:19:23.445 --> 00:19:26.460 align:middle line:84%
I had my eyes closed and went
down on this yellow book,

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:28.380 align:middle line:90%
and it was a novel.

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:29.900 align:middle line:90%
What the heck?

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:33.690 align:middle line:84%
Opened the page, the exact
thing that actually turned out

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:35.933 align:middle line:90%
to be true is what I was told.

00:19:35.933 --> 00:19:38.100 align:middle line:84%
He hadn't split up with his
girlfriend named Alison.

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:41.220 align:middle line:84%
This was about a man cheating
on his wife named Alison

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:42.690 align:middle line:90%
and being busted and all this.

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:44.840 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, oh, my god.

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:48.142 align:middle line:84%
And it was right down to
the name of the girlfriend.

00:19:48.142 --> 00:19:49.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Oh, my gosh.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so it
can work both ways.

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:55.470 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I'd just gotten
comfortable with expansion

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:57.840 align:middle line:84%
and contraction of
energy and stickiness

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:01.410 align:middle line:84%
versus ephemeral
qualities of energy.

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:03.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: There are
four main ways that we

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:05.160 align:middle line:90%
receive intuitive information.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.470 align:middle line:84%
People are
clairsentient, like you,

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:11.130 align:middle line:84%
clairaudient where they
can actually hear a voice,

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:14.580 align:middle line:84%
claircognizant,
where they just know.

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:16.740 align:middle line:84%
They don't even know how
they know, they just know.

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:17.845 align:middle line:90%
And then clair--

00:20:17.845 --> 00:20:18.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --voyant

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:22.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: --voyant, where
they actually see information.

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.337 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people are
combinations of those.

00:20:24.337 --> 00:20:26.128 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm kind of
a combination of all,

00:20:26.128 --> 00:20:27.460 align:middle line:90%
depending on the situation.

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:29.650 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I see;
sometimes I hear.

00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:34.570 align:middle line:84%
But it's not just that it can
happen on command in any one

00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:36.107 align:middle line:90%
of those modalities, right?

00:20:36.107 --> 00:20:38.440 align:middle line:84%
It'll come in the way it's
going to come in that moment.

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:39.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yes.

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And for myself, especially
in the beginning, I needed,

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:50.360 align:middle line:84%
now, a confirmation of what I
felt was intuitive information.

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:53.650 align:middle line:84%
So for example, I might
have heard the voice,

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:56.840 align:middle line:84%
or I felt like I knew
what was going on.

00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:01.270 align:middle line:84%
But by getting outside of my
head and getting confirmation,

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:04.840 align:middle line:84%
another way, that's where
all doubt is removed.

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's also the point at which
you start to develop trust.

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:09.880 align:middle line:84%
When you're
clairsentient, sentient,

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:12.340 align:middle line:84%
and you actually
do have that gift,

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:15.250 align:middle line:84%
you kind of, your whole
life, are aware of it.

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:18.190 align:middle line:84%
And you live your life from
that knowing and bringing

00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:22.640 align:middle line:84%
in that intuitive information
throughout your experiences.

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:25.930 align:middle line:84%
But if you're not
taught that, then you

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:30.010 align:middle line:84%
need to develop that
muscle to gain the trust.

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:32.110 align:middle line:90%
It is a skill.

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:35.560 align:middle line:84%
Just like we train
our intellectual mind

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:39.040 align:middle line:84%
to increase our
intelligence, we also

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:42.850 align:middle line:84%
have to train this
intuitive, this, what I call,

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:44.770 align:middle line:84%
your transcendental
intelligence.

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:48.280 align:middle line:84%
There's something
beyond your intellect

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:50.980 align:middle line:84%
where you can tap
into a higher knowing.

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:53.680 align:middle line:84%
You have to strengthen
that muscle and train it.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And so it isn't like, oh, it's
something I did last week,

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.240 align:middle line:84%
and I got amazing
confirmation, that's wonderful,

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:04.590 align:middle line:84%
and next year,
I'll try it again.

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:06.730 align:middle line:90%
It's definitely a relationship.

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:09.470 align:middle line:84%
Like any relationship,
that takes time,

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:13.840 align:middle line:84%
it takes commitment, it takes
a constant conversation.

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And what I learned
to do, especially

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:18.790 align:middle line:84%
because of writing my
book, "Hiring the Heavens,"

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:21.670 align:middle line:84%
I learned to have a
constant conversation going

00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:23.170 align:middle line:90%
with my higher guidance.

00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's where you
strengthen that muscle

00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:32.520 align:middle line:84%
and you become smart in that
transcendental intelligence

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:36.360 align:middle line:84%
to where now you're
living your life truly,

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:40.530 align:middle line:84%
as a spiritual being,
having a human experience.

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:42.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
throughout my life,

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:43.920 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know that
I was listening

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.620 align:middle line:84%
to anything, especially
in the early years, right?

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:48.867 align:middle line:84%
Because both of us come
from religious backgrounds

00:22:48.867 --> 00:22:50.700 align:middle line:84%
when we were young, and
we kind of fled away

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:53.240 align:middle line:84%
from that once we had the
opportunity as so, most

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:55.350 align:middle line:84%
of people that I
interview, oftentimes,

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:58.720 align:middle line:84%
have very fundamentalist type
of upbringings and say, hey,

00:22:58.720 --> 00:22:59.920 align:middle line:90%
this isn't working.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.860 align:middle line:84%
So you throw the
whole thing out.

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:03.210 align:middle line:90%
So I'm not even into it.

00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:07.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm not interested in the notion
of reincarnation, intuition,

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:08.850 align:middle line:90%
nothing, when I was in my 20s.

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:10.870 align:middle line:90%
But things started happening.

00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:13.800 align:middle line:84%
But what I did notice
the whole time,

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.990 align:middle line:84%
because I'm very
feeling-centered,

00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:19.440 align:middle line:84%
and in human design,
that's my primary capacity,

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.282 align:middle line:84%
is that I would feel my
way through situations.

00:23:22.282 --> 00:23:24.240 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people say,
why are you doing this?

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.740 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make any sense.

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And it would just be this
awful contracted feeling.

00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:30.870 align:middle line:84%
I know it sounds like
a great job offer.

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:33.420 align:middle line:84%
Can't do it, no can
do, I, don't want it.

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:34.600 align:middle line:90%
Are you crazy?

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:35.610 align:middle line:90%
I can't do it.

00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:37.318 align:middle line:84%
And then something
else would come along,

00:23:37.318 --> 00:23:39.300 align:middle line:84%
and the field would
open up, and it's--

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:41.790 align:middle line:84%
I might even think, I don't
really want to do this,

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:44.200 align:middle line:84%
but I'm feeling like
I have to do this.

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:47.520 align:middle line:84%
So everything was expansion
and contraction, attraction

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:49.260 align:middle line:90%
and repulsion.

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And that is one way
that we are accessing

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:55.680 align:middle line:84%
that aspect of ourselves,
but we're not giving it

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:56.820 align:middle line:90%
credit a lot of the time.

00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:59.580 align:middle line:84%
Because you tell me
from your own lens,

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:01.350 align:middle line:84%
even though you
use your protocols

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:03.960 align:middle line:84%
and you've developed
this, how much of the time

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:07.170 align:middle line:84%
do you have a feeling of
attraction or repulsion

00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:09.630 align:middle line:90%
going on underneath?

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:11.818 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Actually, now
I'm very in tune to it.

00:24:11.818 --> 00:24:12.985 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, you are now.

00:24:12.985 --> 00:24:14.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Now,
yeah, but not before.

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:16.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In the beginning,
you weren't feeling that?

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:18.555 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: I didn't
actually become intuitive

00:24:18.555 --> 00:24:20.790 align:middle line:90%
till I was in my 40s.

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:22.510 align:middle line:90%
And I did exactly what you said.

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:24.900 align:middle line:84%
I threw the baby out
with the bathwater,

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:27.008 align:middle line:84%
wanted nothing to do
with spirituality.

00:24:27.008 --> 00:24:29.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you came from
a really strict fundamentalist,

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:31.230 align:middle line:84%
strange religion,
a cult, basically.

00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:33.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Yeah,
and so when people

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:36.360 align:middle line:84%
were talking about
using oracles,

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:41.250 align:middle line:84%
I considered that so woo-woo, I
really thought they were weird

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:45.030 align:middle line:84%
and wanted nothing to do
with those kind people.

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:48.640 align:middle line:84%
And here I am a spiritual
teacher doing this.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:49.440 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:51.898 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But in the beginning,
you weren't feeling those--

00:24:51.898 --> 00:24:54.600 align:middle line:84%
because I take it for granted
everyone feels this contraction

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:57.030 align:middle line:84%
and expansion, repulsion,
attraction, that that's--

00:24:57.030 --> 00:24:59.430 align:middle line:84%
so I'm making an assumption,
through my filter,

00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:01.740 align:middle line:84%
that that's how we gain
access to intuition.

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:03.960 align:middle line:84%
You're saying no,
not for you, and not

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.130 align:middle line:90%
for probably most people.

00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:06.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: And
we're brainwashed.

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:09.040 align:middle line:84%
So here's what
ends up happening.

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:13.380 align:middle line:84%
Most people are told
what they should want.

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:15.810 align:middle line:84%
You should want a good paying
job, you should want this,

00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:17.340 align:middle line:90%
you should want that.

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:18.240 align:middle line:90%
You get your family.

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:21.210 align:middle line:84%
You get your nice house
with the white picket fence,

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:23.670 align:middle line:84%
and these are the things
that you want in life.

00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And we sit down, and we
say, OK, so do I want

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:29.070 align:middle line:90%
this job in computer science?

00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:31.980 align:middle line:84%
Do I want this job in
selling real estate?

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And yes, and we're trying
to convince ourselves

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:36.160 align:middle line:90%
that this is what we want.

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:38.808 align:middle line:84%
We don't actually
tune in to that--

00:25:38.808 --> 00:25:40.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: See, I
don't even get that.

00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:43.123 align:middle line:84%
How can anyone live a life
without knowing what you want?

00:25:43.123 --> 00:25:44.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Yeah, and
they don't actually

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:46.650 align:middle line:90%
tune into what this is.

00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:50.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, they go by what
our programming is

00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:52.500 align:middle line:84%
and what society
is telling us we

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:55.140 align:middle line:84%
should want, rather than
asking the one part of us that

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:57.900 align:middle line:84%
actually knows, and
then they pursue it.

00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:59.550 align:middle line:84%
They pursue that
job in real estate.

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:01.410 align:middle line:84%
I thought that I was supposed
to go into real estate.

00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:03.780 align:middle line:84%
And so that was the one
thing that I was going to do,

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:07.650 align:middle line:84%
got the whole course, started
to get certified in it.

00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:12.870 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately, there
was a time in my life

00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:15.960 align:middle line:84%
where my higher guidance
intervened and said,

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:18.390 align:middle line:90%
you're not going that path.

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:21.180 align:middle line:84%
If I had, if I had
stayed with real estate,

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:23.302 align:middle line:84%
would I be fulfilled
like I am now?

00:26:23.302 --> 00:26:24.510 align:middle line:90%
The answer is absolutely not.

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:25.552 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely not.

00:26:25.552 --> 00:26:28.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Maybe I would be
making a ton of money doing it,

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:29.070 align:middle line:90%
very successful.

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:30.600 align:middle line:90%
Would I be fulfilled?

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:31.980 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's the problem is, if
we go by what other people are

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:40.740 align:middle line:84%
telling us is our truth, this
is why it's so important to have

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:43.740 align:middle line:84%
a way, either if you
are intuitive enough

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:47.970 align:middle line:84%
to divine it yourself or have
a way to get out of your head

00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:50.340 align:middle line:84%
and get confirmation from
your higher guidance,

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:52.630 align:middle line:84%
from your soul, is
this right for me?

00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:53.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:56.040 align:middle line:84%
Because this is a big
problem on this planet.

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:57.640 align:middle line:84%
Because we're
looking at survival,

00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:00.150 align:middle line:84%
we're forced to deal now with
the institution of, well,

00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:03.600 align:middle line:84%
with the reality of money and
gaining currencies in order

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.490 align:middle line:84%
to be able to even
have a stable life,

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:08.280 align:middle line:84%
even be healthy and have
a roof over our head.

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:13.680 align:middle line:84%
In the community of
spiritual seekers,

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:18.630 align:middle line:84%
the holy grail seems to be,
oftentimes, you-- often that we

00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:21.570 align:middle line:84%
want to blend our true
desire and our Dharma

00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:24.360 align:middle line:84%
with our ability to
support ourselves.

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And just like what you
were talking about,

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:28.683 align:middle line:84%
this can be really
tricky, right?

00:27:28.683 --> 00:27:30.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: It can
be really tough.

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:32.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's so tricky,
and it can lead people

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:33.430 align:middle line:90%
to so much heartache.

00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:35.182 align:middle line:90%
Now, I want to get into that.

00:27:35.182 --> 00:27:37.390 align:middle line:84%
And then I want to get into
the notion of when you're

00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:41.950 align:middle line:84%
getting your
intuitive information,

00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:45.340 align:middle line:84%
that time is the X
factor on everything.

00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:48.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's what really, I
think, kind of bungs people

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:49.250 align:middle line:90%
up on this.

00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:53.230 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you realized you
don't like being an accountant.

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:55.210 align:middle line:84%
You never did want to
be, but your dad was one.

00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:56.200 align:middle line:90%
You talked into it.

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:58.390 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you've made some
money, but not enough

00:27:58.390 --> 00:28:01.768 align:middle line:90%
to retire or go without a job.

00:28:01.768 --> 00:28:03.310 align:middle line:84%
So now you want to
switch professions

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:07.570 align:middle line:84%
into becoming a counselor,
a higher guidance counselor.

00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:10.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, Let's talk
about the process

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:12.310 align:middle line:90%
of moving from one to another.

00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:16.660 align:middle line:84%
Because Dharma doesn't
always mean money.

00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:18.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: No.

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:20.467 align:middle line:84%
We've been told that,
find your bliss,

00:28:20.467 --> 00:28:21.550 align:middle line:90%
and the money will follow.

00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:22.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not necessarily.

00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:23.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Not necessarily.

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:25.282 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I really
want to dispel that.

00:28:25.282 --> 00:28:27.160 align:middle line:84%
Because I know
Mitch Horowitz, whom

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:28.540 align:middle line:90%
I've interviewed a few times.

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:33.160 align:middle line:84%
And he's a real student and very
disciplined in his practice,

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:34.480 align:middle line:90%
and he's found you can.

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And there are ways
to certainly maximize

00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:39.050 align:middle line:84%
on that potential,
no doubt about it.

00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:40.750 align:middle line:84%
But you may have a
Dharma for something

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:43.000 align:middle line:84%
you're totally passionate
about, but you may never

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.270 align:middle line:90%
make a dime on it.

00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:45.980 align:middle line:90%
Does that mean you don't do it?

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:48.160 align:middle line:84%
No your soul
suffers if you don't

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.180 align:middle line:90%
do that thing no matter what.

00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:53.740 align:middle line:84%
So I think that determining what
it is your heart's crying out

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:56.900 align:middle line:84%
for, honoring it, is number
one, whether you're going

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:58.280 align:middle line:90%
to make a living at it or not.

00:28:58.280 --> 00:28:59.745 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk
about it from there.

00:28:59.745 --> 00:29:01.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Well,
it all gets down

00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:03.760 align:middle line:90%
to asking the right questions.

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:05.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:08.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Because I
always say, don't just

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:10.920 align:middle line:84%
stop at the most
obvious questions.

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:13.540 align:middle line:84%
Go deeper, or go
deeper, go deeper.

00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:18.010 align:middle line:84%
As you go deeper, you may get
the fullness of the picture.

00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's like little
pieces of the puzzle

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:22.060 align:middle line:84%
that you're trying to
understand about your life.

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:24.070 align:middle line:84%
So the most important
thing is for you

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:26.290 align:middle line:84%
to remember that who
you are, as a spiritual,

00:29:26.290 --> 00:29:29.810 align:middle line:90%
having this human experience.

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:33.610 align:middle line:84%
So as a spiritual being,
it's understanding that you

00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:35.590 align:middle line:90%
are a creator of experience.

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:40.690 align:middle line:10%
And you have, in mind,
certain experiences

00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:45.280 align:middle line:10%
you want to receive
from your life in order

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:47.200 align:middle line:10%
to know the truth of something.

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:50.050 align:middle line:84%
Like, for an example,
before your soul incarnated,

00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:51.640 align:middle line:84%
your soul might
have said, we want

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:55.258 align:middle line:84%
you to really understand what
it's like to rescue yourself.

00:29:55.258 --> 00:29:56.800 align:middle line:84%
We want you to really
understand what

00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:58.540 align:middle line:90%
it's like to love yourself.

00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:01.630 align:middle line:84%
We want you to really
understand and experience

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:04.100 align:middle line:84%
what it's like to
love someone else.

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:06.250 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is that
your soul decided

00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:08.590 align:middle line:84%
to experience when
it came here, it

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:12.560 align:middle line:84%
began to create experiences
that would support that.

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:15.040 align:middle line:84%
So all of your
life experience is

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:19.420 align:middle line:84%
going to be molded
into getting what it is

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:21.093 align:middle line:90%
your soul desired to know the--

00:30:21.093 --> 00:30:22.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It doesn't
have anything

00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:25.750 align:middle line:84%
to do with your conscious
mind's desire You

00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:28.917 align:middle line:84%
can be at counter purposes
an entire lifetime.

00:30:28.917 --> 00:30:31.000 align:middle line:84%
And I hear that, even when
people are of age where

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.190 align:middle line:84%
they retire saying,
I just haven't

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:35.720 align:middle line:84%
gotten to what it is I
think I want to do yet

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:37.720 align:middle line:84%
or the thing I think
I'm here for yet.

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:38.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Right.

00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:40.570 align:middle line:84%
So there's different
aspects of, when

00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:43.600 align:middle line:84%
we ask ourselves,
what's our purpose,

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:46.600 align:middle line:84%
we're asking for main
questions, right?

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:49.210 align:middle line:84%
We're asking, what
is it that I want

00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:53.020 align:middle line:84%
to know of myself, what is
it that I want to experience

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:55.180 align:middle line:84%
and express of myself,
what is it that I

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:56.683 align:middle line:90%
want to do for a vocation?

00:30:56.683 --> 00:30:57.850 align:middle line:90%
That's only one of the four.

00:30:57.850 --> 00:31:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And what is it my soul
desires above all else?

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:03.920 align:middle line:84%
So when we're asking that
question, what's my purpose,

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.830 align:middle line:84%
and what is it I'm here
to do, and all that,

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:07.455 align:middle line:84%
we don't realize it,
but we're actually

00:31:07.455 --> 00:31:09.970 align:middle line:84%
asking four different
distinct questions.

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:11.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:11.980 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:16.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: And so when you can
identify all four of those,

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:17.755 align:middle line:90%
you'll get an idea about--

00:31:17.755 --> 00:31:19.630 align:middle line:84%
and these other
pieces of the puzzle.

00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:24.550 align:middle line:84%
Oh, so maybe what it is my
soul really, truly desires

00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:28.060 align:middle line:84%
is to know what it
is to love myself.

00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:30.130 align:middle line:90%
OK, so now we've got that piece.

00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:33.910 align:middle line:84%
Then, what is it that I want
to know of myself and my being

00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:35.650 align:middle line:90%
and how I express my energy?

00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And you may find out that
who you truly is a writer.

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And you want to bring
forth these words

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:44.350 align:middle line:84%
that you have in
your soul that you

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:46.150 align:middle line:84%
want to bring
forth, put on paper,

00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:48.080 align:middle line:90%
and share with the world.

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:50.410 align:middle line:84%
And then you say,
OK, well, then what

00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:52.330 align:middle line:84%
is it that I want
to do as a vocation?

00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:53.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Best-selling author.

00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:54.872 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Best-selling author.

00:31:54.872 --> 00:31:58.900 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe you work for a
publishing house or something

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:00.280 align:middle line:90%
that brings you in the money.

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:02.780 align:middle line:84%
Because you and I have joked
about it you're right you know,

00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:04.360 align:middle line:84%
that higher guidance
or your angels

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:07.150 align:middle line:84%
may not have ever paid bills,
and they don't certainly

00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:07.950 align:middle line:90%
know about time.

00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:10.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: My soul does
not care about money.

00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:12.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: So we have to
consider that part about, what

00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:15.100 align:middle line:84%
is it that I can do
that fulfills my soul

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:16.790 align:middle line:90%
and brings me in money?

00:32:16.790 --> 00:32:18.415 align:middle line:84%
Because we're living
in this dimension.

00:32:18.415 --> 00:32:20.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sort of like what
you talked about a moment ago.

00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:22.000 align:middle line:84%
You have to look at
the practical end,

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.080 align:middle line:90%
like with me in media.

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:24.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing this today.

00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:28.250 align:middle line:84%
But I started doing shows
for $25 a show working

00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:32.090 align:middle line:84%
my toosh off, writing and
producing and everything,

00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:34.370 align:middle line:84%
and then going on camera
when I was scared to death,

00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:36.110 align:middle line:90%
doing sports.

00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:37.380 align:middle line:90%
That's not my Dharma.

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:40.190 align:middle line:84%
But this whole thing about
timing we're talking about,

00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:43.520 align:middle line:84%
you start somewhere, and
you begin working toward it.

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:46.940 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people see these quite,
quote, "overnight successes."

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:48.530 align:middle line:90%
There is almost no such thing.

00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:50.600 align:middle line:84%
A few YouTube phenomenas,
that's about it,

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:54.830 align:middle line:84%
but real overnight successes,
you don't see that often.

00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:57.230 align:middle line:84%
So like you said, you
don't have to say,

00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:58.730 align:middle line:90%
OK, I'm quitting my job.

00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:00.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm devoting myself
to writing this book,

00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:02.750 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to be
a best-selling author

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:05.420 align:middle line:84%
through my sheer projection
and will and intent.

00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:08.450 align:middle line:84%
Instead, maybe you get into
the publishing company, right?

00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:11.340 align:middle line:84%
Start coming in there for a day
job, learning the ins and outs,

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:13.760 align:middle line:84%
see what kind of books are
trending, what isn't trending?

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:15.890 align:middle line:84%
What's involved in
becoming an author?

00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:17.450 align:middle line:90%
And that is much more--

00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:21.770 align:middle line:84%
that's kind of a rational,
doable entrance into that.

00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:23.540 align:middle line:90%
That's just one example, right?

00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:25.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: And it's
understanding exactly what you

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:28.690 align:middle line:84%
said is that, everything
is about a step by step--

00:33:28.690 --> 00:33:32.420 align:middle line:84%
and the information that's
going to be revealed to you

00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:35.390 align:middle line:90%
is important to that next step.

00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:36.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:33:36.270 --> 00:33:38.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: I didn't
become a spiritual teacher

00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:40.070 align:middle line:90%
till I was in my 40s.

00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:42.230 align:middle line:84%
If my guidance had
said to me, when

00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:44.180 align:middle line:84%
I was graduating
from high school,

00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:46.120 align:middle line:84%
hey, you're going to
be a spiritual teacher,

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:48.645 align:middle line:84%
I would have flat out
laughed and said no.

00:33:48.645 --> 00:33:50.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
you're, first of all,

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:51.470 align:middle line:90%
running away from all that.

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:52.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yes.

00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And so everything's
about a stepping stone

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:56.505 align:middle line:90%
or, you know what?

00:33:56.505 --> 00:33:57.890 align:middle line:90%
It's about timing.

00:33:57.890 --> 00:33:59.210 align:middle line:90%
And you are revealed.

00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:01.400 align:middle line:84%
The information will be
revealed to you as you

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:03.620 align:middle line:90%
need it to take that next step.

00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:05.990 align:middle line:84%
And worry about,
well, what is it

00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:10.760 align:middle line:84%
going to be going on 10,
20 years down the road.

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:13.730 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes, whatever is going
to be happening down the road

00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:17.330 align:middle line:84%
has so many variants
to it and variables.

00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:21.239 align:middle line:84%
Because timing is an
interesting thing.

00:34:21.239 --> 00:34:23.510 align:middle line:84%
It's not just your
life path, but it's

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:26.090 align:middle line:84%
intertwined with
so many other life

00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:29.449 align:middle line:84%
paths that are going on at the
same time and circumstances

00:34:29.449 --> 00:34:31.050 align:middle line:90%
and experiences.

00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And so when people to get
information from their higher

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:39.620 align:middle line:84%
guide and said, this is going
to happen in three years,

00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:43.100 align:middle line:84%
and then it doesn't, they
become disillusioned and say,

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:44.540 align:middle line:90%
my higher guidance lied to me.

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:45.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:48.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, the thing is, your
soul, your higher mind,

00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:50.060 align:middle line:84%
not only doesn't
care about money,

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:54.047 align:middle line:84%
but it has no real sense
of time in this dimension.

00:34:54.047 --> 00:34:55.880 align:middle line:84%
So it can see something
that looks imminent.

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:57.960 align:middle line:84%
That might be five
years from now.

00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:59.597 align:middle line:84%
And so the way you
do, it does refine

00:34:59.597 --> 00:35:02.180 align:middle line:84%
the way you ask the question,
so you're going to get something

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:04.480 align:middle line:90%
closer, but it's mutable.

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:06.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah.

00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:08.420 align:middle line:84%
A simple example
to understand this

00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:11.800 align:middle line:84%
is, if I ask, through
using my pendulum,

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:16.580 align:middle line:84%
I'd say, how much vitamin C
do I need on a daily basis?

00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And if it tells me I need
500 milligrams, great.

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And I say OK, how long
do I need to take that?

00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:25.880 align:middle line:84%
It says, well, do this
every day for three months.

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:31.827 align:middle line:84%
Well, what happens if two months
down the road, I catch a flu.

00:35:31.827 --> 00:35:33.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not
applicable anymore.

00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:35.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: And now it's
not applicable anymore.

00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:37.640 align:middle line:84%
So it's just being
open to understanding

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:40.130 align:middle line:84%
that, when you ask
a future question,

00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:44.120 align:middle line:84%
it's a best-guess answer based
upon the information of what's

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:45.620 align:middle line:90%
going on right now.

00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:47.820 align:middle line:90%
But be open to things changing.

00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:48.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:49.220 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:51.140 align:middle line:84%
So along that line,
I'll tell a little story

00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:54.780 align:middle line:84%
about moving parts and
timing and so forth.

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:58.500 align:middle line:90%
So this was in the late 1980s.

00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:01.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, at this time, I'm
obsessed with reading books

00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:03.470 align:middle line:84%
on vibrational healing
and color therapy.

00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:05.060 align:middle line:90%
That's my passion, right?

00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:06.260 align:middle line:90%
So I get this whim.

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:08.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go to
Europe and hunt down

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:11.720 align:middle line:84%
the top people, the
top physicists and MDs

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:16.040 align:middle line:84%
in the world when it comes to
the unseen forces and healing

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:18.845 align:middle line:84%
and with a bent
toward color therapy

00:36:18.845 --> 00:36:19.970 align:middle line:90%
because that's what I love.

00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:21.350 align:middle line:90%
That was my filter.

00:36:21.350 --> 00:36:24.350 align:middle line:84%
I found the most amazing
people, Steven Ross

00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:26.000 align:middle line:84%
and I have talked
about it on camera

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.190 align:middle line:84%
because he was there
a few months before me

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:31.070 align:middle line:84%
talking to the same people
on the same journey because

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:32.490 align:middle line:90%
of color therapy, right?

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:34.610 align:middle line:84%
It's like, the world
needs to know this.

00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:35.940 align:middle line:90%
And I'm in media.

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:37.910 align:middle line:90%
I can help inform people.

00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:39.320 align:middle line:90%
So I come back.

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:43.010 align:middle line:84%
I create a little pilot
series of five parts.

00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And through a contact,
I was able to meet

00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:50.690 align:middle line:84%
with the head of production for
what are called news inserts,

00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:53.210 align:middle line:84%
little pieces like on
your pad or movies that

00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:56.450 align:middle line:84%
come into your nightly news,
that's what they produced.

00:36:56.450 --> 00:36:59.660 align:middle line:84%
So I have now produced a
bunch of these little segments

00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:01.702 align:middle line:90%
called, "A Second Opinion--

00:37:01.702 --> 00:37:03.410 align:middle line:84%
How to Begin Looking
at our Health Beyond

00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:06.170 align:middle line:90%
the Allopathic Model."

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:07.470 align:middle line:90%
They sign me up.

00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:09.950 align:middle line:84%
I've got this fat, juicy,
wonderful contract.

00:37:09.950 --> 00:37:12.500 align:middle line:84%
It's like only six,
eight months have passed.

00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:13.320 align:middle line:90%
This is exciting.

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:15.320 align:middle line:90%
This is moving along.

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:22.340 align:middle line:84%
So something happens where Time
buys that particular division

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:23.600 align:middle line:90%
of that company.

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:25.370 align:middle line:90%
Now, they freeze everything.

00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:26.490 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:37:26.490 --> 00:37:27.290 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:28.480 align:middle line:90%
They say stop.

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:30.290 align:middle line:84%
We're not selling them
to the market yet.

00:37:30.290 --> 00:37:31.850 align:middle line:84%
We're just getting
content together.

00:37:31.850 --> 00:37:32.650 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:35.890 align:middle line:84%
So I have to wait about six
months or a year, right?

00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:37.960 align:middle line:90%
It's like, OK, go.

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:39.130 align:middle line:90%
And so we start producing.

00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:41.300 align:middle line:84%
They're ready to put
him out in the markets.

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:42.130 align:middle line:90%
Stop.

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:44.330 align:middle line:84%
Warner comes in and
buys Time, which became

00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:46.270 align:middle line:90%
the megalithic media companies.

00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:47.650 align:middle line:90%
That was the beginning of it.

00:37:47.650 --> 00:37:50.830 align:middle line:84%
Warner says dumping everything
from selling that division.

00:37:50.830 --> 00:37:53.980 align:middle line:84%
A couple years have
passed, and it all

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:57.800 align:middle line:84%
looked like it was a go to begin
with, even got a buy-in on it,

00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:59.590 align:middle line:90%
but stuff happens.

00:37:59.590 --> 00:38:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And so then, I think,
wow, what made me do that?

00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:05.350 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:09.850 align:middle line:84%
I end up coming to
Gaia in 2012, and I

00:38:09.850 --> 00:38:12.370 align:middle line:84%
had a show called "The
Healing Matrix," which

00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:13.790 align:middle line:90%
was a second opinion.

00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:14.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Wow.

00:38:14.590 --> 00:38:18.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It just took
an additional 20 years

00:38:18.610 --> 00:38:22.150 align:middle line:84%
to make it happen, come to
the airwaves as a reality.

00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:23.830 align:middle line:90%
It took 20 more years.

00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And arguably, maybe the
public wasn't really

00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:28.790 align:middle line:90%
even ready for it 20 years ago.

00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:29.873 align:middle line:90%
And so, do I look at that?

00:38:29.873 --> 00:38:30.957 align:middle line:90%
We're looking at the time.

00:38:30.957 --> 00:38:32.170 align:middle line:90%
I thought, why did I do that?

00:38:32.170 --> 00:38:34.040 align:middle line:90%
It was just a flop.

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:34.840 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:36.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: It
wasn't wasted time.

00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:37.172 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It wasted time.

00:38:37.172 --> 00:38:39.100 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't wasted knowledge.

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And the feeling, the impulse
to go and spend my own money

00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:46.750 align:middle line:84%
to travel Europe and do
this was so loud and clear,

00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:48.260 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't ignore it.

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:51.970 align:middle line:84%
So 20 years later, it shows
up on the airwaves, right?

00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:55.540 align:middle line:84%
So that's an idea of moving
parts, of timing, and how

00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:56.840 align:middle line:90%
we can't judge these things.

00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:00.280 align:middle line:84%
You still have to go with those
impulses, these compulsions,

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:01.635 align:middle line:90%
to do something.

00:39:01.635 --> 00:39:02.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yes.

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:04.660 align:middle line:90%
And trust your higher guidance.

00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:08.300 align:middle line:84%
So once you develop that trust--
and you obviously had the trust

00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:09.100 align:middle line:90%
then--

00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:13.180 align:middle line:84%
but once you develop that trust,
and then something happens

00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:15.880 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't get fulfilled
the way that you thought--

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:17.710 align:middle line:84%
don't go into this
place of doubt,

00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:19.630 align:middle line:90%
and say, OK, this doesn't work.

00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:20.590 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not intuitive.

00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:21.740 align:middle line:90%
And forget it.

00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:22.990 align:middle line:90%
Don't throw it all out.

00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:24.550 align:middle line:84%
Don't go into that
place of doubt

00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:27.010 align:middle line:84%
because just keep
going with, what

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:29.560 align:middle line:84%
is the message my higher
guidance is trying to give me?

00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And keep going
back to that piece,

00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:34.460 align:middle line:84%
that you are a spiritual
having a human experience.

00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:36.370 align:middle line:84%
So what is it my soul
is trying to help

00:39:36.370 --> 00:39:38.440 align:middle line:90%
me to understand through this?

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:41.080 align:middle line:84%
Because everything's
about the creation of that

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:43.630 align:middle line:84%
experience so that you can
know something about that.

00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:45.430 align:middle line:84%
And what did you find
out about yourself

00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:46.920 align:middle line:90%
in doing that experience?

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:48.910 align:middle line:90%
A whole bunch.

00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And you developed a
wisdom and a knowledge

00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:53.740 align:middle line:84%
that you were able
to tap into later.

00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:55.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's what it
was really about,

00:39:55.690 --> 00:39:58.870 align:middle line:84%
not the actual fulfillment
right then and there.

00:39:58.870 --> 00:40:01.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: My guidance--
so what's 20 years?

00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:03.760 align:middle line:90%
What's an incarnation?

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:05.370 align:middle line:90%
When someone was asking--

00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:08.680 align:middle line:84%
an outside guidance in
my soul group about love.

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:11.660 align:middle line:84%
I said, I don't feel like I've
had a good relationship 3,500

00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:12.460 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:14.555 align:middle line:84%
And they're, like,
that's not so long.

00:40:14.555 --> 00:40:15.430 align:middle line:90%
And I started crying.

00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:17.350 align:middle line:84%
I said it certainly
is if you're here

00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:18.865 align:middle line:90%
incarnated in a human body.

00:40:18.865 --> 00:40:21.910 align:middle line:90%


00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, hmm,
sorry you feel that way.

00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:27.620 align:middle line:84%
Kind of nonplused,
not our problem.

00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:28.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: That's funny.

00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:30.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the
big thing here too

00:40:30.730 --> 00:40:33.490 align:middle line:84%
that distorts our
perceptions and the answers

00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:35.410 align:middle line:84%
we get when we do our
own intuitive work, more

00:40:35.410 --> 00:40:39.190 align:middle line:84%
than anything, is
attachment to the outcome.

00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:40.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Oh, my gosh, yeah.

00:40:40.610 --> 00:40:42.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You've talked
about the other factors.

00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:44.410 align:middle line:90%
But that's the big one.

00:40:44.410 --> 00:40:48.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: We can want an answer
to be one thing or another.

00:40:48.130 --> 00:40:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And because we want
it, we can actually

00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:55.960 align:middle line:84%
fool ourselves into thinking
that it's actually that way.

00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:59.830 align:middle line:84%
I went to a very well-known
financial seminar.

00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And there was a point in
there where they passed out

00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:06.040 align:middle line:90%
this four-page questionnaire.

00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And you were to rate,
on a scale of 1 to 10,

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:13.100 align:middle line:84%
how strongly do you believe
that statement is true?

00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like, I've
got my stuff together

00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:17.260 align:middle line:90%
about-- you know.

00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And these things are
just way too obvious.

00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:22.270 align:middle line:84%
Like, money doesn't
grow on trees.

00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:24.160 align:middle line:90%
Nope, don't believe that.

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:28.510 align:middle line:84%
Things that are obviously going
to be blocks in attracting

00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:30.820 align:middle line:84%
money-- well, I
ended up answering

00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:34.240 align:middle line:84%
zero to one on every single
one of these, what I felt

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:35.920 align:middle line:90%
were ridiculous statements.

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:37.720 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe any of those.

00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:41.260 align:middle line:84%
Because I had a certain
perception of what I think I

00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:44.690 align:middle line:90%
knew about money and who I was.

00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:47.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So wee bit of
assumptions or arrogance

00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:48.410 align:middle line:90%
going on there.

00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:49.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah, a little bit.

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:51.920 align:middle line:90%
So I went back to my hotel room.

00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:54.690 align:middle line:84%
And then I decided ask
my higher guidance.

00:41:54.690 --> 00:42:00.380 align:middle line:84%
I took out my pendulum, and I
said, OK I answered 0 and 1,

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:02.980 align:middle line:84%
but am I fooling myself
about some of these?

00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:03.970 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:42:03.970 --> 00:42:07.210 align:middle line:84%
OK, how many here do
I need to look at?

00:42:07.210 --> 00:42:08.870 align:middle line:90%
And there were four of them.

00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:11.260 align:middle line:84%
And I went through, and I
dowsed which ones they were.

00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And I was a 10, like, I strongly
believed they were true.

00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:19.360 align:middle line:84%
And at first, I was in
complete denial of it.

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:22.750 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, you're wrong.

00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:24.620 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe that.

00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:28.540 align:middle line:84%
So I really had to look at
it because that attachment

00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:32.620 align:middle line:84%
to a certain answer and what
our perception is, and yet,

00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:36.080 align:middle line:84%
here is all the evidence to the
opposite and we cannot even see

00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:36.880 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:39.730 align:middle line:84%
We can go into complete
denial of that.

00:42:39.730 --> 00:42:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And I had actually
asked my guidance, OK,

00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:44.740 align:middle line:84%
if you say I believe
that, and that's a 10,

00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:46.660 align:middle line:90%
show me how that's true.

00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:50.733 align:middle line:84%
And they showed me,
and they were right.

00:42:50.733 --> 00:42:52.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A little
bit of humility

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:53.800 align:middle line:90%
is always a good thing in this.

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:57.160 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's bring another area
in because that influences us

00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:58.480 align:middle line:90%
subconsciously.

00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:01.023 align:middle line:84%
And not everybody will
buy into this, but I do.

00:43:01.023 --> 00:43:02.440 align:middle line:84%
And that has to
do with the notion

00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:04.462 align:middle line:90%
of previous incarnations.

00:43:04.462 --> 00:43:05.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Oh, my gosh.

00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:06.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's a big area.

00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:09.700 align:middle line:84%
And it is, if we look at
the subconscious as the sum

00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:11.440 align:middle line:84%
total of everything
that's ever been,

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:13.985 align:middle line:84%
that we've ever experienced,
that we carry forward

00:43:13.985 --> 00:43:15.610 align:middle line:84%
along with the higher
part of our mind,

00:43:15.610 --> 00:43:18.070 align:middle line:84%
from incarnation
to incarnation, it

00:43:18.070 --> 00:43:21.925 align:middle line:84%
has a purpose to create, again,
attractions, fear, repulsion

00:43:21.925 --> 00:43:23.800 align:middle line:84%
from things we've been
harmed by in the past.

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And there's a
purpose for all this.

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:30.250 align:middle line:84%
But you've got a big bag
of previous experiences

00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:32.050 align:middle line:84%
and reactions and
traumas that we're

00:43:32.050 --> 00:43:36.130 align:middle line:84%
carrying when we're born, before
this life even does its thing.

00:43:36.130 --> 00:43:37.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah.

00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:41.600 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I'm going to go back to
what I said before and say it

00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:42.400 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:43.880 align:middle line:90%
We're spiritual beings having--

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:44.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:46.780 align:middle line:84%
And our audience knows
that, but still--

00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:49.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: And we are
creators of experience.

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:51.910 align:middle line:84%
So what ends up happening--
and I look at karma

00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:54.470 align:middle line:84%
very differently than
what most people do.

00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:59.950 align:middle line:84%
I don't look at it as, oh, you
were whatever in a past life,

00:43:59.950 --> 00:44:02.110 align:middle line:84%
so this time you're going
to have the opposite.

00:44:02.110 --> 00:44:06.790 align:middle line:84%
I look at it as you a
very curious creator

00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:10.060 align:middle line:84%
that wants to explore
a thought form,

00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:13.120 align:middle line:84%
and you'll leave
no stone unturned.

00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:15.460 align:middle line:84%
So you'll, first
of all experience

00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:20.260 align:middle line:84%
it this way to know everything
about that in that way.

00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And it could be your
entire incarnation

00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:24.880 align:middle line:90%
you explored it in that form.

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:27.490 align:middle line:84%
And then, now, in
this lifetime, you're

00:44:27.490 --> 00:44:29.680 align:middle line:84%
going to explore it
from the opposite

00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:31.870 align:middle line:90%
and see what that feels like.

00:44:31.870 --> 00:44:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we do that
for the entire life.

00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:37.570 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we get it to a
point where I know everything

00:44:37.570 --> 00:44:39.530 align:middle line:90%
about that, and you just--

00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:41.930 align:middle line:84%
it's a kind of feeling
like, I've had it.

00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:42.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm done.

00:44:42.730 --> 00:44:43.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: I'm done with that.

00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:46.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't ever need
to visit that again.

00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And you know, when that happens,
there's a turning point.

00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:53.830 align:middle line:90%
And now you turn--

00:44:53.830 --> 00:44:55.210 align:middle line:84%
it's like you turn
over the coin,

00:44:55.210 --> 00:44:58.130 align:middle line:84%
and you go in a different
direction entirely.

00:44:58.130 --> 00:45:01.150 align:middle line:84%
So I look at, whatever's
going on in past lives,

00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:04.780 align:middle line:84%
as you were a conscious
creator, deliberately

00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:06.760 align:middle line:90%
having these experiences.

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:09.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, having said that-- and
that's the overriding theme.

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:14.860 align:middle line:84%
Having said, that there's
also a lot of trauma

00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:18.520 align:middle line:84%
and incidental stuff that's
being caught and carried

00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:19.450 align:middle line:90%
forward.

00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And we had these
knee-jerk reactions

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.370 align:middle line:84%
where you meet somebody,
and immediately, you

00:45:24.370 --> 00:45:25.660 align:middle line:90%
brace yourself.

00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:30.610 align:middle line:84%
Or you get in a tight space,
and you're claustrophobic,

00:45:30.610 --> 00:45:32.790 align:middle line:84%
and you go, why am
I claustrophobic?

00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And why am I having
these feelings?

00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:35.740 align:middle line:84%
And those can be
directly related

00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:37.540 align:middle line:84%
to something that
happened in a past life.

00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:39.517 align:middle line:84%
But guess who knows
everything about you?

00:45:39.517 --> 00:45:40.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, your self.

00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:41.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Your own self.

00:45:41.350 --> 00:45:42.392 align:middle line:90%
Your own higher guidance.

00:45:42.392 --> 00:45:46.060 align:middle line:84%
So why not ask the one part
of you that actually knows.

00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:48.020 align:middle line:90%
Where is this coming from?

00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:50.500 align:middle line:84%
Is it something that I'm
dealing with in this lifetime

00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:52.360 align:middle line:90%
that I have great purpose for?

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:54.860 align:middle line:90%
If so, tell me more about this.

00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And help me to get
the nuances of it.

00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And if it is
something that you can

00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:02.770 align:middle line:84%
get rid of because
it was incidental

00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:06.520 align:middle line:84%
and not part of the big plan,
then how do I get rid of this?

00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:09.180 align:middle line:84%
Ask the one part of you
that actually knows?

00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:11.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's like you
have to be an anthropologist

00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:12.760 align:middle line:90%
in your own life.

00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:13.600 align:middle line:84%
You really have to
unearth yourself.

00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:14.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Really
good way to put it.

00:46:14.830 --> 00:46:16.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you have
to unearth yourself.

00:46:16.930 --> 00:46:20.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this always comes
back to knowing thyself.

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:24.050 align:middle line:84%
However, and I
hesitate to say this,

00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:30.100 align:middle line:84%
but I think what happened when
the New Age movement really

00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:33.640 align:middle line:84%
came into full bloom,
which was in the 1980s,

00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:35.345 align:middle line:84%
and then strengthened
more in the '90s--

00:46:35.345 --> 00:46:36.970 align:middle line:84%
now, there was new
thought before that.

00:46:36.970 --> 00:46:40.510 align:middle line:84%
But in the 1980s there was
a burgeoning of channelers

00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:41.770 align:middle line:90%
and new thought and so forth.

00:46:41.770 --> 00:46:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And power of positive
thinking was really

00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:46.510 align:middle line:90%
employed in a new way and such.

00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:51.820 align:middle line:84%
But what it tended to do was
create shortcuts and bumper

00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:52.850 align:middle line:90%
stickers.

00:46:52.850 --> 00:46:53.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Totally.

00:46:53.650 --> 00:46:56.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we need to
talk about that because what

00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:58.490 align:middle line:90%
you do is not that.

00:46:58.490 --> 00:47:01.840 align:middle line:84%
You have done your
due diligence probably

00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:03.580 align:middle line:84%
more than anyone in
this field I know.

00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:05.230 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you're so strategic.

00:47:05.230 --> 00:47:06.100 align:middle line:90%
You work hard at it.

00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:09.160 align:middle line:84%
You've put protocols,
courses together from it.

00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not just saying
that to be complementary.

00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:14.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying you didn't take the
shortcut, and you're not in--

00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:16.840 align:middle line:84%
I don't suggest people
take the shortcut,

00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:19.300 align:middle line:84%
even though I, myself,
am guilty of that

00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:21.660 align:middle line:84%
sometimes because I can sit
down and say, yes, show me

00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:22.460 align:middle line:90%
what going.

00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:24.850 align:middle line:84%
OK got it, up and gone
already without looking

00:47:24.850 --> 00:47:26.350 align:middle line:90%
at the implications, even.

00:47:26.350 --> 00:47:29.250 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about this
shortcut-bumper-sticker world

00:47:29.250 --> 00:47:30.300 align:middle line:90%
that's called "New Age."

00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:31.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah.

00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:36.150 align:middle line:84%
It really appealed
to using spirituality

00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:38.160 align:middle line:90%
for materialistic gain.

00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And the short term, not
the big message behind it,

00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:46.970 align:middle line:84%
but just rather the short term,
I want to get what I want.

00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And so if I just focus on
what it is that I want,

00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:55.390 align:middle line:84%
if I just state things
in the positive,

00:47:55.390 --> 00:47:58.230 align:middle line:84%
if I just have enough
attitude of gratitude--

00:47:58.230 --> 00:47:59.920 align:middle line:90%
the list goes on and on--

00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:04.590 align:middle line:84%
I will actually get that
amazing yacht or whatever

00:48:04.590 --> 00:48:06.850 align:middle line:90%
it is that I'm desiring.

00:48:06.850 --> 00:48:08.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was really
about fulfilling desire.

00:48:08.850 --> 00:48:10.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Fulfilling desires.

00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:12.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Instead of
spiritual soul development.

00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:13.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Exactly.

00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:16.320 align:middle line:84%
So from a soul point
of view, does the soul

00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:18.060 align:middle line:90%
care about getting that yacht?

00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:20.010 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:48:20.010 --> 00:48:26.280 align:middle line:84%
It was appealing to a
childlike aspect of ourselves.

00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:32.730 align:middle line:84%
If you are to ask a child what
he wants to eat for dinner,

00:48:32.730 --> 00:48:34.730 align:middle line:84%
the child's going to say,
I want ice cream, mom.

00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:36.630 align:middle line:90%
I want ice cream.

00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:37.920 align:middle line:90%
And that's what it wants.

00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And if you tell that child well,
just think positive about this,

00:48:41.010 --> 00:48:42.540 align:middle line:90%
and you'll get ice cream.

00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:46.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, what happens if,
from a higher viewpoint,

00:48:46.290 --> 00:48:49.440 align:middle line:84%
the mother says, no, this
isn't in your best interest

00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:52.170 align:middle line:90%
to feed you ice cream every day.

00:48:52.170 --> 00:48:55.720 align:middle line:84%
And so because it's in
your best interests,

00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:59.130 align:middle line:84%
here's how we're going to
sit down and eat our meals,

00:48:59.130 --> 00:49:01.270 align:middle line:84%
and this is what's going
to be on your plate.

00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:05.190 align:middle line:84%
This is a higher view
saying and expressing

00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:08.100 align:middle line:84%
what is good because the child
doesn't have the wisdom yet

00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:09.180 align:middle line:90%
to discern that.

00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:10.763 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a
really good example

00:49:10.763 --> 00:49:13.680 align:middle line:84%
because it almost ended up
infantilizing us in terms

00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:14.970 align:middle line:90%
of our spiritual development.

00:49:14.970 --> 00:49:17.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: So then we
started thinking, OK,

00:49:17.550 --> 00:49:20.970 align:middle line:84%
as the New Age started getting--
the new thinking that says,

00:49:20.970 --> 00:49:22.860 align:middle line:84%
I can use the power
of spirituality

00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:24.250 align:middle line:90%
to get what I want.

00:49:24.250 --> 00:49:27.630 align:middle line:90%
And I can have my "ice cream."

00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And then we tended to
get a very limited view

00:49:31.230 --> 00:49:34.350 align:middle line:90%
of what we thought was success.

00:49:34.350 --> 00:49:38.820 align:middle line:84%
Success was that you are
bringing in beaucoup bucks,

00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:41.640 align:middle line:84%
and you've got this perfect
relationship, and perfect kids,

00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:42.540 align:middle line:90%
and this and that.

00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:46.530 align:middle line:84%
And all I did was, I
said my affirmations,

00:49:46.530 --> 00:49:48.300 align:middle line:90%
and I attracted it to me.

00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:50.220 align:middle line:90%
And you can too.

00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And then it brings about
a guilt that says, wait,

00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:55.590 align:middle line:90%
that's not happening for me.

00:49:55.590 --> 00:49:57.850 align:middle line:90%
I must not be doing it right.

00:49:57.850 --> 00:49:59.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because the
gurus were doing it right.

00:49:59.850 --> 00:50:02.550 align:middle line:84%
We've seen all the films,
Especially in the '90s, yeah.

00:50:02.550 --> 00:50:04.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Yeah,
and then we started

00:50:04.050 --> 00:50:07.170 align:middle line:84%
to get this limited view
of what success was.

00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:10.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, the truth of it is,
when you use spirituality

00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:13.740 align:middle line:84%
in that way, if that
is in your path--

00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:17.130 align:middle line:84%
and I'm very
appreciative of all those

00:50:17.130 --> 00:50:18.900 align:middle line:84%
that brought that
forth because there

00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:20.025 align:middle line:90%
is an aspect of that that--

00:50:20.025 --> 00:50:21.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, in
fact, I'm going

00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:23.207 align:middle line:90%
to bring that exact example up.

00:50:23.207 --> 00:50:24.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: I think it's awesome.

00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:27.750 align:middle line:84%
It's not like saying
this isn't good.

00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:30.930 align:middle line:84%
It's saying that it's this,
and it's this, and it's this,

00:50:30.930 --> 00:50:34.050 align:middle line:84%
and it's this, and
understanding that you're--

00:50:34.050 --> 00:50:37.260 align:middle line:84%
to get to the message your
soul wants to bring forth,

00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:39.010 align:middle line:90%
what is it your soul desires?

00:50:39.010 --> 00:50:39.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:50:39.810 --> 00:50:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm going to take it
through that lens because I

00:50:42.510 --> 00:50:44.290 align:middle line:90%
was guilty of it myself.

00:50:44.290 --> 00:50:47.780 align:middle line:84%
So when I would do,
maybe 25 years ago,

00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:49.030 align:middle line:90%
I started doing vision boards.

00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:49.830 align:middle line:90%
On New Year's Eve.

00:50:49.830 --> 00:50:51.220 align:middle line:90%
And I've mentioned this before.

00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:54.540 align:middle line:84%
But the thing about
it was this, somehow,

00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:57.580 align:middle line:84%
I understood how to do it
so that it actually works.

00:50:57.580 --> 00:51:01.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's because I can
bypass my mind pretty easily.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.850 align:middle line:84%
Because I go on this really
primal kind of feeling.

00:51:03.850 --> 00:51:07.510 align:middle line:84%
So what would happen is I put
my little vision board together.

00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:09.840 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
even the first one.

00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:12.030 align:middle line:90%
This is what I was doing.

00:51:12.030 --> 00:51:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And my friends, I notice,
we're not doing this.

00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And it goes back to mind
attachment and expectation

00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:19.860 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:21.635 align:middle line:84%
I said, look, when
we do this, let's

00:51:21.635 --> 00:51:23.010 align:middle line:84%
have a little
glass of champagne,

00:51:23.010 --> 00:51:25.140 align:middle line:84%
loosen it up, and go
through our images,

00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:28.560 align:middle line:84%
just fly through them like
a little kid, just like,

00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:29.820 align:middle line:90%
oh, I love the color blue.

00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:32.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm ripping that page out
just because it's blue.

00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:34.890 align:middle line:84%
And I was really
specific in saying,

00:51:34.890 --> 00:51:37.860 align:middle line:84%
just kind of go
with a feeling, back

00:51:37.860 --> 00:51:40.770 align:middle line:84%
to this whole feeling thing,
because that works for me.

00:51:40.770 --> 00:51:43.170 align:middle line:84%
So the stuff on my
board would happen.

00:51:43.170 --> 00:51:44.610 align:middle line:90%
Like, this one year, I had--

00:51:44.610 --> 00:51:46.110 align:middle line:84%
literally, I put
a piano on there.

00:51:46.110 --> 00:51:48.030 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have a piano.

00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:50.940 align:middle line:90%
I put scuba diving.

00:51:50.940 --> 00:51:52.710 align:middle line:90%
I put horseback riding.

00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:56.190 align:middle line:84%
This looks like something out
of a "Town & Country" magazine

00:51:56.190 --> 00:51:57.470 align:middle line:90%
or whatever, right?

00:51:57.470 --> 00:51:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And it was just feelings
of pictures I saw.

00:51:59.970 --> 00:52:03.480 align:middle line:84%
All those things came to me as
gifts that year, unexpectedly.

00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:04.625 align:middle line:90%
All that stuff happened.

00:52:04.625 --> 00:52:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And so my friends will say,
how come yours happens,

00:52:06.750 --> 00:52:07.750 align:middle line:90%
and mine doesn't happen?

00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And they start feeling
self-conscious about it.

00:52:10.650 --> 00:52:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And so the thing is,
I started watching

00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:16.050 align:middle line:84%
what was going on
when people were

00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:17.400 align:middle line:90%
putting their boards together.

00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:18.983 align:middle line:84%
They're looking at
images, and they're

00:52:18.983 --> 00:52:21.300 align:middle line:84%
studying it saying,
well, I think

00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:22.440 align:middle line:90%
that's a good word for me.

00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:25.320 align:middle line:84%
No, I think that would be
a good word for me to have.

00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:28.440 align:middle line:84%
Filter, filter, filter, put
everything through the filter.

00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:31.020 align:middle line:84%
So they looked at a board
that had words all over it

00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:35.580 align:middle line:84%
and things that, to me, didn't
have any coherence or joy

00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:36.880 align:middle line:90%
or anything.

00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And so I became inadvertently
serving the wrong purpose

00:52:41.550 --> 00:52:44.490 align:middle line:84%
because, for me, it
seemed so natural.

00:52:44.490 --> 00:52:47.097 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't the way
most people work with it.

00:52:47.097 --> 00:52:48.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: But what did
you learn from that?

00:52:48.930 --> 00:52:51.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I learned that there
are other ways to do this.

00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:53.238 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I
start-- when I met you,

00:52:53.238 --> 00:52:55.530 align:middle line:84%
I had so much respect for
what you do because you do it

00:52:55.530 --> 00:52:57.700 align:middle line:90%
in the way that I don't do it.

00:52:57.700 --> 00:53:01.110 align:middle line:84%
So I am only bringing that up
to say that, yes, those vision

00:53:01.110 --> 00:53:02.490 align:middle line:90%
boards can come true and work.

00:53:02.490 --> 00:53:03.870 align:middle line:90%
I've done it a lot.

00:53:03.870 --> 00:53:08.160 align:middle line:84%
But not if you're not hearing
that wonderful whispering

00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:10.510 align:middle line:84%
from the higher
aspect of yourself.

00:53:10.510 --> 00:53:13.560 align:middle line:84%
It's just, like, oh, god,
I'd love to be underwater.

00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:14.900 align:middle line:90%
It's just a feeling.

00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:16.623 align:middle line:90%
Boom, it happened.

00:53:16.623 --> 00:53:18.540 align:middle line:84%
The point is, it wasn't
spiritual development.

00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:19.170 align:middle line:90%
It was fun.

00:53:19.170 --> 00:53:21.660 align:middle line:84%
I wanted things that we're
going to be pleasurable in life,

00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:23.243 align:middle line:84%
just like what you
were talking about,

00:53:23.243 --> 00:53:26.400 align:middle line:84%
this materialistic
kind of approach to it.

00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:31.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: And so much of that
is somebody else telling them

00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:33.000 align:middle line:90%
what should be on the board.

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:33.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:33.960 align:middle line:90%
Never.

00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:34.800 align:middle line:90%
Never, ever.

00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:36.057 align:middle line:90%
That does not work at all.

00:53:36.057 --> 00:53:37.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: No, it doesn't.

00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:39.120 align:middle line:84%
It's saying everybody
should want this.

00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:42.210 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine, when our souls
came here, they caught the bus

00:53:42.210 --> 00:53:45.630 align:middle line:84%
to come to planet earth,
and they were given a card

00:53:45.630 --> 00:53:49.590 align:middle line:84%
and said, here's what you
have to obtain in your life--

00:53:49.590 --> 00:53:52.230 align:middle line:84%
big house-- check,
the right family--

00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:53.030 align:middle line:90%
check--

00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:54.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: One dull planet.

00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Yeah, like
one-size fits all.

00:53:56.730 --> 00:53:58.437 align:middle line:84%
And yet, that's
kind of what we're

00:53:58.437 --> 00:53:59.520 align:middle line:90%
programmed into believing.

00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:01.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, we
are, absolutely.

00:54:01.230 --> 00:54:04.020 align:middle line:84%
So now let's go to something
that brings you into the now.

00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:07.020 align:middle line:84%
Because we talked about the
other forms of intuition.

00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:09.690 align:middle line:84%
Like our stories where
things just took so much time

00:54:09.690 --> 00:54:11.400 align:middle line:90%
to actually manifest.

00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:13.950 align:middle line:84%
I think one really
interesting way

00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:16.170 align:middle line:84%
of expanding one's
capabilities if someone really

00:54:16.170 --> 00:54:18.630 align:middle line:84%
wants to dive into
it is to-- you

00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:21.660 align:middle line:84%
can go to little clinics, for
example, on remote viewing.

00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:23.610 align:middle line:84%
What's nice about
remote viewing clinics

00:54:23.610 --> 00:54:27.120 align:middle line:84%
is that there's something
in a box on the podium.

00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:28.080 align:middle line:90%
You have two minutes.

00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:29.913 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the
lectures and the practice,

00:54:29.913 --> 00:54:32.220 align:middle line:84%
you have two minutes
to draw or write out

00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:34.320 align:middle line:84%
what's in that little
box on the podium.

00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:36.690 align:middle line:84%
So you're able to
gain trust in yourself

00:54:36.690 --> 00:54:38.250 align:middle line:90%
because it's in the now.

00:54:38.250 --> 00:54:39.660 align:middle line:90%
There are no moving parts.

00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:43.080 align:middle line:84%
There's a thing sitting here,
you just can't see it, right?

00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:45.030 align:middle line:84%
So that's one little
tool, I think,

00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:47.880 align:middle line:84%
for developing intuitive
capacity and faith in self

00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:50.170 align:middle line:84%
because it really comes
down to trusting yourself.

00:54:50.170 --> 00:54:51.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Right.

00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:55.560 align:middle line:84%
I tell people that,
in the beginning,

00:54:55.560 --> 00:55:00.300 align:middle line:84%
to be very gentle
with their confidence

00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:04.350 align:middle line:84%
and not to set themselves
up in a situation

00:55:04.350 --> 00:55:07.950 align:middle line:84%
where they could actually have
evidence that they did not

00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:09.090 align:middle line:90%
see what was in the box.

00:55:09.090 --> 00:55:09.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:11.897 align:middle line:84%
Most people are probably not
going to see what's in there.

00:55:11.897 --> 00:55:12.960 align:middle line:90%
Erase what I just said.

00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:14.780 align:middle line:84%
It's a fun thing to
do, but most people

00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:16.120 align:middle line:90%
won't see it the first time.

00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:16.560 align:middle line:90%
So you're right.

00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:17.620 align:middle line:84%
It could destroy
your confidence.

00:55:17.620 --> 00:55:19.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: It could destroy
your confidence, yeah.

00:55:19.290 --> 00:55:20.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's a now thing.

00:55:20.610 --> 00:55:22.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: It is a now thing,
and it is a lot of fun,

00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:24.340 align:middle line:90%
and fun to play with.

00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:28.810 align:middle line:84%
But I wouldn't say to yourself,
if you didn't see anything,

00:55:28.810 --> 00:55:30.600 align:middle line:90%
I can't do this.

00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And I do have people that say
to me, I am not intuitive.

00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:36.360 align:middle line:90%
I never get anything.

00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:38.780 align:middle line:84%
People tell me to sit
down and visualize this.

00:55:38.780 --> 00:55:40.627 align:middle line:90%
I never see anything.

00:55:40.627 --> 00:55:41.460 align:middle line:90%
Everything is blank.

00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:44.880 align:middle line:84%
They said they feel colors,
and they have a tingling,

00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:46.780 align:middle line:90%
and I don't get anything.

00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:50.790 align:middle line:84%
And then they just dismiss this
idea that they are in any way

00:55:50.790 --> 00:55:51.970 align:middle line:90%
intuitive.

00:55:51.970 --> 00:55:54.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's almost
in denying of the fact

00:55:54.090 --> 00:55:54.930 align:middle line:90%
that, wait a minute.

00:55:54.930 --> 00:55:56.055 align:middle line:90%
You have a higher guidance.

00:55:56.055 --> 00:55:58.590 align:middle line:84%
You are never not in touch
with your higher guidance.

00:55:58.590 --> 00:56:00.360 align:middle line:90%
You're always in touch.

00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:01.620 align:middle line:90%
It's alive and well.

00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:04.450 align:middle line:84%
We just have to find the
way that works for you.

00:56:04.450 --> 00:56:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And so what I like to do is
to have things that require

00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:11.410 align:middle line:90%
absolutely no skill whatsoever.

00:56:11.410 --> 00:56:13.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's what
I love about your work

00:56:13.410 --> 00:56:14.350 align:middle line:90%
and because it works.

00:56:14.350 --> 00:56:15.493 align:middle line:90%
So we're out of time.

00:56:15.493 --> 00:56:17.910 align:middle line:84%
So just really briefly, what
are you working on right now?

00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:20.270 align:middle line:84%
Because I know you have your
courses online and layers

00:56:20.270 --> 00:56:21.270 align:middle line:90%
you take people through.

00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:23.130 align:middle line:84%
What is getting your
jets going this moment.

00:56:23.130 --> 00:56:25.860 align:middle line:10%
>>SLATTER: Oh, I am
so jazzed about this.

00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:28.020 align:middle line:10%
I have a new membership
that I'm creating

00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:31.500 align:middle line:10%
called Raise Your TQ, which
is your transcendental

00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:32.760 align:middle line:10%
intelligence.

00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And the way that I'm
putting this membership

00:56:35.940 --> 00:56:39.120 align:middle line:84%
together is to come up with
very specific questions

00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:42.090 align:middle line:84%
that you get to answer
from your higher guidance,

00:56:42.090 --> 00:56:46.230 align:middle line:84%
and we do it in a tricky way
that bypasses your logic mind.

00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:49.020 align:middle line:84%
Your logic mind cannot answer
because it doesn't know what

00:56:49.020 --> 00:56:50.160 align:middle line:90%
the question is.

00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:53.250 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to get that
confidence that you want

00:56:53.250 --> 00:56:57.480 align:middle line:84%
and develop that trust by seeing
that your higher guidance is

00:56:57.480 --> 00:56:59.430 align:middle line:84%
able to answer
questions for you.

00:56:59.430 --> 00:57:02.420 align:middle line:84%
They will be spot-on,
jaw dropping.

00:57:02.420 --> 00:57:04.280 align:middle line:90%
You'll go, how did I know that?

00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:05.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:05.670 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:57:05.670 --> 00:57:07.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: And that's
what I'm working on.

00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:09.297 align:middle line:90%
I am so excited about it.

00:57:09.297 --> 00:57:11.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I wish
you the best on that.

00:57:11.130 --> 00:57:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And again, I always
enjoy these conversations

00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:14.400 align:middle line:90%
because we're on the same page.

00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:16.690 align:middle line:10%
If we can listen and truly
hear our higher voice,

00:57:16.690 --> 00:57:19.450 align:middle line:10%
life just smooths out
and makes a lot of sense.

00:57:19.450 --> 00:57:21.630 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for
joining me today, Jean.

00:57:21.630 --> 00:57:23.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Thank
you so much Regina.

00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:24.630 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: To connect
with Jean's work

00:57:24.630 --> 00:57:26.588 align:middle line:10%
and class is, you can go
to creativemystic.com.

00:57:26.588 --> 00:57:29.150 align:middle line:10%
A lot of bonding
happens there too.

00:57:29.150 --> 00:57:32.840 align:middle line:10%
So until next time, thank you
for joining us on "Open Minds."
