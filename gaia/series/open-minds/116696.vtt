00:00:27.562 --> 00:00:29.270 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Have you ever wondered

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.840 align:middle line:10%
how certain fantastical tales
of folklore and fairy tales

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.340 align:middle line:10%
came to be true?

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.840 align:middle line:84%
While many of us chalk that
up to fertile imaginations

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.670 align:middle line:84%
of our ancestors,
or perhaps being

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.710 align:middle line:84%
under the influence
of hallucinogens,

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.190 align:middle line:84%
Michael Mott is saying
these tales may well

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.760 align:middle line:90%
be based on reality.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.050 align:middle line:84%
In his book, "Caverns, Cauldrons
and Concealed Creatures,"

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.460 align:middle line:84%
Michael tells us that there
are vast underground biosystems

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.930 align:middle line:84%
that are home to species that
humanity has come to fear,

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.310 align:middle line:84%
specifically, humanoid
species that are not of Earth.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:59.190 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.734 align:middle line:84%
Wow, what an intriguing
book this is.

00:01:01.734 --> 00:01:03.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHAEL MOTT: Well,
I appreciate that.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I would
say they're not of Earth.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.136 align:middle line:84%
I think that actually, they
very much are of Earth.

00:01:07.136 --> 00:01:08.343 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, you're right.

00:01:08.343 --> 00:01:10.600 align:middle line:84%
I just had this conversation
with another gentleman,

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.641 align:middle line:84%
because we tend to think
of them as otherworldly.

00:01:12.641 --> 00:01:14.780 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, they're just
a different species here.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.020 align:middle line:10%
>>MOTT: Well, I think that
what we're seeing here

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.260 align:middle line:10%
is a group of species, and
they are, to some extent,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.560 align:middle line:10%
related to human beings.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.672 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is told in
every folklore tradition

00:01:27.672 --> 00:01:28.380 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to get
into a whole bunch of them.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.850 align:middle line:84%
Because there are so
many and different ways

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.950 align:middle line:84%
these beings show up,
from seemingly benign

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.540 align:middle line:84%
and cute and friendly,
to terrifying.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.810 align:middle line:84%
But first of all, I
want to go to you.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.810 align:middle line:84%
Because you had an
event in your young life

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.620 align:middle line:84%
in Morocco that wasn't very--
well, it was terrifying to you

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.750 align:middle line:84%
as a young boy, because you
had a housekeeper that kept--

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.760 align:middle line:84%
and the people in
Morocco are very much

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.200 align:middle line:84%
ordered toward the unseen worlds
and the djinn and fear of them.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.016 align:middle line:84%
>>MOTT: Well, they
did fear the djinn.

00:01:58.016 --> 00:02:02.250 align:middle line:84%
I remember an incident when
my brother and I actually

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:08.720 align:middle line:84%
had-- we were just kids-- we
had brought home a large lizard.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.590 align:middle line:90%
And they just lost it.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.370 align:middle line:84%
They could not
handle this thing.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.260 align:middle line:84%
They said it was a
djinn and so forth.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.790 align:middle line:90%
And of course, we just laughed.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.400 align:middle line:90%
And it was just a lizard.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.160 align:middle line:84%
But there was another incident,
where we were on a river,

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.250 align:middle line:84%
on a tour, and the boatmen
took us around a bend,

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.070 align:middle line:84%
and there was a cave
up in the cliff side.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.474 align:middle line:84%
And so I asked him, being
seven or eight years old,

00:02:38.474 --> 00:02:39.640 align:middle line:90%
I said, what's in that cave?

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.973 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh, he says, you
don't want to go in there.

00:02:41.973 --> 00:02:43.200 align:middle line:90%
And I said, why?

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.630 align:middle line:84%
And he said, because Aisha
Kandisha lives in there.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.379 align:middle line:84%
And that she is a witch, and she
is from the underworld, and all

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:52.170 align:middle line:90%
this kind of stuff.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.086 align:middle line:84%
And she's really bad,
and she'll come get you.

00:02:54.086 --> 00:02:56.890 align:middle line:84%
She takes little kids and--
this is a typical boogeyman type

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:57.800 align:middle line:90%
story.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.840 align:middle line:84%
But when I got older, and
I was doing more research

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.990 align:middle line:84%
into these things, I
remembered this story.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And over and over again,
we hear this idea--

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But it scared you.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: Well, it had an effect.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.040 align:middle line:84%
It definitely piqued
my imagination.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It peaked your-- OK.

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.220 align:middle line:84%
That's where I'm
getting to in all this.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.990 align:middle line:84%
Tell us if that
was the seed that

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.970 align:middle line:84%
may have been
planted for what came

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.372 align:middle line:84%
to be this intense fascination
at this point in your life.

00:03:21.372 --> 00:03:23.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MOTT: Well, it was
probably part of it.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.090 align:middle line:84%
You know, everything
goes into the stew pot.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.730 align:middle line:84%
I was always a fan of
folklore, mythology,

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.620 align:middle line:84%
and comparative religion, of
course, fiction and nonfiction

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:33.520 align:middle line:90%
both.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.110 align:middle line:90%
And all these things, history.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.110 align:middle line:84%
There are incidents from
history which are basically

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.930 align:middle line:90%
the same type of thing.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.180 align:middle line:84%
And after awhile, it
became apparent to me

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.260 align:middle line:84%
that there were
certain patterns that

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.930 align:middle line:84%
were in existence which
indicated that there's

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.810 align:middle line:90%
something to all this stuff.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.422 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you look at the way
people around the world deal

00:03:54.422 --> 00:03:56.380 align:middle line:84%
with it, they'll deal
with it very differently.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.930 align:middle line:84%
So cultures embrace it and say,
this is part of our culture.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.733 align:middle line:84%
We believe that these
beings are real,

00:04:01.733 --> 00:04:03.750 align:middle line:84%
and they live under that
mountain, over there.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.170 align:middle line:84%
Whereas you have cultures like
the Western culture, where

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.400 align:middle line:84%
that's just fairy tales,
and that's for children.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.941 align:middle line:84%
Well, the more you
learn about fairy tales,

00:04:11.941 --> 00:04:13.815 align:middle line:84%
fairy tales are not
really just for children.

00:04:13.815 --> 00:04:16.019 align:middle line:90%
Fairy tales are bloody.

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.950 align:middle line:90%
They're cautionary tales.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.090 align:middle line:84%
They're meant to convey
survival messages and lessons.

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.330 align:middle line:84%
The whole point of a fairytale
was really to teach children,

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.852 align:middle line:90%
don't go into those places.

00:04:27.852 --> 00:04:30.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And a lot of times,
this is the dark of the woods

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.561 align:middle line:84%
at night, and so forth, and into
caves and under logs and you

00:04:34.561 --> 00:04:35.060 align:middle line:90%
know--

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.643 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: Right.

00:04:35.643 --> 00:04:36.310 align:middle line:90%
The dark places.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.226 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like in the
Bible, where it says,

00:04:38.226 --> 00:04:40.970 align:middle line:84%
the dark places of the earth
are filled with the habitations

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.130 align:middle line:90%
of cruelty.

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.310 align:middle line:84%
There are reasons that these
cautionary statements are

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.120 align:middle line:84%
in all this folklore
and mythology and all

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.552 align:middle line:90%
these religious texts.

00:04:48.552 --> 00:04:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And the more you
delve into it, you

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.290 align:middle line:84%
see that it really does tie
into mysteries that people

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.750 align:middle line:84%
are interested in today,
which they mistakenly

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.640 align:middle line:84%
believe are new and
recent mysteries,

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.130 align:middle line:90%
but they're not at all.

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.557 align:middle line:90%
Very old.

00:05:00.557 --> 00:05:02.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And one of the
common threads, it seems,

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.520 align:middle line:84%
is whichever
culture, as you say,

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.360 align:middle line:84%
some embrace these great
ancestors, others don't.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.060 align:middle line:84%
But there seems to be
a feeling in general

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.780 align:middle line:84%
that what is subterranean
is dark and evil.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're going back into
mythology and the journey

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.610 align:middle line:84%
into the underworlds and
such, and dealing with demons

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.160 align:middle line:84%
before one can surface back
into the sun, the light.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MOTT: Well even going back
to the oldest written story

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.346 align:middle line:84%
we have, "Gilgamesh,"
or "Gilgameshi," he

00:05:31.346 --> 00:05:32.720 align:middle line:84%
had to journey to
the underworld,

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.739 align:middle line:84%
and he was searching
for immortality.

00:05:34.739 --> 00:05:36.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, the reason he was
searching for immortality

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.980 align:middle line:84%
was because he was
descended from someone

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.735 align:middle line:90%
that claimed to be a god.

00:05:42.735 --> 00:05:44.860 align:middle line:84%
And this is a theme that
you find again and again--

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.070 align:middle line:90%
demigods.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.650 align:middle line:84%
Or as the Torah and
the Old Testament

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.190 align:middle line:84%
called them, Nephilim
or Anakim, which

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.500 align:middle line:84%
is very similar to
Annuna, you'll notice.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.140 align:middle line:84%
These are beings
that are part human,

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:03.640 align:middle line:84%
and they're part of
this underworld reality.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:07.274 align:middle line:84%
And just like with today, with
so-called alien abductions

00:06:07.274 --> 00:06:08.690 align:middle line:84%
and things of this
nature, they're

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.180 align:middle line:84%
fascinated by human
genetic diversity,

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.380 align:middle line:84%
and they seem to
require an influx

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:15.710 align:middle line:90%
of human genetic material.

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.460 align:middle line:84%
You know, if they were
from the other side

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.880 align:middle line:84%
of the galaxy or
another star system,

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.290 align:middle line:84%
and they could travel at the
speed of light or warp space

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.564 align:middle line:84%
and time, create a
wormhole, their technology

00:06:25.564 --> 00:06:26.980 align:middle line:84%
would be so
advanced-- and I'm not

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.563 align:middle line:84%
saying that it's
not-- that they would

00:06:28.563 --> 00:06:32.590 align:middle line:84%
be able to recombine their
own DNA, rewrite their DNA,

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:34.080 align:middle line:90%
repair any damage.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.914 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't need to come
all the way out here to do it.

00:06:36.914 --> 00:06:37.580 align:middle line:90%
In other words--

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:38.538 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is true.

00:06:38.538 --> 00:06:41.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MOTT: In other words, the
only reason they would do this

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:44.646 align:middle line:84%
is because in some way they
are genetically related to us.

00:06:44.646 --> 00:06:45.770 align:middle line:90%
And when you looks at the--

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:48.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or have to at least
adapt to this environment.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: Yes.

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.140 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:52.980 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're half
genetically related to us.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.550 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
biodiversity of the earth,

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.730 align:middle line:84%
you have hermit crabs and
blue whales and elephants

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:01.122 align:middle line:84%
and Maasai warriors
and penguins.

00:07:01.122 --> 00:07:02.580 align:middle line:84%
And if you were
from another world,

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.434 align:middle line:84%
or just someplace where you
were totally isolated, if you'd

00:07:06.434 --> 00:07:07.850 align:middle line:84%
lived on an island
your whole life

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:09.880 align:middle line:84%
and didn't know anything
about the rest the world,

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.560 align:middle line:84%
and you saw all these
different life forms,

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.140 align:middle line:84%
you would think, where in the
world did all of these things

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:14.136 align:middle line:90%
come from?

00:07:14.136 --> 00:07:16.010 align:middle line:84%
They can't possibly come
from the same place.

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:17.340 align:middle line:90%
But they do.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.030 align:middle line:84%
They share a common
genetic heritage.

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:22.760 align:middle line:84%
They are actually
genetically similar

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.116 align:middle line:84%
and related from the
biodiversity of the Earth.

00:07:26.116 --> 00:07:27.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you
look at the things

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:29.720 align:middle line:84%
that people encounter,
whether it's

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.330 align:middle line:84%
so-called aliens of different
types, or hairy humanoids,

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.500 align:middle line:84%
or chupacabras, or any
number of strange creatures

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:41.050 align:middle line:84%
that people say that they've
encountered, there's shock

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:44.250 align:middle line:84%
and there's awe when
they see these beings,

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:45.330 align:middle line:90%
but they're astonished.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.470 align:middle line:84%
They're not thinking
in terms of does

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:50.870 align:middle line:84%
this conform to an earthly
vertebrate template.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.710 align:middle line:90%
And without fail, it does.

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:55.342 align:middle line:84%
They always conform to an
earthly vertebrate template.

00:07:55.342 --> 00:07:56.800 align:middle line:84%
They have bilateral
symmetry, which

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.510 align:middle line:84%
means both sides
are basically equal,

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:01.790 align:middle line:84%
two arms, two legs,
or four flippers,

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:03.600 align:middle line:90%
or whatever the case may be.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And they are going to be
either reptilian, mammalian,

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.740 align:middle line:90%
or a combination of the two.

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:11.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, people that claim they've
seen insectoids, well--

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:12.727 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or the Ant people.

00:08:12.727 --> 00:08:13.310 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: Right.

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:15.878 align:middle line:84%
But Insects are part of the
Earth's genetic diversity.

00:08:15.878 --> 00:08:16.461 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:16.461 --> 00:08:17.002 align:middle line:90%
Yes they are.

00:08:17.002 --> 00:08:19.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MOTT: And on top of that,
these insectoids people

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.984 align:middle line:84%
see generally have two
arms, and two legs.

00:08:21.984 --> 00:08:23.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
Praying Mantis people.

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:24.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: Yes.

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:25.590 align:middle line:90%
Still, two arms and two legs.

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:26.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Two arms and two legs.

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:28.564 align:middle line:84%
>>MOTT: So we're talking about
a vertebrate of some kind,

00:08:28.564 --> 00:08:30.670 align:middle line:84%
or at least something
that's partially vertebrate.

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:34.429 align:middle line:84%
Now is it some sort of
genetically engineered form?

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:34.929 align:middle line:90%
Who knows.

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:37.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, ancient texts are
full of stuff like that.

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:42.240 align:middle line:84%
You'll find ledgers all over
the world about the gods mixing

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.270 align:middle line:90%
species together.

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:45.906 align:middle line:84%
In the book of Enoch, one
of the apocryphal books,

00:08:45.906 --> 00:08:47.780 align:middle line:84%
that's one of the great
sins before the flood

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:51.535 align:middle line:84%
of the Nephilim, the ones
who are already half human.

00:08:51.535 --> 00:08:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that they
did-- because they weren't just

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:59.480 align:middle line:84%
physical giants, they were
mental giants-- and the books

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.010 align:middle line:84%
of Enoch, all
three versions, say

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:05.680 align:middle line:84%
that they were mixing
human and animal DNA.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And that this was a great
threat to the future propagation

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.230 align:middle line:84%
of those species as
they were meant to be.

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:16.990 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it
threatened their viability

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:19.030 align:middle line:90%
if it were to continue.

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And so you have this in several
of the apocryphal books.

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:25.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Old Testament
just simplifies it

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:28.470 align:middle line:84%
and says all flesh had corrupted
its way upon the Earth.

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:31.280 align:middle line:84%
But it's talking
about what was talked

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.930 align:middle line:84%
about in the book of
Enoch, which was this gene

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:36.380 align:middle line:90%
splicing and the creatures.

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.120 align:middle line:84%
But when you look
today at things

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.440 align:middle line:84%
that people see, like el
chupacabras and a number

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.820 align:middle line:84%
of other anomalous
creatures, they

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:47.290 align:middle line:84%
exhibit the same sort of
hybrid characteristics

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:49.670 align:middle line:84%
of several species
mixed into one.

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:51.952 align:middle line:84%
And we're not talking about
supernatural stuff, here.

00:09:51.952 --> 00:09:54.410 align:middle line:84%
I think we're talking about--
in this particular instance--

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:56.280 align:middle line:90%
probably talking about science.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You call
them interterrestrials.

00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:59.707 align:middle line:90%


00:09:59.707 --> 00:10:02.040 align:middle line:84%
That's one term you use in
your book, interterrestrials.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.040 align:middle line:84%
Instead of extraterrestrials,
interterrestrials.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: And subterrestrials.

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:06.719 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And subterrestrials.

00:10:06.719 --> 00:10:09.495 align:middle line:84%
And now, I don't even
know if this is related.

00:10:09.495 --> 00:10:10.786 align:middle line:90%
It's just popping into my mind.

00:10:10.786 --> 00:10:12.430 align:middle line:84%
It's a conversation
I had with a fellow

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:15.110 align:middle line:84%
who had been with an
intelligence community.

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:18.250 align:middle line:84%
He died a rapid and
unfortunate death.

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:21.740 align:middle line:84%
But just before he died, they
had this conversation with him

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:24.820 align:middle line:84%
about what was happening
to the human species.

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And he was saying
that there's going

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:30.440 align:middle line:84%
to be a larger percentage
or incorporation

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:34.520 align:middle line:84%
of copper in the blood, as
opposed to iron in the blood.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:38.220 align:middle line:84%
And he was talking about
species that already

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:39.600 align:middle line:90%
possess high levels of copper.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.141 align:middle line:84%
And he seemed to be
referring to what

00:10:41.141 --> 00:10:45.820 align:middle line:84%
we have called ETs, or pale, or
blue, or gray types of species

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:48.555 align:middle line:84%
as having more
copper in the blood.

00:10:48.555 --> 00:10:49.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: That's interesting.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.750 align:middle line:84%
I know that if you have too
much silver in your blood,

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:55.480 align:middle line:84%
that you will take on
that sort of a cast.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.760 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is
that again, we have

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:02.390 align:middle line:84%
to wonder what we hear,
how much is disinformation,

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:05.510 align:middle line:84%
and how much is-- when
I hear the word alien,

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:07.350 align:middle line:84%
I think anything strange
to you is "alien."

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:08.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:08.730 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:09.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: Right.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, he was
dealing in some pretty strange

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:12.120 align:middle line:90%
projects.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.850 align:middle line:90%
It was a private conversation.

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:17.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MOTT: And I'm not
saying that there are not

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.340 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrials out
there in the universe.

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.630 align:middle line:84%
I believe the universe
is teeming with life.

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:22.745 align:middle line:90%
I believe it's everywhere.

00:11:22.745 --> 00:11:24.370 align:middle line:84%
And some of them are
probably advanced,

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:28.510 align:middle line:84%
and they're probably
bipedal humanoid forms.

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:35.390 align:middle line:84%
But logic dictates that the huge
variety of bipedal, basically

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:40.120 align:middle line:84%
reptilian, mammalian
appearing creatures that

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.320 align:middle line:84%
have been seen by
people here on Earth

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.752 align:middle line:84%
are not all coming here
from 50 different planets.

00:11:45.752 --> 00:11:47.960 align:middle line:84%
They're from here, and
they've always been from here.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:48.501 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:11:48.501 --> 00:11:55.120 align:middle line:84%
So let's start getting into
more the geological aspect

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:59.400 align:middle line:84%
of the story, and explain
to us what the Moho is,

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.880 align:middle line:84%
and let's explain about
different attempts

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:04.760 align:middle line:84%
to drill down deep
into the earth's

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.930 align:middle line:84%
crust for certain
discoveries, and let's

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:08.400 align:middle line:90%
talk about this part of it.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MOTT: Well, we discovered
through seismology

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.580 align:middle line:84%
that there is an anomalous
region at the crust mantle

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:19.220 align:middle line:84%
boundary, the Mohorovicic,
which is shortened to Moho.

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And we know that it's
anomalous, because when

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.900 align:middle line:84%
we bounce seismic
waves through it,

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:30.460 align:middle line:84%
it shows valleys, peaks
and troughs, and basically,

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:33.070 align:middle line:84%
what looks like either--
well, areas of less density.

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:37.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, some of those areas may be
filled with water, air, magma,

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:39.640 align:middle line:90%
all three, in different areas.

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.690 align:middle line:84%
But this is a
world-wide structure,

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:46.530 align:middle line:84%
20 miles down beneath the
continents, and 11 miles--

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:47.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Under the sea.

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:48.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: --under the sea.

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And there's always going to be
somebody wondering if there's

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.140 align:middle line:90%
a military application to it.

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:56.050 align:middle line:84%
The US Navy tried to
drill to it and failed.

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:58.340 align:middle line:84%
They got almost
there and they quit.

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.800 align:middle line:84%
The Russians tried to
drill to it, and they quit.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.160 align:middle line:90%
Supposedly.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.422 align:middle line:84%
But it's an area of
immense pressure.

00:13:05.422 --> 00:13:07.630 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting thing
is that all over the world,

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:11.707 align:middle line:84%
there are large cavern systems
that constantly blow air.

00:13:11.707 --> 00:13:13.956 align:middle line:84%
There are huge volumes of
air that constantly pour out

00:13:13.956 --> 00:13:16.440 align:middle line:84%
of these caves, like
Blowing Cave in Arkansas,

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:22.010 align:middle line:84%
Lechuguilla in New Mexico, some
of the big caves in Vietnam

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:23.070 align:middle line:90%
and other places.

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:26.950 align:middle line:84%
There are always huge, vast
amounts of air pouring out

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:27.745 align:middle line:90%
of these caverns.

00:13:27.745 --> 00:13:30.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, where's the
air coming from?

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.480 align:middle line:84%
That air has to
come from somewhere.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:35.380 align:middle line:84%
So my general feeling
is that it's probably

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:36.999 align:middle line:90%
coming from the Moho.

00:13:36.999 --> 00:13:38.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure how
it's being produced.

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:41.340 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's being produced
by heat in reaction

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:43.080 align:middle line:90%
with subterranean water.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.500 align:middle line:84%
But somehow, it's coming
about, and it's pouring out.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, where you have huge
amounts of air moving and oxygen

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.740 align:middle line:84%
and water, you're
going to have life.

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:56.974 align:middle line:84%
And where you have
bacteria, you're

00:13:56.974 --> 00:13:58.390 align:middle line:84%
going to have other
forms of life,

00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:00.840 align:middle line:84%
because there's always stuff
that feeds off of bacteria.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And now it's been postulated
that as many as 90%

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:06.780 align:middle line:84%
of all the bacteria on
Earth may be subterranean.

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:09.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, they find new subterranean
bacteria every year,

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:12.800 align:middle line:84%
and they also find other
life forms every year

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.100 align:middle line:90%
in caves and caverns.

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:16.214 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And just the
network of fungus alone.

00:14:16.214 --> 00:14:16.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: Oh yeah.

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:17.380 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah.

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:21.344 align:middle line:84%
And so we're talking
about-- we barely

00:14:21.344 --> 00:14:23.260 align:middle line:84%
know anything about the
surface of our planet,

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.170 align:middle line:84%
much less what's
under the surface.

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:30.000 align:middle line:84%
We find new discoveries all
the time here on the surface.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And then we go into the oceans,
the depths of the oceans,

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:33.930 align:middle line:90%
where a lot of UFOs come from.

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:34.513 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:34.513 --> 00:14:35.269 align:middle line:90%
The USOs.

00:14:35.269 --> 00:14:35.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: Yeah.

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:39.200 align:middle line:90%
And the Earth itself.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.700 align:middle line:84%
We can only go down so far,
because the pressure gets

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:44.390 align:middle line:90%
to be so great.

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And again, the whole idea
of the elevated pressure,

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:50.520 align:middle line:84%
adapting to greater
pressure, seems

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.940 align:middle line:84%
to tie in with a lot of
these anomalous platforms.

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.480 align:middle line:84%
They seem to exhibit the
characteristics of something

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:59.280 align:middle line:84%
that originates in a room
of higher density or higher

00:14:59.280 --> 00:14:59.900 align:middle line:90%
pressure.

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.492 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about the
anomalies of the poles?

00:15:02.492 --> 00:15:03.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MOTT: The anomalies
of the poles.

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:06.875 align:middle line:84%
Well, I do talk about
that in my book.

00:15:06.875 --> 00:15:09.250 align:middle line:84%
I have a chapter on that, and
that there is an indication

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:11.990 align:middle line:84%
that there is something
anomalous about the poles.

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:13.990 align:middle line:84%
There are some things
that just don't add up,

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:18.260 align:middle line:84%
in terms of
mysteries of weather,

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.940 align:middle line:84%
and encounters that
people have had,

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:25.095 align:middle line:84%
and UFO activity over the poles,
and things of this nature.

00:15:25.095 --> 00:15:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And does this mean that
the Earth is a geode,

00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:31.020 align:middle line:84%
or does it just mean that
there's entrances there

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:33.150 align:middle line:90%
to the subterranean areas?

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:35.830 align:middle line:84%
Or could it be that there's
some sort of wormhole type

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:38.100 align:middle line:84%
thing going on that ties
into the gravitational field

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:38.880 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth.

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:40.100 align:middle line:90%
We really don't know.

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:42.350 align:middle line:84%
Whoever knows is probably
not going to tell us.

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:44.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and then
there was, supposedly,

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.960 align:middle line:84%
during the Hitler years, a
lot of interest in Antarctica.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And supposedly, a base that
was established in Antarctica.

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:57.000 align:middle line:84%
He was fascinated with
Antarctica and whatever

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.306 align:middle line:90%
life forms were there.

00:15:59.306 --> 00:16:00.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: Well, yeah.

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:01.470 align:middle line:90%
That's a rumor.

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:02.780 align:middle line:90%
But it's a very good rumor.

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:02.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's a rumor.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:03.890 align:middle line:90%
It's a good rumor.

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:04.473 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: It is.

00:16:04.473 --> 00:16:06.110 align:middle line:84%
Because just recently,
they discovered

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:09.890 align:middle line:84%
that the body found in
the bunker was not Hitler.

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:11.320 align:middle line:90%
It was a female.

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:12.820 align:middle line:90%
By DNA analysis.

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:15.690 align:middle line:84%
So everybody said, well,
Hitler died in the bunker.

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:16.690 align:middle line:90%
Well, no.

00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:17.902 align:middle line:90%
He didn't, apparently.

00:16:17.902 --> 00:16:19.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, will they rewrite
the history books?

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:20.740 align:middle line:90%
I doubt it.

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:22.531 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Probably not
going to be written.

00:16:22.531 --> 00:16:25.180 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless, there have
been some very interesting bits

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:28.530 align:middle line:84%
of evidence having to do with
certain missing submarines.

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:31.300 align:middle line:84%
Submarines that went
off the radar and--

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:32.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: Some were never found.

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:34.980 align:middle line:84%
A few were found off
the coast of Argentina,

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:37.700 align:middle line:84%
and the people on
board were captured.

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:40.170 align:middle line:84%
But more were not
found, and they

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:43.240 align:middle line:84%
were the ones that were
supposedly sent to Antarctica.

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:46.762 align:middle line:84%
Now, there were German officials
who made some statements

00:16:46.762 --> 00:16:48.970 align:middle line:84%
to the effect that they were
working on a base there,

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:51.330 align:middle line:84%
and that they had discovered
something fantastic.

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:54.710 align:middle line:84%
They had discovered a
subterranean realm, basically,

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:56.730 align:middle line:84%
where everything was
totally different

00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:58.500 align:middle line:90%
than it is here on the surface.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:04.079 align:middle line:84%
And allegedly, Admiral
Byrd went down there

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:06.920 align:middle line:84%
and came back so
shaken that he said,

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.119 align:middle line:84%
we have to nuke
it till it glows.

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:10.910 align:middle line:84%
If we don't, we're
going to be overwhelmed.

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:12.880 align:middle line:84%
There's a superior
technology there.

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And he was taken
aside and said, we're

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.550 align:middle line:90%
not going to talk about that.

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:18.276 align:middle line:84%
And he kind of backed
off the statement.

00:17:18.276 --> 00:17:20.775 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are people now who
say, well, that didn't happen.

00:17:20.775 --> 00:17:22.030 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's always the case.

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:24.160 align:middle line:84%
But for decades
and decades, people

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.996 align:middle line:84%
remembered hearing
this and seeing this.

00:17:25.996 --> 00:17:28.329 align:middle line:84%
And there are people that
still remember seeing the news

00:17:28.329 --> 00:17:32.710 align:middle line:84%
reel that he sent back, where
he flew beyond the poles

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:35.280 align:middle line:84%
and saw something strange,
in terms of a landscape that

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.790 align:middle line:90%
should not have been there.

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:38.440 align:middle line:84%
So again, what are
we talking about?

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:42.120 align:middle line:84%
Are we talking about--
is the Earth a geode?

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, it doesn't tie
in well with the ideas

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.671 align:middle line:84%
of how gravity works and how
our electromagnetic field is

00:17:46.671 --> 00:17:47.170 align:middle line:90%
formed.

00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:49.753 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, but they just--
the new information on gravity,

00:17:49.753 --> 00:17:52.540 align:middle line:84%
which is something I
was told by some beings

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:54.734 align:middle line:84%
quite a long time ago,
was that gravity is not

00:17:54.734 --> 00:17:55.650 align:middle line:90%
what we thought it is.

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:56.691 align:middle line:90%
It isn't a one-way force.

00:17:56.691 --> 00:17:58.170 align:middle line:84%
It's a two-way
force that creates

00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:02.000 align:middle line:84%
in places of equilibrium within
gravity moving both directions.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.692 align:middle line:84%
>>MOTT: And it warps space
and time around itself.

00:18:04.692 --> 00:18:06.150 align:middle line:84%
So if we're talking
about something

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:08.260 align:middle line:84%
that is warping
space and time, you

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:11.910 align:middle line:84%
might be able to create what's
known as a space-time bubble.

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:13.910 align:middle line:84%
Could that be what the
hollow Earth actually is?

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:15.980 align:middle line:90%
Could it be a space-time bubble?

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:19.530 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the Earth is
built like we think it is,

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:21.361 align:middle line:84%
and it generates the
electromagnetic field,

00:18:21.361 --> 00:18:22.860 align:middle line:84%
but couldn't there
be some other way

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:25.725 align:middle line:84%
to access a
space-time bubble that

00:18:25.725 --> 00:18:27.590 align:middle line:84%
is also created by the
gravitational field

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:28.486 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth?

00:18:28.486 --> 00:18:29.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these are
all just ideas.

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:33.970 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, they seem to be
valid in their-- at least

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:35.227 align:middle line:90%
to consider and talk about.

00:18:35.227 --> 00:18:35.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:39.320 align:middle line:84%
OK So we have, even in cave
art, extraterrestrial presence.

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:40.950 align:middle line:84%
What "appears to be"
extraterrestrials.

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:43.000 align:middle line:84%
That's what we've
labeled them as thus far.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And I had a conversation with
a man named Ken Cherry, who's

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:51.960 align:middle line:84%
written a book more with the
military and intelligence

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:55.960 align:middle line:84%
community implications of having
these underground "ET" species

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:58.400 align:middle line:90%
that are actually native.

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.110 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk about that
from your point of view.

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MOTT: Well, I think
that there is evidence

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.650 align:middle line:84%
that there is somebody
else here with us,

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:07.320 align:middle line:90%
and they've always been here.

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.990 align:middle line:90%
You talk about cave art.

00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:11.540 align:middle line:84%
That's why I say, people
think that all these mysteries

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:14.660 align:middle line:84%
are new, you know, UFOs
coming from Alpha Centauri.

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:17.130 align:middle line:84%
Well no, they've been
here ever since people

00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:18.339 align:middle line:90%
could record them being here.

00:19:18.339 --> 00:19:19.838 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Aboriginals,
the Wandjina.

00:19:19.838 --> 00:19:20.580 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: Right.

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:23.400 align:middle line:84%
Even in some of the
caverns in France,

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:27.800 align:middle line:84%
there's pictures which
look like flying saucers.

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:30.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't know what else
the caveman could have been

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:32.920 align:middle line:84%
attempting to convey, since
there were no animals running

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.150 align:middle line:90%
around that looked like that.

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:38.510 align:middle line:84%
So there are a
lot of indications

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:40.020 align:middle line:90%
that we've never been alone.

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:43.352 align:middle line:84%
Now, my concern here with
these types of things is--

00:19:43.352 --> 00:19:45.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These are the humanoid
species we're speaking of.

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:46.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:46.382 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: Right.

00:19:46.382 --> 00:19:48.720 align:middle line:84%
I think we're talking about
more than one species.

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:52.440 align:middle line:84%
I think there are species
that aren't indigenous that

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:55.122 align:middle line:90%
are kind of indifferent to us.

00:19:55.122 --> 00:19:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And by that, I mean they've
probably advanced so far by now

00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:01.700 align:middle line:84%
that the only thing they see
us as is a nuisance, maybe.

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:06.629 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I say that is
because if, for instance, there

00:20:06.629 --> 00:20:08.920 align:middle line:84%
were a reptilian species
which basically evolved almost

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:11.240 align:middle line:84%
to look totally human,
over time, they would.

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:12.990 align:middle line:84%
Or if there were
other species that

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:15.050 align:middle line:84%
had been here that had
evolved to a higher

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:19.000 align:middle line:84%
state of technological
advancement,

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.190 align:middle line:84%
they could have had their
singularity a long time ago.

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:24.890 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if they've
discovered a way to use,

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:29.740 align:middle line:84%
say, the computing power of
gigantic crystalline structures

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:31.890 align:middle line:90%
inside the Earth--

00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:34.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which was said to
exist in Atlantean times,

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:35.010 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:35.593 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: Right.

00:20:35.593 --> 00:20:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And now we know
that quartz, which--

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:40.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, crystals are made
of-- even limestone-- quartz,

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:43.390 align:middle line:90%
magnetite, silica.

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And all these things,
they will hold energy,

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:48.300 align:middle line:90%
and they can transmit energy.

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And they store energy
and information.

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:51.780 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:54.130 align:middle line:84%
So let's say that
someone figured this

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:58.010 align:middle line:90%
out half a million years ago.

00:20:58.010 --> 00:21:00.370 align:middle line:90%
How advanced would they be now?

00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:01.940 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you take
just one cavern,

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:04.430 align:middle line:84%
like the cave in Mexico
that's full of crystals,

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:07.160 align:middle line:84%
and you turned it
into a supercomputer.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:11.030 align:middle line:84%
What capabilities would
you open up for yourself?

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:13.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they would
essentially be like gods,

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:14.770 align:middle line:90%
as far as we're concerned.

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:16.667 align:middle line:84%
So I think we have
groups like that.

00:21:16.667 --> 00:21:17.750 align:middle line:90%
I think they're out there.

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:20.205 align:middle line:84%
I also think that there
are other groups that

00:21:20.205 --> 00:21:23.800 align:middle line:84%
are a little more predatory
and parasitic towards humanity

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:25.090 align:middle line:90%
and the way they look at us.

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:26.260 align:middle line:84%
I think they're the
ones that are probably

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.100 align:middle line:84%
related to us in
some way, in terms

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:30.590 align:middle line:84%
of being a hominid or
partially a hominid.

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:32.840 align:middle line:84%
The ones we were
talking about earlier.

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:34.184 align:middle line:90%
I think that they see--

00:21:34.184 --> 00:21:36.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are you speaking
more of the grays and that type

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:38.410 align:middle line:90%
of being, or reptilian, or--

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:40.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MOTT: I'm talking
about beings that

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:44.450 align:middle line:84%
want to use us for
genetic purposes,

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:47.437 align:middle line:84%
to take what is not
theirs, without permission.

00:21:47.437 --> 00:21:49.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, let's just
call it what it is.

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:50.350 align:middle line:90%
That's what they do.

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:51.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, wait a minute.

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.830 align:middle line:84%
If they've always been here,
what is to say-- I mean,

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:55.955 align:middle line:84%
you say to take what's not
theirs, look what we do,

00:21:55.955 --> 00:21:57.540 align:middle line:84%
in terms of genetic
experimentation

00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:58.645 align:middle line:90%
on other species.

00:21:58.645 --> 00:21:59.478 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: Oh, I agree.

00:21:59.478 --> 00:22:01.980 align:middle line:84%
But see, looking from
a human perspective,

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:04.767 align:middle line:84%
I have to say that before
somebody comes and steals

00:22:04.767 --> 00:22:07.100 align:middle line:84%
my genetics, I would like to
give them permission first.

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:07.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That would
be nice, and I'm

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:09.350 align:middle line:84%
sure the species
we experiment on

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:11.650 align:middle line:84%
would love to have been
granted permission-- I mean,

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:13.525 align:middle line:84%
would love to have been
asked permission too,

00:22:13.525 --> 00:22:14.359 align:middle line:90%
if they could speak.

00:22:14.359 --> 00:22:16.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm not-- I'm just
playing devil's advocate

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:17.177 align:middle line:90%
for just one moment.

00:22:17.177 --> 00:22:18.260 align:middle line:90%
This is a complex subject.

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:19.350 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: Oh, it's super complex.

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:21.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Anyone that we
understand is in the right,

00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:21.670 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:23.980 align:middle line:84%
But if we don't understand,
they're in the wrong.

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:25.271 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: I look at it like this.

00:22:25.271 --> 00:22:32.051 align:middle line:84%
I look at what happens with
humans when we tag animals.

00:22:32.051 --> 00:22:32.550 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:34.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, a biologist
will go in the field,

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:37.060 align:middle line:84%
and they will tranquilize
an animal, where

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:40.030 align:middle line:84%
it's totally out of it, and
it's not feeling the pain.

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And it will tag the
animal and examine it.

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:46.480 align:middle line:84%
Then it will set the animal free
and make sure it's basically

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:48.320 align:middle line:90%
back on its way.

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:52.030 align:middle line:84%
This is called being humane,
because we humans came up

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:53.460 align:middle line:90%
with this.

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:56.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We did, except until
you go to university labs.

00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:56.920 align:middle line:90%
That's not humane.

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:57.330 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: That's true.

00:22:57.330 --> 00:22:58.130 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:00.906 align:middle line:84%
But when I look at
some of the stories

00:23:00.906 --> 00:23:02.530 align:middle line:84%
that people tell
about their encounters

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:06.420 align:middle line:84%
with these beings that show
up, and basically-- OK.

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:07.250 align:middle line:90%
They're supposed--

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:08.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us
about the encounters,

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.030 align:middle line:84%
but we also have
to say, at least

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:11.240 align:middle line:90%
they lived to tell the story.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:11.676 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:11.676 --> 00:23:11.937 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: That's right.

00:23:11.937 --> 00:23:12.550 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:15.630 align:middle line:84%
But these beings are supposedly
advanced genetically,

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:20.160 align:middle line:84%
mentally,
technologically advanced.

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And they show up, and they will
put some sort of a dampening

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:25.970 align:middle line:84%
field out, which
seems to inhibit

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:29.452 align:middle line:84%
the electromagnetic activity
of the brain of the subject.

00:23:29.452 --> 00:23:30.910 align:middle line:84%
That's what they're
doing, I think.

00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:31.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:32.470 align:middle line:90%
Kind of stunning the person.

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:33.011 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: Yeah.

00:23:33.011 --> 00:23:36.982 align:middle line:84%
And basically, they put them in
a state of-- an altered state

00:23:36.982 --> 00:23:37.690 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:39.780 align:middle line:90%
And they cannot fight.

00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:41.030 align:middle line:90%
They cannot defend themselves.

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:42.730 align:middle line:84%
Kind of like we do with
animals in the field.

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:44.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, oftentimes,
people are paralyzed.

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:45.630 align:middle line:90%
Conscious, but yet paralyzed.

00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:46.296 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: Exactly.

00:23:46.296 --> 00:23:47.860 align:middle line:90%
But they're still conscious.

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:51.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's the thing
that always got me

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.400 align:middle line:90%
about the whole situation.

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.420 align:middle line:84%
Often, they will
go out of their way

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:58.580 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that the person
knows what's going on,

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:01.240 align:middle line:84%
and they will do
painful procedures

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:05.530 align:middle line:84%
without any anesthetic-- not
even a local anesthetic--

00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:08.726 align:middle line:84%
and say, basically, the message
is, look what we can do.

00:24:08.726 --> 00:24:09.850 align:middle line:90%
Look what we can do to you.

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:14.270 align:middle line:90%
Now, this, to me, is sadistic.

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:16.380 align:middle line:84%
You can call it what
you want, but to me, it

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:17.800 align:middle line:90%
seems to be a control mechanism.

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:21.430 align:middle line:84%
It's like Pavlovian
conditioning,

00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:25.015 align:middle line:84%
or other types of conditioning,
where you'll get used to this.

00:24:25.015 --> 00:24:26.120 align:middle line:90%
This is what we do.

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:27.570 align:middle line:90%
We have the right to do this.

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:28.410 align:middle line:90%
We'll look at your--

00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:30.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or they're just
incredibly insensitive.

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:30.903 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: Insensitive.

00:24:30.903 --> 00:24:32.764 align:middle line:84%
And if they're
supposedly telepathic,

00:24:32.764 --> 00:24:34.180 align:middle line:84%
then they know
what they're doing.

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:35.850 align:middle line:84%
They know the
terror that's there.

00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:36.895 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Maybe their
emotional bodies

00:24:36.895 --> 00:24:38.150 align:middle line:90%
aren't developed like ours.

00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:40.066 align:middle line:84%
>>MOTT: Well, they've
been around a long time.

00:24:40.066 --> 00:24:41.920 align:middle line:84%
I think it's more along
the lines of they're

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:44.080 align:middle line:90%
interested in how we react.

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:47.160 align:middle line:90%
And if it's cruel, it's cruel.

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:49.130 align:middle line:84%
When you look back
in the folklore,

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:51.680 align:middle line:84%
you'll see that this is
not dissimilar to some

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:55.740 align:middle line:84%
of the things that shaman go
through when they encounter

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:56.660 align:middle line:90%
non-human entities.

00:24:56.660 --> 00:25:01.680 align:middle line:84%
Their bodies are dismembered
and then put back together.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:02.870 align:middle line:90%
They feel it all.

00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:04.180 align:middle line:90%
They can't stop it.

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:06.900 align:middle line:84%
Or the demonology
of the Middle Ages

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:08.675 align:middle line:84%
had similar things
that happened.

00:25:08.675 --> 00:25:11.320 align:middle line:90%


00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:14.170 align:middle line:90%
The people who practice alchemy.

00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:17.520 align:middle line:84%
They're the first
scientists, the alchemists.

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:20.240 align:middle line:84%
They claimed that
some things like

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:22.840 align:middle line:84%
this would happen sometimes
with some of the elementals

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:24.350 align:middle line:90%
that they had to deal with.

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:27.100 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking at
something here which, to me,

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:30.000 align:middle line:84%
these are all masks
for the same thing.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.740 align:middle line:90%
The same phenomena.

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:35.350 align:middle line:84%
So I think that there's
a disconnect here.

00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:40.540 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say that any
species that is just inherently

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:43.650 align:middle line:84%
cruel, we need to be
really cautious of how

00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:44.780 align:middle line:90%
we deal with them.

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:46.261 align:middle line:90%
And I find the same thing--

00:25:46.261 --> 00:25:47.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I would agree.

00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:48.940 align:middle line:84%
Whether they're
intentionally cruel,

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:51.770 align:middle line:84%
or whether they just don't have
any sensitive mechanisms going,

00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:54.610 align:middle line:84%
either way, that's something
we wouldn't be comfortable

00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:55.470 align:middle line:90%
interfacing with.

00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:56.053 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: Right.

00:25:56.053 --> 00:26:01.180 align:middle line:84%
Because they appear to
have, at best, indifference.

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they
exhibit contempt.

00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:06.520 align:middle line:84%
There have been plenty
of stories of them being

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.820 align:middle line:90%
contemptuous of human beings.

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:11.940 align:middle line:84%
So I think that, again, that
there are those who genetically

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:13.259 align:middle line:90%
need what we have.

00:26:13.259 --> 00:26:15.050 align:middle line:84%
They have to have a
regular influx of this,

00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:17.050 align:middle line:84%
because I don't
know if they've hit

00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:19.790 align:middle line:84%
a genetic bottleneck, of if
they're a hybrid species which

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:20.770 align:middle line:90%
is related to us.

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:24.730 align:middle line:84%
But for whatever reason, they
have a semi-regular influx

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:26.200 align:middle line:90%
of human genetic material.

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:29.165 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you think maybe
they want to ultimately emerge

00:26:29.165 --> 00:26:29.694 align:middle line:90%
and become--

00:26:29.694 --> 00:26:30.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: Become more like us?

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:31.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:32.800 align:middle line:84%
A species that lives above
the crust of the Earth.

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:35.174 align:middle line:84%
>>MOTT: I think that there's
a certain amount of jealousy

00:26:35.174 --> 00:26:35.840 align:middle line:90%
here, honestly.

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:36.880 align:middle line:90%
For something someone had said--

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:37.086 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I
mean, it seems to me,

00:26:37.086 --> 00:26:39.482 align:middle line:84%
if I could choose, [LAUGHS]
I'd sure rather live

00:26:39.482 --> 00:26:40.190 align:middle line:90%
above the ground.

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:40.856 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: Exactly.

00:26:40.856 --> 00:26:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And so they kind of
resent us for the fact

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:45.510 align:middle line:90%
that they are dependent on us.

00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is
in the literature.

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:52.710 align:middle line:84%
You can see this in-- you read
Karla Turner's stuff, or Benny

00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:54.020 align:middle line:90%
Andreasen.

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:57.170 align:middle line:84%
These beings are very
manipulative and deceptive,

00:26:57.170 --> 00:26:59.540 align:middle line:90%
and they do need what we have.

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:02.187 align:middle line:84%
And they seem to resent
the fact that they need it.

00:27:02.187 --> 00:27:04.020 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
we should look at too

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:08.130 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that even
though we know now

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:09.980 align:middle line:84%
that these things
have been going on

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:14.360 align:middle line:84%
for probably tens of thousands
of years at the very least,

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:18.440 align:middle line:84%
that these beings still
do not want us to know

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:20.180 align:middle line:90%
where they really come from.

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:24.170 align:middle line:84%
For instance, when they were
portraying themselves as gods,

00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:27.127 align:middle line:84%
they would come down, and
Zeus would come and chase

00:27:27.127 --> 00:27:28.960 align:middle line:84%
the daughters of men,
and then he would say,

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.170 align:middle line:84%
well, you can't really
do anything about it,

00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:32.165 align:middle line:84%
because I live up there
on that big mountain,

00:27:32.165 --> 00:27:33.420 align:middle line:90%
and you can't get that high.

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:35.600 align:middle line:90%
And so you're just out of luck.

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:36.101 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:27:36.101 --> 00:27:37.766 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've reached
a point where we can

00:27:37.766 --> 00:27:39.140 align:middle line:90%
reach the top of the mountains.

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:42.625 align:middle line:84%
We can go down a certain
depth into the sea.

00:27:42.625 --> 00:27:44.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not far
enough, though.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:44.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: No.

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:45.640 align:middle line:90%
They're still there.

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:50.230 align:middle line:84%
But now, whenever they encounter
people, they go overboard,

00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:53.915 align:middle line:84%
as far as I can tell, to say,
well, we come from up there.

00:27:53.915 --> 00:27:55.040 align:middle line:90%
You see that star up there?

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.310 align:middle line:90%
That's where we come from.

00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:58.920 align:middle line:84%
Oh, don't-- in other words,
don't look over here under this

00:27:58.920 --> 00:27:59.420 align:middle line:90%
mountain.

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:03.414 align:middle line:84%
Don't look beneath that
desert, under that ocean.

00:28:03.414 --> 00:28:05.330 align:middle line:84%
So you saw UFOs coming
out of the Great Lakes?

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:06.720 align:middle line:90%
Well, don't look in there.

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:07.540 align:middle line:90%
Forget about that.

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:09.500 align:middle line:90%
That's not where we come from.

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And just because
they have the ability

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:13.830 align:middle line:84%
to zip around the solar
system doesn't mean

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:15.611 align:middle line:90%
that they're not from here.

00:28:15.611 --> 00:28:17.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
an interesting point.

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:19.910 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about-- you talked
about a sea a moment ago.

00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:21.640 align:middle line:84%
I meant to ask you
this a little bit ago.

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:26.590 align:middle line:84%
Princeton seismologists claim
there's this gigantic sea 555

00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:29.210 align:middle line:90%
miles under modern day Europe.

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:30.870 align:middle line:90%
Did I read that correctly?

00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:31.400 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: Yes.

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:33.920 align:middle line:84%
There are indications that
there are both bodies of water,

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:35.820 align:middle line:84%
and there's huge
amounts of water--

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:39.330 align:middle line:84%
there are huge amounts of water
which are locked in the strata.

00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:43.180 align:middle line:84%
And that means that they
are actually, basically,

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:45.836 align:middle line:84%
almost in molecular
form in the strata.

00:28:45.836 --> 00:28:47.460 align:middle line:84%
But there are other
areas which do seem

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:49.475 align:middle line:90%
to be full of liquid water.

00:28:49.475 --> 00:28:51.225 align:middle line:84%
And they're finding
new ones all the time.

00:28:51.225 --> 00:28:52.933 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you said
another one, here.

00:28:52.933 --> 00:28:54.170 align:middle line:90%
2,000 miles under Indonesia.

00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:54.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: Right.

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:55.380 align:middle line:90%
There's one there.

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:56.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: 2,000 miles
under Indonesia.

00:28:56.990 --> 00:28:57.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: Yes.

00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:01.680 align:middle line:10%
Now, I would imagine that that
water's probably superheated.

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:03.652 align:middle line:10%
And if it is, you have a--

00:29:03.652 --> 00:29:05.860 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You'd have a
tropical environment of types.

00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:10.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MOTT: Or you have an engine
for the development of life

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:13.300 align:middle line:90%
in higher levels in the crust.

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:15.150 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if
you're generating

00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:19.730 align:middle line:84%
that kind of heat, super
thermal heat, at that depth,

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:23.210 align:middle line:84%
then that water is
going to produce oxygen.

00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:25.450 align:middle line:84%
It's going to
produce water vapor.

00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:28.510 align:middle line:84%
It's going to percolate
up through the crust.

00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And the Earth is
not a solid object.

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:33.295 align:middle line:84%
People have this concept
about the Earth being solid.

00:29:33.295 --> 00:29:37.770 align:middle line:84%
The Earth is full of fissures,
cracks, chasms, gaps,

00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:38.660 align:middle line:90%
cave systems.

00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:40.600 align:middle line:90%
All these things are there.

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:44.710 align:middle line:84%
So you have the possibility,
under the right conditions,

00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:47.260 align:middle line:84%
in any number of places,
where different forms of life

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:50.055 align:middle line:90%
could develop at high pressure.

00:29:50.055 --> 00:29:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And again, you see this
with a lot of the creatures

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:53.612 align:middle line:90%
that are seen by people.

00:29:53.612 --> 00:29:55.070 align:middle line:84%
There are many
anomalous encounters

00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:59.450 align:middle line:84%
with people who encounter
creatures where they hit them

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:02.570 align:middle line:84%
with a shovel, and they say it's
just like hitting a brick wall.

00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:04.095 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was kind
of odd when I read that.

00:30:04.095 --> 00:30:04.636 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: Yeah.

00:30:04.636 --> 00:30:07.770 align:middle line:84%
Or they shoot them, and the
creature's just irritated.

00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:09.050 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it hurts.

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:10.280 align:middle line:90%
It seems to stain.

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:10.815 align:middle line:90%
But it--

00:30:10.815 --> 00:30:12.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Doesn't
take them down.

00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:13.481 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: Doesn't take them down.

00:30:13.481 --> 00:30:15.890 align:middle line:84%
Or with the so
called men in black,

00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:17.866 align:middle line:84%
who, interestingly
enough, they claim

00:30:17.866 --> 00:30:19.740 align:middle line:84%
to come from the-- at
least in one encounter,

00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:22.110 align:middle line:84%
they said they came from
the Nation of the Third Eye.

00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:25.670 align:middle line:84%
Which is interesting, because
according to Tibetan Buddhism,

00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:28.845 align:middle line:84%
the king of the world is the
head of the Nation of the Third

00:30:28.845 --> 00:30:30.540 align:middle line:90%
Eye, which is underground.

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:32.760 align:middle line:84%
It's called Agharta
or Shamballa.

00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:37.130 align:middle line:90%
So we have these clues.

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:40.120 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the men in
black, when they show up,

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:43.990 align:middle line:84%
at first they operate
more or less normally.

00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:47.590 align:middle line:84%
But as time goes by, they seem
to become short of breath.

00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:50.310 align:middle line:90%
They can't function properly.

00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:50.890 align:middle line:90%
They stammer.

00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:52.140 align:middle line:90%
They stutter.

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:54.030 align:middle line:84%
They can't seem
to move properly.

00:30:54.030 --> 00:30:54.530 align:middle line:90%
And they--

00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:55.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They don't do
well in this atmosphere.

00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:56.563 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: Right.

00:30:56.563 --> 00:31:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And then they will quickly
jump up, and they'll say,

00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:00.960 align:middle line:90%
we have to go.

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:02.187 align:middle line:90%
Our time is up.

00:31:02.187 --> 00:31:03.770 align:middle line:84%
And they kind of
stagger out the door.

00:31:03.770 --> 00:31:05.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, what they're
doing is they're

00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:08.890 align:middle line:84%
exhibiting the effects
of nitrogen poisoning

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:10.080 align:middle line:90%
in their blood.

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:14.229 align:middle line:84%
They're showing that they may
have some sort of ability to--

00:31:14.229 --> 00:31:16.520 align:middle line:84%
even if it's some sort of
chemical ability or something

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:20.280 align:middle line:84%
that they take-- to withstand
a sudden change in pressure

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:21.950 align:middle line:84%
from where they
really come from.

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:24.361 align:middle line:84%
But if they stay too long,
they start to get the bends.

00:31:24.361 --> 00:31:26.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They get the bends,
and they're also, again,

00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:27.790 align:middle line:90%
these same characteristics.

00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:29.400 align:middle line:90%
Extraordinarily pale.

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:32.790 align:middle line:84%
Some kind of what we have
called ET or grey-like features.

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:33.930 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: Or humanoid hybrid.

00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:36.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Humanoid
hybrid features.

00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And the same kind of-- it's a
hive mentality behavior, again.

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:41.075 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: It really is.

00:31:41.075 --> 00:31:41.699 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:41.699 --> 00:31:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And not particularly
sensitive to humans.

00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:45.510 align:middle line:84%
Just working-- but not
necessarily horrible.

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:47.780 align:middle line:84%
Just doing their own agenda
for their own purposes.

00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:50.155 align:middle line:84%
>>MOTT: And it's interesting
that you say hive mentality,

00:31:50.155 --> 00:31:54.340 align:middle line:84%
because many creatures that
live in the earth exhibit hive

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:55.360 align:middle line:90%
behavior.

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.290 align:middle line:90%
Not just insects.

00:31:57.290 --> 00:32:02.130 align:middle line:84%
Prairie dogs, for instance, or
just any number of creatures

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:02.630 align:middle line:90%
that--

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:05.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, Ken Cherry said
that that's-- the grays exhibit

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:07.436 align:middle line:84%
the same behavior, where they
have mass consciousness they

00:32:07.436 --> 00:32:08.970 align:middle line:90%
are each tapped into as a hive.

00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:11.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MOTT: And so we're
talking about something here

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:14.020 align:middle line:84%
that's-- the way it thinks
is so different from us,

00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:20.680 align:middle line:84%
it's as different as the way
we think is from the way a cat

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:21.260 align:middle line:90%
would think.

00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:22.600 align:middle line:90%
Which is pretty different.

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:25.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they think totally
different than we do.

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:27.180 align:middle line:84%
So their idea of right
and wrong is probably

00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:29.510 align:middle line:84%
totally different than our
idea of right and wrong.

00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:32.084 align:middle line:84%
And that may explain
some of their attitude

00:32:32.084 --> 00:32:33.750 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to the
things that they do

00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:38.850 align:middle line:84%
and that they think they're
entitled to do to human beings.

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:42.002 align:middle line:84%
So I think that the humans have
to look out for the humans.

00:32:42.002 --> 00:32:43.210 align:middle line:90%
Because we have to look out--

00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:43.266 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:43.266 --> 00:32:45.099 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have a lot of
other little critters

00:32:45.099 --> 00:32:47.220 align:middle line:84%
to talk about besides
just those guys, too.

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:49.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they show up in
so many different ways.

00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And Richard Dewhurst,
I interviewed him,

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:54.820 align:middle line:84%
having to do with giants in
America, in ancient America.

00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:58.830 align:middle line:84%
But also, he talked, as you did,
about Kentucky's Mammoth Cave.

00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:01.250 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about just
the vastness of that,

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:04.280 align:middle line:84%
for example, and some of
the types of creatures

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:06.130 align:middle line:84%
that have been associated
with that region?

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:06.671 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: Sure.

00:33:06.671 --> 00:33:10.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're talking about
Kentucky's Mammoth Cave,

00:33:10.810 --> 00:33:12.070 align:middle line:90%
but not just Kentucky.

00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:14.860 align:middle line:84%
West Virginia is what's
called a Karst region,

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:17.680 align:middle line:84%
and it's the most densely caved
region of the United States.

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:19.910 align:middle line:84%
There are cavern systems
there which still have not

00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:21.426 align:middle line:90%
been totally mapped.

00:33:21.426 --> 00:33:23.050 align:middle line:84%
The Mammoth Cave
system is one of them,

00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:25.090 align:middle line:84%
because they're constantly
finding new passageways,

00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:27.548 align:middle line:84%
and they think they've found
it, and then, all of a sudden,

00:33:27.548 --> 00:33:29.090 align:middle line:90%
they've got more.

00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:31.450 align:middle line:84%
There have been a lot of
strange creatures associated

00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:33.409 align:middle line:90%
with that whole region.

00:33:33.409 --> 00:33:35.450 align:middle line:84%
It's probably had more
strange creature sightings

00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:38.950 align:middle line:84%
than any other part of
America or North America.

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:41.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What kinds of
critters or creatures?

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:43.720 align:middle line:10%
>>MOTT: The so-called
Hopkinsville goblins

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:44.780 align:middle line:10%
from Kentucky.

00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:46.240 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Would you give
us their characteristics?

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:47.198 align:middle line:10%
What do they look like?

00:33:47.198 --> 00:33:51.570 align:middle line:10%
>>MOTT: They're basically
similar to-- I would say,

00:33:51.570 --> 00:33:53.496 align:middle line:10%
similar to gremlins or trolls.

00:33:53.496 --> 00:33:55.120 align:middle line:84%
They're small little
guys, [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:57.127 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not a lot
of-- no real neck.

00:33:57.127 --> 00:33:57.710 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: Right.

00:33:57.710 --> 00:33:59.915 align:middle line:84%
But they have big
ears, which makes sense

00:33:59.915 --> 00:34:01.790 align:middle line:84%
if you're in an environment
that's very dark,

00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:02.832 align:middle line:90%
and you use echolocation.

00:34:02.832 --> 00:34:03.498 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:34:03.498 --> 00:34:04.002 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:34:04.002 --> 00:34:05.030 align:middle line:90%
That would make sense.

00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:06.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MOTT: They also
are extremely dense,

00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:09.489 align:middle line:84%
because the family that
encountered them shot them

00:34:09.489 --> 00:34:11.290 align:middle line:90%
multiple types with firearms.

00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:14.210 align:middle line:84%
And again, it would just
sting them and infuriate them.

00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:16.110 align:middle line:84%
But it didn't do
any real damage.

00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:17.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Were these
beings displaying

00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:18.739 align:middle line:90%
aggressive behaviors?

00:34:18.739 --> 00:34:19.239 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: Yes.

00:34:19.239 --> 00:34:21.750 align:middle line:84%
They were aggre--
they seemed to be

00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:26.610 align:middle line:84%
interested in the young people
of the family or the females.

00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:27.770 align:middle line:90%
That's my opinion.

00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:29.270 align:middle line:84%
That's what they
were interested in.

00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:33.520 align:middle line:84%
But you see the same thing
again and again in that region.

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:39.490 align:middle line:84%
You'll see all types of little
people, big, hairy humanoids,

00:34:39.490 --> 00:34:41.580 align:middle line:90%
other strange creatures.

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:43.312 align:middle line:90%
There's an excellent book out.

00:34:43.312 --> 00:34:44.770 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember
the author's name.

00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:46.061 align:middle line:90%
But it's called "White Things."

00:34:46.061 --> 00:34:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And it deals with a number of
anomalies from West Virginia,

00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:54.360 align:middle line:90%
and they're always white.

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:58.442 align:middle line:84%
Now, white would be associated
with a creature which

00:34:58.442 --> 00:35:00.150 align:middle line:84%
does not come out to
the light very much.

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:04.090 align:middle line:84%
A creature which is
subterranean in nature.

00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:06.900 align:middle line:84%
You have these themes which
come up again and again.

00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:09.250 align:middle line:84%
But that theme comes
up all over the world.

00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:13.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's not just
the Appalachian region.

00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:16.660 align:middle line:84%
But another aspect
of a Karst region,

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:20.580 align:middle line:84%
a limestone caverns region,
is that those mountains

00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:22.000 align:middle line:90%
are made of limestone.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.220 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of water that
moves through that limestone.

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:29.460 align:middle line:84%
Limestone's made of
silica, magnetite, quartz.

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:31.635 align:middle line:84%
On the molecular
level, it generates

00:35:31.635 --> 00:35:34.380 align:middle line:84%
an electromagnetic field
when water runs through it.

00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:37.330 align:middle line:84%
A powerful one, if the
water's moving fast enough.

00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:40.810 align:middle line:84%
It also could be
used, potentially,

00:35:40.810 --> 00:35:43.670 align:middle line:84%
to record information,
even if it was information

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:45.740 align:middle line:90%
from the environment.

00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:48.070 align:middle line:84%
So it's an anomalous
region with a lot

00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:49.850 align:middle line:90%
of strange characteristics.

00:35:49.850 --> 00:35:53.170 align:middle line:84%
And the people that
live there know

00:35:53.170 --> 00:35:56.760 align:middle line:84%
that there's a lot
of folklore that

00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:59.860 align:middle line:84%
indicates that there's something
going on beneath their feet.

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:05.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you think about
folklore, I'm of the opinion

00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:08.670 align:middle line:84%
that what we're
doing right now is

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:12.945 align:middle line:84%
we are participating
in update of folklore.

00:36:12.945 --> 00:36:15.320 align:middle line:84%
In other words, this is the
same stuff people have always

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:16.290 align:middle line:90%
talked about.

00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:19.200 align:middle line:84%
We're just putting our
modern interpretation on it.

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:25.050 align:middle line:84%
And you have to be careful not
to become part of the folklore.

00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:29.010 align:middle line:84%
You have to be careful
to be objective and try

00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:34.790 align:middle line:84%
to look at it through
the lens of evaluating it

00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:36.740 align:middle line:90%
as a folkloric medium.

00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:38.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we to
think of the British

00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:40.190 align:middle line:84%
and the European
folklore that have

00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:44.520 align:middle line:84%
to do-- like Geoffrey Hodson's
work on elves and fairies

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:50.110 align:middle line:84%
and brownies and what are the
little sinuous water sprite

00:36:50.110 --> 00:36:52.120 align:middle line:90%
feminine characters, and such.

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:55.780 align:middle line:84%
We tend to think of those
as more-- whether we're

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:59.429 align:middle line:84%
flattering ourselves-- allies
of humanity and little helpers.

00:36:59.429 --> 00:37:01.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MOTT: Well, here's
where that comes from.

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:03.900 align:middle line:84%
That comes from
the Victorian Age.

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:07.520 align:middle line:84%
Prior to the Victorian Age, the
so-called fairies or fey folk,

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:10.359 align:middle line:84%
or trolls, or whatever
you want to call them.

00:37:10.359 --> 00:37:11.900 align:middle line:84%
Depending on where
you are in Europe,

00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:13.150 align:middle line:90%
they all have different names.

00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:14.740 align:middle line:90%
But they're the same beings.

00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:16.810 align:middle line:90%
They were all viewed with fear.

00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:17.950 align:middle line:90%
They still are in Ireland.

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:19.312 align:middle line:90%
They still are in Iceland.

00:37:19.312 --> 00:37:20.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And Scotland.

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:21.710 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: Yeah, and Scotland.

00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:24.491 align:middle line:90%
They were-- they're sinister.

00:37:24.491 --> 00:37:26.240 align:middle line:84%
They're referred to
as the good neighbors,

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:27.440 align:middle line:90%
because that's a euphemism.

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.050 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
hurt their feelings.

00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:30.410 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:32.080 align:middle line:90%
They abduct people.

00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:34.540 align:middle line:84%
They abduct children
and young maidens.

00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:38.780 align:middle line:84%
They try to force maidens
and young men to marry them.

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:40.500 align:middle line:84%
Again, we have
this genetic theme.

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:41.230 align:middle line:90%
The same thing.

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:45.500 align:middle line:84%
They steal the genetic
diversity of the farmers.

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:47.330 align:middle line:90%
Like aliens supposedly do.

00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:49.010 align:middle line:90%
They really like beef a lot.

00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:50.820 align:middle line:90%
They like to take cattle.

00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:55.130 align:middle line:84%
They like to take other types
of farm animals and the crops.

00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:58.490 align:middle line:84%
They'll come in and steal a
crop right before harvest.

00:37:58.490 --> 00:38:02.500 align:middle line:84%
It's as if the Victorians
came along and said,

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:04.080 align:middle line:90%
oh, this stuff's too scary.

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:06.371 align:middle line:84%
We like these stories, but
we're going to clean them up

00:38:06.371 --> 00:38:08.490 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to put
little wings on everybody.

00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:10.325 align:middle line:84%
The fairies from folklore
don't have wings.

00:38:10.325 --> 00:38:11.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not until Disney.

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:11.950 align:middle line:90%
Tinkerbell.

00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:12.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: Yeah.

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:15.340 align:middle line:84%
They tended to be rather bloody,
sinister little characters.

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:16.715 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
it's interesting.

00:38:16.715 --> 00:38:19.170 align:middle line:84%
In the series-- the
"Outlander" series of books,

00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:22.890 align:middle line:84%
Diana Gabaldon-- however
you pronounce her name--

00:38:22.890 --> 00:38:24.190 align:middle line:90%
did a fair amount of research.

00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:26.260 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, the whole
notion of the fairies that

00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:28.330 align:middle line:84%
take the babies, the
newborns and such,

00:38:28.330 --> 00:38:32.380 align:middle line:84%
was also factored into her
story of the local folklore

00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:34.055 align:middle line:84%
of the people in the
Scottish highlands.

00:38:34.055 --> 00:38:36.730 align:middle line:84%
They were terrified that their
babies we're going to be taken.

00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:39.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MOTT: Well, you look at--
you'll still get glimpses

00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:41.440 align:middle line:90%
of that in fairy tales.

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:44.310 align:middle line:84%
You have the story
of Rumpelstiltskin.

00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:44.810 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:49.030 align:middle line:84%
Here's a little guy who really,
really wants that human baby,

00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:51.980 align:middle line:84%
and he'll do whatever
it takes to get it.

00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And not only does he
want the human baby,

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:57.060 align:middle line:84%
but he's involved in the
politics of the region.

00:38:57.060 --> 00:39:01.200 align:middle line:84%
He's involved in who marries
who and getting his hands

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:03.695 align:middle line:84%
on a child that will
have a claim to a throne.

00:39:03.695 --> 00:39:06.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you think that's
like hiding in plain sight?

00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:07.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MOTT: I think it's pretty
much a message that tells us

00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:09.147 align:middle line:90%
that something's going on.

00:39:09.147 --> 00:39:11.230 align:middle line:84%
And you'll have the same
thing with, for instance,

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:16.170 align:middle line:84%
the whole idea of frog
princesses and frog princes.

00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:18.710 align:middle line:84%
You have the frog prince
or the frog princess.

00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And usually, it's a frog prince,
but sometimes it's a female.

00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:25.910 align:middle line:84%
And they will appear
as a reptilian,

00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:27.680 align:middle line:90%
let's say an amphibian.

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:31.740 align:middle line:84%
But look, if you exchange
your genetic material

00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:35.520 align:middle line:84%
and kiss with them, oh, they
become a handsome prince,

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:36.790 align:middle line:90%
and everything's wonderful.

00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:37.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: An interesting
interpretation, yeah?

00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:38.331 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: Yeah.

00:39:38.331 --> 00:39:40.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, you go over
to the Far East,

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:43.400 align:middle line:84%
and you'll find legends
in both China and Japan

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:47.210 align:middle line:84%
about men, young
men and maidens who

00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:51.340 align:middle line:84%
are abducted by dragon
kings, dragon princes, dragon

00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:52.640 align:middle line:90%
princesses.

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:55.350 align:middle line:84%
Or the dragon king will
grab some guy and say,

00:39:55.350 --> 00:39:57.784 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
marry my daughter.

00:39:57.784 --> 00:39:58.700 align:middle line:90%
These types of things.

00:39:58.700 --> 00:39:59.550 align:middle line:90%
It's the same thing.

00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:01.091 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
said earlier, there

00:40:01.091 --> 00:40:03.610 align:middle line:84%
are some cultures that are
proud of their background.

00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And the Asian culture
is proud of these dragon

00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:08.204 align:middle line:90%
clans, who they consider what?

00:40:08.204 --> 00:40:08.703 align:middle line:90%
Ancestors?

00:40:08.703 --> 00:40:09.390 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: Right.

00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:13.420 align:middle line:84%
Ancestors or
relatives or patrons.

00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:15.260 align:middle line:84%
You go into the
Indian subcontinent,

00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:16.595 align:middle line:90%
and you have the Naga.

00:40:16.595 --> 00:40:17.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Naga.

00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:17.937 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:40:17.937 --> 00:40:20.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MOTT: Well, the Naga
are-- that's basically also

00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:21.430 align:middle line:90%
what they call cobras.

00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:24.230 align:middle line:84%
But the Naga people,
they live in a place

00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:26.340 align:middle line:84%
called Patala, beneath
the Hindu Kush Mountains.

00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:27.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
worshipped everywhere.

00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:29.560 align:middle line:84%
And through all the
monasteries and temples

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:31.100 align:middle line:90%
are renderings of them.

00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:33.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MOTT: Go read the
different ancient writings,

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:36.470 align:middle line:84%
and you'll find that
they aren't so nice.

00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:37.490 align:middle line:90%
They abduct people.

00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:39.670 align:middle line:90%
They really like women a lot.

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:42.960 align:middle line:84%
They also occasionally
might eat somebody.

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:45.510 align:middle line:84%
They have flying craft,
which are basically

00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:48.400 align:middle line:84%
UFOs, which they keep in
caverns beneath the Earth.

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And this is a theme that
we find over and over again

00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:52.030 align:middle line:90%
in all of these stories.

00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:54.400 align:middle line:84%
That they live underground,
and that they could fly.

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:57.500 align:middle line:84%
That they're interested
in human genetic diversity

00:40:57.500 --> 00:40:59.160 align:middle line:90%
and in mixing with human beings.

00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:02.430 align:middle line:84%
But they're also interested
in human politics,

00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:06.640 align:middle line:90%
in human societies.

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:07.747 align:middle line:90%
Who's in charge.

00:41:07.747 --> 00:41:10.080 align:middle line:84%
They really, really seem to
be interested in that a lot.

00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:11.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, so
you hear in various

00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:16.810 align:middle line:84%
of the ufology cases that
are more conspiracy oriented,

00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:18.416 align:middle line:84%
with the military
and the government,

00:41:18.416 --> 00:41:19.540 align:middle line:90%
high-ups in the government.

00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:20.040 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:21.530 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to Tibet.

00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:23.930 align:middle line:84%
The Tibetan monks
say that they are

00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:25.540 align:middle line:90%
derived from the Monkey Kings.

00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:26.900 align:middle line:90%
What is that about?

00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:28.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MOTT: Well,
basically, they believe

00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:31.960 align:middle line:84%
that a subterranean being,
which they call-- basically,

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:38.320 align:middle line:84%
what we would call an ogre-- at
some point, came out of a cave

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:43.000 align:middle line:84%
and mated with women and
created the Tibetan people.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.500 align:middle line:84%
They're kind of proud of it,
and again, they're kind of not.

00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:47.160 align:middle line:90%
Because ogres are kind of scary.

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:49.130 align:middle line:84%
Basically, they're
talking about the yeti.

00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:53.470 align:middle line:84%
Something that's not analogous
to that form, which is

00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:56.820 align:middle line:84%
believed, in that region, to be
something that lives in caves.

00:41:56.820 --> 00:42:00.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they really believe
that that's where it comes from.

00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:04.150 align:middle line:84%
So again, we're
talking about an unseen

00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:06.080 align:middle line:90%
kingdom that rules everything.

00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:08.620 align:middle line:84%
They very much believe
that the whole planet is

00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:11.790 align:middle line:90%
ruled by a subterranean king.

00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:14.320 align:middle line:90%
The king of Shamballa.

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:16.160 align:middle line:90%
And the nation of the Third Eye.

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:18.564 align:middle line:84%
And if you go look
at their art, well,

00:42:18.564 --> 00:42:20.230 align:middle line:84%
just look at their
religious traditions.

00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:22.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the whole
idea of opening up

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:27.070 align:middle line:84%
the pineal, the pineal
gland, the third eye.

00:42:27.070 --> 00:42:29.590 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
goes all the way back

00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:33.687 align:middle line:84%
to this ancient belief
in these non-human beings

00:42:33.687 --> 00:42:35.520 align:middle line:84%
and their abilities,
which we're associating

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:37.750 align:middle line:90%
with that particular gland.

00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:40.570 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's telepathy,
or whatever it is.

00:42:40.570 --> 00:42:46.570 align:middle line:84%
So the whole region is
basically absolutely mired

00:42:46.570 --> 00:42:49.350 align:middle line:84%
in this belief of an
underworld that's real.

00:42:49.350 --> 00:42:49.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:51.980 align:middle line:84%
What about the
intru-- you say there

00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:54.160 align:middle line:84%
are beings of a more
intrusive and lustful nature.

00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:57.670 align:middle line:84%
And in one of your chapters,
you have the horned beings

00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:58.920 align:middle line:90%
and Pan-like beings.

00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:00.910 align:middle line:90%
The seducers.

00:43:00.910 --> 00:43:02.240 align:middle line:90%
Talk about them for a moment.

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:04.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MOTT: Well, I think
they're all-- to some extent,

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:06.370 align:middle line:90%
fit that description.

00:43:06.370 --> 00:43:13.030 align:middle line:84%
Because any beings that come to
innocent people, simple people

00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:15.610 align:middle line:84%
in a village, and try to
convince them to give them

00:43:15.610 --> 00:43:17.920 align:middle line:84%
their sons and
daughters, there's

00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:22.290 align:middle line:84%
something going on there
that's not exactly above board.

00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:25.927 align:middle line:84%
And whether it's the Pied Piper,
which now people are saying,

00:43:25.927 --> 00:43:27.260 align:middle line:90%
well, that was just a migration.

00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:29.416 align:middle line:84%
Well, go back and read
the original stuff.

00:43:29.416 --> 00:43:31.540 align:middle line:84%
It was a pretty sinister
thing that happened there.

00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And then he takes all these
young, genetically viable

00:43:35.890 --> 00:43:39.100 align:middle line:84%
young people, and he disappears
into a mountainside with them,

00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:40.970 align:middle line:90%
and they're never seen again.

00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:42.460 align:middle line:90%
This is the same old story.

00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:46.250 align:middle line:84%
This is the same motif that
we see again and again.

00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:48.080 align:middle line:84%
But then you have
things like Satyrs,

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:50.220 align:middle line:84%
which kind of tie in to
what we were talking about

00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:51.720 align:middle line:90%
earlier with the hybrid beings.

00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:54.720 align:middle line:84%
Beings that were
created by somebody.

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And they have a strong interest
in mixing their genetics

00:43:57.330 --> 00:43:58.300 align:middle line:90%
with human beings.

00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:01.190 align:middle line:84%
Probably because they have
to in order to propagate.

00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:07.690 align:middle line:84%
In other words, some hybrid
species cannot procreate with

00:44:07.690 --> 00:44:09.820 align:middle line:90%
others of their own kind.

00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:13.790 align:middle line:90%
It's like a mule is infertile.

00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And there have been a few
cases of a few animals that

00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:21.160 align:middle line:84%
were cross-bred and actually
were genetically viable.

00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:24.950 align:middle line:84%
So those cases are very
few and far between.

00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:27.140 align:middle line:84%
If there's a species
out there that

00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:29.740 align:middle line:84%
even can do that a little
bit, but is basically

00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:34.440 align:middle line:84%
a hybrid species with its
origin in hybridization,

00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:37.120 align:middle line:84%
then it's going to have
to have a regular influx

00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:41.360 align:middle line:90%
of the other parent.

00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:44.160 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the parent
that was not originally

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:49.610 align:middle line:84%
part of the species, but which
contributed to the development

00:44:49.610 --> 00:44:51.320 align:middle line:90%
of it as it is now.

00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:54.910 align:middle line:84%
It will have to have a genetic
influx from that species

00:44:54.910 --> 00:44:57.135 align:middle line:90%
in order to continue to exist.

00:44:57.135 --> 00:44:58.510 align:middle line:84%
And so this is
what I think we're

00:44:58.510 --> 00:45:00.890 align:middle line:84%
seeing with a lot of these
different types of creatures.

00:45:00.890 --> 00:45:03.520 align:middle line:84%
They are very interested
in human genetic diversity.

00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:07.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about a strange
situation of Grady Stiles,

00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:08.600 align:middle line:90%
called the Lobster Boy?

00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:12.255 align:middle line:84%
Because you say, you don't think
that's a natural genetic leap.

00:45:12.255 --> 00:45:13.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MOTT: Well, you
have to wonder.

00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:15.046 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of
times, you'll see

00:45:15.046 --> 00:45:19.700 align:middle line:84%
like, there's a tribe in Africa
that has bifurcated hands

00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:21.389 align:middle line:90%
and feet, kind of like that.

00:45:21.389 --> 00:45:22.680 align:middle line:90%
Actually, it's mainly the feet.

00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:24.210 align:middle line:90%
But sometimes it's the hands.

00:45:24.210 --> 00:45:27.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's supposed to be from
inbreeding, which is possible.

00:45:27.490 --> 00:45:28.990 align:middle line:90%
It could be inbreeding.

00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:33.550 align:middle line:84%
But you also have
numerous motifs

00:45:33.550 --> 00:45:36.030 align:middle line:84%
around the world
of non-human beings

00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:38.090 align:middle line:90%
that have the same features.

00:45:38.090 --> 00:45:40.050 align:middle line:84%
You'll have-- in
Europe, you can even

00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:42.310 align:middle line:84%
find it in the architecture
on the cathedrals.

00:45:42.310 --> 00:45:46.300 align:middle line:84%
You know, being of the
sea who are humanoid,

00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:48.830 align:middle line:84%
but they have been
genetically altered--

00:45:48.830 --> 00:45:49.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are you talking
about the Merpeople?

00:45:49.730 --> 00:45:50.646 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: The Merpeople.

00:45:50.646 --> 00:45:52.600 align:middle line:84%
They have been genetically
altered to live

00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:53.560 align:middle line:90%
in that environment.

00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:57.520 align:middle line:84%
And they will have either
split tail configuration, which

00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:59.530 align:middle line:84%
should have been
legs, or they will

00:45:59.530 --> 00:46:02.800 align:middle line:84%
have a configuration kind of
like what Grady Stiles had,

00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:04.670 align:middle line:90%
with their hands.

00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:06.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, am I saying
that he was a hybrid?

00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:07.220 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:08.345 align:middle line:90%
That's not what I'm saying.

00:46:08.345 --> 00:46:12.810 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of genetic
errors in the human genome,

00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:13.970 align:middle line:90%
and things happen.

00:46:13.970 --> 00:46:19.960 align:middle line:84%
But you go and look at examples
of, for instance, UFO cases

00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:21.990 align:middle line:84%
which have the
same sort of thing.

00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:24.630 align:middle line:84%
For instance, the Pascagoula,
Mississippi, case.

00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:28.404 align:middle line:84%
This being or beings came
floating out of a ship

00:46:28.404 --> 00:46:29.820 align:middle line:84%
and abducted a
couple of fisherman

00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:31.690 align:middle line:90%
on the Pascagoula River.

00:46:31.690 --> 00:46:36.350 align:middle line:84%
And they exhibited the same
sort of claw-like hands.

00:46:36.350 --> 00:46:40.450 align:middle line:84%
And they also had--
their lower extremities

00:46:40.450 --> 00:46:44.830 align:middle line:84%
were almost wrapped like
a mummy, like one piece.

00:46:44.830 --> 00:46:50.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, here we see the tail
idea of the Merpeople,

00:46:50.370 --> 00:46:54.820 align:middle line:84%
except now we have a modern
update with technology at play

00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:57.920 align:middle line:90%
and a UFO involved and so forth.

00:46:57.920 --> 00:46:59.600 align:middle line:84%
But the Pascagoula
River runs directly

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:00.600 align:middle line:90%
into the Gulf of Mexico.

00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And they were abducted
right there by the Gulf.

00:47:03.650 --> 00:47:04.390 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:09.470 align:middle line:84%
So again, we're talking about
something that's probably here,

00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:10.390 align:middle line:90%
always has been here.

00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And some of these
different types of beings

00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:15.190 align:middle line:90%
live-- they're sub-oceanic.

00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:17.360 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they come and go
into cavernous regions

00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:18.590 align:middle line:90%
beneath the sea.

00:47:18.590 --> 00:47:19.944 align:middle line:90%
But yeah.

00:47:19.944 --> 00:47:21.110 align:middle line:90%
I think it's the same thing.

00:47:21.110 --> 00:47:21.651 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:47:21.651 --> 00:47:24.100 align:middle line:84%
And you talk about people
that you've encountered

00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:26.251 align:middle line:84%
or that others have
encountered that--

00:47:26.251 --> 00:47:28.250 align:middle line:84%
and I've heard others
that I've interviewed talk

00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:31.492 align:middle line:84%
about them-- people who
appear to have black eyes.

00:47:31.492 --> 00:47:32.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MOTT: I haven't
encountered them,

00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:34.130 align:middle line:90%
but I know people who have.

00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And I talked to
some in the book.

00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:39.980 align:middle line:90%
And yeah.

00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:41.490 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of--

00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:44.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's a lack
of empathy there and such.

00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And do you consider those
to be more hybrid beings?

00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:49.720 align:middle line:90%
Cross-breeds with humans?

00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:52.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MOTT: Well, it's in
the literature a lot now.

00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:53.790 align:middle line:90%
It's a real popular theme.

00:47:53.790 --> 00:47:56.560 align:middle line:84%
But when I first wrote the
very first edition of "Caverns,

00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:58.190 align:middle line:84%
Cauldrons, and
Concealed Creatures,"

00:47:58.190 --> 00:48:00.580 align:middle line:84%
I talked to a guy who
had an encounter with one

00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:02.317 align:middle line:90%
these beings in a grocery store.

00:48:02.317 --> 00:48:03.150 align:middle line:90%
Not a grocery store.

00:48:03.150 --> 00:48:07.540 align:middle line:84%
A toy store in a mall
in Huntsville, Alabama.

00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And this toy store was
beneath ground level.

00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And he was in there,
along with his daughter.

00:48:13.110 --> 00:48:17.080 align:middle line:90%
And as he-- she was just little.

00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:17.830 align:middle line:90%
She was a toddler.

00:48:17.830 --> 00:48:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And as he was going
about looking around,

00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:23.000 align:middle line:84%
and she was down there,
squatting down, playing

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.297 align:middle line:84%
with toys and
stuff, he looked up,

00:48:26.297 --> 00:48:27.880 align:middle line:84%
and there was a
little girl standing--

00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:29.620 align:middle line:84%
what he at first thought
was a little girl, standing.

00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:30.995 align:middle line:84%
And he said that
she was standing

00:48:30.995 --> 00:48:33.470 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the aisle,
just staring at his daughter.

00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And at first he
thought that maybe she

00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:39.930 align:middle line:84%
had some sort of Down
Syndrome or something.

00:48:39.930 --> 00:48:43.690 align:middle line:84%
But he said that
she moved closer,

00:48:43.690 --> 00:48:47.410 align:middle line:84%
and that she looked like
her eyes were jet black.

00:48:47.410 --> 00:48:50.020 align:middle line:84%
And then, all of sudden, she
darted toward his daughter.

00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:52.020 align:middle line:84%
He grabbed his daughter
up, and he looked at her

00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:52.736 align:middle line:90%
at close range.

00:48:52.736 --> 00:48:54.485 align:middle line:84%
And he told me, he
said, she wasn't human.

00:48:54.485 --> 00:48:57.930 align:middle line:84%
He said it looked like she had
a wig on and a little dress

00:48:57.930 --> 00:48:58.960 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:01.242 align:middle line:90%
So he said he went to the front.

00:49:01.242 --> 00:49:02.950 align:middle line:84%
And there was one guy
working that night.

00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And he told the guy,
you've got a problem.

00:49:04.970 --> 00:49:07.127 align:middle line:84%
There's a strange
child in the store,

00:49:07.127 --> 00:49:08.460 align:middle line:90%
and there's nobody else in here.

00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:10.794 align:middle line:84%
He said, and this child is
following my child from aisle

00:49:10.794 --> 00:49:12.626 align:middle line:84%
to aisle, because that's
what she was doing.

00:49:12.626 --> 00:49:14.180 align:middle line:90%
She was going aisle to aisle.

00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And he said, she kind
of charged at my kid.

00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And you need to find out who her
parent is and take care of it.

00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:24.260 align:middle line:84%
And the guy said, sir, he
said, you and your daughter

00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:26.629 align:middle line:84%
are the only people
in the store.

00:49:26.629 --> 00:49:28.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're
talking about something

00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:29.790 align:middle line:90%
that can materialize.

00:49:29.790 --> 00:49:30.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: Yeah.

00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:31.360 align:middle line:90%
Something.

00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:32.650 align:middle line:90%
Maybe there's a door--

00:49:32.650 --> 00:49:32.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Dematerialize.

00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:34.313 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: Maybe there's a doorway.

00:49:34.313 --> 00:49:36.699 align:middle line:90%
They were in a sub level.

00:49:36.699 --> 00:49:37.365 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:49:37.365 --> 00:49:37.865 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:49:37.865 --> 00:49:39.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MOTT: I mean, but it
reminds you of a story

00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:44.220 align:middle line:84%
that Whitley Strieber told
about somebody that sent him--

00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:46.280 align:middle line:84%
that had read his
books and then had

00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:48.450 align:middle line:90%
an encounter in a bookstore.

00:49:48.450 --> 00:49:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And this guy said
that he told Whitley

00:49:50.550 --> 00:49:54.680 align:middle line:84%
that he was in the store, and
that he was just looked around,

00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:58.070 align:middle line:84%
and he noticed that there
was a couple standing

00:49:58.070 --> 00:50:01.390 align:middle line:84%
by Whitley's books, and they
were looking through his books.

00:50:01.390 --> 00:50:03.304 align:middle line:90%
And they were saying, oh no.

00:50:03.304 --> 00:50:04.220 align:middle line:90%
He's wrong about this.

00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:04.570 align:middle line:90%
Oh, look.

00:50:04.570 --> 00:50:05.220 align:middle line:90%
He got this wrong.

00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:05.830 align:middle line:90%
And they were laughing.

00:50:05.830 --> 00:50:07.840 align:middle line:84%
And they had strange,
little, squeaky voices.

00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:10.509 align:middle line:84%
And they were laughing
and they thought

00:50:10.509 --> 00:50:12.300 align:middle line:84%
it was really funny,
all the things that he

00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:13.470 align:middle line:90%
had gotten wrong.

00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at these
people, and they were heavily

00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:22.700 align:middle line:90%
cowled, basically.

00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:24.270 align:middle line:90%
Covered up completely.

00:50:24.270 --> 00:50:26.840 align:middle line:84%
Had thick, black glasses
on, and were very pale,

00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:30.412 align:middle line:84%
and they were only
about four feet tall.

00:50:30.412 --> 00:50:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And he said, and
then suddenly they

00:50:31.870 --> 00:50:33.369 align:middle line:84%
became aware he was
looking at them,

00:50:33.369 --> 00:50:36.790 align:middle line:84%
and he became very
uneasy, so he left.

00:50:36.790 --> 00:50:39.947 align:middle line:84%
So you wonder how often
this type of thing goes on,

00:50:39.947 --> 00:50:41.280 align:middle line:90%
and that we just don't catch it.

00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:44.825 align:middle line:84%
Because human genetic
biodiversity is pretty big.

00:50:44.825 --> 00:50:47.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people come in
all shapes and sizes.

00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:50.420 align:middle line:84%
So it should be pretty
easy for somebody

00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:54.717 align:middle line:84%
that's related to the human
race to masquerade as one of us.

00:50:54.717 --> 00:50:55.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:57.760 align:middle line:84%
In essence, in one
part of the book,

00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:01.310 align:middle line:84%
you were saying that
the creation of folklore

00:51:01.310 --> 00:51:06.130 align:middle line:84%
gives almost like a protective
mechanism for our mass psyche.

00:51:06.130 --> 00:51:07.212 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: It really does.

00:51:07.212 --> 00:51:08.170 align:middle line:90%
I think it really does.

00:51:08.170 --> 00:51:11.480 align:middle line:84%
I think that you know, we
talked earlier about folklore

00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:14.940 align:middle line:84%
being cautionary tales to
teach young people there

00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:15.970 align:middle line:90%
are dangers out there.

00:51:15.970 --> 00:51:18.287 align:middle line:90%
Things that you cannot control.

00:51:18.287 --> 00:51:20.495 align:middle line:84%
Some of those things may be
natural, but some of them

00:51:20.495 --> 00:51:23.090 align:middle line:84%
may be more along the lines
of what we're talking about.

00:51:23.090 --> 00:51:27.747 align:middle line:84%
And in order for us
to deal with this,

00:51:27.747 --> 00:51:29.330 align:middle line:84%
we have to be able
to put a spin on it

00:51:29.330 --> 00:51:30.860 align:middle line:84%
where it's not so
frightening to us.

00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:35.330 align:middle line:84%
A perfect example is
in Irish folklore,

00:51:35.330 --> 00:51:38.660 align:middle line:84%
leprechauns are
believed to be real.

00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:41.340 align:middle line:84%
There are people in Ireland who
believe leprechauns are real.

00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And they believe you do
not mess with a leprechaun.

00:51:44.110 --> 00:51:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And if you make
him mad, he becomes

00:51:45.570 --> 00:51:47.160 align:middle line:84%
something they
call a clurichaun,

00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:50.570 align:middle line:90%
and he will hurt you.

00:51:50.570 --> 00:51:53.130 align:middle line:84%
But what do we do
here in the USA?

00:51:53.130 --> 00:51:55.861 align:middle line:90%
We put him on some cereal.

00:51:55.861 --> 00:51:56.360 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:56.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Lucky Charms.

00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:56.930 align:middle line:90%
He's comical.

00:51:56.930 --> 00:51:58.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MOTT: --make a
fool out of him.

00:51:58.510 --> 00:52:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And so look, it's a
funny little leprechaun.

00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:02.400 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that cute?

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:04.483 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is the type of
thing I'm talking about.

00:52:04.483 --> 00:52:06.810 align:middle line:84%
It's a tendency
that human beings

00:52:06.810 --> 00:52:08.940 align:middle line:84%
have to take things
that are terrifying

00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:11.220 align:middle line:84%
and try to make them
non-threatening.

00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:15.060 align:middle line:84%
We do it with Sasquatch and
beef jerky, for instance.

00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:18.630 align:middle line:84%
We do it all the time,
and we've always done it.

00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:22.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
folklore itself,

00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:24.290 align:middle line:84%
whereas it teaches
us valuable lessons,

00:52:24.290 --> 00:52:26.790 align:middle line:84%
and it's a good place to look,
we need look beyond folklore.

00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:28.060 align:middle line:90%
We have to look at mythology.

00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:31.550 align:middle line:84%
We have to look at
comparative religion a lot.

00:52:31.550 --> 00:52:34.800 align:middle line:84%
And we also have to look
at historical accounts

00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:36.840 align:middle line:84%
that people have
actually-- experiences

00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:38.090 align:middle line:90%
that people have actually had.

00:52:38.090 --> 00:52:39.923 align:middle line:84%
Because there are a lot
of them, and they do

00:52:39.923 --> 00:52:41.690 align:middle line:90%
tie-in with all this stuff.

00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:45.120 align:middle line:84%
So with folklore, I think
that it's easier for us

00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:49.921 align:middle line:84%
to function as a
society, a human society,

00:52:49.921 --> 00:52:52.045 align:middle line:84%
if we don't have to worry
all the time about things

00:52:52.045 --> 00:52:54.130 align:middle line:90%
that go bump in the night.

00:52:54.130 --> 00:52:56.340 align:middle line:84%
People disappearing
for no reason

00:52:56.340 --> 00:52:59.650 align:middle line:84%
whatsoever, things coming in
in the middle of the night,

00:52:59.650 --> 00:53:02.410 align:middle line:84%
and paralyzing you and
taking genetic material,

00:53:02.410 --> 00:53:05.510 align:middle line:84%
and seeming to not care
if it hurts or not.

00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:07.680 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to think
about these things.

00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:10.000 align:middle line:84%
And if you think about
them or talk about them,

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.560 align:middle line:90%
then you're a little strange.

00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:15.070 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is that
there are now probably

00:53:15.070 --> 00:53:19.440 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of thousands of people
who have reported these things.

00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:23.235 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of the
population will just

00:53:23.235 --> 00:53:27.942 align:middle line:84%
see them as delusions,
some sort of folklore.

00:53:27.942 --> 00:53:29.900 align:middle line:84%
But what they don't
understand is that folklore

00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:31.210 align:middle line:90%
is based in reality.

00:53:31.210 --> 00:53:34.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Billy the Kid
is now part of folklore.

00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:36.270 align:middle line:90%
Jesse James.

00:53:36.270 --> 00:53:39.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, folklore is
usually based in reality.

00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:42.970 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere there's a kernel
of truth to all of it.

00:53:42.970 --> 00:53:45.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So for you,
knowing about this

00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:48.440 align:middle line:84%
and sharing with us information
that these things exist,

00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:53.200 align:middle line:84%
what is it, on a deep level,
you're attempting to do?

00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:55.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MOTT: Well, the
reason I wrote the book,

00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:58.050 align:middle line:84%
and I was writing some
fiction stuff too.

00:53:58.050 --> 00:54:01.105 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I've always
had an interest in folklore

00:54:01.105 --> 00:54:03.750 align:middle line:84%
and mythology and
comparative religion

00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:07.300 align:middle line:84%
and historical
accounts of anomalies,

00:54:07.300 --> 00:54:11.580 align:middle line:84%
Fortean studies, true
stories of things

00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:13.350 align:middle line:90%
that were unusual and strange.

00:54:13.350 --> 00:54:17.650 align:middle line:84%
And as I looked at all of this
material, even some fiction

00:54:17.650 --> 00:54:19.780 align:middle line:90%
stuff, I began to see patterns.

00:54:19.780 --> 00:54:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And they were the same
stories, the same themes,

00:54:23.890 --> 00:54:27.720 align:middle line:84%
the same patterns of behavior,
over and over and over again,

00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:29.595 align:middle line:84%
no matter where they
came from on the planet.

00:54:29.595 --> 00:54:32.670 align:middle line:84%
They were always-- they
had something in common.

00:54:32.670 --> 00:54:35.919 align:middle line:84%
And some of the newer stuff
that was coming along,

00:54:35.919 --> 00:54:37.960 align:middle line:84%
I was seeing some
interpretations of these things

00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:39.650 align:middle line:84%
where people thought,
well, this is new.

00:54:39.650 --> 00:54:40.400 align:middle line:90%
This is all new stuff.

00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:41.360 align:middle line:90%
And isn't it wonderful.

00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And kind of like
the folklore thing.

00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:47.550 align:middle line:90%
The happy side.

00:54:47.550 --> 00:54:51.145 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want to look any
deeper than these things are

00:54:51.145 --> 00:54:52.160 align:middle line:90%
our friends.

00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:57.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, historically, in terms
of the actual literature

00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:59.480 align:middle line:84%
in the accounts, they've
never been our friends.

00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:01.710 align:middle line:90%
They might be indifferent to us.

00:55:01.710 --> 00:55:04.450 align:middle line:84%
They might help us when
it serves their interests.

00:55:04.450 --> 00:55:06.240 align:middle line:84%
But they haven't
been our friends.

00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:11.160 align:middle line:84%
And I said, somebody needs
to correlate all this data

00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:13.720 align:middle line:84%
and find all these
parallels and these patterns

00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:15.800 align:middle line:84%
and lay it out in
a logical fashion,

00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:20.340 align:middle line:84%
so that people could see what
is probably really going on.

00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:21.270 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I'm wrong.

00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:21.820 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:55:21.820 --> 00:55:25.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, they could
be-- there are also reports,

00:55:25.110 --> 00:55:27.380 align:middle line:84%
on occasion, where
you'll hear that one

00:55:27.380 --> 00:55:30.070 align:middle line:84%
of these unusual
beings is a friend

00:55:30.070 --> 00:55:31.870 align:middle line:84%
and helps somebody
out in a situation.

00:55:31.870 --> 00:55:34.920 align:middle line:84%
So you could say sometimes
friendly, sometimes foe,

00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:35.520 align:middle line:90%
indifferent.

00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:37.665 align:middle line:84%
They're just doing their own
thing for their own purposes.

00:55:37.665 --> 00:55:38.030 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: Right.

00:55:38.030 --> 00:55:39.010 align:middle line:90%
It's like I have in the book.

00:55:39.010 --> 00:55:40.630 align:middle line:84%
There's a couple
of cases like that.

00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:42.588 align:middle line:84%
There's a guy who got
hurt when he was a child,

00:55:42.588 --> 00:55:44.060 align:middle line:84%
and he still
remembers to this day

00:55:44.060 --> 00:55:46.725 align:middle line:84%
that a so-called gnome
ran out and helped him

00:55:46.725 --> 00:55:49.360 align:middle line:84%
and healed him
and sent him home.

00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:52.142 align:middle line:90%
So it's just like anybody else.

00:55:52.142 --> 00:55:53.475 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's just like humans.

00:55:53.475 --> 00:55:56.140 align:middle line:84%
We have good guys and guys that
aren't so good or friendly.

00:55:56.140 --> 00:55:56.806 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: Exactly.

00:55:56.806 --> 00:55:59.470 align:middle line:84%
And it probably-- it may have
to do with the group, too.

00:55:59.470 --> 00:56:00.850 align:middle line:90%
The group you're dealing with.

00:56:00.850 --> 00:56:01.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:56:01.330 --> 00:56:01.810 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:56:01.810 --> 00:56:03.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MOTT: Like this
little gnome group.

00:56:03.150 --> 00:56:05.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we could be talking
about people that are descended

00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:09.040 align:middle line:90%
from Homo floresiensis.

00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:10.020 align:middle line:90%
They were around for--

00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:10.705 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The little
people in Indonesia.

00:56:10.705 --> 00:56:11.371 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: Exactly.

00:56:11.371 --> 00:56:14.750 align:middle line:84%
They were around for
80,000 years in that cave.

00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:15.650 align:middle line:90%
80,000 years.

00:56:15.650 --> 00:56:18.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Until as recently as
300 years ago, they were seen.

00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:18.870 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: Until recently.

00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:19.530 align:middle line:90%
As recently.

00:56:19.530 --> 00:56:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And the people there
called them ebu

00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:22.890 align:middle line:84%
gogo, which means
little grandmother who

00:56:22.890 --> 00:56:23.950 align:middle line:90%
eats everything.

00:56:23.950 --> 00:56:25.670 align:middle line:84%
Because not only would they
come steal their crops,

00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:27.961 align:middle line:84%
they would steal the little
children and eat them, too.

00:56:27.961 --> 00:56:31.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, you take this
story from 300 years ago,

00:56:31.930 --> 00:56:34.080 align:middle line:84%
and you go to Europe,
and then there you

00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:36.380 align:middle line:84%
have trolls that take
children and eat them.

00:56:36.380 --> 00:56:38.770 align:middle line:84%
Or there you have
the fairy folk who

00:56:38.770 --> 00:56:42.370 align:middle line:84%
kidnap children and young
maidens for their own purposes.

00:56:42.370 --> 00:56:43.580 align:middle line:90%
So it's the same thing.

00:56:43.580 --> 00:56:48.520 align:middle line:84%
So if there were a subterranean
hominid species that

00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:50.790 align:middle line:84%
had developed over
time and branched out,

00:56:50.790 --> 00:56:52.960 align:middle line:84%
who's to say that they
stayed on the Flores Island,

00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:55.630 align:middle line:84%
or if that wasn't just
one branch of the family.

00:56:55.630 --> 00:56:57.090 align:middle line:84%
They could be all
over the world.

00:56:57.090 --> 00:57:00.820 align:middle line:84%
They could be as advanced, in
terms of their hominid nature,

00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:03.119 align:middle line:84%
as we are, but they're
just different than we are.

00:57:03.119 --> 00:57:03.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They are.

00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:05.860 align:middle line:84%
And then, maybe some of
us are just like them.

00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:11.500 align:middle line:84%
We have the whole human child
interface with satanic cults

00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:14.250 align:middle line:84%
that are taking babies
and children too.

00:57:14.250 --> 00:57:18.020 align:middle line:84%
So you've got some bad players
above ground and underground.

00:57:18.020 --> 00:57:21.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MOTT: And as you know from
various secret society studies,

00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:27.320 align:middle line:84%
there are rumors, as Albert
Pike might have said,

00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:29.470 align:middle line:84%
of a darker nature behind
some of these things.

00:57:29.470 --> 00:57:33.190 align:middle line:84%
And that people serve these
things and don't even know it.

00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:33.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:57:33.970 --> 00:57:34.470 align:middle line:90%
Indeed.

00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:38.195 align:middle line:84%
And there are people who can
be turned to for that work.

00:57:38.195 --> 00:57:39.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MOTT: And they
used to be known

00:57:39.570 --> 00:57:41.040 align:middle line:90%
as the gods of the underworld.

00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:43.220 align:middle line:10%
And people used to
sacrifice to them.

00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:44.700 align:middle line:10%
We don't do that anymore.

00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:47.810 align:middle line:84%
So they probably are not
real happy about that.

00:57:47.810 --> 00:57:49.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
we're out of time.

00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:51.660 align:middle line:90%
What an intriguing conversation.

00:57:51.660 --> 00:57:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, people will
be able to still sleep

00:57:54.330 --> 00:57:55.732 align:middle line:90%
well tonight after this one.

00:57:55.732 --> 00:57:57.690 align:middle line:84%
Because the reality is,
it's always been there.

00:57:57.690 --> 00:57:58.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MOTT: It always has been.

00:57:58.520 --> 00:58:00.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We've always
been living side by side.

00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:02.889 align:middle line:84%
The reality is, what you look
at day in and day out around you

00:58:02.889 --> 00:58:04.180 align:middle line:90%
in your life, that's your life.

00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:05.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MOTT: We just have to wake
up to what's really going on.

00:58:05.660 --> 00:58:06.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's their life.

00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:07.171 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:58:07.171 --> 00:58:07.670 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:08.810 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Michael.

00:58:08.810 --> 00:58:09.230 align:middle line:90%
