>>ROBERT BANNAN: We give
them an artificial disease

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.990 align:middle line:90%
with the potency.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And then we collect
all that information,

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.890 align:middle line:84%
and that becomes
our index to the use

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.080 align:middle line:90%
of that in an actual disease.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.190 align:middle line:90%
That is so profound.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.250 align:middle line:84%
The karmic rut that they've
been stuck in is just finished.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.140 align:middle line:84%
It's not about the
size of the dose,

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.807 align:middle line:84%
it's about the intensity
of the potency.

00:00:25.807 --> 00:00:28.348 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, in America, we
like to think we're independent

00:00:28.348 --> 00:00:29.180 align:middle line:90%
and we're free.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.013 align:middle line:84%
But actually, we're
much more impressionable

00:00:31.013 --> 00:00:32.119 align:middle line:90%
than we like to recognize.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.950 align:middle line:84%
If modern medicine
really worked,

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.820 align:middle line:84%
we'd see fewer and fewer people
needing fewer and fewer drugs

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.340 align:middle line:90%
less and less frequently.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know about you,
but that's not what I'm seeing.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.690 align:middle line:84%
As we become less healthy
it's harder and harder for us

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:45.920 align:middle line:90%
to manifest our will.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.593 align:middle line:84%
We want things we
can't have, and we

00:00:47.593 --> 00:00:48.635 align:middle line:90%
get things we don't want.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.500 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: What if homeopathy
could help you speed along

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.910 align:middle line:10%
karmic recovery?

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.180 align:middle line:10%
According to Robert Bannan,
our internal world of wounds,

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.280 align:middle line:10%
both physically and
emotionally, need

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.830 align:middle line:10%
to be handled in a complex
and delicate manner.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.530 align:middle line:84%
No two conditions, even
the same diagnosis,

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.750 align:middle line:84%
require the same
approach because what's

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.550 align:middle line:90%
underneath them is so unique.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.140 align:middle line:90%
We're all so unique.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.808 align:middle line:84%
Robert, it's
wonderful meeting you.

00:01:14.808 --> 00:01:16.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: It's a
pleasure to be here.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.183 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I was
interested in the story.

00:01:18.183 --> 00:01:21.460 align:middle line:84%
I have done a couple of pieces
on homeopathy in the past.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.550 align:middle line:84%
But the notion of helping
along karmic recovery

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.430 align:middle line:84%
was something I hadn't heard
before with homeopathy.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.190 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: Yeah.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.720 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of a thing that I've
been talking about for about 15

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.650 align:middle line:84%
or maybe 20 years now, looking
at what happens to people

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.750 align:middle line:84%
when they receive
good treatment.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.190 align:middle line:10%
It's as if patterns that they've
been stuck in for decades,

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.490 align:middle line:10%
or sometimes most of their
life, in some instances just

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.800 align:middle line:10%
seem to dissolve very quickly.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.400 align:middle line:10%
And suddenly, their
whole life frees up.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And they start moving and living
their life in a different way.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:01.930 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, what--

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.160 align:middle line:10%
that is so profound.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.450 align:middle line:10%
What's actually happening here
it's almost like the karmic rut

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.348 align:middle line:10%
that they've been stuck
in is just finished.

00:02:10.348 --> 00:02:11.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's like
it was permeating

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.470 align:middle line:84%
the cells of their body
it had gone so physical.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.920 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, when we're
talking homeopathy,

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.395 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
quantum reality.

00:02:21.395 --> 00:02:22.270 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: I think so.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.228 align:middle line:90%
This is my sense.

00:02:23.228 --> 00:02:24.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's my sense, too.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.320 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: Yeah.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.970 align:middle line:84%
Because the important
thing to keep in view,

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.920 align:middle line:84%
probably the main
difference between what

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.260 align:middle line:84%
we do in homeopathy
and holistic therapies

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.500 align:middle line:84%
in general and
classical medicine

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.200 align:middle line:84%
is we understand that the
real cause of the problem

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.970 align:middle line:84%
is actually an
internal situation.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.850 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense, you
could say there's

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.590 align:middle line:84%
an internal spiritual
deficiency of some kind,

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.340 align:middle line:84%
and the disease, the
signs and symptoms,

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.370 align:middle line:84%
the emotional dynamics,
the difficulties

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.620 align:middle line:84%
are only the
external expressions

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.500 align:middle line:84%
of these internal-- this
true internal problem.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And we need to meet the
problem on the plane

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.810 align:middle line:90%
that it actually exists on.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.480 align:middle line:84%
It's no good addressing
the external problem

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.522 align:middle line:84%
without taking care of
actually what's behind it.

00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:11.272 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is,
of course, the problem

00:03:11.272 --> 00:03:14.470 align:middle line:84%
with allopathic medicine-- why
you get the same color Band-Aid

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.850 align:middle line:90%
for the same diagnosis, right?

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:17.650 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: Yeah.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to beat up
on classical medicine

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.000 align:middle line:84%
because there's a
lot of good things

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.970 align:middle line:90%
there as well, of course.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:23.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We need it.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.070 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: We need it.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We do.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.540 align:middle line:84%
We need it for a
lot of things, but--

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: It pertains
to the mechanism,

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.140 align:middle line:84%
to the physical
results of the disease,

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.210 align:middle line:84%
rather than to the
real disease itself.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
origin of the disease.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And so, again, when we
get back to the world

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.830 align:middle line:84%
of quantum mechanics, it
is a field of information--

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:40.630 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: Indeed.

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --which
permeates everything.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.310 align:middle line:84%
This desk, you, me,
the entire universe

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.320 align:middle line:84%
is simply encoded
with information that

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.580 align:middle line:90%
expresses in different ways.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:50.510 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: Yes, indeed.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:51.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Make
your comments on it

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.990 align:middle line:84%
because then we're going to get
into the actual little pills

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.650 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:55.450 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: OK.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, when we're
talking about this inner world

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.620 align:middle line:90%
and this outer world, in--

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
present myself as

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.790 align:middle line:84%
a dilettante theoretical
physicist, which I'm definitely

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:06.590 align:middle line:90%
not.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.280 align:middle line:84%
But this really
fascinates me, and I'm

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.280 align:middle line:84%
really interested in it,
particularly because it

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.468 align:middle line:90%
overlaps with homeopathy.

00:04:11.468 --> 00:04:12.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, absolutely.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: I think it explains
homeopathy, actually.

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.220 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.730 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: Eventually, it will.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.649 align:middle line:84%
Like you say, the
whole physical universe

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:22.970 align:middle line:84%
is actually evolved
out of the quantum.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a real-
there's a tendency

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.580 align:middle line:84%
to be mystical about what
this quantum is all about.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.040 align:middle line:90%
It's certainly very weird.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.890 align:middle line:84%
The laws in the
quantum reality are

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.990 align:middle line:84%
inverse to the laws in
the relative reality.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.620 align:middle line:84%
So you get these strange
things like superposition

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.720 align:middle line:84%
and entanglement and
decoherence and the rest of it.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.140 align:middle line:84%
But if there's an
internal disturbance

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.270 align:middle line:84%
in the world of
causes, that's where

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.950 align:middle line:90%
the disturbance has to be met.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I think that
actually homeopathic remedies

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.380 align:middle line:84%
are composed of
quantum coherence

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.568 align:middle line:84%
domains of the substance
that are actually made from.

00:05:00.568 --> 00:05:01.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, absolutely.

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.200 align:middle line:90%
Because there is no there there.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.670 align:middle line:90%
They're not material in nature.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.920 align:middle line:84%
So, of course, that would just
take you right into the quantum

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:07.820 align:middle line:90%
world, wouldn't it?

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: Once you get to the
12th centesimal potency, which

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.530 align:middle line:84%
is a quite low
potency in homeopathy,

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.780 align:middle line:84%
you reach what's called
Avogadro's number.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.350 align:middle line:84%
There's not a single
molecule left.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:17.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.600 align:middle line:84%
And so for those who have
not experienced homeopathy

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.360 align:middle line:84%
and don't understand
this about it,

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.880 align:middle line:84%
because that's really
the magic of it.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.658 align:middle line:90%
It is potentized information.

00:05:29.658 --> 00:05:31.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: I think that's
a good way of saying it.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.100 align:middle line:90%
It's probably the best way of--

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.780 align:middle line:90%
it's the best analogy for it.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.230 align:middle line:84%
But it's quantum information,
and I think that's important.

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.560 align:middle line:84%
Because really,
there are two things

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.870 align:middle line:84%
that have to be met
in treating somebody

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.280 align:middle line:90%
with a homeopathic remedy.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:51.230 align:middle line:84%
The first thing is the
homeopathic correspondence

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:53.540 align:middle line:84%
needs to be there
between the substance

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:58.390 align:middle line:84%
that the remedy is made of and
the person and their process.

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.250 align:middle line:84%
But it also has to be
prepared in such a way

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:01.940 align:middle line:84%
that it goes to
the level of cause.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:02.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.640 align:middle line:84%
Let's just take the
drug, Digitalis.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:05.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: OK.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.010 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful.

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:07.635 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's play
with that and talk

00:06:07.635 --> 00:06:10.090 align:middle line:84%
about what it looks like
in these different domains.

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: Well, in
the outer domain,

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:17.080 align:middle line:84%
Digitalis has been used for
probably thousands of years

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.045 align:middle line:90%
as a medicine for heart disease.

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:20.920 align:middle line:84%
There's a very strong
affinity for the heart.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.590 align:middle line:84%
It also has a very strong
affinity for the liver

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:25.810 align:middle line:84%
and for a lot of other
stuff in the system,

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.730 align:middle line:84%
but it's been identified
as a heart medicine.

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:28.735 align:middle line:90%
And it is.

00:06:28.735 --> 00:06:30.735 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us how
it's normally administered

00:06:30.735 --> 00:06:31.818 align:middle line:90%
and under what conditions.

00:06:31.818 --> 00:06:34.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: Well, it would
be used for bradycardia,

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.800 align:middle line:84%
which would be slow
heartbeat in a decompensating

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.570 align:middle line:90%
state of the heart.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.820 align:middle line:84%
And it would be used
in material doses.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:45.443 align:middle line:84%
And it can and would
stabilize certain conditions.

00:06:45.443 --> 00:06:46.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When a
person's tanking.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:47.910 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: When a
person's tanking.

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:48.840 align:middle line:90%
Precisely.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.040 align:middle line:84%
But it's not going to
resolve the problem.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.480 align:middle line:84%
It's just a physical
chemical assist

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.920 align:middle line:90%
to palliate the situation.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.920 align:middle line:84%
It's not really
addressing the problem.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.250 align:middle line:84%
In the homeopathic
sphere, this remedy

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:06.030 align:middle line:84%
would be prepared into
a homeopathic potency.

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And then the signs and
symptoms of a natural disease

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:16.640 align:middle line:84%
that match with the information
we have about the remedy,

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.380 align:middle line:84%
we get this information by
doing what we call provings--

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:21.490 align:middle line:90%
homeopathic provings.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:22.810 align:middle line:90%
These are experiments.

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.390 align:middle line:84%
It's actually an
anglicization of a German word

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:26.990 align:middle line:90%
which simply means experiment.

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:29.320 align:middle line:84%
All of the remedies, most
of the remedies we use

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:30.430 align:middle line:90%
are experimented with.

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:35.060 align:middle line:84%
We give them in homeopathic
potency to healthy people.

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.680 align:middle line:84%
It's best if we
do this in a group

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.470 align:middle line:84%
because the group
dynamic seems to augment

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:42.260 align:middle line:84%
the way the information
is presented in quite

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:43.610 align:middle line:90%
a powerful way, actually.

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.190 align:middle line:84%
We give people the
remedy in potency

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:49.275 align:middle line:84%
until they start to
produce symptoms.

00:07:49.275 --> 00:07:50.150 align:middle line:90%
So it's a kind of a--

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:51.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Like cures like.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: We dissed
you in a way.

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:56.210 align:middle line:84%
We give them an artificial
disease with the potency,

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:57.950 align:middle line:84%
and then we collect
all that information.

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:00.560 align:middle line:84%
And that becomes
our index to the use

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.650 align:middle line:90%
of that in an actual disease.

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:06.380 align:middle line:84%
So these are the phenomena
that this Digitalis

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.710 align:middle line:84%
is capable of producing
in healthy people.

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:13.400 align:middle line:84%
These are the phenomena we
use to apply this remedy

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.320 align:middle line:90%
in a natural disease.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:20.000 align:middle line:84%
When we find the correspondence
between the natural disease

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.940 align:middle line:84%
process and the
phenomena of the proving,

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:25.310 align:middle line:84%
we know that there is a
homeopathic correspondence.

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:27.690 align:middle line:84%
So that's the first
thing that has to be met.

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:29.850 align:middle line:84%
Then comes the
question of potency.

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:30.650 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:33.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
as it's potentized,

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.940 align:middle line:84%
it becomes even further
and further away

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:39.530 align:middle line:84%
from the original molecules
that it was initially made from.

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: After the 12th
centesimal potency--

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:42.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There
are no molecules.

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:43.130 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: There's nothing there.

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:44.420 align:middle line:90%
So it's completely non-toxic.

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:47.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's just been
imprinted with the information

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.870 align:middle line:90%
of Digitalis.

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:48.703 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: Precisely.

00:08:48.703 --> 00:08:51.260 align:middle line:84%
The quantum signature
of the substance

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.670 align:middle line:84%
is there in the potency, and
we can control the intensity

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:57.380 align:middle line:90%
of that signature.

00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:00.770 align:middle line:84%
So the quantum-- the impulse
of that electromagnetically

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:02.780 align:middle line:84%
on the system we're
giving it to can

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:07.250 align:middle line:84%
be controlled by increasing
or decreasing the potency.

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:09.110 align:middle line:84%
It's not about the
size of the dose,

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:10.920 align:middle line:84%
it's about the intensity
of the potency.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So whether it's
a 12, or a 30, or a 200.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: Or a 1,000,
or a 10,000 or a 50,000,

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:19.350 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, et cetera,
this will be-- these

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:23.010 align:middle line:84%
will be used according to
the nature of the case.

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:24.570 align:middle line:90%
It's case specific.

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:25.950 align:middle line:90%
It's always case specific.

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:27.450 align:middle line:90%
This is a fundamental thing.

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:31.190 align:middle line:84%
With homeopathy, every case
has to be individualized.

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:32.530 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:34.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm going to ask
one question about--

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.550 align:middle line:84%
and something else just
popped into my head.

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:41.620 align:middle line:84%
Do homeopaths also
work with cell salts?

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:44.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: Well, actually,
Schuessler was a homeopath.

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:46.750 align:middle line:84%
And I think he was
a bit bamboozled

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:48.970 align:middle line:90%
by how many remedies we had.

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:53.140 align:middle line:84%
So his approach was
midway between homeopathy

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:54.160 align:middle line:90%
and allopathy.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which is cell salts.

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:56.400 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: Which is cell salts.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.910 align:middle line:84%
They are still
homeopathic remedies.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And actually, they're
beautiful homeopathic remedies.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:09:59.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.450 align:middle line:84%
That's why I was wondering
if those worlds still

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:02.230 align:middle line:90%
work together.

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:03.030 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: Yeah.

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:04.540 align:middle line:84%
They do, they
overlap, certainly.

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.580 align:middle line:84%
But the idea-- his
idea behind cell salts

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:11.650 align:middle line:84%
was that you could look
at the specific compounds

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:13.960 align:middle line:84%
in the substrate or
the cellular material

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.970 align:middle line:84%
and use this for
application of a remedy.

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:18.220 align:middle line:90%
But there are only 12 of them.

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:18.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:19.660 align:middle line:90%
There are only 12, right--

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:20.530 align:middle line:90%
the months of the year.

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:21.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: And there are
something like 12,000

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:22.660 align:middle line:90%
homeopathic remedies.

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:23.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, right.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:23.980 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:24.280 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.613 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to get back on
the track we were on before.

00:10:26.613 --> 00:10:31.430 align:middle line:84%
So Digitalis, heart disease,
palliative, you're tanking.

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:32.690 align:middle line:90%
Take the physical stuff.

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:35.520 align:middle line:84%
Kind of get up so you can
make it to live another day.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're taking
it homeopathically,

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:42.410 align:middle line:84%
and this is going to
the level of the cause.

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:44.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: Yes,
but wait a second.

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:45.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because I want
to get to the ancestral

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:46.280 align:middle line:90%
part of how we got there.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:46.670 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: Oh, I see.

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:47.712 align:middle line:90%
We're going to ancestral.

00:10:47.712 --> 00:10:50.150 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let me unpack
this a little bit

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:53.330 align:middle line:84%
because the indications
for the material

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:58.070 align:middle line:84%
Digitalis for palliation can
be opposite to the indications

00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:00.197 align:middle line:90%
of Digitalis impotency.

00:11:00.197 --> 00:11:01.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:05.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: Yeah because
the internal quantum

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:09.420 align:middle line:84%
laws are actually the inverse
of the external material laws.

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:13.940 align:middle line:84%
So it may be a different
kind of heart decompensation

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:15.350 align:middle line:90%
that really cures--

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:17.840 align:middle line:90%
is really cured with Digitalis.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.207 align:middle line:84%
And there will be concomitants
in the other spheres

00:11:20.207 --> 00:11:22.040 align:middle line:84%
in the body as well,
particularly the liver.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.665 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What does
it do to the liver?

00:11:23.665 --> 00:11:26.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: It makes it difficult
to digest food, basically.

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:30.630 align:middle line:84%
And in many heart conditions,
any good cardiologist

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:31.430 align:middle line:90%
will tell you--

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:31.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:32.753 align:middle line:90%
It's called a side effect.

00:11:32.753 --> 00:11:33.553 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: Well--

00:11:33.553 --> 00:11:34.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:37.007 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: This is-- it's a
lovely word, side effect.

00:11:37.007 --> 00:11:38.840 align:middle line:84%
But actually, there
aren't any side effects.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.670 align:middle line:90%
There's just effects.

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:41.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, OK.

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:43.100 align:middle line:90%
So let's go to--

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:43.900 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:45.980 align:middle line:84%
So there's heart
disease in your family.

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:47.510 align:middle line:90%
This is all a hypothetical.

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:49.340 align:middle line:84%
There's heart disease
in the family.

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:52.745 align:middle line:84%
Now, how do you work
then because these

00:11:52.745 --> 00:11:54.375 align:middle line:90%
are these ancestral patterns.

00:11:54.375 --> 00:11:55.250 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: Absolutely.

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:58.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That doesn't mean
it's necessarily in your DNA,

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:03.050 align:middle line:84%
but it's in your larger,
energetic quantum

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:04.365 align:middle line:90%
field of information.

00:12:04.365 --> 00:12:05.240 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: Absolutely.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about where that comes from,

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:09.710 align:middle line:84%
how it gets implanted, even
if it's not in your genetics.

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:11.930 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: It doesn't have
to be in your genetics.

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:14.615 align:middle line:84%
Epigenetics is probably more
significant than genetics

00:12:14.615 --> 00:12:15.740 align:middle line:90%
when we're looking at this.

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:17.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Totally agree.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:21.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: But if there's a line
of heart disease in the family,

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:23.420 align:middle line:84%
then the affinity
for the heart is

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:27.270 align:middle line:84%
going to be pretty obvious
in dealing with this person.

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:28.820 align:middle line:84%
So then we're
looking at the heart

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:33.210 align:middle line:84%
as probably the most
vulnerable system, probably

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:37.120 align:middle line:84%
what the person's going
to die with in the end.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.760 align:middle line:84%
And probably we can do something
about when that end comes.

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.710 align:middle line:84%
But importantly, if
there's a disease

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:44.650 align:middle line:84%
of the heart with a
qualification of there

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:46.390 align:middle line:84%
are many ways that
that can manifest,

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:49.360 align:middle line:84%
the heart is an organ which
has many correspondences.

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.100 align:middle line:84%
You see, there are
correspondences

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:52.880 align:middle line:90%
between organs and functions.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:56.140 align:middle line:84%
So when we think of the heart,
we can think of expansiveness.

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:58.010 align:middle line:90%
We can think about contraction.

00:12:58.010 --> 00:12:59.350 align:middle line:90%
We can think about love.

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:02.470 align:middle line:84%
We can think about
a lack of love.

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:04.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
is in that lineage.

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:06.520 align:middle line:84%
Those challenges
are in that lineage.

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: The
dynamics of the heart

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:12.430 align:middle line:84%
are not just expressed on the
language of organic pathology.

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:14.740 align:middle line:84%
Every organ speaks
its own language.

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:16.900 align:middle line:84%
The liver will say the
same thing as the heart,

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:18.970 align:middle line:84%
but it will say it in
a different language.

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:20.770 align:middle line:84%
The kidneys will say the
same things as the heart,

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:22.562 align:middle line:84%
but they'll say it in
a different language.

00:13:22.562 --> 00:13:27.280 align:middle line:84%
So we have to learn to
translate or disencode

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:32.020 align:middle line:84%
the language that the system is
using, and it's very pertinent.

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:35.350 align:middle line:84%
So these kind of
inherited tendencies

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:39.670 align:middle line:84%
have implications beyond
simply the organ itself.

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:42.070 align:middle line:84%
But when you're talking
about the heart,

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:45.580 align:middle line:84%
it's about how we relate
to life fundamentally,

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:47.005 align:middle line:90%
what the will to be is.

00:13:47.005 --> 00:13:48.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now, you
have someone before you

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:49.780 align:middle line:90%
that says, oh, yeah.

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:50.680 align:middle line:90%
It runs in my family.

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:52.138 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to die
of a heart attack.

00:13:52.138 --> 00:13:54.370 align:middle line:84%
Or I'm afraid I'm going
to die of a heart attack.

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:55.150 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: That's
a different thing.

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:55.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:59.800 align:middle line:84%
So how do you start
working with them

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.790 align:middle line:84%
when you know the vulnerability
is in the emotional field

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:03.590 align:middle line:90%
and so forth?

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get into a
quirky little thing we found

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:09.430 align:middle line:84%
that you use with your
clients as well for diving

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:10.840 align:middle line:90%
into their character--

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.020 align:middle line:90%
as you say, provoking them.

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:14.820 align:middle line:84%
But before we go there, how
do you begin working with that

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:16.570 align:middle line:84%
because every person
is different when you

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:18.670 align:middle line:90%
start the interview process?

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:21.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: I think
very important there's

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:23.650 align:middle line:84%
something we talk about
called the therapeutic field.

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:24.880 align:middle line:90%
Like, we're in a field now.

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:27.400 align:middle line:84%
We're actually transferring
information to each other.

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.190 align:middle line:84%
This is a field
of communication.

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:33.250 align:middle line:84%
The therapeutic field is
a similar kind of field,

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:38.510 align:middle line:84%
but it has a specific aim, which
is the healing of somebody.

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:42.695 align:middle line:84%
So the way this
information is transferred

00:14:42.695 --> 00:14:47.130 align:middle line:84%
can be helped a lot by
the nature of the presence

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:48.540 align:middle line:90%
of the homeopath.

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:51.450 align:middle line:84%
So it's very important
to be unprejudiced.

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:53.317 align:middle line:84%
If I come into this
consultation, OK,

00:14:53.317 --> 00:14:55.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm interested in the
heart, just the heart.

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:56.567 align:middle line:84%
Let's not listen
to anything else.

00:14:56.567 --> 00:14:58.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm not interested.

00:14:58.110 --> 00:14:58.980 align:middle line:90%
Filter all this out.

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:00.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you
wouldn't be a homeopath.

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:01.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: I wouldn't
be a homeopath.

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:06.640 align:middle line:84%
But actually, this unprejudiced
idea is very, very significant.

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:08.670 align:middle line:84%
And where you're
coming from, if you're

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:12.190 align:middle line:84%
coming with a clear heart,
and you're not prejudiced,

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:14.440 align:middle line:84%
and you're really open
to help this person,

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:16.180 align:middle line:84%
it enables them
to tell you things

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:17.603 align:middle line:90%
they'll never tell anyone.

00:15:17.603 --> 00:15:19.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
your interview process

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:21.910 align:middle line:90%
is not like going to Kaiser.

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:24.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: Fortunately,
it's a different universe.

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:26.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.120 align:middle line:84%
Because you start
asking-- you want

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.820 align:middle line:84%
to know the fundamental
questions about a person's

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:36.230 align:middle line:84%
emotional state, their mental
state, their digestive state,

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:37.090 align:middle line:90%
et cetera, right?

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:38.715 align:middle line:84%
What are all the
factors you're looking

00:15:38.715 --> 00:15:40.790 align:middle line:90%
at in that initial consult?

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:43.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: Well, it's a
complex investigation

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:46.090 align:middle line:84%
because we're looking at all
different kinds of information.

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:48.337 align:middle line:84%
And then we're looking
for a coherence

00:15:48.337 --> 00:15:50.170 align:middle line:84%
between these different
levels of expression

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:51.250 align:middle line:90%
within the system.

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:53.230 align:middle line:84%
Like I was saying,
the heart speaks--

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:56.470 align:middle line:84%
will say the same things in one
language, the liver in another.

00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:59.770 align:middle line:84%
But the emotion
is also in another

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:01.625 align:middle line:90%
and the sensations in another.

00:16:01.625 --> 00:16:03.250 align:middle line:84%
Sensations are very
important-- the way

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:05.200 align:middle line:90%
we experience being embodied.

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:09.080 align:middle line:84%
What's the meaning
of our suffering?

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:09.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.338 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is it serving
us, or is it gratuitous?

00:16:12.338 --> 00:16:13.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: It can be
either, can't it?

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:14.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:14.980 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: Yeah.

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:18.680 align:middle line:84%
So I have to come into
this investigation

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.190 align:middle line:90%
with an open heart and mind.

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:22.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be closing
on the heart too quickly.

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:24.540 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very interested
in this heart thing.

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And somewhere over
here it's saying,

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:28.760 align:middle line:84%
he probably needs
a heart remedy.

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:31.130 align:middle line:84%
But I don't want that to
influence me because sometimes

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:32.588 align:middle line:84%
he won't need a
heart remedy that's

00:16:32.588 --> 00:16:34.370 align:middle line:90%
recognized as a heart remedy.

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is
millions and millions

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:38.840 align:middle line:84%
and millions of human beings
have issues with the heart.

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.670 align:middle line:84%
And what you're seeing
in your patients,

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:44.090 align:middle line:84%
is this increasing more with
the incredible anxiety happening

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:47.700 align:middle line:90%
in the world these days?

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:54.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: That's a big one
because we're not islands.

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.863 align:middle line:90%
We're so interconnected.

00:16:55.863 --> 00:16:57.780 align:middle line:84%
We're-- you know, in
America, we like to think

00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:59.817 align:middle line:84%
of our-- we're independent
and we're free.

00:16:59.817 --> 00:17:01.650 align:middle line:84%
But actually, we're
much more impressionable

00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:03.300 align:middle line:90%
than we'd like to recognize.

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:06.210 align:middle line:90%
We're so interconnected.

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And actually in the end, our
best resource is each other.

00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:12.817 align:middle line:84%
So these connections and
the way we work and live

00:17:12.817 --> 00:17:15.150 align:middle line:84%
with these connections are
fundamental to being healthy,

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:15.950 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:18.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the
entanglement and the heart--

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:22.680 align:middle line:84%
quantum entanglement and the
heart where so many have always

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:26.040 align:middle line:84%
suffered-- are there
more suffering now

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:28.980 align:middle line:84%
because of the entanglement
and because of the anxiety--

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.890 align:middle line:84%
mass anxiety that people
are experiencing and levels

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:35.617 align:middle line:90%
of fear about the future?

00:17:35.617 --> 00:17:37.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: It's a really
interesting question

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:41.440 align:middle line:84%
because actually, when
we look at something

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:46.360 align:middle line:84%
like a biological system,
like an individual person,

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.273 align:middle line:90%
then we can draw circles.

00:17:48.273 --> 00:17:49.690 align:middle line:84%
We say, OK, this
is an individual.

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And then the next circle will
be the family of the person.

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And then the next circle will
be the community of the person.

00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And then the society,
the nation, the culture--

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:01.480 align:middle line:90%
increasing circles.

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:04.550 align:middle line:84%
We're each a fractal
of each of these.

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:05.920 align:middle line:90%
We're not separate from them.

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:12.100 align:middle line:84%
So what's happening in the state
of a culture influences each

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:14.140 align:middle line:90%
of us profoundly.

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:15.730 align:middle line:90%
But it's a bidirection.

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:17.470 align:middle line:90%
It goes both ways.

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:21.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm an eternal optimist, but
I can't say anything good

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:22.647 align:middle line:90%
about that.

00:18:22.647 --> 00:18:23.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right now.

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:26.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: But what I
can say is in nature

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:28.430 align:middle line:90%
there are always cycles.

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:29.770 align:middle line:90%
So the tide goes in.

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:31.480 align:middle line:90%
The tide goes out.

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Tide goes in, and
we spiral around.

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:37.940 align:middle line:84%
So we go through these
large cycles in time.

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:43.010 align:middle line:84%
And we're in a part of a cycle
now, which is not very pretty.

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:47.600 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't-- you can't
see the light of dawn

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:48.740 align:middle line:90%
on the horizon yet.

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:51.740 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Are you speaking
as large as Yuga cycles, or--

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:53.542 align:middle line:10%
>>BANNAN: You could
say we're in Kali Yuga.

00:18:53.542 --> 00:18:54.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, we are.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:54.920 align:middle line:90%
We are.

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:55.910 align:middle line:90%
That's a fact.

00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:58.077 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: But there are
pluses to Kali Yuga as well.

00:18:58.077 --> 00:19:01.020 align:middle line:84%
It's easier to get
free in Kali Yuga.

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:01.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:02.820 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you can break free.

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:05.060 align:middle line:84%
Revolution,
provocation-- we're going

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:07.020 align:middle line:84%
to get to that in a
moment, to provocation.

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:09.200 align:middle line:84%
So when you're sitting
with this person.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:11.720 align:middle line:84%
You've kind of woven
around the story,

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.130 align:middle line:90%
and you realize, OK, it's heart.

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:16.580 align:middle line:84%
And there's obviously a lot
of emotional entanglement

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:18.110 align:middle line:84%
with the past and
belief systems.

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:23.450 align:middle line:84%
Do you do one type of remedy
to go into the emotional field,

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:25.790 align:middle line:90%
and that just trickles up?

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:28.760 align:middle line:84%
Or are there different
levels and types of remedies

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:32.100 align:middle line:84%
as you go further
toward the physical?

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:34.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: That's a
really good question.

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:40.090 align:middle line:84%
It's not easy to say what's
going to happen because there

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:41.590 align:middle line:84%
are different
approaches to applying

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:43.840 align:middle line:84%
the homeopathic
principle, of course.

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.610 align:middle line:84%
You can work in
both of those ways.

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:49.720 align:middle line:84%
My interest is going for
the big kahuna, which

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:53.320 align:middle line:84%
is I want to encompass this,
that, this and that together

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:54.940 align:middle line:90%
as a totality.

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:58.990 align:middle line:84%
This is the organic whole
of this person's being.

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:02.030 align:middle line:84%
I want to address it in as
holistic a way as possible.

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:08.577 align:middle line:10%
So I tend to put things and try
and hold things in solution.

00:20:08.577 --> 00:20:10.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be too
prejudiced about the heart.

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:11.950 align:middle line:90%
I know it's important.

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:13.420 align:middle line:90%
But what else is important?

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:14.890 align:middle line:90%
And how do I qualify that?

00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:15.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:17.978 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:20:17.978 --> 00:20:20.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You might work
with an emotional remedy

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:22.780 align:middle line:90%
under the surface first?

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:25.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: I'll try and focus
on where the energy is most

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.350 align:middle line:90%
central--

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:28.900 align:middle line:84%
what the central nexus
of what's happening now.

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:31.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, if
they're clearly a wound--

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:34.690 align:middle line:84%
an open wound walking
with a broken heart,

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:36.175 align:middle line:84%
and they can't get
over the story.

00:20:36.175 --> 00:20:38.690 align:middle line:90%


00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:41.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: If they're an open
wound working with a broken

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:43.130 align:middle line:84%
heart, and they can't
get over the story--

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:46.610 align:middle line:84%
you see, we can go to--
we can palliate that

00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:49.280 align:middle line:84%
with an acute remedy, which
will make them feel better

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:52.670 align:middle line:84%
temporarily, but it won't
address the underlying reason

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:55.710 align:middle line:84%
that they go into such a damaged
state in the first place.

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:56.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:20:56.510 --> 00:21:00.290 align:middle line:84%
So many people-- let's
use this as an example--

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:04.340 align:middle line:84%
certainly the women I know, most
of them have digestive issues.

00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:07.440 align:middle line:84%
Most of them-- it doesn't
matter, even the age anymore.

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:08.550 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:09.970 align:middle line:90%
What are you seeing in mass?

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:11.660 align:middle line:84%
I know we're all
individuals, but there

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:14.790 align:middle line:84%
are some things happening to
create this chronic situation

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:15.590 align:middle line:90%
in mass.

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:17.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: I don't want to
say that the physical system

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:18.713 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have significance.

00:21:18.713 --> 00:21:19.820 align:middle line:90%
It's a huge significance.

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:20.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it's
telling us something.

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:22.792 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: It is our physical
being in this world.

00:21:22.792 --> 00:21:25.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But why so
many digestive upsets

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:27.342 align:middle line:90%
among the females in particular?

00:21:27.342 --> 00:21:28.550 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: Do you want a list?

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:29.630 align:middle line:90%
There are a number of reasons.

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:30.110 align:middle line:90%
Yeah because--

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:31.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Give us
the top three hits.

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:33.350 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: Well, first is diet.

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:34.970 align:middle line:90%
What are we eating?

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:39.390 align:middle line:84%
What are we putting in that's
so difficult to digest.

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:41.453 align:middle line:90%
Look at our food system.

00:21:41.453 --> 00:21:42.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's
not, but go ahead.

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:43.860 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:45.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: You see,
in a way, when

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:48.270 align:middle line:84%
you begin to look at
this in a holistic way,

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:52.050 align:middle line:84%
as a-- the whole paradigm of
information starts to change.

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:55.590 align:middle line:84%
You look at the way
modern medicine works,

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:58.923 align:middle line:84%
the way you look at agriculture
works, the food industry works,

00:21:58.923 --> 00:22:00.090 align:middle line:90%
the pharmaceutical industry.

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:03.422 align:middle line:84%
They all work in the
same principles and--

00:22:03.422 --> 00:22:04.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, profit.

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:05.770 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: They're not healthy.

00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:08.400 align:middle line:84%
They don't-- they're not
paying attention to the natural

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.430 align:middle line:90%
harmony and health.

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:10.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:11.630 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: So that's number one.

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:13.380 align:middle line:84%
Then there's going to
be relationships to,

00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:17.250 align:middle line:90%
how to digest.

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:18.660 align:middle line:90%
Why can't the system digest?

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:20.580 align:middle line:84%
OK, what you're putting
in is one thing,

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:24.250 align:middle line:84%
but some people will
be able to digest that.

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:26.820 align:middle line:84%
So why is it a particular
issue for this person?

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:29.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're beginning to find
a complex starting to evolve.

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:32.640 align:middle line:84%
So there's a relationship
between these things.

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And so you can't
digest unfairness.

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.230 align:middle line:90%
You can't digest it.

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:38.303 align:middle line:90%
You've got indigestion.

00:22:38.303 --> 00:22:39.720 align:middle line:84%
You've got unfairness
indigestion.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:40.637 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, right.

00:22:40.637 --> 00:22:43.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: So the principle
of justice and equanimity

00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:47.790 align:middle line:84%
and truth is
probably fundamental.

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:50.670 align:middle line:84%
So then we have to look at
the way this is affecting you

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:51.900 align:middle line:90%
emotionally.

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:56.560 align:middle line:84%
Usually, if there's
difficulty with the digestion,

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.690 align:middle line:84%
there's probably a
separation between the will

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:00.170 align:middle line:90%
and the understanding.

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:00.970 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:02.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Explain
that a little for us

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:04.840 align:middle line:84%
because there are so many people
that have this issue right now

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:05.960 align:middle line:90%
and heart problems.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:07.592 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't--
just explain that.

00:23:07.592 --> 00:23:09.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: Well, the will
pertains to the heart,

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:10.880 align:middle line:90%
really-- the spiritual heart.

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:11.680 align:middle line:90%
What is your will?

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:13.720 align:middle line:84%
What's the purpose
of your existence?

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:14.560 align:middle line:90%
Why are you here?

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.580 align:middle line:84%
Every soul comes
here with a purpose--

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:17.380 align:middle line:90%
a specific purpose.

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:19.213 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what do
you mean the difference

00:23:19.213 --> 00:23:21.040 align:middle line:84%
between your will and
your understanding?

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:23.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: Well, in health,
like I was saying before,

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:24.940 align:middle line:90%
health is wholeness.

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:25.900 align:middle line:90%
There's a harmony.

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:27.670 align:middle line:90%
These things are not separated.

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:31.240 align:middle line:84%
You will-- and you
understand-- the understanding

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:34.635 align:middle line:84%
serves of the will, so that
you can manifest your will.

00:23:34.635 --> 00:23:36.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's
what you call

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:37.390 align:middle line:90%
the manifestation of healing.

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:39.250 align:middle line:84%
This is a good time to
get into that topic.

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:40.583 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: This is simply health.

00:23:40.583 --> 00:23:43.000 align:middle line:84%
This is a healthy
condition, where

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.550 align:middle line:84%
the time period between willing
something and actuating it

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:47.950 align:middle line:90%
is very short.

00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:50.110 align:middle line:84%
Part of the reason for
that is that in health, you

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:52.670 align:middle line:84%
don't want things
you can't have,

00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:55.230 align:middle line:84%
and you get things
that you want.

00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And as we lose our
health, a polarization

00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:00.830 align:middle line:84%
happens between the will
and the understanding.

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:02.100 align:middle line:90%
And this is relative.

00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:03.800 align:middle line:84%
There are relative
levels of health,

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.383 align:middle line:84%
and it's very important
to appreciate.

00:24:05.383 --> 00:24:06.710 align:middle line:90%
This isn't black or white.

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:09.960 align:middle line:84%
As people's health deteriorates,
the will and the understanding

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:10.760 align:middle line:90%
separate.

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:14.302 align:middle line:84%
And people start to want
things they can't have,

00:24:14.302 --> 00:24:15.260 align:middle line:90%
and they start to get--

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:16.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or that
they shouldn't have.

00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:19.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: And they shouldn't
have, but that they can't have.

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:20.970 align:middle line:90%
They're not easy to get.

00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:21.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:22.460 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I see.

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:23.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: So they don't
get what they want.

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:25.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
in a state of lack.

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:26.120 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:28.250 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: They don't get
what they want because they

00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:29.542 align:middle line:90%
want something they can't have.

00:24:29.542 --> 00:24:33.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this deep
disappointment, OK,

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:37.480 align:middle line:84%
is blocking their ability to
have that coherence or harmony.

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:38.510 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: Precisely.

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:39.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:41.253 align:middle line:90%
These two are closely related.

00:24:41.253 --> 00:24:42.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now,
this is interesting

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:45.580 align:middle line:84%
because everything in our
culture in the Western world

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:48.070 align:middle line:84%
is to inspire us to
have what most of us

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:49.690 align:middle line:90%
can't have or can't afford.

00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:53.680 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: Yeah, it's the
profit motive, you know?

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:54.593 align:middle line:90%
Create the need.

00:24:54.593 --> 00:24:55.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Create the desire.

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.790 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: Create the desire.

00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:01.810 align:middle line:84%
And as we become less healthy,
it's harder and harder for us

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:03.070 align:middle line:90%
to manifest our will.

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:04.720 align:middle line:84%
We want things we
can't have, and we

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:09.848 align:middle line:84%
get things we don't want,
and the cycle goes on.

00:25:09.848 --> 00:25:11.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Chasing shiny things.

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:12.232 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: Precisely, yeah.

00:25:12.232 --> 00:25:14.440 align:middle line:84%
And when you get them,
there's no satisfaction in it,

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:16.810 align:middle line:84%
of course, because this
isn't what your inner--

00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:19.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now, how is this
showing up with someone sitting

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:21.910 align:middle line:90%
before you in your office--

00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:25.870 align:middle line:84%
this chasing-- this
eternal disappointment

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:28.480 align:middle line:84%
of chasing things
they can't have?

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And then, thus, drawing
things that you don't want.

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:34.930 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: People come
when they have a problem.

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:36.940 align:middle line:84%
I say there are two
kinds of clients.

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:38.850 align:middle line:84%
This is one way of
cutting the pie.

00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:40.600 align:middle line:84%
There's people who
come who are suffering.

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:43.058 align:middle line:84%
They want relief from suffering,
and that's what they want.

00:25:43.058 --> 00:25:45.040 align:middle line:84%
They've tried everything,
and it hasn't worked.

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:47.590 align:middle line:84%
They just want relief,
and that's perfectly

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:50.357 align:middle line:90%
good and understandable.

00:25:50.357 --> 00:25:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And then there are
people who actually

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:54.520 align:middle line:84%
come because they
want to heal, which is

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:56.380 align:middle line:90%
a much more profound position.

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:58.203 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, more
and more people

00:25:58.203 --> 00:25:59.620 align:middle line:84%
are coming with
this understanding

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:05.200 align:middle line:84%
that this isn't just something
that's happening to me.

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.933 align:middle line:84%
This is something
more fundamental--

00:26:06.933 --> 00:26:08.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You've
been co-creating.

00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:09.490 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: --to my orientation.

00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:10.050 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:10.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:15.910 align:middle line:84%
And then, really, we're cooking
because we're working together.

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:16.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:17.260 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:18.820 align:middle line:84%
So the whole world
is conditioned

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:21.680 align:middle line:84%
to have us seek what we can't
have, for the most part.

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:24.580 align:middle line:84%
Most of us are not going to
be able with a spare dime

00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:28.330 align:middle line:84%
buy a villa in
France or in Italy.

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:30.580 align:middle line:84%
And we're not going to look
like the supermodel that's

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:32.020 align:middle line:90%
in the pool in that villa.

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:36.370 align:middle line:84%
And yet, this yearning has
been created that is so false.

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:40.240 align:middle line:84%
But it's our responsibility
to start understanding

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.590 align:middle line:90%
what has true value.

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:43.790 align:middle line:84%
Would that go a long
way toward our health?

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:45.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: The shoe's on
the other foot, I think.

00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:50.050 align:middle line:84%
As we become more healthy, as
we heal, this shift in values

00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:51.693 align:middle line:90%
happens naturally.

00:26:51.693 --> 00:26:52.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:55.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: Because the internal
and the external depolarize.

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:58.530 align:middle line:84%
They start to become
harmonious with each other.

00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:02.120 align:middle line:84%
And so the will and the
understanding begin to line up.

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:07.317 align:middle line:84%
And this is what-- in fact, real
healing, true healing raises

00:27:07.317 --> 00:27:08.900 align:middle line:84%
the level of a
person's consciousness,

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:10.940 align:middle line:84%
and it expands their
spiritual awareness.

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:13.232 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it has to
because if you're not feeling

00:27:13.232 --> 00:27:16.040 align:middle line:84%
well, and your energy is low,
you cannot expand very easily.

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:17.120 align:middle line:90%
Your creativity dips.

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:18.140 align:middle line:90%
Everything dips.

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:20.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: And you can't manifest
what it is you're here to do,

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.760 align:middle line:84%
and that's really
what's crucial.

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:24.440 align:middle line:90%
We're here for a purpose.

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is there
any kind of overlay

00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:31.460 align:middle line:84%
that you're seeing in terms of
the rise of chronic conditions?

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:32.390 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: It is.

00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:35.070 align:middle line:84%
There is certainly a rise
in chronic conditions.

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:39.860 align:middle line:84%
And if you think about it, if
modern medicine really worked,

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:40.760 align:middle line:90%
what would we see?

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:44.570 align:middle line:84%
We'd see fewer and fewer people
needing fewer and fewer drugs

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:46.010 align:middle line:90%
less and less frequently.

00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:48.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know about you,
but that's not what I'm seeing.

00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:52.880 align:middle line:84%
Some of this is related to the
ability of modern diagnostics

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:54.750 align:middle line:90%
to actually identify things.

00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:56.300 align:middle line:90%
Some of it is related to--

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:59.360 align:middle line:84%
I hate to say this, but there
are fashions in medicine.

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:02.180 align:middle line:90%
And if you look at the DSM--

00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:05.180 align:middle line:84%
the manual for-- the
Diagnostic Statistical Manual,

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:08.220 align:middle line:84%
you'll see new
diagnoses appearing

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:11.660 align:middle line:90%
which have specific treatments.

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:13.170 align:middle line:90%
It's a very profitable business.

00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:13.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:15.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But I mean, for you--

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:18.020 align:middle line:84%
what you're seeing
in your clients.

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:19.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: I see all
kinds of things.

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:20.300 align:middle line:90%
I see everything.

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:20.930 align:middle line:90%
I don't--

00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:22.347 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there's
not one thing

00:28:22.347 --> 00:28:24.960 align:middle line:84%
that's kind of popping
up more these days?

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: You see a lot
more autoimmune diseases

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:27.410 align:middle line:90%
than you used to.

00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:28.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what I
was just going to ask you.

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:29.630 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: Yeah.

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:31.255 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you--
let me ask you this.

00:28:31.255 --> 00:28:34.650 align:middle line:84%
Since COVID-- and forget the
argument over vaccinated,

00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:35.450 align:middle line:90%
unvaccinated.

00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:36.533 align:middle line:90%
Everybody kind of got it--

00:28:36.533 --> 00:28:39.100 align:middle line:90%
didn't matter.

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:43.030 align:middle line:84%
Are you seeing more autoimmune
problems now from that, or--

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:48.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: I don't think
this has been digested yet.

00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:50.440 align:middle line:90%
I think this is early days.

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:53.080 align:middle line:90%
The problem is because of--

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:54.700 align:middle line:84%
we have to understand
culturally,

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:57.820 align:middle line:84%
we're so profoundly
indoctrinated by materialism.

00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:01.250 align:middle line:84%
We think that this is the
definition of our experience.

00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:02.050 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:04.720 align:middle line:84%
It's just one
interpretation, you know?

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:06.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the
interesting thing about COVID

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:09.430 align:middle line:84%
is what it did to us
spiritually, psychically,

00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:10.870 align:middle line:90%
emotionally, and physically.

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:12.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: But it's an
external expression

00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:15.640 align:middle line:84%
of a pre-existing
internal deficiency.

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:17.085 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Explain that.

00:29:17.085 --> 00:29:18.460 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: It
couldn't have mani--

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:20.835 align:middle line:84%
it couldn't-- this could not
have manifested in a healthy

00:29:20.835 --> 00:29:21.700 align:middle line:90%
society.

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:22.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:23.200 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:25.067 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: It could
not have happened.

00:29:25.067 --> 00:29:26.650 align:middle line:84%
And look at-- there
are some societies

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:27.880 align:middle line:90%
in which it didn't manifest.

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:29.110 align:middle line:90%
Look at the African nations.

00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:30.863 align:middle line:90%
Some of them didn't have COVID.

00:29:30.863 --> 00:29:31.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:32.830 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:33.880 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: Yeah.

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:36.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's a
very good point you bring up.

00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:39.830 align:middle line:84%
So back to autoimmune because
that seems to be everywhere.

00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:41.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: Yes, and
increasingly everywhere.

00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And it represents an
increasing complexity

00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:52.490 align:middle line:84%
of the condition of the
population's health.

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:53.870 align:middle line:90%
And it's a real concern.

00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:59.180 align:middle line:84%
The real problem is because of
our philosophical materialism,

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:03.400 align:middle line:84%
we blame everything
on the external.

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:07.010 align:middle line:90%
We think it's an external cause.

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:09.288 align:middle line:84%
If there's a problem, it's
because of the neighbor,

00:30:09.288 --> 00:30:10.580 align:middle line:90%
or it's because of the weather.

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:12.350 align:middle line:84%
It's because of what I ate, or
it's because of the markets,

00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:13.150 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:14.870 align:middle line:84%
There's always something
out there that's

00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:16.280 align:middle line:90%
the cause of the trouble.

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:18.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: One of the
probably exemplary examples

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:21.980 align:middle line:84%
in terms of longevity
and physical well-being

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:25.710 align:middle line:84%
has been England's royal family
and the use of homeopathics.

00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:26.510 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: Mm-hmm.

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:27.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:31.012 align:middle line:84%
Well, they've been avid
homeopaths for over 100 years.

00:30:31.012 --> 00:30:33.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and most of them
live to be about 100 years.

00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:33.710 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: Yeah.

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:35.960 align:middle line:84%
Most of them live well
into their 90s, yeah.

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:39.530 align:middle line:84%
Or the Queen Mother
died, 103, I think.

00:30:39.530 --> 00:30:42.530 align:middle line:90%
The Queen's husband died at 99.

00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:44.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just
before his hundredth.

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:46.655 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: Just before he got his
telegram from the Queen, yeah.

00:30:46.655 --> 00:30:50.000 align:middle line:90%


00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.250 align:middle line:90%
Yes, they're well taken care of.

00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And so I do think that good
homeopathic work will do a lot

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:03.920 align:middle line:84%
to safeguard people from
degenerative problems related

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:08.330 align:middle line:84%
to their inheritance and
environmental factors

00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:09.538 align:middle line:90%
and stresses and strains.

00:31:09.538 --> 00:31:11.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what about
the average person?

00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:13.163 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're talking about
the average person.

00:31:13.163 --> 00:31:13.970 align:middle line:90%
We all have issues.

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:15.710 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has something
wrong, and not

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:17.930 align:middle line:84%
everyone can even afford
to go to a homeopath.

00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:18.450 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: This is true.

00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:19.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now,
how can you even

00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:21.900 align:middle line:84%
begin to incorporate
homeopathy in your life

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:23.997 align:middle line:84%
if you can't afford
to go to a homeopath.

00:31:23.997 --> 00:31:26.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can go to Whole
Foods, and there are whole--

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:29.390 align:middle line:84%
you can say sinusitis
or headaches,

00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:31.430 align:middle line:84%
and you got your
remedy right there--

00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:32.510 align:middle line:90%
Boiron.

00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:33.320 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: Yeah.

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:36.760 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you can do that, but this
is like Schuessler's tissue

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:37.560 align:middle line:90%
salts.

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:39.380 align:middle line:90%
It's a very reductive model.

00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:41.282 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But can it
help the symptoms?

00:31:41.282 --> 00:31:42.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: It can
help the symptoms.

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:43.260 align:middle line:90%
No question.

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:43.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:44.360 align:middle line:90%
Arnica montana.

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:44.900 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: Yes.

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:47.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everybody's heard of
that pretty much and used it,

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:48.783 align:middle line:90%
and you go to the dentist.

00:31:48.783 --> 00:31:50.450 align:middle line:84%
You take a little
Arnica, and your tooth

00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:51.650 align:middle line:90%
doesn't hurt as badly.

00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:53.180 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:55.070 align:middle line:84%
Let's even talk
about the complexity

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:57.630 align:middle line:84%
of Arnica montana, the most
popular one for a moment--

00:31:57.630 --> 00:31:58.430 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: OK.

00:31:58.430 --> 00:31:59.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --in the populace.

00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:00.847 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: That's an
interesting approach

00:32:00.847 --> 00:32:05.330 align:middle line:84%
because this concept of
similitude-- the principle

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:09.230 align:middle line:84%
of homeopathy-- homeopathy,
similar suffering.

00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:11.480 align:middle line:84%
The principle of similitude
is the most important one.

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:14.180 align:middle line:84%
But similar by
definition is relative.

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:17.690 align:middle line:90%
There are degrees of similarity.

00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:21.380 align:middle line:84%
So you can apply it on a
fairly superficial level,

00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:24.030 align:middle line:84%
or you can apply
it on a deep level.

00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And you can apply
it on gradations

00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:29.510 align:middle line:84%
in between these
two levels, and you

00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:35.080 align:middle line:84%
will get a result proportionate
to how deep the correspondence

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:36.230 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:39.220 align:middle line:84%
So if you've just hit
your thumb with a hammer--

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:41.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you have a
little vial of, say, 200.

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:43.150 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: 200 or 30.

00:32:43.150 --> 00:32:43.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or 30, whatever.

00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:45.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: You take
Arnica 30, you'll

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:48.590 align:middle line:84%
be amazed how you don't have a
problem with your thumb really.

00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:51.562 align:middle line:84%
Next day, it's like you didn't
hit your thumb with a hammer.

00:32:51.562 --> 00:32:53.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sounds
pretty good to me.

00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:54.395 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: It's
quite astonishing.

00:32:54.395 --> 00:32:57.340 align:middle line:84%
I know people who've
convinced that they've

00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:59.890 align:middle line:84%
smashed their fingers in a
train door, for instance.

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And they take Arnica 30 or
200, and next day there's

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:05.020 align:middle line:90%
no problem, you know?

00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:06.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So--

00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:09.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: It's a very concise
prescription based on event,

00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:12.400 align:middle line:84%
and an event that's very
defined in space and time.

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:13.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And traumatic.

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:14.500 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: And traumatic.

00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:17.023 align:middle line:84%
Well, the trauma is
what Arnica's all about.

00:33:17.023 --> 00:33:19.190 align:middle line:84%
But there are different
levels of trauma, of course.

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:22.300 align:middle line:84%
On that level of
simple physical trauma,

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:27.200 align:middle line:84%
immediately now Arnica will help
probably 80% or 90% of people.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:28.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's a
good one to have on hand.

00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:31.335 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: It's a very
good one to have.

00:33:31.335 --> 00:33:33.490 align:middle line:84%
If you go traveling,
take Arnica 30 with you.

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:34.640 align:middle line:90%
You never know.

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:36.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you said,
though, it's about trauma,

00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:39.020 align:middle line:84%
meaning it has to be about
different levels of trauma,

00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:39.320 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:41.100 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: Well,
Arnica-- for instance,

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:45.530 align:middle line:84%
if you had a remedy as
a holistic prescription

00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:47.570 align:middle line:84%
for somebody, if
you find somebody

00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:52.145 align:middle line:84%
who needs Arnica
and has needed it

00:33:52.145 --> 00:33:53.520 align:middle line:84%
since the beginning
of their life

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:56.170 align:middle line:84%
as a homeopathic
simillimum, there's

00:33:56.170 --> 00:33:58.330 align:middle line:84%
a profound correspondence
between the Arnica

00:33:58.330 --> 00:34:00.130 align:middle line:90%
and the person.

00:34:00.130 --> 00:34:02.320 align:middle line:84%
And what you'll find
is the story of Arnica

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:05.570 align:middle line:84%
really is all about trauma,
or is all about vulnerability,

00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:06.370 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:08.679 align:middle line:84%
It's really a paradigm
of vulnerability

00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:11.889 align:middle line:84%
and the strategy for
coping with vulnerability.

00:34:11.889 --> 00:34:14.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So can it help you
deal with emotional trauma,

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:15.550 align:middle line:90%
too?

00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:16.480 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: No.

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:17.139 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:34:17.139 --> 00:34:18.181 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: Absolutely not.

00:34:18.181 --> 00:34:21.219 align:middle line:84%
It's the opposite because
the strategy that Arnica

00:34:21.219 --> 00:34:24.820 align:middle line:84%
uses to cope with vulnerability
when they're relatively healthy

00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:26.800 align:middle line:90%
is to be invulnerable.

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:30.280 align:middle line:84%
They jump out of
airplanes, climb mountains,

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:34.000 align:middle line:84%
do dangerous things to prove
to themselves and the world

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.830 align:middle line:90%
that they're invulnerable.

00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:37.467 align:middle line:84%
And then something
happens, usually

00:34:37.467 --> 00:34:38.800 align:middle line:90%
when they're in their early 50s.

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.659 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If the chute
doesn't open you mean or what?

00:34:40.659 --> 00:34:41.492 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: Precisely.

00:34:41.492 --> 00:34:48.610 align:middle line:84%
Or they have a relatively
minor disease or something

00:34:48.610 --> 00:34:51.610 align:middle line:84%
which demonstrates to them
that they're vulnerable,

00:34:51.610 --> 00:34:54.010 align:middle line:84%
and they can't kid themselves
that they're not vulnerable

00:34:54.010 --> 00:34:54.810 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:57.970 align:middle line:84%
Then you can see a dramatic
kind of a decompensation,

00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:00.520 align:middle line:84%
and then this almost
hypochondriasis develops out

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:01.840 align:middle line:90%
of invulnerability.

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:04.300 align:middle line:84%
So this is what you'll
see in a chronic, much

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:07.510 align:middle line:84%
deeper correspondence between
the Arnica and the person.

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:08.950 align:middle line:90%
But on an everyday level--

00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:10.883 align:middle line:90%
bang, Arnica.

00:35:10.883 --> 00:35:12.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tooth work--
take your Arnica.

00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:13.350 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: Exactly.

00:35:13.350 --> 00:35:17.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so on that level,
do you have a couple remedies

00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:19.930 align:middle line:84%
that you could say without
seeing the person would

00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:22.270 align:middle line:90%
work for anxiety?

00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:23.583 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: I wouldn't go there.

00:35:23.583 --> 00:35:25.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah because
it's-- that's too individual.

00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:27.000 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: It's too individual.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.098 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:35:28.098 --> 00:35:30.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we just go and read
it on the little container--

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:31.440 align:middle line:90%
anxiety.

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:35.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: I mean, like we
have these reference manuals

00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:39.280 align:middle line:84%
called repertories
that we use sometimes.

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:41.410 align:middle line:84%
You look at the
repertory for anxiety.

00:35:41.410 --> 00:35:42.670 align:middle line:90%
There's an anxiety rubric.

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:44.300 align:middle line:84%
It's got about
1,000 clicks in it.

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:44.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:44.920 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:45.370 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:45.730 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:46.530 align:middle line:90%
Forget that.

00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:48.260 align:middle line:84%
So I have one final
question for you

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:52.100 align:middle line:84%
here, which is because
homeopathy is so effective,

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:56.410 align:middle line:84%
and it is an actual alternative
to allopathic medicine,

00:35:56.410 --> 00:35:58.030 align:middle line:90%
why does it still exist?

00:35:58.030 --> 00:36:01.090 align:middle line:84%
Why hasn't it been run out of
business like everything else?

00:36:01.090 --> 00:36:03.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: Well, they're
making concerted efforts now.

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:06.095 align:middle line:84%
In the last 20
years, they've really

00:36:06.095 --> 00:36:07.720 align:middle line:84%
rubbished it in the
media, particularly

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:08.510 align:middle line:90%
in the UK and Europe.

00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:09.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:36:09.010 --> 00:36:09.880 align:middle line:90%
I've seen it.

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:12.130 align:middle line:10%
>>BANNAN: And now you've
got the FDA working

00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:15.460 align:middle line:10%
to make homeopathic
remedies unavailable

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:18.850 align:middle line:10%
because they're toxic.

00:36:18.850 --> 00:36:23.260 align:middle line:84%
This is the same FDA that
regulates really toxic drugs.

00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:24.070 align:middle line:90%
So it's--

00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:26.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All those opioids
out there among the populace.

00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:27.270 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: Exactly.

00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:30.052 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that they're
on our side by any means.

00:36:30.052 --> 00:36:32.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm just wondering
how they haven't already

00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:33.970 align:middle line:90%
killed you guys.

00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:35.427 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: It's the truth.

00:36:35.427 --> 00:36:36.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: People find their way.

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And they can't-- I mean,
what are they going to say?

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:40.687 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have anything there.

00:36:40.687 --> 00:36:42.020 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: There's nothing in it.

00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:42.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There's nothing in it.

00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:44.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: That's been
their argument today.

00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:45.340 align:middle line:90%
Now, they're going to find--

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:47.230 align:middle line:84%
probably, they'll
find something,

00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:49.900 align:middle line:90%
some reason, some excuse to--

00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:52.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that means we have
to stand up as human beings,

00:36:52.450 --> 00:36:55.840 align:middle line:84%
as citizens, and fight
for the remedies we feel--

00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:58.832 align:middle line:84%
the holistic therapies we feel
have value-- just fight for it.

00:36:58.832 --> 00:37:00.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: This is
what we're doing.

00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:02.450 align:middle line:90%
It's happening.

00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:05.220 align:middle line:84%
We're writing to our congressmen
and all the rest of it.

00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:07.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what do you see is
the future of homeopathy then?

00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:09.680 align:middle line:84%
If you look into
the bright future--

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:11.660 align:middle line:84%
you said you're an
optimist a while ago.

00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:13.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: I'm also--

00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:14.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A realist.

00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:16.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BANNAN: Yeah, something
of a realist, yeah.

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:17.870 align:middle line:90%
I like to kid myself anyway.

00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:21.420 align:middle line:90%


00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:22.500 align:middle line:90%
Homeopathy is the truth.

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:24.010 align:middle line:90%
It's just a brute fact.

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:25.350 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to go away.

00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:27.450 align:middle line:84%
Whether human beings
accept it or not,

00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:29.760 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be
here in 1,000 years.

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:31.650 align:middle line:90%
It's how it is.

00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:36.210 align:middle line:84%
The question is, are we going
to get in alignment with it?

00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:40.110 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to align ourselves
to the truth or aren't we?

00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:43.060 align:middle line:84%
This is really what it
comes down to as a society,

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:45.390 align:middle line:90%
as a culture, as individuals.

00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:48.490 align:middle line:90%
Are we going to move up--

00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:50.110 align:middle line:84%
we're going to strive
up to the light?

00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:53.493 align:middle line:84%
Or are we going to
move away from it?

00:37:53.493 --> 00:37:55.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that is
the ultimate question.

00:37:55.410 --> 00:37:56.210 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: Yeah.

00:37:56.210 --> 00:38:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's in our hands, as
far as we're able to do so.

00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:02.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: On that note,
we'll say goodbye,

00:38:02.770 --> 00:38:03.970 align:middle line:90%
and I couldn't agree more.

00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:05.060 align:middle line:90%
It's in our hands.

00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:07.065 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
being with us today.

00:38:07.065 --> 00:38:07.400 align:middle line:90%
>>BANNAN: It's been a pleasure.

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.050 align:middle line:90%
It's been a pleasure.

00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:09.883 align:middle line:10%

on current events and studies
on homeopathy to peruse there.

00:38:16.855 --> 00:38:17.980 align:middle line:10%
I've been through the site.

00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:19.450 align:middle line:10%
