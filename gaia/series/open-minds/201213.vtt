>>REGINA MEREDITH: Here is a
quote from former CIA director

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.140 align:middle line:10%
William Casey.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.080 align:middle line:10%
"We'll know our disinformation
program is complete

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.578 align:middle line:10%
when everything the American
public believes is false."

00:00:31.578 --> 00:00:33.620 align:middle line:84%
Casey is said to have made
this comment according

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.700 align:middle line:84%
to Barbara Honegger, who was
in the room as a Reagan White

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.880 align:middle line:84%
House policy analyst
back in February of 1981.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.260 align:middle line:84%
An email from her to a colleague
confirmed this quote in 2014.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.990 align:middle line:84%
So as far as we know,
this quote is true.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.580 align:middle line:90%
And it's devastating.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.960 align:middle line:90%
We are there now.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.200 align:middle line:84%
This COVID social, economic,
and physical crisis

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.720 align:middle line:84%
has created such division
that families and friends are

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.040 align:middle line:90%
parting ways.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.110 align:middle line:84%
To begin healing
the societal gulf,

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.850 align:middle line:84%
I have Jean Slatter
with us today

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.750 align:middle line:84%
to help us begin to dig
into our own deeper truth.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:06.740 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Jean.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.690 align:middle line:84%
Normally we'd have
kind of fun little sort

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.700 align:middle line:84%
of girly conversations
around all

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.880 align:middle line:84%
of this and divination and our
Tarot cards out and all that.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.470 align:middle line:90%
That's not what we're doing now.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.900 align:middle line:84%
And I've invited you on
because there's been--

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.670 align:middle line:84%
to me, this is the
most critical time

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.510 align:middle line:84%
I've ever seen for
people absolutely

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.070 align:middle line:84%
having to start
determining what truth is.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we know
truth is subjective,

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.170 align:middle line:84%
but our higher
selves do know truth

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.423 align:middle line:84%
and can tap into
the quantum field.

00:01:35.423 --> 00:01:37.340 align:middle line:84%
And this is going to
bring up a lot of topics,

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.715 align:middle line:84%
because the quantum field is
kind of messed up right now.

00:01:39.715 --> 00:01:41.610 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.410 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:43.160 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN SLATTER: Right.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And we've seen this.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:44.990 align:middle line:90%
We live in Placer County.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.490 align:middle line:84%
We're in an area
that's pretty open,

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.710 align:middle line:84%
didn't have a lot of
COVID cases to begin with

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.230 align:middle line:84%
and is open when other
places are closed.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And people are pretty
relaxed about it,

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.450 align:middle line:84%
and it's not creating
tremendous amount of fear.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.270 align:middle line:84%
Other than people who
have lost work and may not

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.430 align:middle line:84%
get that work back, we're
in this grace period

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:02.990 align:middle line:90%
right now, right?

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.680 align:middle line:84%
But we're still seeing people
kind of go at each other.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.530 align:middle line:10%
>>SLATTER: And the
reason is because people

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.810 align:middle line:10%
are choosing a side, right?

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.760 align:middle line:90%
They're becoming very polarized.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.730 align:middle line:84%
So when we're in an intense
period like we are right now

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.020 align:middle line:84%
and information is being
thrown at us in a way that

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.620 align:middle line:84%
is completely overwhelming,
the most important thing

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.960 align:middle line:90%
is to remain open.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.930 align:middle line:84%
Have some humility that
says, wait a minute.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.340 align:middle line:84%
I may not know everything
that's going on,

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.790 align:middle line:84%
and I'm allowing
myself to be flexible.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm allowing the
information to reveal itself

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.230 align:middle line:84%
without getting fixated on a
particular thought and an idea

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.420 align:middle line:90%
and an ideology.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.620 align:middle line:90%
We see this on a national level.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And what's happened is that
they've locked into something,

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.660 align:middle line:84%
and now what they're doing
is totally justifying

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.620 align:middle line:84%
the original idea that they
came up with rather than going

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.650 align:middle line:84%
with the flow and seeing how
new information is coming in

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.690 align:middle line:90%
and how it could be modified.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing happens on
a personal level where we are

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.440 align:middle line:84%
seeing that our friends
and families have locked

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.410 align:middle line:84%
into a personal-- and
to one particular idea,

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.330 align:middle line:84%
and then won't veer from that
no matter what new information--

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even if new
evidence has been introduced,

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.090 align:middle line:84%
it's like the fear
is creating these--

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.220 align:middle line:90%
something to cling to.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.130 align:middle line:90%
Something to cling to.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.920 align:middle line:84%
So when we're exposed to
something new, like none of us

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.128 align:middle line:84%
have ever been through
something like this before.

00:03:39.128 --> 00:03:40.670 align:middle line:84%
When you're exposed
to something new,

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.110 align:middle line:90%
remain humble enough to say, OK.

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.130 align:middle line:84%
I can allow new information
in, and I can be flexible.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.890 align:middle line:90%


00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.330 align:middle line:84%
My brother was telling me
a story of the local app

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.850 align:middle line:90%
in our area, Nextdoor.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And someone had posted
a video of doctors

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.580 align:middle line:84%
talking about their
experience in their hospital.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.620 align:middle line:84%
And it was very
different from what

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.750 align:middle line:84%
the viewpoint is that we're
hearing from the government.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And he could not believe
the amount of hate responses

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.149 align:middle line:90%
that came after that.

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:20.720 align:middle line:90%
It was vicious, he said.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And he felt sorry for
the person that wrote it.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And so he started
to respond and say,

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.820 align:middle line:84%
well, the most
important thing is

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.280 align:middle line:84%
that we all have our
freedom of speech

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.190 align:middle line:90%
and we get to present ideas.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.080 align:middle line:84%
And before he could even hit
Enter, the post was removed.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.947 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:04:39.947 --> 00:04:41.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh my god, yeah.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.410 align:middle line:90%
No, this is being--

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is even
more frustrating

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.150 align:middle line:84%
as people try to write what
they feel is their truth.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.740 align:middle line:90%
We're being censored.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.120 align:middle line:90%
This is very obvious now.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.980 align:middle line:84%
Everybody knows posts
are being pulled down.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.870 align:middle line:84%
Films, interviews
are being pulled down

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.270 align:middle line:84%
if they don't have the
right point of view, right?

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.320 align:middle line:84%
So you know, as
we look at this--

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this morning,
Zeus and I were talking

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.780 align:middle line:90%
about this, my husband Zeus.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And he's doing so much research
on all of these topics,

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.720 align:middle line:84%
and stumbled across something,
a stat, and thought, oh my god.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.680 align:middle line:84%
Now here's a whole
other rabbit hole

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.710 align:middle line:84%
to dive down, and have
to let go of everything

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.290 align:middle line:84%
we believe to be
true about this.

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.990 align:middle line:84%
Because in truth, this
is the weird thing

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.820 align:middle line:90%
about this phenomena.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.680 align:middle line:84%
All of the above
have truth in it.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.590 align:middle line:84%
You talk to a
doctor in one area.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:28.490 align:middle line:90%
Hospitals are empty.

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:29.930 align:middle line:90%
No cases of anything.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.598 align:middle line:84%
Talk to a doctor
in central London,

00:05:31.598 --> 00:05:33.890 align:middle line:84%
they're coming home crying
because all these people are

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.500 align:middle line:90%
on respirators or they're dying.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.180 align:middle line:84%
They lose all their
patients in a shift

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.740 align:middle line:90%
and they can't take the stress.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.360 align:middle line:84%
You go somewhere else,
it's like where we are.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.080 align:middle line:90%
Totally chill.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.880 align:middle line:90%
Life is normal.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.250 align:middle line:84%
People are riding their bikes
and families are out together.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.850 align:middle line:90%
All of the above.

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.730 align:middle line:84%
We're having a hard
time processing

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.490 align:middle line:84%
that all of the
above can be true,

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.000 align:middle line:84%
depending on where you are and
what's going on in your area.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.640 align:middle line:84%
But this was the thing
that came up this morning.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.000 align:middle line:84%
Please, don't take this to mean
anything more than just what

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying, indicating
that among the people who

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.210 align:middle line:84%
appear to be somewhat less
vulnerable to the upper

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.930 align:middle line:84%
respiratory infection part
of this or the clogging

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.900 align:middle line:90%
with the mucus were smokers.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.350 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, what?

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And so we're talking about
it, because we have not

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:20.090 align:middle line:90%
gone into the research yet.

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.820 align:middle line:84%
But talk about, again,
having to shift your mind,

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.780 align:middle line:84%
everything we've been told
about smoking and smokers.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.170 align:middle line:84%
Yet it appears there's
something that nicotine does

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:34.377 align:middle line:90%
to either open up the blood--

00:06:34.377 --> 00:06:35.210 align:middle line:90%
what do you call it?

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.100 align:middle line:84%
The circulation
which gives people

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.310 align:middle line:84%
that high that might be
affecting this on some--

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And so how do you get your
mind around these things?

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.790 align:middle line:84%
How can we start
looking for real truth

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:50.810 align:middle line:84%
and acknowledge that all
of the above may be true?

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.150 align:middle line:84%
Our minds don't work like
that when we're in fear.

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:54.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: No, they don't.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:55.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:55.130 --> 00:07:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And what we're hearing from
the high levels of government

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.945 align:middle line:90%
and from Fauci and--

00:07:03.945 --> 00:07:04.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh my gosh.

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.560 align:middle line:90%
I have that in here.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.990 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you've got to
get a vaccine tomorrow.

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:11.660 align:middle line:84%
Oh, there are no regulations
over the vaccine industry.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.460 align:middle line:90%
Oh, we're rushing one to market.

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.490 align:middle line:90%
Then medicine says, no.

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:15.290 align:middle line:90%
You can't do that.

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:17.510 align:middle line:84%
It takes anywhere from
18 months to 10 years

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:19.820 align:middle line:84%
to really make a
vaccine properly.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.140 align:middle line:84%
And everyone's like,
ah, I don't want to die.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.920 align:middle line:90%
I don't want my father to die.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.640 align:middle line:84%
I have never seen such
mass freaking out globally

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.500 align:middle line:84%
in my entire life, because
no one knows what's true.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:32.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Right.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You really have to
spend a lot of time digging.

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:35.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: We don't
know what's true.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:36.690 align:middle line:90%
Everything's new.

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:38.190 align:middle line:84%
We've got to stay
open and flexible.

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:40.580 align:middle line:84%
But I also want to
bring up something here

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.470 align:middle line:90%
that I see as a pattern.

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's appropriate
to have our radar out

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.830 align:middle line:90%
for a pattern like this.

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:50.870 align:middle line:84%
This is very near
and dear to my heart,

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:54.260 align:middle line:84%
because I experienced this, as
I've mentioned before with you,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.800 align:middle line:84%
that I grew up in a church
that I consider a cult.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.080 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons
that I consider it a cult

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.120 align:middle line:84%
is because they had
extreme mind control.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.210 align:middle line:84%
And if they had told us
to drink the Kool-Aid,

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:07.010 align:middle line:90%
we would have done it, right?

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:11.030 align:middle line:84%
Now the way that a cult
leader does this and keeps

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:16.580 align:middle line:84%
control of his congregation
is to, one, they offer safety.

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.080 align:middle line:90%
You are the chosen ones.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.162 align:middle line:90%
If you stay here--

00:08:19.162 --> 00:08:20.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Stay with me.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.410 align:middle line:90%
Hang with me.

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:24.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: --you will be safe
and your salvation is assured.

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:25.190 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:26.240 align:middle line:90%
They offer you safety.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And then on the flip
side, they present fear.

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:33.110 align:middle line:84%
If you have doubt,
if you question,

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:38.570 align:middle line:84%
if you dare to deviate
from what the doctrine is,

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:45.710 align:middle line:84%
then your eternal
damnation is assured, OK?

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:47.450 align:middle line:90%
So you've got safety.

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:48.540 align:middle line:90%
You've got damnation.

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:49.340 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:50.840 align:middle line:90%
What are you got to choose?

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:56.720 align:middle line:84%
So what you do is you
stay within that paradigm

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.600 align:middle line:84%
and whatever that belief
and dogma system is.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what I
see happening here.

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:06.320 align:middle line:84%
I see that pattern in what
the government is putting out

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:10.760 align:middle line:90%
and what the censoring is--

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.920 align:middle line:90%
the extent of the censoring.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.500 align:middle line:84%
Whenever anything
like that happens

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.140 align:middle line:84%
and you see that pattern,
you have to ask yourself,

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.180 align:middle line:90%
what don't they want us to know?

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:22.470 align:middle line:84%
Because the one
thing that a cult

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:25.580 align:middle line:84%
leader fears is when
the congregation

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.440 align:middle line:90%
begins to question.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.260 align:middle line:84%
They begin to ask
their own questions

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:34.100 align:middle line:84%
and think on their own
and begin to say, OK.

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:35.720 align:middle line:90%
I can make up my own mind.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.300 align:middle line:90%
That they can't have.

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.180 align:middle line:84%
What are we seeing
coming from the top down?

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.220 align:middle line:90%
We're seeing extensive control.

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:45.180 align:middle line:90%
You must think this way.

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:48.540 align:middle line:84%
And if you think this
way, we'll keep you safe.

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't, then
we're going to ridicule you.

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:55.160 align:middle line:90%
We're going to shame you.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.050 align:middle line:90%
We're going to outcast you.

00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:59.960 align:middle line:84%
We're going to call
it disinformation.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.240 align:middle line:84%
And so you know,
you go into fear.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.918 align:middle line:84%
Like, I don't want
to be one of those.

00:10:04.918 --> 00:10:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a real
issue, because you're

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:07.910 align:middle line:90%
talking about two strains.

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:11.030 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about
science and junk science,

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:13.337 align:middle line:84%
meaning you've got to look
at who funded the study,

00:10:13.337 --> 00:10:15.920 align:middle line:84%
and you have to look at the real
results, not the ones they've

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.210 align:middle line:90%
published.

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:19.710 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to this subject,
there's a ton of junk science

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:20.510 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:22.540 align:middle line:84%
Then you can look behind
it at the real science.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.670 align:middle line:84%
Now that takes you in a
little different direction.

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:26.980 align:middle line:84%
Then you look at our
fearless political leaders,

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:28.620 align:middle line:84%
whatever side you're
on, that they're

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:30.993 align:middle line:84%
the ones that if you can
attach to their truth,

00:10:30.993 --> 00:10:32.410 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
be safe by hanging

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:34.860 align:middle line:84%
onto a political
position on this.

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:36.630 align:middle line:84%
And now they've all
become conflated,

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:40.020 align:middle line:84%
and it's the worst
jumble of flawed thinking

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.360 align:middle line:84%
across the board
I have ever seen.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.588 align:middle line:90%
And now we're stuck.

00:10:43.588 --> 00:10:45.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: And the last
thing they want you to do

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:47.400 align:middle line:84%
is to question and
think on your own.

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Question everything.

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:51.090 align:middle line:84%
That used to be the
motto of Conscious Media

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:52.200 align:middle line:90%
Network, my old company.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:53.310 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:55.320 align:middle line:84%
So I want to read
another quote here.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.590 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go back in a
moment, because a lot of people

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:01.200 align:middle line:84%
have been thrown into fear
economically and otherwise.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:05.910 align:middle line:84%
But also, the whole subject
of, is this science safe?

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:08.100 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to have the
military come and vaccinate

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.450 align:middle line:90%
us all?

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:10.320 align:middle line:90%
Are they safe?

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.040 align:middle line:90%
And Operation Warp Speed is--

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.280 align:middle line:90%
that'll be passe soon.

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.770 align:middle line:84%
But the whole notion of
Operation Warp Speed,

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:19.290 align:middle line:84%
which is just throw some
stuff together in a bucket

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:20.940 align:middle line:90%
and call it a vaccine.

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:23.350 align:middle line:84%
People need to now
find their truth.

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:25.350 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to ask you
about this in a minute.

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And educate themselves
and listen to their bodies

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:31.710 align:middle line:84%
and what their body
has to say about

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:34.650 align:middle line:84%
whether they're going to buy
into this or not buy into this.

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:38.010 align:middle line:84%
It's an individual choice for
each person and their family.

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:41.640 align:middle line:84%
But as far as the disinformation
comment you made at the top,

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:46.290 align:middle line:84%
I want to read another comment
that was written to me.

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:47.850 align:middle line:84%
And I've told you
about Jack Barsky,

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:50.910 align:middle line:84%
and our audience knows I
interviewed him, a former KGB

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:52.080 align:middle line:90%
spy.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm intrigued with the
way his mind works,

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:57.270 align:middle line:84%
because he is accustomed
to looking behind things.

00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:00.060 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't see things
in a normal way

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:01.410 align:middle line:90%
that we do with attachments.

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:03.330 align:middle line:90%
It's all strategic, you know?

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:05.130 align:middle line:84%
Watching information,
disinformation.

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:07.920 align:middle line:84%
That was part of his
training and thinking.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what
is your perception

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:14.130 align:middle line:84%
watching all of this happening,
playing out, especially

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:17.640 align:middle line:84%
certain disinformation that I
consider disinformation sites,

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:19.680 align:middle line:90%
clearly and obviously to me?

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:23.460 align:middle line:84%
He said, "With regard to
disinformation, rumors,

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:26.610 align:middle line:84%
falsehoods, lies, with the
advent of the internet,

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:28.552 align:middle line:84%
we've lost the
battle for the truth.

00:12:28.552 --> 00:12:30.510 align:middle line:84%
This horse is out of the
barn, and you will not

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:32.340 align:middle line:90%
be able to get it back in.

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:35.250 align:middle line:84%
The sites you mention allow
smart, irresponsible mischief

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:37.170 align:middle line:90%
makers to do what they do best.

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:39.330 align:middle line:84%
The result is a
bizarre fantasy world

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.940 align:middle line:84%
which is a hybrid of "Harry
Potter," "Star Wars,"

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:44.100 align:middle line:90%
Minecraft, Godzilla, et cetera.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.290 align:middle line:84%
These are bright
people who are kept

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:49.350 align:middle line:90%
prisoners in a virtual reality.

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:51.870 align:middle line:84%
As this reality encroaches
on the real world,

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:56.872 align:middle line:84%
it has the potential of
creating phenomenal damage."

00:12:56.872 --> 00:12:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
what we're looking at.

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And I don't usually
go out on a limb,

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:03.470 align:middle line:84%
but I've been kind of outspoken
that I am not in alignment

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:06.800 align:middle line:84%
with any sites that are
anonymous by nature such as Q.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.320 align:middle line:84%
I do not trust anonymous,
because here you

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.270 align:middle line:84%
get some truthful
information, meaning

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:14.490 align:middle line:84%
there's intelligence involved
like intelligence community.

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:16.430 align:middle line:84%
Then you're getting
falsehoods, and you're

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:20.270 align:middle line:84%
getting a totally skewed
perception in the big picture.

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:22.070 align:middle line:84%
But they're giving
enough information

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:25.220 align:middle line:84%
to make a person kind of hang in
there like you're on the inside

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:26.540 align:middle line:90%
somehow.

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:30.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: I think on a
very deep, personal level,

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:33.200 align:middle line:84%
you can get caught
in a rabbit hole that

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:36.380 align:middle line:84%
will take you down
with it if you

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:41.810 align:middle line:90%
are going in these directions.

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:43.730 align:middle line:84%
Just like all the
information is going

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:45.680 align:middle line:84%
in all different
directions, it will take you

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:48.350 align:middle line:90%
in all different directions.

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:52.700 align:middle line:84%
Maybe what's important
here is to zoom out.

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:56.780 align:middle line:84%
To zoom out and take a much
broader picture of what

00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:59.570 align:middle line:90%
we as souls are doing here.

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:04.700 align:middle line:84%
Because we incarnated here
at this time on purpose,

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:06.020 align:middle line:90%
for a purpose.

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:08.900 align:middle line:84%
We have great reason
for being here.

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:16.220 align:middle line:84%
And you know, we may appear to
be x age here in this lifetime,

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:19.610 align:middle line:84%
but who we truly are
is this immortal soul.

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:23.330 align:middle line:84%
What is it that so appealed
to us about this time--

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:24.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To come here now.

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:26.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: At this time?

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And so whether it is dealing
with this intensity of what's

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:33.530 align:middle line:84%
going on right now or
the whole of our lives,

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:35.600 align:middle line:84%
there's something
that we're here

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.480 align:middle line:84%
to get from this
particular time frame.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And so if we zoom out,
the bigger question

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.230 align:middle line:84%
that we're wanting
to ask ourself

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:45.600 align:middle line:84%
is, what is our
soul interested in?

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.317 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: We are not
separate from everything

00:14:48.317 --> 00:14:49.940 align:middle line:90%
that's going on here.

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:54.920 align:middle line:84%
We are participants
in creating all of it.

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:57.320 align:middle line:90%
We create consciousness.

00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:00.560 align:middle line:84%
Even if we're just
an observation,

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:02.480 align:middle line:90%
we're still taking a role in it.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:07.340 align:middle line:84%
We're not ever passive
bystanders just somehow not

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:08.630 align:middle line:90%
involved at all.

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:10.580 align:middle line:90%
What we think matters.

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:12.800 align:middle line:90%
What we do matters.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:16.800 align:middle line:84%
What we let occupy
our thoughts matters.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:23.120 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, what is
it that my soul, my higher

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.205 align:middle line:84%
guidance finds
interesting about this?

00:15:26.205 --> 00:15:27.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.372 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't agree with you more.

00:15:28.372 --> 00:15:32.070 align:middle line:84%
Because this is a collectively
agreed upon experience

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:34.340 align:middle line:84%
as a group of souls
who've incarnated

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:36.230 align:middle line:90%
on Earth at this time.

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:39.050 align:middle line:84%
Because I mean,
I have repeatedly

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:41.420 align:middle line:84%
talked about the
beauty of this moment.

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:45.410 align:middle line:84%
What happens when you have
everything ground to a halt

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:49.888 align:middle line:84%
without having to have a
comet hit the planet, right?

00:15:49.888 --> 00:15:52.430 align:middle line:84%
People were in fear that a comet
was going to hit the planet.

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:53.720 align:middle line:90%
All these different things.

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:57.320 align:middle line:84%
What happens when it's
ground to a halt in a sense,

00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:00.890 align:middle line:84%
in a relatively-- and I don't
mean benign as an unimportant.

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:02.470 align:middle line:90%
A relatively benign way.

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And that it's not
the Black Plague.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:07.760 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's not taking
out half the population.

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.710 align:middle line:84%
But it's still
something to look at.

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And then when you look at all
the other elements behind it

00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:14.750 align:middle line:84%
that have to do with
deception, you've

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:16.860 align:middle line:84%
got that part of
the game as well.

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:18.750 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless,
wherever it came from,

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:21.560 align:middle line:84%
however it arrived here, and
whatever the effects are,

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:24.410 align:middle line:90%
it stopped everything.

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:27.500 align:middle line:84%
And maybe we've been
going on for lifetimes

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:32.750 align:middle line:84%
in patterned thinking,
patterned desires.

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And maybe now this
is stopping to break

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:36.620 align:middle line:84%
these patterns,
because everything

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:40.700 align:middle line:84%
has come to a stop for a
short, brief window of time

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:42.560 align:middle line:90%
to re-evaluate, to think.

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:44.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: There's good
and bad and bad and good.

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And what is it
that you're wanting

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:49.580 align:middle line:84%
to put your attention
on, your focus on?

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:53.650 align:middle line:84%
And your truth is something
that you get to choose.

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:56.030 align:middle line:84%
We need to be empowered
with that idea.

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:59.930 align:middle line:84%
It's not like truth is out
there and it's happening to us.

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:02.570 align:middle line:84%
Because as you said,
there can be truth found

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:04.460 align:middle line:90%
in every different perspective.

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:07.460 align:middle line:84%
So now what is it
that is your choice?

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And what is it as a soul you're
wanting to know the truth of?

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:12.230 align:middle line:90%
You see, we're creators.

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:13.280 align:middle line:90%
Creators of what?

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:15.390 align:middle line:90%
We're creators of experience.

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:16.190 align:middle line:90%
And why?

00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:18.500 align:middle line:84%
So that we can know
the truth of something.

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:21.020 align:middle line:90%
That's why we incarnate here.

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the
definition of experience,

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:27.230 align:middle line:84%
it is practical
knowledge derived

00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:29.040 align:middle line:90%
through direct participation.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:29.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:31.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: In other
words, you live it.

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:32.230 align:middle line:90%
You live it.

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:36.230 align:middle line:84%
So here we are, and we're
living a certain experience.

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:38.480 align:middle line:84%
What is it that we're
wanting to know the truth of?

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:42.470 align:middle line:84%
And so you get these people
that are exploring QAnon.

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:45.588 align:middle line:84%
You get people that
are exploring--

00:17:45.588 --> 00:17:47.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's serving
something for each person.

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:49.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: For each person.

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:52.700 align:middle line:84%
And they are finding
out something

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:55.730 align:middle line:84%
about that that is
of interest to them.

00:17:55.730 --> 00:18:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And they may decide that that is
their truth or they may decide

00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:02.030 align:middle line:90%
it isn't.

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And the point of it is that
all of us get to decide that.

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:09.230 align:middle line:84%
If you feel victimized
by what's going on,

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:13.070 align:middle line:84%
if you feel diminished,
if you feel disempowered,

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:15.840 align:middle line:84%
then you're forgetting
who you really are,

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.500 align:middle line:84%
and that you've actually
made a choice to be here

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:21.680 align:middle line:90%
and to be participating in this.

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And get back into your power
where you say, wait a minute.

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:28.940 align:middle line:90%
What viewpoint do I want?

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:33.110 align:middle line:84%
A gentleman was telling me
how this time has given him

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:35.510 align:middle line:84%
the opportunity to
get to know his kids--

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:36.385 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:18:36.385 --> 00:18:39.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: --that he never
would have had otherwise.

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:42.030 align:middle line:84%
He's eating breakfast,
lunch, and dinner with them.

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:43.620 align:middle line:90%
He's playing with them.

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:45.390 align:middle line:90%
He's learning with them.

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And he wakes up every morning
grateful for this time.

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:50.550 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, how beautiful.

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:51.350 align:middle line:90%
How beautiful.

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:52.808 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
millions and millions

00:18:52.808 --> 00:18:56.250 align:middle line:84%
of people around the world,
if not billions are actually

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:57.730 align:middle line:90%
experiencing this now.

00:18:57.730 --> 00:19:00.480 align:middle line:84%
So what is it we had
forgotten in ourselves

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:03.480 align:middle line:84%
that made everything have
to come to a grinding halt?

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And there's another
element of this too,

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:09.390 align:middle line:84%
and this is the whole notion
throughout our history

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:10.940 align:middle line:90%
that there are saviors.

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:11.760 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:14.780 align:middle line:84%
That you've got white
hats in the more new age,

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:18.060 align:middle line:84%
you know, conspiratorial
commentary.

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:20.580 align:middle line:90%
White hats and black hats.

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:23.640 align:middle line:84%
The reality is we're
complex beings.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.020 align:middle line:90%
These are complex agendas.

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:26.700 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's running
their own agendas

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:29.700 align:middle line:84%
for their own reasons,
which is kind of interesting

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:30.870 align:middle line:90%
in and of itself.

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:34.470 align:middle line:84%
But I have been saying recently,
there are no white hats.

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:35.880 align:middle line:90%
We are the white hats.

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:38.160 align:middle line:90%
Our truth is the white hat.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:41.740 align:middle line:84%
Our connection with one another
and our caring for one another.

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:43.710 align:middle line:84%
If you want to put a
white hat on anything,

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:47.250 align:middle line:84%
put a white hat on
cooperation and truth

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:50.550 align:middle line:84%
and kindness and
caring and compassion.

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:53.920 align:middle line:84%
There isn't anything
that's going to save us.

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:57.510 align:middle line:84%
We now have to find our truth
and do it for ourselves.

00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:00.450 align:middle line:84%
And maybe we've had a
pattern for millennia

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:02.460 align:middle line:90%
of looking to whatever it is.

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:05.100 align:middle line:84%
Churches, governments,
institutions as our white hats,

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:06.750 align:middle line:90%
and it's over.

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:10.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: And that's when we
empower ourselves and remember

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:13.110 align:middle line:84%
who we truly are and
remember we have choice.

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:14.340 align:middle line:90%
We always have choice.

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:15.720 align:middle line:90%
We are not victims in this.

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:16.887 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We're not victims.

00:20:16.887 --> 00:20:18.000 align:middle line:90%
I agree with you in that.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.048 align:middle line:84%
Even though some people
have lost their lives.

00:20:20.048 --> 00:20:22.340 align:middle line:84%
People are going to-- we're
all going to lose our life.

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And I don't say that
blithely, but we are all

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:25.770 align:middle line:90%
going to lose our lives.

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:27.187 align:middle line:84%
And maybe we're
learning something

00:20:27.187 --> 00:20:31.500 align:middle line:84%
about the patterns of people
who are losing their lives.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.390 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's some
knowledge coming out

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:36.150 align:middle line:84%
of that that can help serve
us in terms of taking back

00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:37.710 align:middle line:84%
our own immune
systems in the future,

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:41.730 align:middle line:84%
because that's important
no matter what, right?

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:42.840 align:middle line:90%
And you work in this area.

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:44.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: I sure do.

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And boy, oh boy do
I ever hope that

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.970 align:middle line:90%
is an end result from all this.

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:49.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I hope so too.

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:49.970 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:52.700 align:middle line:84%
So where we sit right now,
pandemonium, confusion.

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:54.210 align:middle line:84%
We've kind of gone
over that one.

00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:55.870 align:middle line:90%
Agenda, so forth.

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:57.507 align:middle line:84%
But here we are
as people, and we

00:20:57.507 --> 00:20:59.340 align:middle line:84%
have to figure out this
story for ourselves.

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:03.620 align:middle line:84%
So now you're also a
naturopathic health coach.

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:05.370 align:middle line:84%
And so you have a lot
of different clients

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:06.203 align:middle line:90%
you're working with.

00:21:06.203 --> 00:21:08.910 align:middle line:84%
Now let's say I'm a
client who comes in

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:11.010 align:middle line:90%
with this one specific issue.

00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:14.710 align:middle line:84%
Oh my god, do I have to have a
vaccine so that I'll be safe,

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:15.510 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:17.135 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not getting
political about it.

00:21:17.135 --> 00:21:20.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying, how would you begin
unwinding this for yourself

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.000 align:middle line:90%
on a level of truth?

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.873 align:middle line:84%
What kind of questions would
you begin asking of a client?

00:21:24.873 --> 00:21:26.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Mm, that's a
really great question.

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:29.580 align:middle line:90%


00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:35.460 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies can inform us of our
own truth and the information

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:36.690 align:middle line:90%
that we need.

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:39.300 align:middle line:84%
So whatever's going
on around you,

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:42.240 align:middle line:84%
start paying attention
to how your own body is

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:46.800 align:middle line:84%
taking this information in
and how you're processing it.

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.150 align:middle line:90%
Food is information, right?

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And we know how food
affects our bodies.

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:53.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, look at all the
information around us.

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:55.643 align:middle line:90%
We take it in the same way.

00:21:55.643 --> 00:21:57.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are we
being encouraged?

00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:58.170 align:middle line:90%
Are we being enlightened?

00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:00.430 align:middle line:84%
Are we being repressed
and depressed?

00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:01.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah.

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:01.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And all this
information coming in,

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:05.940 align:middle line:84%
if you pay attention to how
it's affecting your body,

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:09.210 align:middle line:84%
you can kind of tell
where it's being held

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:11.130 align:middle line:90%
and what's being affected.

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:14.370 align:middle line:84%
I personally had this
experience here recently

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:17.190 align:middle line:84%
where I was doing
a lot of research

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:19.740 align:middle line:84%
into some areas that were
really toxic, actually.

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:21.410 align:middle line:90%
Some toxic information.

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:23.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, what organ in the
body deals with toxins?

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:24.930 align:middle line:90%
The liver.

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And so what I noticed is I
was feeling very sluggish

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:34.290 align:middle line:90%
and fatigued and heavy.

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:37.260 align:middle line:84%
And those are all
symptoms of the liver.

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:39.300 align:middle line:84%
What I started doing
then is supporting

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:43.110 align:middle line:84%
my liver on the physical level
by taking liver cleansing

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:45.420 align:middle line:90%
herbs and some B vitamins.

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:48.567 align:middle line:84%
And within a day, my
energy shot back up.

00:22:48.567 --> 00:22:49.650 align:middle line:90%
So let's just talk about--

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:50.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:50.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah.

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:52.233 align:middle line:84%
Let's just talk about
the organs here.

00:22:52.233 --> 00:22:55.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Using your body as
a divination device right now.

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:55.830 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:58.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: So let me just run
through this really quick,

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:01.200 align:middle line:84%
because if we use
food as an analogy,

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.900 align:middle line:84%
I think it's going to be
very obvious to people

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:07.890 align:middle line:84%
how this information
is affecting them.

00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:10.110 align:middle line:84%
So when we take in
food, the first thing it

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:11.670 align:middle line:90%
goes is to the stomach, right?

00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:14.730 align:middle line:84%
And so if you find that you're
taking in information that you

00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:18.420 align:middle line:84%
cannot stomach, it makes
you sick to your stomach,

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:19.220 align:middle line:90%
support your--

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:20.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Nausea
weighting over you.

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:20.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Nausea.

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:22.050 align:middle line:90%
Oh my gosh.

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:25.350 align:middle line:84%
Take nutrients that
will support that.

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:30.270 align:middle line:84%
Maybe some digestive enzymes
or some calming herbs.

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:34.110 align:middle line:84%
Because you know, you cannot
run away from all this.

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:37.470 align:middle line:84%
This is part of mass
consciousness right now,

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:40.212 align:middle line:84%
and you're not going to be
able to run away from it.

00:23:40.212 --> 00:23:42.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, we're bathing
in a quantum field of it.

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:43.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah.

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:45.710 align:middle line:84%
So you might as well be able
to support your physical body

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:46.940 align:middle line:90%
as you're bathing in it.

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:47.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Excellent point.

00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:48.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: OK.

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:51.110 align:middle line:84%
So next, it goes to
the small intestine.

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:53.000 align:middle line:84%
What does the small
intestine do with food?

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.720 align:middle line:84%
It sorts through the nutrients
and says, I can use this,

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:57.890 align:middle line:90%
but I can't use that.

00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:00.058 align:middle line:84%
I can use this, but
I can't use that.

00:24:00.058 --> 00:24:02.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's the same thing we're
going to do with information.

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And if you find yourself
where you're just

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:06.500 align:middle line:90%
completely overwhelmed--

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:07.583 align:middle line:90%
I can't sort through this.

00:24:07.583 --> 00:24:10.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what's true and
I don't know what isn't true.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.105 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what I can
use and what I can't use.

00:24:12.105 --> 00:24:14.480 align:middle line:84%
Then you're going to want to
support your small intestine

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:17.030 align:middle line:84%
by taking herbs that
support that, and maybe even

00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:18.110 align:middle line:90%
probiotics.

00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:19.630 align:middle line:90%
That would be very helpful.

00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:21.140 align:middle line:90%
And prebiotics.

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And then you get into
the large intestine.

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:24.740 align:middle line:84%
The large intestine's
all about, what

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:26.020 align:middle line:90%
do I need to let go of, right?

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:26.330 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:26.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:27.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:28.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: I'm done with this.

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:28.960 align:middle line:90%
This is garbage.

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:30.285 align:middle line:90%
Let's get this out.

00:24:30.285 --> 00:24:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And we need to be
able to discern that.

00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And if you find that
your bowels are affected

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:38.630 align:middle line:84%
and you're either letting go
too soon or you're constipated

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:42.830 align:middle line:84%
and holding on, support
that, because information

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:45.470 align:middle line:84%
is affecting you in
the intestinal area.

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:46.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.775 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Next we go to the
liver like what I explained.

00:24:48.775 --> 00:24:51.650 align:middle line:84%
Now another thing about
the liver besides detoxing

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:54.080 align:middle line:90%
is the liver makes decisions.

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:55.740 align:middle line:90%
It's the one that says, OK.

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:57.660 align:middle line:84%
I've gotten all the
information I need,

00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:59.930 align:middle line:84%
and now I know what
to do, and now I

00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:01.140 align:middle line:90%
know how to make a choice.

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And if you find that you're
just waffling back and forth

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:05.578 align:middle line:90%
and you don't know what to do--

00:25:05.578 --> 00:25:07.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, because
I had talked to you

00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:09.650 align:middle line:84%
a couple months ago on a
private level and you said,

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:12.010 align:middle line:84%
I just don't even know
what to believe anymore.

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:13.580 align:middle line:84%
Just were throwing
your hands up in--

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:15.626 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: My liver
was so out of balance.

00:25:15.626 --> 00:25:16.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:16.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:17.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
that's where you were,

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:20.000 align:middle line:84%
and that's how you made this
discovery, which I think

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.170 align:middle line:90%
all of this is so brilliant.

00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:21.970 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:23.345 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: So we
go to the liver.

00:25:23.345 --> 00:25:24.530 align:middle line:90%
Next, we go to the pancreas.

00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:28.010 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are being
affected in their pancreas

00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:29.270 align:middle line:90%
by what's going on.

00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:32.240 align:middle line:84%
Pancreas is about self-esteem
and about the sweet things

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:33.180 align:middle line:90%
in life.

00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:35.780 align:middle line:84%
And so what they're finding is
they're just craving desserts

00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:36.680 align:middle line:90%
like crazy.

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:37.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh my god.

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:40.250 align:middle line:84%
You know, all these sites
like King Arthur Flour,

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:43.730 align:middle line:84%
they're sold out of more
than half their products.

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:46.550 align:middle line:84%
Anything that has to do with
carbohydrates, everything

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:48.240 align:middle line:90%
seems to be in short supply now.

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:51.297 align:middle line:84%
Flours, basic
yeast, basic stuff.

00:25:51.297 --> 00:25:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying to
get the sweetness back.

00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:55.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: We want
the sweetness of life.

00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And so what you're
going to want to do

00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:59.990 align:middle line:90%
is support that by finding--

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:02.640 align:middle line:84%
being with your
friends, laughing.

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:03.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:05.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Doing things that
are the sweetness of life,

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:07.730 align:middle line:90%
and looking for beauty.

00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:11.943 align:middle line:84%
If you had been one
that posted something,

00:26:11.943 --> 00:26:13.360 align:middle line:84%
had the courage
to post something,

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:16.040 align:middle line:84%
then got blasted
for it, that's going

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:21.080 align:middle line:84%
to go right to your pancreas
and affect your self-esteem.

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And so support that
by doing something

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:26.060 align:middle line:84%
on the flipside of that
that's very beautiful

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:29.270 align:middle line:84%
and brings sweetness
of life and gentleness.

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:30.270 align:middle line:90%
Your spleen.

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:32.320 align:middle line:90%
What an interesting organ.

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:39.950 align:middle line:84%
The spleen is about
feeling overly sympathetic.

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:45.140 align:middle line:84%
Now empaths and caretakers
are extremely affected

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:48.865 align:middle line:84%
by their spleen energy, and
it's usually out of balance.

00:26:48.865 --> 00:26:50.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How does that
express itself in the body?

00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:51.907 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Oh my gosh.

00:26:51.907 --> 00:26:56.510 align:middle line:84%
What they tend to do is they
tend to take their spleen chi

00:26:56.510 --> 00:27:00.410 align:middle line:84%
and take it out and say, I
feel so sorry for these people.

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:02.420 align:middle line:84%
Let me bring that
energy in and try

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:05.750 align:middle line:84%
to fix it, which totally
overwhelms their own system

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:07.850 align:middle line:90%
and exhausts them.

00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:10.910 align:middle line:84%
I had a client one time
that her spleen energy

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:12.470 align:middle line:90%
was off the charts.

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:14.820 align:middle line:90%
It was so overstimulated.

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:18.455 align:middle line:84%
And I said, are you
really concerned

00:27:18.455 --> 00:27:20.510 align:middle line:90%
and worry about people?

00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:22.490 align:middle line:90%
And she says, oh my god.

00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:28.130 align:middle line:84%
Every night I go to bed and
I pray to god, please give me

00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:31.640 align:middle line:84%
the strength to help my
daughter and to help my family

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:34.730 align:middle line:84%
and to help heal this person
and help heal that person.

00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:40.700 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at her and I said,
get yourself out of that role.

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:43.100 align:middle line:90%
God can handle that himself.

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:44.580 align:middle line:90%
You don't need to be doing that.

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:45.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:45.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:47.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: And so
just ask God to do it.

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And the next time she came
in, it was unbelievable,

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:53.180 align:middle line:90%
the difference in her.

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:55.430 align:middle line:84%
Just simply knowing
that, that you

00:27:55.430 --> 00:28:00.070 align:middle line:84%
don't have to use your
own power to help,

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:03.650 align:middle line:84%
it can be from
healthy boundaries.

00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:05.595 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:28:05.595 --> 00:28:06.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: All right.

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:08.580 align:middle line:90%
Then we come up to the lungs.

00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:10.430 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:15.890 align:middle line:10%
Lungs hold grief is a big
one that the lungs will hold,

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:18.170 align:middle line:10%
but also it's about
your ability to take

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:21.480 align:middle line:10%
in a deep breath of life.

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:22.280 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And if you are holding
back and feeling like,

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:29.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm now afraid of life
and I can only breathe--

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:30.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Fear is
really big when

00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:32.650 align:middle line:84%
it comes to something
like a pandemic,

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:36.380 align:middle line:84%
and the lungs in a lot of the
people are being affected.

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:39.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: I'm scared to
take a deep breath of life.

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:41.520 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if I can trust it.

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And so the lungs
become affected.

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:47.730 align:middle line:84%
So take things that will
affect and heal the lungs

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:50.100 align:middle line:84%
and support the lungs
on a physical level,

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:52.960 align:middle line:84%
but also meditate and
think about, wait a minute.

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:54.510 align:middle line:90%
Can I trust life?

00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:56.880 align:middle line:84%
A very interesting study
that I read one time

00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:00.060 align:middle line:90%
is about how people heal.

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that is a determinant

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:06.870 align:middle line:84%
is, do they consider god, the
universe, and life benevolent,

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:10.110 align:middle line:84%
or is it waiting to judge
you and condemn you?

00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:12.990 align:middle line:84%
The difference of that
makes all the difference

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:13.948 align:middle line:90%
in our ability to heal.

00:29:13.948 --> 00:29:14.823 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:29:14.823 --> 00:29:16.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: It's,
can we trust life?

00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:19.320 align:middle line:90%
Can we take a deep breath of it?

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:21.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And one of the
things that has gone around

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:25.710 align:middle line:84%
in terms of information that
no one seems to disagree with

00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:29.640 align:middle line:84%
is the power of using deep
breathing exercises if one even

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:30.440 align:middle line:90%
becomes ill.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:31.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yes.

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:32.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And how
that can actually

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:35.280 align:middle line:84%
start correcting the
lung condition, where

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:38.130 align:middle line:84%
putting someone on a ventilator
with cement in their lungs

00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:39.150 align:middle line:90%
is not helping.

00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:40.890 align:middle line:84%
That does not appear
to be helping.

00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:44.070 align:middle line:84%
But to do deep breathing to
the best of one's ability,

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:45.420 align:middle line:90%
but look what that does.

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:47.850 align:middle line:84%
We use deep breathing
to stop everything,

00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:52.380 align:middle line:84%
to let our entire being
inhale, exhale, and relax.

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:55.170 align:middle line:84%
It's also our connection
with our higher self.

00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:58.110 align:middle line:84%
So this has a kind of a
multidimensional effect

00:29:58.110 --> 00:30:01.650 align:middle line:84%
when we take time, as you say,
to take a deep breath of life.

00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:03.310 align:middle line:90%
Consciously deep breathe.

00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:04.110 align:middle line:90%
Hold it in.

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:05.922 align:middle line:90%
Use whatever method you want.

00:30:05.922 --> 00:30:07.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: And
realize, oh my gosh.

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:08.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm still alive.

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:09.260 align:middle line:90%
I can trust.

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:09.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:10.250 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:11.490 align:middle line:90%
And you notice fear.

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:15.833 align:middle line:84%
You can't do deep breathing
and hold fear at the same time.

00:30:15.833 --> 00:30:17.250 align:middle line:84%
So that fear you're
talking about,

00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:20.730 align:middle line:84%
about lungs and people
fearing for their lungs

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:24.070 align:middle line:84%
and their health and so
forth, it all goes together.

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:25.560 align:middle line:90%
It's multidimensional in nature.

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:26.070 align:middle line:90%
So go ahead.

00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:26.970 align:middle line:90%
We've got more organs.

00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:28.345 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: We've
got more organs.

00:30:28.345 --> 00:30:29.850 align:middle line:90%
So then we come to the kidneys.

00:30:29.850 --> 00:30:32.620 align:middle line:90%
Kidneys, fascinating.

00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:35.580 align:middle line:84%
Kidneys in Chinese
philosophy is your reservoir

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:36.970 align:middle line:90%
of life force energy.

00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:38.753 align:middle line:84%
It's like you're born
with this reservoir.

00:30:38.753 --> 00:30:40.170 align:middle line:84%
And as you go
through life, you're

00:30:40.170 --> 00:30:41.960 align:middle line:84%
continuing to use
your reservoir,

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:44.740 align:middle line:84%
and you get to the end of your
life, your reservoir is empty.

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:45.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your kidneys
aren't working well.

00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:45.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah.

00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:46.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:47.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: And that's the
most common cause of death

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:48.615 align:middle line:90%
on a death certificate.

00:30:48.615 --> 00:30:50.532 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, because
you're dehydrated when

00:30:50.532 --> 00:30:51.750 align:middle line:90%
you're old and ready to go.

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:53.520 align:middle line:84%
You're not even
taking fluids in.

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:54.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Right.

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:56.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, when the kidneys
get out of balance,

00:30:56.370 --> 00:30:58.470 align:middle line:84%
one of the things that
you can see is paranoia.

00:30:58.470 --> 00:30:59.430 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:00.513 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:31:00.513 --> 00:31:01.377 align:middle line:90%
And that is rife.

00:31:01.377 --> 00:31:02.460 align:middle line:90%
The planet's rife with it.

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:04.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: It goes
into paranoia.

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:07.843 align:middle line:90%
Oh, in a way that is--

00:31:07.843 --> 00:31:08.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fascinating.

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:09.420 align:middle line:90%
That's fascinating.

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:10.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah.

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:12.380 align:middle line:84%
In a way that anybody
listening to a person says,

00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:13.820 align:middle line:90%
are you a little bit off?

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:16.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, we have all
kinds of that going on.

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:16.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah.

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:17.170 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:17.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:19.050 align:middle line:90%
Bladder.

00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:21.075 align:middle line:84%
If you feel pissed
off and irritable--

00:31:21.075 --> 00:31:23.190 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:24.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Having an
irritable bladder.

00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:25.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:25.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah.

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:26.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's your bladder.

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.590 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll finally
get to your heart.

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:30.630 align:middle line:90%
And the heart is the emperor.

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:33.450 align:middle line:84%
The emperor is asking,
how are you circulating

00:31:33.450 --> 00:31:37.740 align:middle line:84%
all this information and
recognizing and empowering

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:39.240 align:middle line:90%
yourself with choice?

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.290 align:middle line:90%
What are your choices?

00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:41.730 align:middle line:90%
How are you choosing?

00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:46.260 align:middle line:84%
Are you choosing
to stay and love?

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:48.355 align:middle line:84%
Are you choosing
to come from fear?

00:31:48.355 --> 00:31:50.490 align:middle line:90%
What is your choice?

00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:52.890 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, that
comes from your heart,

00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:54.690 align:middle line:84%
because your heart
decides, where is all

00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:56.790 align:middle line:90%
this going to be circulating?

00:31:56.790 --> 00:32:03.030 align:middle line:84%
So if you can pay attention
to those symptoms,

00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:06.090 align:middle line:84%
you can see where this
bombardment of information

00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:09.930 align:middle line:84%
is affecting you and what you
need to support in the body.

00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:13.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Jean, that's
absolutely beautiful and wise,

00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:15.540 align:middle line:90%
and also very useful.

00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:19.230 align:middle line:84%
I think most people hearing you
can understand the truth in it.

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:21.720 align:middle line:84%
But also, you can
immediately, as soon

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.370 align:middle line:84%
as everybody's
done watching this,

00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:25.890 align:middle line:84%
can stop and say,
where have I been

00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:29.250 align:middle line:90%
experiencing this in my body?

00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:33.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you were having
the liver impacted.

00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And I'm seeing here,
I would wake up

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:38.840 align:middle line:84%
and I would be overwhelmed
kind of with the field--

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:39.960 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't even a thought.

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:41.910 align:middle line:84%
It was just kind of
literally feeling

00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:44.100 align:middle line:84%
like in that vulnerable
time, in the wee

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:47.220 align:middle line:84%
hours when the veils are thin
you where you're connecting

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:50.340 align:middle line:84%
into the quantum field of
information and energy,

00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:53.880 align:middle line:84%
I would just find kind of
waves of nausea going over me,

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:59.350 align:middle line:84%
thinking, I don't have nausea
in the middle of the night ever.

00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:01.488 align:middle line:84%
So in your language,
what is that expressing.

00:33:01.488 --> 00:33:02.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: That's your stomach.

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:04.560 align:middle line:90%
I can't stomach this.

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:05.730 align:middle line:90%
I can't digest it.

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:06.780 align:middle line:90%
I can't take it in.

00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:08.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm sensitive to all this.

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:08.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:33:08.910 --> 00:33:10.410 align:middle line:84%
Because it didn't
even have content.

00:33:10.410 --> 00:33:12.940 align:middle line:84%
It's just the
energy itself even.

00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:13.740 align:middle line:90%
And that's helpful.

00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:14.540 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

about these compulsive

00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:08.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Well, you know
that we have subtle bodies.

00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:12.620 align:middle line:84%
So think of that like
octaves on a piano.

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:17.130 align:middle line:84%
The octaves have the same notes,
but you have the lower octave,

00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:19.340 align:middle line:84%
then the next octave
up, the next octave up.

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:21.980 align:middle line:84%
Same notes, but a
higher frequency.

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:23.810 align:middle line:84%
The same is with
our subtle bodies.

00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:26.930 align:middle line:84%
We have our physical body,
which is the lowest octave.

00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:29.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's because it's
so low we actually

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:31.160 align:middle line:90%
have a physical appearance.

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:34.850 align:middle line:84%
But then from that
comes the etheric body,

00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:38.930 align:middle line:84%
the emotional body, the mental
body, and the spiritual body.

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:43.640 align:middle line:84%
So then the question
becomes, where is the injury?

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:46.363 align:middle line:90%
Where is the-- where we would--

00:35:46.363 --> 00:35:48.530 align:middle line:84%

>>SLATTER: Yes, yes.

00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:53.990 align:middle line:84%
So on the physical level, you
deal with physical things.

00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:56.030 align:middle line:84%
Everything affects
everything, of course.

00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:59.810 align:middle line:84%
But the closer that you can
get to where it's originating,

00:35:59.810 --> 00:36:03.020 align:middle line:84%
the more direct
healing you can have.

00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:04.917 align:middle line:84%
So the lowest octave,
the physical octave,

00:36:04.917 --> 00:36:06.500 align:middle line:84%
you want to deal
with physical things.

00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:09.980 align:middle line:84%
The next body up, the
etheric body, that frequency

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:13.010 align:middle line:90%
is matched by homeopathics.

The next frequency up,
the emotional body,

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:18.470 align:middle line:84%
the match of frequency for
that is flower essences.

00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:20.218 align:middle line:84%

But they all specifically
deal with emotional issues.

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:40.640 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a cut
in the emotional field,

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:43.910 align:middle line:84%
deal with it there with
an emotional remedy,

00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:48.710 align:middle line:84%
because taking a physical remedy
for that is a long way around.

00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:57.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Lying in the
sand or in the grass

00:39:57.450 --> 00:39:59.770 align:middle line:84%
and letting the
Earth support you

00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:01.720 align:middle line:90%
from underneath and the sun.

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:03.010 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:40:03.010 --> 00:40:05.180 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, that's my
little piece of it.

00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:08.230 align:middle line:84%
So what I want to do is I want
to start talking about some

00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:11.110 align:middle line:84%
of the divination-type
of techniques

00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:13.100 align:middle line:84%
that anybody can do
anytime, anywhere.

00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:14.490 align:middle line:90%
You don't need anything.

00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:15.300 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:17.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: OK.

00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:20.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we can ascertain,
what level am I freaked out on?

00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:21.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Right.

00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:25.390 align:middle line:84%
So I want to make
sure that I don't

00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:30.040 align:middle line:84%
get people running
with this information

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:31.670 align:middle line:90%
and then get discouraged and--

00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:34.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to talk
about the loopholes in it, OK?

00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:35.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah, the loopholes.

00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:35.590 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:38.200 align:middle line:84%
So if we're going to talk about
the loopholes, let's do that.

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:40.240 align:middle line:84%
I'll show you first
some techniques,

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:44.740 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll-- let's get into
some of the understandings you

00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:45.578 align:middle line:90%
have to have about--

00:40:45.578 --> 00:40:46.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To do it effectively.

00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:47.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah.

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:47.950 align:middle line:90%
To do it effectively.

00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:48.760 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:51.540 align:middle line:84%
So you know that pendulum
dowsing is my go-to.

00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:54.370 align:middle line:84%
Pendulum dowsing and Tarot
cards and divination.

00:40:54.370 --> 00:40:59.070 align:middle line:84%
But understand that
when you are beginning,

00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:01.733 align:middle line:84%
it's a relationship that you're
building with your higher--

00:41:01.733 --> 00:41:02.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Higher self.

00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:02.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:03.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah.

00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:04.180 align:middle line:90%
It's a relationship.

00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:07.610 align:middle line:84%
And some people have the
gift, as I know you do,

00:41:07.610 --> 00:41:10.810 align:middle line:84%
and it was just right there
for you and available to you.

00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And others like myself, it
was a skill I had to develop.

00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:17.320 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't like
playing the piano.

00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:20.470 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't sit down and play
Mozart after just five lessons.

00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:21.270 align:middle line:90%
No way.

00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:22.070 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And don't expect yourself
to be able to do that.

00:41:24.450 --> 00:41:26.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:30.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: So in the
beginning, be very gentle

00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:35.920 align:middle line:84%
with your confidence, and
don't ask these questions

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:41.830 align:middle line:84%
that are so black and white
and that your life is depending

00:41:41.830 --> 00:41:42.630 align:middle line:90%
on it.

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:45.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You don't want
emotional baggage-laded

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:45.400 align:middle line:90%
questions.

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:45.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Right.

00:41:45.850 --> 00:41:46.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:47.888 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: So some of
the things that you

00:41:47.888 --> 00:41:51.100 align:middle line:84%
can do without a pendulum,
without divination tools,

00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:53.620 align:middle line:84%
is getting in touch
with how your body feels

00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:54.543 align:middle line:90%
about something.

00:41:54.543 --> 00:41:55.960 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that people seem

00:41:55.960 --> 00:42:00.010 align:middle line:84%
to gravitate to really
easily and be able to feel,

00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:04.120 align:middle line:84%
have a visceral reaction
to it is body dowsing.

00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:07.390 align:middle line:84%
And this is where you can take
a supplement, for example,

00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:09.440 align:middle line:84%
and say, is this
supplement good for me?

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:12.790 align:middle line:84%
Hold it right next to
your heart right here

00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:16.150 align:middle line:84%
and close your eyes while you're
standing, and just feel, are

00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:19.660 align:middle line:84%
you gravitating towards
it, saying, I want that?

00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:22.637 align:middle line:90%
Or are you being repelled by it?

00:42:22.637 --> 00:42:23.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Quick tip.

00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:24.430 align:middle line:90%
Don't wear heels.

00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:25.340 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:27.100 align:middle line:90%
You don't go backward right.

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:28.270 align:middle line:90%
You want to be flat-footed.

00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:28.768 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: OK.

00:42:28.768 --> 00:42:29.568 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:29.568 --> 00:42:30.760 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:32.320 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
easy to do when

00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:34.840 align:middle line:84%
you're in the grocery store,
when you're in the health food

00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:35.640 align:middle line:90%
store.

00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:36.700 align:middle line:90%
Is this something I need?

00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:38.020 align:middle line:90%
Take it off the shelf.

00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:39.160 align:middle line:90%
Hold it right here.

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:40.910 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel yourself
being pulled forward?

00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:43.840 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel yourself
being repelled?

00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:46.480 align:middle line:84%
You can get down to,
how many do you need?

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:48.490 align:middle line:84%
Let's say your body
goes, oh my gosh.

00:42:48.490 --> 00:42:49.750 align:middle line:90%
I love this.

00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:50.950 align:middle line:90%
Then you can ask, OK.

00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:52.820 align:middle line:84%
How many times a
day do I need it?

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:53.620 align:middle line:90%
One time?

00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:54.700 align:middle line:90%
And you still get a yes.

00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:55.420 align:middle line:90%
Two times?

00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:56.050 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:42:56.050 --> 00:42:56.850 align:middle line:90%
Three times?

00:42:56.850 --> 00:42:57.920 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:02.120 align:middle line:84%
So you can get yes and no's and
get more specific information.

00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's really
good to start that way

00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:05.662 align:middle line:84%
with something like
that, because you

00:43:05.662 --> 00:43:07.510 align:middle line:84%
don't have an emotional
charge around it,

00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:10.180 align:middle line:84%
so you're not carrying
that weighted belief

00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:11.630 align:middle line:90%
system in with you.

00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:14.080 align:middle line:84%
So this is a really good way
to start building confidence.

00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:14.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Right.

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:15.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:16.975 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: And the other
fun thing you can do

00:43:16.975 --> 00:43:19.360 align:middle line:84%
is do it without looking
at what the supplement is.

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:20.237 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:20.237 --> 00:43:22.320 align:middle line:84%
You know, you have that
book, the Dale Olson book.

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:22.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yes, I do.

00:43:22.930 --> 00:43:24.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which I
just love, you know?

00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:26.710 align:middle line:84%
It's great when you need to
kind of get down to something.

00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:29.740 align:middle line:84%
And the way I do it, if I decide
I want to dowse for something

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:33.430 align:middle line:84%
specific, is I close my eyes
or I look the other way,

00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:35.000 align:middle line:90%
and I'll use a pendulum.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:35.140 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And I'll just sit
like this and just

00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:39.360 align:middle line:84%
let it go until it seems
to settle in a pattern

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:40.350 align:middle line:90%
and look back.

00:43:40.350 --> 00:43:41.280 align:middle line:90%
And then I look.

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing how
accurate it can be.

00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:46.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, kind of
shockingly so at times.

00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:46.505 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:43:46.505 --> 00:43:48.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: And at times you
even want to argue with it.

00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:50.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you want
to, but there's no point.

00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:51.390 align:middle line:90%
But I mean, I agree with you.

00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:53.790 align:middle line:84%
Don't let your mind become
involved, because you already

00:43:53.790 --> 00:43:54.630 align:middle line:90%
have perceptions.

00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:54.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Right.

00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:55.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:56.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Another
thing that you can do

00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:58.260 align:middle line:90%
is what I call finger dowsing.

00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:02.550 align:middle line:84%
Now one of the things that you
see a lot of other people do

00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:04.890 align:middle line:90%
is this O ring thing.

00:44:04.890 --> 00:44:07.500 align:middle line:84%
The reason I don't like that
is it requires two hands,

00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:09.640 align:middle line:90%
but I'll explain how to do it.

00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:14.400 align:middle line:84%
A strong, a yes is where you
can't pull your fingers apart,

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:16.690 align:middle line:84%
and a no is when
it slips through.

00:44:16.690 --> 00:44:20.880 align:middle line:84%
And when you're first starting
any kind of dowsing technique

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:22.470 align:middle line:84%
like this, you have
to realize, you

00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:24.888 align:middle line:84%
have to train your
body to do this, OK?

00:44:24.888 --> 00:44:26.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Otherwise, if
you're holding too tight,

00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:28.950 align:middle line:84%
you're never going to--
it'll never give way.

00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:29.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: It's
like, do you expect

00:44:29.610 --> 00:44:31.650 align:middle line:84%
to just sit down at the piano
and let your fingers just

00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:32.010 align:middle line:90%
do it?

00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:32.885 align:middle line:90%
They're not going to.

00:44:32.885 --> 00:44:34.350 align:middle line:90%
You have to train your fingers.

00:44:34.350 --> 00:44:36.600 align:middle line:84%
In the same way, you
have to tell the body,

00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:38.580 align:middle line:84%
this is what I want
to see for a yes.

00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:40.660 align:middle line:84%
This is what I want
to see for a no.

00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:41.460 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:45.660 align:middle line:84%
And train the body, and get
it to where it feels like, OK.

00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:48.630 align:middle line:84%
That feels so natural
to me now that it's

00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:49.980 align:middle line:90%
on a subconscious level.

00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:53.730 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, then you can
start asking your questions.

00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:55.230 align:middle line:84%
But the reason I
don't like this one

00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:57.240 align:middle line:84%
is because it takes
two hands to do it.

00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:00.030 align:middle line:84%
My preferred way
is finger dowsing

00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:03.780 align:middle line:84%
where you put one finger on
top of the other like this.

00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And when it's a
yes, it's strong.

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:07.050 align:middle line:90%
It holds like this.

00:45:07.050 --> 00:45:09.210 align:middle line:90%
When it's a no, it slips off.

00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:11.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know, that's
the one I've never tried.

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:13.150 align:middle line:84%
I've never tried finger
dowsing that way.

00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:15.192 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to just
get a basic yes or no, you

00:45:15.192 --> 00:45:17.180 align:middle line:84%
can ask something like,
is my name Regina?

00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:20.040 align:middle line:84%
Or is my name Waldorf
or whatever, right?

00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:21.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yes.

00:45:21.830 --> 00:45:24.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you can use your
dominant hand or non-dominant

00:45:24.330 --> 00:45:24.590 align:middle line:90%
hand?

00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:25.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: I use my right hand.

00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:26.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, my dominant.

00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:28.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Dominant hand.

00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:31.270 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:32.230 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:33.670 align:middle line:90%
So it seems strong enough.

00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:35.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm asking if my name's Regina.

00:45:35.890 --> 00:45:37.370 align:middle line:90%
Now what should I ask myself?

00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:40.930 align:middle line:84%
Is there something--
well, Waldo.

00:45:40.930 --> 00:45:42.512 align:middle line:90%
Is my name Waldo?

00:45:42.512 --> 00:45:43.720 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I see what you're saying.

00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:44.553 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Now-- OK.

00:45:44.553 --> 00:45:46.930 align:middle line:84%
So you're using it where
it actually goes down.

00:45:46.930 --> 00:45:48.430 align:middle line:84%
But again, you're
the programmer.

00:45:48.430 --> 00:45:49.840 align:middle line:90%
You get to tell it.

00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:51.730 align:middle line:90%
But I use it where it slips off.

00:45:51.730 --> 00:45:53.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yours slips off.

00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:54.100 align:middle line:90%
It'll go off of it.

00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:54.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Like it can't hold.

00:45:54.730 --> 00:45:56.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I'm having
mine right over it.

00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:57.110 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Go down.

00:45:57.110 --> 00:45:57.370 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:57.370 --> 00:45:58.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Go down.

00:45:58.560 --> 00:45:58.730 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:45:58.730 --> 00:45:59.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: It's however you--

00:45:59.750 --> 00:46:00.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: However
you want to do it.

00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:03.310 align:middle line:84%
So if it just automatically
slips off, that's your no?

00:46:03.310 --> 00:46:04.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: That's my no.

00:46:04.490 --> 00:46:05.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:46:05.290 --> 00:46:06.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: This is effective
when you're driving.

00:46:06.850 --> 00:46:07.570 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:46:07.570 --> 00:46:09.400 align:middle line:84%
Because here you are,
you're driving down the road

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:10.630 align:middle line:90%
and you have this question.

00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:12.670 align:middle line:84%
Oh my god, I've got to
ask my higher guidance.

00:46:12.670 --> 00:46:14.890 align:middle line:84%
But you can't take
out a pendulum.

00:46:14.890 --> 00:46:17.140 align:middle line:90%
So here, you can use your--

00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:19.097 align:middle line:84%
you can keep one hand
on the steering wheel

00:46:19.097 --> 00:46:20.680 align:middle line:84%
and start to dowse
with the other one,

00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:21.830 align:middle line:90%
and it works beautifully.

00:46:21.830 --> 00:46:24.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you can also do
it with nobody staring at you.

00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:26.620 align:middle line:84%
Because I've done the
other one before like

00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:29.260 align:middle line:84%
in a health food store about
a supplement, standing there.

00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:30.938 align:middle line:84%
Kind of close your
eyes for a minute.

00:46:30.938 --> 00:46:32.230 align:middle line:90%
It's like, what are they doing?

00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And you don't want to take
a pendulum out, you know?

00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:36.490 align:middle line:90%
So that one's much more subtle.

00:46:36.490 --> 00:46:37.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah.

00:46:37.630 --> 00:46:40.810 align:middle line:84%
I used that one time when I
was on a walk with a friend.

00:46:40.810 --> 00:46:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And she was saying,
I just don't get

00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:46.030 align:middle line:90%
what's going on with my mom.

00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:48.020 align:middle line:90%
She is driving me nuts.

00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:50.330 align:middle line:84%
She's calling me
every single day.

00:46:50.330 --> 00:46:53.720 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what
it is she wants from me.

00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:57.880 align:middle line:84%
So as you're walking again,
when you're using a pendulum,

00:46:57.880 --> 00:46:59.870 align:middle line:84%
you'd have to stop,
take out your pendulum.

00:46:59.870 --> 00:47:02.630 align:middle line:84%
You can't walk at the
same time and do it.

00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:04.210 align:middle line:84%
But with this
finger dowsing, you

00:47:04.210 --> 00:47:06.910 align:middle line:84%
can easily keep
walking and dowse.

00:47:06.910 --> 00:47:08.570 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I did.

00:47:08.570 --> 00:47:09.370 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK.

00:47:09.370 --> 00:47:12.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's find out what it
is she truly wants from you.

00:47:12.550 --> 00:47:16.000 align:middle line:84%
Long story short, what she
wanted from her daughter

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.300 align:middle line:84%
more than anything
was to be needed.

00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:22.870 align:middle line:84%
Her daughter, on the
other hand, wanted her mom

00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:24.480 align:middle line:90%
to be proud of her.

00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:27.795 align:middle line:84%
And so she kept saying,
I don't need you, Mom.

00:47:27.795 --> 00:47:28.595 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:47:28.595 --> 00:47:31.660 align:middle line:84%
It's like, Mom, I don't
need you to do that for me.

00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:33.040 align:middle line:90%
I can take care of myself.

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:33.840 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And she was telling
her mom the exact thing

00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:39.720 align:middle line:84%
she didn't want to hear, which
was intensifying her need

00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:40.520 align:middle line:90%
to be needed.

00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:41.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:43.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: So once she
understood that, then she

00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:45.100 align:middle line:84%
changed how she
conversed with her mom,

00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:47.680 align:middle line:84%
and she instead said,
Mom, I need you to do this

00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:49.030 align:middle line:90%
and to do that.

00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:51.700 align:middle line:84%
After that, what a difference
in their relationship.

00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:55.067 align:middle line:84%
But that all came from a
simple walk and finger dowsing.

00:47:55.067 --> 00:47:55.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:56.700 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:47:56.700 --> 00:47:59.770 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
the other side,

00:47:59.770 --> 00:48:02.290 align:middle line:84%
which is the side where people
start feeling like they're

00:48:02.290 --> 00:48:04.270 align:middle line:84%
a failure because
they feel like they're

00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:06.130 align:middle line:90%
getting inaccurate information.

00:48:06.130 --> 00:48:07.008 align:middle line:90%
This is a big one.

00:48:07.008 --> 00:48:08.050 align:middle line:90%
We've got a subconscious.

00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:09.400 align:middle line:90%
We've got a ton of beliefs.

00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:11.230 align:middle line:90%
We have a ton of expectations.

00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:13.000 align:middle line:84%
All of these interfere
with the clarity

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.560 align:middle line:84%
of the answer that should be
coming from higher source.

00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:16.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Right.

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:17.160 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:18.040 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:23.050 align:middle line:84%
So this whole conversation
has been about truth.

00:48:23.050 --> 00:48:25.090 align:middle line:84%
There's something really
important to understand

00:48:25.090 --> 00:48:30.250 align:middle line:84%
about how the universe speaks to
you and this concept of truth.

00:48:30.250 --> 00:48:32.650 align:middle line:90%
You might want to rethink it.

00:48:32.650 --> 00:48:33.490 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:48:33.490 --> 00:48:37.060 align:middle line:84%
Instead, understand that
your life is a journey,

00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:41.980 align:middle line:84%
and you are given the
information you need in order

00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:44.200 align:middle line:90%
to take the next step.

00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:47.320 align:middle line:84%
Don't think of it so
much as the truth,

00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:51.100 align:middle line:84%
but rather, just what you
need to take the next step.

00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:52.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is critical.

00:48:52.370 --> 00:48:53.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: This is credit.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
sometimes you think,

00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:56.880 align:middle line:90%
my higher guidance lied to me.

00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:58.790 align:middle line:90%
No, it didn't lie to you.

00:48:58.790 --> 00:49:01.370 align:middle line:84%
It told you what you needed
to do the next thing.

00:49:01.370 --> 00:49:02.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yes.

00:49:02.170 --> 00:49:05.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which if you're
given this goal over here

00:49:05.530 --> 00:49:08.000 align:middle line:84%
and there are several
steps to get there,

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.250 align:middle line:84%
you can sabotage yourself
at any point along the way.

00:49:10.250 --> 00:49:11.120 align:middle line:90%
So continue.

00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:11.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:12.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah.

00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:16.270 align:middle line:84%
One of my clients, a young
gal, called me one day

00:49:16.270 --> 00:49:19.330 align:middle line:84%
and said, Jean, I'm so
in love with this guy.

00:49:19.330 --> 00:49:20.200 align:middle line:90%
Is he the one?

00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:21.073 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:49:21.073 --> 00:49:22.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Pretty common one.

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:22.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Right.

00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:23.550 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:49:23.550 --> 00:49:24.550 align:middle line:90%
And guidance said, no.

00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:26.560 align:middle line:90%
This is not the one.

00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:29.350 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you're not
going to meet the one

00:49:29.350 --> 00:49:30.640 align:middle line:90%
until about three years.

00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:33.080 align:middle line:84%
But you're waiting
for him to grow up.

00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:33.880 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:34.880 align:middle line:90%
You don't want him now.

00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:35.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:39.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: But in three
years, he will be the one.

00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:41.100 align:middle line:90%
Well, she's so in love with him.

00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:44.493 align:middle line:84%
You know, she said, oh, I
can't break up with this guy.

00:49:44.493 --> 00:49:45.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm just having
such a great time,

00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:48.640 align:middle line:84%
but it saddens me to
know he's not the one.

00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:51.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, almost three
years goes by.

00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And during that time,
or about that time,

00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:56.470 align:middle line:90%
she met someone else.

00:49:56.470 --> 00:49:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And thought to herself,
is this the one?

00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And this other person
so intrigued her

00:50:02.590 --> 00:50:06.280 align:middle line:84%
that she was willing to let
go of that first relationship.

00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:12.250 align:middle line:84%
And actually, they broke up,
and he went back to his house,

00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:16.300 align:middle line:84%
and she started a relationship
with this new person.

00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:18.670 align:middle line:84%
And yet, that
didn't go very far.

00:50:18.670 --> 00:50:20.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, meanwhile,
what was happening

00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:26.050 align:middle line:84%
with this guy is when he
was told that this is over,

00:50:26.050 --> 00:50:29.270 align:middle line:84%
he went back home
and he grew up.

00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:30.070 align:middle line:90%
In a way--

00:50:30.070 --> 00:50:31.050 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:31.050 --> 00:50:32.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I have the chills.

00:50:32.730 --> 00:50:34.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: He grew up.

00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And he came back and literally
swept her off her feet

00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:41.290 align:middle line:84%
and said, you are
the one for me.

00:50:41.290 --> 00:50:42.650 align:middle line:90%
We're getting married.

00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:43.450 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

00:50:43.450 --> 00:50:45.880 align:middle line:84%
She dumped the other guy,
and they got married.

00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:47.630 align:middle line:90%
Right at the three-year mark.

00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:49.165 align:middle line:90%
But she was waiting for him--

00:50:49.165 --> 00:50:50.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To grow up.

00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:50.605 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:50.605 --> 00:50:53.063 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Now if she had been
told right in the beginning,

00:50:53.063 --> 00:50:55.842 align:middle line:84%
yes, this is the one,
then that whole experience

00:50:55.842 --> 00:50:56.800 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't have happened.

00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:57.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He wouldn't
have been rejected,

00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:00.050 align:middle line:84%
forcing him to go deeper,
forcing him to grow up.

00:51:00.050 --> 00:51:00.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Right.

00:51:00.850 --> 00:51:01.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:02.160 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:03.670 align:middle line:90%
That's a perfect example.

00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:06.880 align:middle line:90%
So don't take truth as absolute.

00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:10.130 align:middle line:84%
Take it as the thing that
you need in this moment.

00:51:10.130 --> 00:51:12.370 align:middle line:84%
But you still have to get
clear enough to even hear

00:51:12.370 --> 00:51:14.030 align:middle line:90%
that truth in the moment.

00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:15.730 align:middle line:84%
So how do you get
past all the filters

00:51:15.730 --> 00:51:18.400 align:middle line:84%
when you begin dowsing
when you're scared?

00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:21.590 align:middle line:84%
When you are attached
to the outcomes?

00:51:21.590 --> 00:51:22.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah.

00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:27.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, the first thing is
to remember that you're not

00:51:27.220 --> 00:51:29.428 align:middle line:84%
separated from
yourself, so emotions

00:51:29.428 --> 00:51:30.470 align:middle line:90%
are going to play a role.

00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:33.320 align:middle line:84%
It's really hard to get
past your own filters.

00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:37.180 align:middle line:84%
And if you haven't developed
this relationship yet

00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:41.050 align:middle line:84%
and you really haven't discerned
how your guidance speaks

00:51:41.050 --> 00:51:46.290 align:middle line:84%
to you, then like I said, don't
bet the family farm on it.

00:51:46.290 --> 00:51:48.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Don't ask
the big ones just yet.

00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:49.457 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Don't
ask the big ones.

00:51:49.457 --> 00:51:51.900 align:middle line:84%
So that's the main
thing, is just

00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:54.100 align:middle line:90%
to build this relationship.

00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:55.960 align:middle line:90%
Build it.

00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:58.360 align:middle line:90%
Now we all do this.

00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:01.180 align:middle line:84%
Emotions and being
attached to the answer.

00:52:01.180 --> 00:52:03.340 align:middle line:84%
Boy, oh boy, have I ever
learned the hard way

00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:04.780 align:middle line:90%
on some of those issues.

00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:07.750 align:middle line:84%
I had a friend that
wanted to be pregnant.

00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And what she would do-- believe
it or not, I fell into this,

00:52:11.350 --> 00:52:13.310 align:middle line:84%
and I should've never
allowed this to happen.

00:52:13.310 --> 00:52:19.540 align:middle line:84%
But she would call me every
month after that period of time

00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:21.190 align:middle line:84%
when she could
conceive happened.

00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:22.770 align:middle line:90%
And she'd call me every month.

00:52:22.770 --> 00:52:23.690 align:middle line:90%
Jean, did it happen?

00:52:23.690 --> 00:52:24.490 align:middle line:90%
Did I conceive?

00:52:24.490 --> 00:52:25.560 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:26.150 align:middle line:90%
And I would dowse it--

00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:26.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just wait a few weeks.

00:52:26.890 --> 00:52:27.520 align:middle line:90%
You'll know.

00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:28.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah.

00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:30.530 align:middle line:84%
And I would dowse it,
and I would say no, no.

00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And every month
this was happening.

00:52:32.250 --> 00:52:33.050 align:middle line:90%
And I was--

00:52:33.050 --> 00:52:34.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now you're
getting swept up in it.

00:52:34.650 --> 00:52:35.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: I was.

00:52:35.450 --> 00:52:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted so badly
for her to be pregnant

00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:41.020 align:middle line:84%
that one time when she
called I said, yes.

00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:41.890 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it's true.

00:52:41.890 --> 00:52:42.690 align:middle line:90%
You're pregnant.

00:52:42.690 --> 00:52:43.600 align:middle line:90%
And she wasn't.

00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:44.590 align:middle line:90%
And I just felt--

00:52:44.590 --> 00:52:45.460 align:middle line:90%
I thought, OK.

00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:48.550 align:middle line:84%
Never again am I
going to do something

00:52:48.550 --> 00:52:51.600 align:middle line:84%
where I can feel I am
very emotionally attached

00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:52.400 align:middle line:90%
to the answer.

00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:53.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:54.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: OK?

00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:55.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, I want to bring
something else up that's

00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:56.770 align:middle line:90%
kind of interesting.

00:52:56.770 --> 00:52:59.770 align:middle line:84%
Kind of going back to this
whole notion of the planet

00:52:59.770 --> 00:53:02.710 align:middle line:84%
is experiencing this
pandemic, right?

00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:04.487 align:middle line:84%
This is what Rudolf
Steiner stated

00:53:04.487 --> 00:53:05.820 align:middle line:90%
at the turn of the last century.

00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:09.460 align:middle line:84%
I've reduced it a little
bit to the nut of it.

00:53:09.460 --> 00:53:10.960 align:middle line:84%
He believed disease
was a teacher

00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:13.750 align:middle line:84%
and predicted that vaccines
would come in the future

00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:15.670 align:middle line:84%
and would have the
effect of cutting us off

00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:18.370 align:middle line:84%
from our spiritual
impulses and information,

00:53:18.370 --> 00:53:22.300 align:middle line:84%
forcing us into the
world of materialism.

00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:25.570 align:middle line:84%
By forcing these
elements into our body

00:53:25.570 --> 00:53:29.800 align:middle line:84%
to spike an immune
response, it would subvert

00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:31.720 align:middle line:90%
our body's own intelligence.

00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:34.260 align:middle line:90%


00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:35.400 align:middle line:90%
How does that strike you?

00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:37.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just such
a profound statement.

00:53:37.410 --> 00:53:39.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, he was one of the great
geniuses of the last two

00:53:39.930 --> 00:53:40.730 align:middle line:90%
centuries.

00:53:40.730 --> 00:53:44.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, an unsung
hero if there was one.

00:53:44.330 --> 00:53:46.920 align:middle line:84%
What does that-- what
kind of truth do you

00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:48.900 align:middle line:90%
get out of that, or not?

00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:50.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: I think
it is true, but I

00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:57.600 align:middle line:84%
think that's why it's even
more essential that we practice

00:53:57.600 --> 00:54:00.180 align:middle line:84%
and have the discipline to
connect in with our own higher

00:54:00.180 --> 00:54:02.310 align:middle line:90%
guidance on a continual basis.

00:54:02.310 --> 00:54:06.180 align:middle line:84%
And keep that voice alive,
keep our awareness alive,

00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:12.140 align:middle line:84%
keep tuning to it so
that we can discern

00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:14.520 align:middle line:84%
where our information
is coming from,

00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:16.588 align:middle line:90%
and keep it alive and well.

00:54:16.588 --> 00:54:18.630 align:middle line:84%
You know, the truth of
who you are as a spiritual

00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:21.030 align:middle line:84%
being is alive and
well, and it is there.

00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:25.418 align:middle line:84%
But we just ignore it or
bypass it or can't see it.

00:54:25.418 --> 00:54:27.210 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely can't see
it, and for the reason

00:54:27.210 --> 00:54:28.560 align:middle line:90%
that he's talking about.

00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:30.960 align:middle line:84%
But if you continue
a practice, if you

00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:33.060 align:middle line:84%
continue that
discipline, then you

00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:35.070 align:middle line:90%
will keep it front and center.

00:54:35.070 --> 00:54:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
it's so important.

00:54:36.570 --> 00:54:37.987 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right
now, I don't think

00:54:37.987 --> 00:54:40.662 align:middle line:84%
it's ever been so important
or ever been this important.

00:54:40.662 --> 00:54:42.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's always
been important.

00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:47.730 align:middle line:84%
But now, because of the field
of kind of such conflicted field

00:54:47.730 --> 00:54:50.040 align:middle line:84%
of information that's out
there in the unified field

00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:52.620 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, it's all
a jumble with our thoughts

00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:54.460 align:middle line:90%
and our fears, and so forth.

00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:57.780 align:middle line:84%
That's why I was so happy
to have you on right now,

00:54:57.780 --> 00:55:00.690 align:middle line:84%
to start getting straight on
how we start tapping in again.

00:55:00.690 --> 00:55:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And I love the fact that
you talked about the organs,

00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:06.270 align:middle line:84%
beginning to use our body
as our dowsing device

00:55:06.270 --> 00:55:09.510 align:middle line:84%
to really feel where the
dysfunction is happening.

00:55:09.510 --> 00:55:10.440 align:middle line:90%
Loved it.

00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:14.130 align:middle line:10%
And just in
finishing, can people

00:55:14.130 --> 00:55:16.572 align:middle line:10%
go to-- is it
creativemystic.org?

00:55:16.572 --> 00:55:17.372 align:middle line:10%
Or dot com?

00:55:17.372 --> 00:55:18.830 align:middle line:10%
>>SLATTER: Yes,

00:55:18.830 --> 00:55:20.640 align:middle line:84%

to jeanslatter.com.

Slatter's with two Ts.

00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:22.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:23.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:25.980 align:middle line:10%
Because what you do is you
teach these ongoing courses

00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:29.967 align:middle line:10%
for people who don't consider
themselves intuitive, per se.

00:55:29.967 --> 00:55:31.550 align:middle line:84%
But for various
reasons-- some of them

00:55:31.550 --> 00:55:33.570 align:middle line:84%
are life coaches or health
practitioners or just

00:55:33.570 --> 00:55:36.900 align:middle line:84%
people who want to start
being able to ascertain more

00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:39.480 align:middle line:90%
accurately what the truth is.

00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:41.310 align:middle line:84%
And again, truth is
a relative thing.

00:55:41.310 --> 00:55:43.170 align:middle line:84%
But the truth they
need in that moment

00:55:43.170 --> 00:55:45.330 align:middle line:84%
is for either themselves
or that client.

00:55:45.330 --> 00:55:47.790 align:middle line:90%
So you teach what--

00:55:47.790 --> 00:55:49.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: I have two
certification courses.

00:55:49.770 --> 00:55:51.565 align:middle line:90%
One's Creative Mystic Intuitive.

00:55:51.565 --> 00:55:53.190 align:middle line:10%
And then if they
desire, they can go on

00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:56.110 align:middle line:10%
to become a higher
guidance life coach.

00:55:56.110 --> 00:56:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And both of them, what draws
people to those courses

00:56:00.750 --> 00:56:07.980 align:middle line:84%
is a deep desire within
them to know who they are

00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:10.050 align:middle line:84%
and how they express
their energy.

00:56:10.050 --> 00:56:11.370 align:middle line:90%
All roads lead to that.

00:56:11.370 --> 00:56:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And our soul is urging us
to discover who we truly

00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:20.130 align:middle line:84%
are so that we're totally
present in every moment

00:56:20.130 --> 00:56:20.930 align:middle line:90%
of our lives.

00:56:20.930 --> 00:56:21.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:56:21.730 --> 00:56:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And we have to know that
higher guidance is always

00:56:25.170 --> 00:56:29.610 align:middle line:84%
whispering to us, beckoning us
to pay attention, be subtle.

00:56:29.610 --> 00:56:30.490 align:middle line:90%
Don't get attached.

00:56:30.490 --> 00:56:31.770 align:middle line:90%
Don't be fearful.

00:56:31.770 --> 00:56:33.570 align:middle line:90%
It'll never fail us.

00:56:33.570 --> 00:56:36.395 align:middle line:84%
So Jean, I want to thank you
so much for taking the time.

00:56:36.395 --> 00:56:37.770 align:middle line:84%
I love what you
had to say today.

00:56:37.770 --> 00:56:39.190 align:middle line:90%
