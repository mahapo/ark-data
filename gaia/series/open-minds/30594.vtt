00:00:18.422 --> 00:00:20.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: As has
historically been the case,

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.110 align:middle line:84%
many of the world's best minds
have been obscured due to death

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.210 align:middle line:90%
by character assassination.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.610 align:middle line:84%
Austrian psychoanalyst and
inventor, Wilhelm Reich,

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.390 align:middle line:84%
offered a new look
at the energy that

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.310 align:middle line:90%
permeates all living systems.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.180 align:middle line:84%
One that only the most
adept yogis and mystics

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.090 align:middle line:90%
have glimpsed.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And he did it in a
scientific arena.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.430 align:middle line:84%
This gave him a unique
glimpse into human sexuality,

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.010 align:middle line:84%
health, and the cosmos
that ultimately cost him

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.220 align:middle line:90%
his freedom and his life.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.210 align:middle line:84%
No one alive knows
more about his work,

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.110 align:middle line:84%
his research and experiments,
and investigations

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.050 align:middle line:90%
than Doctor James DeMeo.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.930 align:middle line:84%
He has repeatedly
conducted experiments

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.270 align:middle line:84%
of huge significance
that have refuted

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.760 align:middle line:84%
all of the brutal charges
leveled against Reich.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.954 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:01:03.954 --> 00:01:05.370 align:middle line:84%
It's good to see
you again, James.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.110 align:middle line:84%
>>JAMES DEMEO:
Thank you, Regina.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.400 align:middle line:90%
It's good to be here.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
I thought we'd

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.810 align:middle line:84%
do before we even get
into the story is,

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.510 align:middle line:84%
you've done some
wonderful videos.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.370 align:middle line:84%
And we'll take a look at
just an intro to one of them

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.820 align:middle line:84%
to give everybody a
quick look at who he was.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:16.320 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.210 align:middle line:90%


00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.630 align:middle line:84%
>>In the 1940s, an Austrian
immigrant to America

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.260 align:middle line:84%
and refugee from Nazi
Germany, Doctor Wilhelm Reich,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.200 align:middle line:84%
made the scientific discovery
of a previously unknown energy

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.520 align:middle line:84%
existing in the
atmosphere, in space,

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.480 align:middle line:90%
and within living organisms.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.760 align:middle line:84%
Discovered accidentally,
Doctor Reich eventually

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.450 align:middle line:84%
demonstrated this
blue, glowing energy

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.260 align:middle line:84%
to charge up and radiate
from microorganisms, plants,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.230 align:middle line:90%
animals, and humans.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.080 align:middle line:84%
This energy also
existed in a free form

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.400 align:middle line:84%
within the open atmosphere,
and in high vacuum.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.684 align:middle line:84%
He called this
energy the orgone.

00:02:03.684 --> 00:02:05.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Orgone energy.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And this has come to be
used both appropriately and

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.190 align:middle line:84%
bastardized every which way
over the last several decades.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.180 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
you're absolutely

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.800 align:middle line:84%
fatigued with the charges
that have come about.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.020 align:middle line:84%
Not only for his
work, but even yours,

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.040 align:middle line:84%
because you have been
a proponent of the work

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.540 align:middle line:90%
that he did.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.399 align:middle line:84%
The truest, purest
scientific work that he did.

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:26.940 align:middle line:90%
>>DEMEO: Yes.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:27.439 align:middle line:90%
Well--

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:29.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not an
easy path you chose.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.615 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: Uh no, but a
very interesting one.

00:02:31.615 --> 00:02:32.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.680 align:middle line:84%
Well let's start
from the beginning.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.640 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to give people a little
more idea of what happened, how

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.130 align:middle line:84%
he ended up in
this situation, why

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.010 align:middle line:84%
he was such a controversial
character in the end,

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.100 align:middle line:84%
and about his
background with Freud.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.900 align:middle line:84%
Let's start there
and come forward.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:46.680 align:middle line:90%
>>DEMEO: OK.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, he was one of the prime
movers in early psychoanalysis.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.750 align:middle line:84%
He joined Freud in the late
'20s-- mid '20s to late '20s.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And he was an active participant
in the psychoanalytic society

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.780 align:middle line:90%
in Vienna, and later in Berlin.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.510 align:middle line:84%
He was handling their
teaching seminars.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.550 align:middle line:84%
He taught the younger
generation of psychoanalysts.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, he
came to challenge

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.570 align:middle line:84%
some of the
psychoanalytic precepts,

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.230 align:middle line:84%
such as the death instinct
and the ideas of sublimation,

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.170 align:middle line:84%
and the biological nature
of the Oedipal conflict.

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.390 align:middle line:84%
A few things like
this that they started

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.260 align:middle line:84%
to look at him with
a little suspicion.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because he wasn't
buying the strict Freudian

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.940 align:middle line:90%
line.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.981 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: He didn't stay
strict along those lines.

00:03:36.981 --> 00:03:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And as he pointed out
in his own writings,

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.580 align:middle line:84%
he says that, well, that
a lot of people's misery

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.760 align:middle line:84%
that led them into neurosis and
psychosis and mental illness

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.600 align:middle line:84%
was a product of their
social circumstance.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.960 align:middle line:84%
So he began to not only look at
what was going on in the home

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.970 align:middle line:84%
environment, and in the work
environment, and in society

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.370 align:middle line:84%
larger, but he actually
began to think,

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.290 align:middle line:84%
you know, maybe-- he
pointed out this one example

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.250 align:middle line:84%
of a woman who had six kids
and the husband had left.

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And she's there
living in poverty

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.100 align:middle line:84%
and has barely enough money,
and she's doing three jobs.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And he says, this
woman is suffering

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.640 align:middle line:84%
not because of some neurosis
that needs psychotherapy.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.413 align:middle line:90%
What she needs is economic help.

00:04:20.413 --> 00:04:21.079 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: And so he went out into
the public trying to do things

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.850 align:middle line:84%
like making contraception
legal, helping

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:35.250 align:middle line:84%
to upraise the status of
women, and a variety of things

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.170 align:middle line:84%
to prevent people from
going a little crazy because

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.410 align:middle line:84%
of their social and
familial circumstances.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.680 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to eliminate
arranged marriages.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.780 align:middle line:84%
Have marriages based
on love instead

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:52.420 align:middle line:84%
of some compulsive proclamation
from the church authorities

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:53.110 align:middle line:90%
in those days.

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.380 align:middle line:84%
Which the church and
the state was very much

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:01.440 align:middle line:84%
combined together, certainly
under the Kaiser's Germany.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.010 align:middle line:84%
And then it was broken,
more or less, during Wiemar.

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.160 align:middle line:84%
But you still had a lot
of powerful influences

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.457 align:middle line:84%
from the older system that
carried over into the new.

00:05:12.457 --> 00:05:15.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he also fought for
gay rights, even in that day.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.080 align:middle line:84%
That they should not
be jailed, as was the--

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: Decriminalize
of homosexuality

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.210 align:middle line:84%
was one of his
advocated platforms.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, he worked with the
Marxist political parties

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.900 align:middle line:90%
in those days.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And this was a time when
Hitlerism was on the rise.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.480 align:middle line:84%
So he found himself being
attacked in the Nazi press.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And then the Communists
attacked him, also.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.870 align:middle line:84%
Because they said, all your talk
about sexual reform legislation

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:53.420 align:middle line:84%
and so on, is distracting
people from the class struggle.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.010 align:middle line:90%
And so they got upset with him.

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, he
wound up on a death list

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.790 align:middle line:84%
for both the Nazis
and the Communists.

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:01.160 align:middle line:90%
Were both tracking him down.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:01.566 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's
fair to say, he

00:06:01.566 --> 00:06:03.910 align:middle line:84%
wasn't trying to play a
political game by any means.

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:04.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DEMEO: No.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.700 align:middle line:84%
He was sticking to what the
facts of his clinical research

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.595 align:middle line:84%
demanded in trying to
better people's lives.

00:06:10.595 --> 00:06:13.290 align:middle line:90%


00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.230 align:middle line:90%
He was also against pornography.

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.460 align:middle line:84%
This is another thing
that people often mistake.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's back into
this, because if you go online

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.900 align:middle line:84%
and you start
researching him, you're

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.840 align:middle line:84%
going to see one article
after another particularly

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:31.270 align:middle line:84%
on his beliefs about sexuality,
his theories on sexuality.

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And even associated with
what became his invention,

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.150 align:middle line:90%
the orgone accumulator.

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:38.980 align:middle line:84%
And now this gets
really muddled up

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.890 align:middle line:84%
and you read 1,000
different viewpoints.

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:42.650 align:middle line:90%
What was his belief?

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.980 align:middle line:90%
Why was he witch-hunted for it?

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.560 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: What Reich found
was that human sexuality gave

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.800 align:middle line:84%
the greatest pleasure to
people and the greatest

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.250 align:middle line:84%
psychic benefits in terms
of clearing their minds,

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.460 align:middle line:90%
when there was love.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.915 align:middle line:90%
Love was the key ingredient.

00:06:59.915 --> 00:07:04.810 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't just promiscuous
sexual relations with anybody.

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And this is a big mistake
that a lot of people say,

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.480 align:middle line:84%
that Reich was the advocate
of free love and so on.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.710 align:middle line:90%
This is not true.

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:14.040 align:middle line:84%
He believed that if
people loved each other

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.970 align:middle line:84%
and they got married, that
they would stay together

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:20.810 align:middle line:84%
on the basis of the mutual
pleasure that they got,

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:22.890 align:middle line:90%
and the love that existed.

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:26.700 align:middle line:84%
So he was against
compulsive marriages.

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:30.270 align:middle line:84%
He felt that premarital
sexuality was healthy.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:33.310 align:middle line:84%
Now this got him in trouble
with the church authorities.

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:34.920 align:middle line:84%
But on the other
hand, he pointed out

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:38.830 align:middle line:84%
how the Don Juan character--
the guy who goes around and has

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:43.300 align:middle line:84%
10 girlfriends and brags about
how many times he can do it

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.550 align:middle line:84%
in one night-- that
this individual is also

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:49.810 align:middle line:84%
sexually disturbed, because
he can't give himself

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:50.699 align:middle line:90%
to any one woman.

00:07:50.699 --> 00:07:52.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's more
coming from a neuroses,

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:54.430 align:middle line:90%
or something to prove that--

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:56.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: It's
compulsive promiscuity.

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And it was unhealth,
according to Reich.

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:04.420 align:middle line:84%
So Reich identified a series of
sexual neuroses, part of which

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:09.290 align:middle line:84%
were based upon abstinence
and fear and anxiety

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:10.520 align:middle line:90%
about sexuality.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.990 align:middle line:84%
But that this also was
expressed in the compulsion

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:18.545 align:middle line:84%
towards promiscuity and a
lot of pornographic imagery.

00:08:18.545 --> 00:08:20.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So again,
there wasn't really

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:23.570 align:middle line:84%
a political agenda in this, even
though he was then credited,

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:27.270 align:middle line:84%
or accused, of being sort of
the godfather of, as you say,

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:27.890 align:middle line:90%
free love.

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:29.060 align:middle line:90%
The explosion of free love.

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.393 align:middle line:84%
The reality is it sounds like
he was trying to put forth

00:08:31.393 --> 00:08:35.900 align:middle line:84%
what sounds to me to be a very
nature-based, balanced message

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:40.450 align:middle line:84%
about using the energy to its
highest potential between two

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:42.250 align:middle line:84%
consenting people
who love one another.

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:44.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, that doesn't
sound too crazy to me.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: Well he
spoke about surrender.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:49.850 align:middle line:90%
Giving oneself in love.

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:51.970 align:middle line:90%
This was a key ingredient.

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And what he found
in his therapy--

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:56.440 align:middle line:84%
and this is very
controversial even today--

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:59.730 align:middle line:84%
is he found that people
who were able to achieve,

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:03.270 align:middle line:84%
in their therapy, a
loosening of the muscles

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.560 align:middle line:84%
and a relaxation of
their body system,

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:10.500 align:middle line:84%
such that when they had sexual
relations they had a very

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:14.760 align:middle line:84%
strong orgastic discharge,
that these people experience

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.570 align:middle line:84%
afterwards-- not only did
it make them feel better,

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:23.120 align:middle line:84%
but it cleared the mind, they
could breathe more deeply,

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.190 align:middle line:90%
and they felt better.

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:27.210 align:middle line:84%
And he came to the point of
concluding that people who

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:31.620 align:middle line:84%
experienced a good, healthy
orgasm, that he couldn't find

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:37.240 align:middle line:84%
any of his neurotic or psychotic
patients who had this capacity.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.960 align:middle line:84%
They were all suffering from one
or another sexual disturbance.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Some kind of
repression or neuroses

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:42.960 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.130 align:middle line:90%
>>DEMEO: Of one or another kind.

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:44.630 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:47.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he also related
this, again, back to this work,

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:50.834 align:middle line:84%
as a bio-electric
force within the being.

00:09:50.834 --> 00:09:51.750 align:middle line:90%
>>DEMEO: That's right.

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:55.000 align:middle line:84%
He wrote a book called "The
Function of the Orgasm,"

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.690 align:middle line:84%
which of course gets a
lot of people anxious

00:09:57.690 --> 00:09:59.140 align:middle line:90%
just from the title.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.540 align:middle line:84%
But it still is a
light year ahead

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:06.290 align:middle line:84%
of most of what's written
today on human sexual research

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:07.430 align:middle line:90%
and relations.

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:09.670 align:middle line:84%
And in this book,
he also discusses

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:11.220 align:middle line:90%
his bio-electrical experiments.

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, this came
later in his work.

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:18.110 align:middle line:84%
He had to flee from Germany
after Hitler was elected,

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:21.350 align:middle line:84%
because the Germans were
burning people's books.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:25.200 align:middle line:84%
His books were in these big
bonfires along with Einstein

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.260 align:middle line:84%
and Freud and everybody
else of merit.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:32.260 align:middle line:90%
And so he fled to Scandinavia.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, he was
invited by the Oslo, Norway

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:39.940 align:middle line:84%
group of psychoanalysts,
one of whom

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:43.500 align:middle line:84%
was Harald Schjelderup, who
was a professor of psychology

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.510 align:middle line:90%
at the University of Oslo.

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And so he was invited there
to lecture, as well as

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:51.960 align:middle line:84%
to use their facilities
to do the very

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:56.660 align:middle line:84%
first bio-electrical studies
on human emotional and sexual

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:57.750 align:middle line:90%
response.

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:01.470 align:middle line:84%
And he did a study on pleasure
versus anxiety reactions.

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And finding that when
people experience pleasure,

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:09.020 align:middle line:84%
there was an increase
in bio-electrical charge

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:09.860 align:middle line:90%
at the skin surface.

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.600 align:middle line:84%
Kind of the warm,
electric feeling

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:18.610 align:middle line:84%
that one feels in healthy,
relaxed sexual excitement,

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:20.940 align:middle line:84%
but which one also
feels in a lot

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:22.250 align:middle line:90%
of other contexts of pleasure.

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:23.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Maybe laughter
and any number of things.

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:23.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:26.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: Laughter,
relaxing, exciting work,

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:28.180 align:middle line:90%
or play, or whatever.

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:32.060 align:middle line:84%
It's not just sexuality, but
it's a part of sexuality.

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And contrary-wise, when people
experience anxiety reactions,

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:42.060 align:middle line:84%
the skin surface experience a
loss of bio-electrical charge

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:43.130 align:middle line:90%
at the surface.

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:47.110 align:middle line:84%
And then you get the cold,
sweaty, clammy feeling,

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:48.990 align:middle line:90%
the goose flesh.

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:52.392 align:middle line:84%
And now Reich showed
that this was something

00:11:52.392 --> 00:11:53.350 align:middle line:90%
that you could measure.

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And he was the first
one to do this.

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's something that
modern-day psychology

00:11:58.940 --> 00:11:59.950 align:middle line:90%
is like this about.

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:02.690 align:middle line:84%
You know, don't touch
it, don't look at it.

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:04.060 align:middle line:90%
They're afraid of it.

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:04.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why?

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.580 align:middle line:90%
I don't understand.

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:07.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: Let me just give
you one interesting example.

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:10.800 align:middle line:84%
You go to the medical
textbooks and on the shelf,

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:15.440 align:middle line:84%
you'll find enormous books on
the sympathetic nervous system

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:19.770 align:middle line:90%
about anxiety fight or flight.

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:21.460 align:middle line:84%
Now the sympathetic
nervous system

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:24.490 align:middle line:84%
is that which governs
anxiety, and fear,

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:26.490 align:middle line:90%
and running, and fighting.

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:28.610 align:middle line:84%
But the parasympathetic
nervous system,

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:33.575 align:middle line:84%
which is just as complex an
innervation in your body,

00:12:33.575 --> 00:12:35.700 align:middle line:84%
you'll find a tiny little
book that talks about it.

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:37.690 align:middle line:90%
And that's the pleasure system.

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:39.335 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's the part that
relaxes everything and allows

00:12:39.335 --> 00:12:39.500 align:middle line:90%
everything to function.

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: That's the
part that relaxes you

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:42.720 align:middle line:90%
and where you have pleasure.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:48.030 align:middle line:84%
So this is a mirror of the
thinking of modern medicine.

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:52.550 align:middle line:84%
That we study anxiety,
we study unpleasure.

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:55.510 align:middle line:84%
But pleasure,
relaxation, this only

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:57.020 align:middle line:84%
gets a tiny little
bit of attention.

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:59.144 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And not only
that, if you look at the way

00:12:59.144 --> 00:13:01.440 align:middle line:84%
our society is
constructed now, it's

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:05.600 align:middle line:84%
nothing but driving people
towards sympathetic overload.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.980 align:middle line:84%
Very little to encourage
the body's systems

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:10.810 align:middle line:84%
to relax and let
down, which allows

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:13.800 align:middle line:84%
for digestion,
elimination, everything.

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: It relates to
human somatic functioning,

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:16.870 align:middle line:90%
and this is key.

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:19.720 align:middle line:84%
This is key because
Reich followed that track

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.750 align:middle line:84%
about human biological
functioning.

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And at this time, of course,
he's fleeing to America.

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:27.862 align:middle line:84%
He's under attack by the
Nazis, the Communist press

00:13:27.862 --> 00:13:28.570 align:middle line:90%
is attacking him.

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:29.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Got to be doing
something right if they all

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:30.110 align:middle line:90%
hate him.

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:31.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: The psychoanalysts
threw him out

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:32.980 align:middle line:90%
of their organization.

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:36.760 align:middle line:84%
Of course, this is at the same
time when Freud is quietly

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.440 align:middle line:84%
asking all the Jewish
members of psychoanalysis

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.920 align:middle line:84%
to quit the International
Association,

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:45.200 align:middle line:84%
so that they can get along
better with the Nazis.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.300 align:middle line:84%
This is something that's
buried in the history

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:48.100 align:middle line:90%
of psychoanalysis.

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:49.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:49.460 align:middle line:90%
>>DEMEO: Oh, Yeah.

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:51.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So explain that--
just another sentence on that.

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:52.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: Well, Freud
fled to Switzerland,

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:54.310 align:middle line:84%
because he was of a
Jewish background.

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And he handed over the reins of
control to some German analyst

00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:01.080 align:middle line:84%
and said, we have to get
rid of the Jewish analysts

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:04.810 align:middle line:84%
so that you guys can survive
and keep the association going.

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:07.930 align:middle line:90%
Well they weren't successful.

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't that Freud was
anti-Semitic or anything,

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:14.450 align:middle line:84%
but it just shows the
appeasement mentality.

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:17.610 align:middle line:84%
Reich was giving speeches
calling the Nazis

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:20.670 align:middle line:90%
sexual psychopaths in public.

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And this was bringing a lot
of heat down on his head.

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
the psychoanalysts

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:26.120 align:middle line:90%
didn't want that.

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:29.302 align:middle line:84%
They said, you're
rocking the boat.

00:14:29.302 --> 00:14:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So he
ended up in the US.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.120 align:middle line:90%
>>DEMEO: He ended up in the US.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:35.050 align:middle line:90%
Arrived in America in 1939.

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:40.074 align:middle line:84%
And he's doing
research with-- he

00:14:40.074 --> 00:14:41.990 align:middle line:84%
had gone beyond the
bio-electrical experiments

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:45.340 align:middle line:84%
and had now started to
study this whole business

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:47.930 align:middle line:90%
of expansion and contraction.

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's a long series of
steps I'll have to summarize,

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:54.310 align:middle line:84%
but basically the
idea is you have

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.290 align:middle line:84%
a unitary biological
energy that's

00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:58.860 align:middle line:84%
moving out into the
world in pleasure,

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:02.600 align:middle line:84%
or that contracts back away
from the world in anxiety.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And this energy he
discovered, bio-electrically,

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:11.770 align:middle line:84%
he felt that the tiny little
bio-electrical currents of only

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:14.190 align:middle line:84%
a few millivolts or
hundreds of millivolts

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:17.770 align:middle line:84%
wasn't sufficient to explain
the power of human energy

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:19.250 align:middle line:90%
and emotion.

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:21.150 align:middle line:84%
That there was something
much more powerful

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:23.330 align:middle line:90%
going on inside the organism.

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:28.890 align:middle line:84%
So this led him into some
microbiological experiments,

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:32.610 align:middle line:84%
where there was a discovery
of a blue radiant energy that

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:36.070 align:middle line:84%
existed in microbiological
preparations,

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:40.230 align:middle line:84%
as well as could be
seen in darkened rooms.

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:42.730 align:middle line:84%
Where you have a totally
pitch black dark room,

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:44.630 align:middle line:90%
it isn't really pitch black.

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:47.470 align:middle line:84%
You can take a camera,
an ordinary film camera,

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:50.600 align:middle line:84%
and some digital cameras
into a total black room.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And if you do a time
image, it comes off

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:55.100 align:middle line:90%
with this bluish coloration.

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And Reich was able to
document this blue coloration

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:01.820 align:middle line:84%
from the microbes, from
the darkened rooms.

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:04.430 align:middle line:84%
He thought, this is irradiation
and I've got to study this.

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:07.450 align:middle line:84%
So he built what he
thought was a Faraday cage.

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:10.170 align:middle line:84%
He built a Faraday cage
with special arrangements

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:11.770 align:middle line:90%
to trap this energy.

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And he found that it trapped
it, yes, but it amplified it.

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And this was the original
discovery of the orgone energy

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:19.070 align:middle line:90%
accumulator.

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:21.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that
was a byproduct.

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:24.614 align:middle line:84%
Discovering that it accumulated
it and amplified it,

00:16:24.614 --> 00:16:26.280 align:middle line:84%
that wasn't what he
was intending to do.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.160 align:middle line:84%
He was just intending
to observe it, right?

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:29.076 align:middle line:90%
>>DEMEO: That's right.

00:16:29.076 --> 00:16:33.740 align:middle line:84%
It was an accidental finding
based upon a certain logic,

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:38.150 align:middle line:84%
but it was
serendipity, intuition

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:39.510 align:middle line:90%
that led him in this direction.

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And then he began
studying the accumulator.

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:45.050 align:middle line:84%
And he found things
like for example, you

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:47.530 align:middle line:84%
put your hand inside this
metal-- well first of all,

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:50.270 align:middle line:84%
the accumulator is
a metal box composed

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:54.300 align:middle line:84%
of ferromagnetic material,
like a Faraday cage.

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And on the outside, he
put insulating material

00:16:57.930 --> 00:16:59.180 align:middle line:90%
to give it thermal insulation.

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:00.254 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Steel wool?

00:17:00.254 --> 00:17:01.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: Well not
steel wool, but just--

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.210 align:middle line:84%
the original one was
just one layer of metal

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:06.119 align:middle line:84%
with one layer of
insulating material,

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:09.339 align:middle line:84%
like cotton, or
Celotex material,

00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:12.180 align:middle line:90%
some kind of fibrous material.

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And he found that this would
amplify this phenomenon.

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And you could put your
hand in there, for example,

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:22.510 align:middle line:84%
and you could feel a radiant
warmth, a tingling effect.

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:25.089 align:middle line:84%
Now some people might dismiss
that as standard infrared,

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:28.894 align:middle line:84%
but what eventually was
shown with experiments

00:17:28.894 --> 00:17:30.560 align:middle line:84%
with the orgone
accumulator is that they

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:33.150 align:middle line:84%
prolonged the life
of cancer mice.

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:35.850 align:middle line:84%
You could put seeds in
there and the seedlings

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:37.805 align:middle line:84%
would increase in
their growth rate.

00:17:37.805 --> 00:17:39.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're going to
get to that in a little bit

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:40.710 align:middle line:84%
and we'll show some
of the examples

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:43.460 align:middle line:84%
side-by-side in
photographs, as well.

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:47.060 align:middle line:84%
So he had discovered that he
could condense this life force,

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:47.840 align:middle line:90%
as it were.

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.330 align:middle line:84%
And so my question
is, and I alluded

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:52.260 align:middle line:84%
to that in the
open a little bit,

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:56.010 align:middle line:84%
that this is what
had historically

00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:58.390 align:middle line:84%
in spiritual circles
been called what?

00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:59.240 align:middle line:90%
Prana?

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:00.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DEMEO: Prana, chi.

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:00.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Chi.

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:02.646 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: There are
hundreds of different terms

00:18:02.646 --> 00:18:03.560 align:middle line:90%
for life energy.

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:06.200 align:middle line:84%
The American Indians
used the term-- well,

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.930 align:middle line:84%
it's been bastardized
by European language,

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:12.310 align:middle line:84%
but the great spirit
Wakan Tanka was originally

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:15.810 align:middle line:84%
a meaning of the force
that moves all things.

00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:17.450 align:middle line:84%
So it was really
more of an energy,

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:18.597 align:middle line:90%
like the ether of physics.

00:18:18.597 --> 00:18:19.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So this is huge.

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:21.096 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some people
have said this

00:18:21.096 --> 00:18:23.740 align:middle line:84%
was one of the greatest
inventions of the century.

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:25.360 align:middle line:84%
That you can take
this life force

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:29.110 align:middle line:84%
and actually accumulate
it in this box,

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:32.424 align:middle line:84%
and then have the advantage
of utilizing that energy.

00:18:32.424 --> 00:18:34.340 align:middle line:84%
Now where did this go
in the world of science?

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:36.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, was he considered
crazy, or were there

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:38.460 align:middle line:84%
those who actually
started getting it?

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:40.830 align:middle line:84%
This is pretty
esoteric research.

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:42.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: Depends
who you talk to.

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:45.930 align:middle line:84%
Of course the psychoanalysts
were outraged and shocked

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:49.280 align:middle line:84%
at every bit of it and
they threw him out.

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:52.680 align:middle line:84%
But he was invited
to the United States.

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:55.400 align:middle line:84%
He was invited by Harald
Schjelderup in Norway.

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's where he made some
of the initial intuitions

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:00.090 align:middle line:90%
and findings.

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And they appreciated
him very much.

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:04.050 align:middle line:84%
He came to the United
States on the invitation

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:06.430 align:middle line:84%
from Dr. Theodore
Wolfe who was a pioneer

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:07.730 align:middle line:90%
in psychosomatic medicine.

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:10.600 align:middle line:84%
And immediately upon coming
to the United States,

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:12.280 align:middle line:84%
he had a whole
group of physicians

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.640 align:middle line:90%
that gathered around him.

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And he was teaching
them not only

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:18.190 align:middle line:84%
his psychotherapeutic
methods, but

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:19.690 align:middle line:90%
about the orgone accumulator.

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, they
were treating patients

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:24.220 align:middle line:90%
with the accumulator.

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And certain kinds of low
level anxiety reactions

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:30.060 align:middle line:84%
or depressions and
things like this

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:32.740 align:middle line:84%
could be overcome with the
accumulator and not much more.

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:34.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it was
affecting the emotional part

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:35.670 align:middle line:90%
of the being.

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:37.253 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: The emotions
and the somatic.

00:19:37.253 --> 00:19:39.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which has to be
an aspect of this field

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:41.940 align:middle line:84%
around our bodies, which
is called the aura,

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:43.110 align:middle line:90%
loosely speaking.

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:45.322 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: Well Reich
is oftentimes,

00:19:45.322 --> 00:19:47.290 align:middle line:84%
and I think
correctly, identified

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:51.490 align:middle line:84%
as being the person who unified
the psych and soma, or mind

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:52.900 align:middle line:90%
body relation.

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:56.590 align:middle line:84%
In the sense that you have
this unitary biological energy

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:59.460 align:middle line:84%
that governs not only
the psychic phenomenon

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:02.300 align:middle line:84%
of your thinking and
your cognitive functions

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:06.200 align:middle line:84%
and your perception, but it also
governs the physical organism.

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:13.100 align:middle line:84%
The way you expand out and
work and do and accomplish,

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:16.260 align:middle line:84%
versus the things that
hold you back from this.

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:20.960 align:middle line:84%
That oh, well I'm afraid and I
got punished badly as a child,

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:26.650 align:middle line:84%
and that inhibit me from going
for what I really want in life.

00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:30.740 align:middle line:84%
So Reich's therapy was
to try and get people

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:32.570 align:middle line:84%
to go for what they
really wanted in life.

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:33.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean
it's really quite

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:35.390 align:middle line:84%
beautiful the way
this is balanced out.

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:38.120 align:middle line:84%
Because he understood
the, as you say,

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:42.000 align:middle line:84%
psycho and soma--
how do you say that?

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000 align:middle line:90%
>>DEMEO: Psych and soma.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Psych
and soma connection

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:49.130 align:middle line:84%
to the point where he understood
how to not just amplify it,

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:52.640 align:middle line:84%
but how to prove physically
that this connection existed

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:53.400 align:middle line:90%
in people.

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.990 align:middle line:90%
And he was right on.

00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:58.170 align:middle line:84%
If your body is collapsed
down on itself because

00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:00.520 align:middle line:84%
of any kind of repression,
sexual or otherwise,

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:02.520 align:middle line:84%
any kind of emotional
disturbance,

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:05.360 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be creating
much less of this thing.

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.724 align:middle line:84%
I assume there's much
less present around you.

00:21:07.724 --> 00:21:09.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: Well, you won't
be breathing it in so much.

00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:11.264 align:middle line:84%
This is another
thing that people

00:21:11.264 --> 00:21:14.610 align:middle line:84%
who have emotional
blockages, let's

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:18.540 align:middle line:84%
say somebody with a lot of rage
or a lot of grief and sadness,

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:20.810 align:middle line:90%
it gets locked into the muscles.

00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:23.370 align:middle line:90%
The rage versus the sadness.

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:26.420 align:middle line:84%
And you can see this in
people's body language

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:27.910 align:middle line:90%
if you know what to look for.

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:29.750 align:middle line:84%
This gets locked
into the muscles,

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:31.900 align:middle line:90%
and it threatens to come out.

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:34.970 align:middle line:84%
It threatens to overwhelm
the psych, unless they

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:37.040 align:middle line:84%
hold their breath and
reduce their breathing.

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.206 align:middle line:84%
So you wind up with
people walking around--

00:21:39.206 --> 00:21:40.372 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Who don't breathe.

00:21:40.372 --> 00:21:41.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: They don't
breathe deeply.

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:43.479 align:middle line:90%
They hold it back.

00:21:43.479 --> 00:21:45.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this
would be, if you're

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:47.060 align:middle line:84%
looking at someone
in a room and you've

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:50.850 align:middle line:84%
spent a little time doing
this, that thin blue haze

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:52.767 align:middle line:84%
you see around their
head and their shoulders.

00:21:52.767 --> 00:21:54.016 align:middle line:90%
That is what we're looking at.

00:21:54.016 --> 00:21:56.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: We're looking at
the orgone energy field.

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:59.710 align:middle line:84%
It isn't that Reich
discovered this energy.

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:01.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's been
known intuitively

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:02.860 align:middle line:90%
and people have seen it.

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:04.570 align:middle line:84%
But he's the first
one that made it

00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:07.270 align:middle line:84%
accessible from a natural
scientific viewpoint,

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:10.930 align:middle line:84%
and made it available by things
like the accumulator to where

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:12.470 align:middle line:90%
we can work with it.

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:14.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And had
anyone done anything

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:15.780 align:middle line:90%
to this sort prior to this?

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:18.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: Well you had
people with inklings

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:23.780 align:middle line:84%
in this direction-- Von
Reichenbach in Germany.

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:24.614 align:middle line:90%
The names escape me.

00:22:24.614 --> 00:22:27.154 align:middle line:84%
But there's a list of people
who have worked with things that

00:22:27.154 --> 00:22:28.930 align:middle line:84%
are similar to this,
but Reich was really

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:31.290 align:middle line:84%
the one who made the
big breakthroughs.

00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:34.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Before we go into
some of the other inventions

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:36.140 align:middle line:84%
that he had and how
they were utilized,

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:38.450 align:middle line:84%
what would you say the
historical significance

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:42.200 align:middle line:84%
of just creating this
orgone accumulator was?

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: Well,
historical significance

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:51.400 align:middle line:84%
is in terms of medicine and
treatment of somatic diseases.

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.470 align:middle line:84%
Theodore Wolfe said
the orgone accumulator

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:56.540 align:middle line:84%
is the most important discovery
in the history of medicine,

00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:58.214 align:middle line:90%
bar none.

00:22:58.214 --> 00:22:59.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Makes sense.

00:22:59.130 --> 00:22:59.990 align:middle line:90%
Life force.

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:03.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: And other people
have said very similar things.

00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:05.655 align:middle line:84%
There's a Dr.
Kavouras in Germany

00:23:05.655 --> 00:23:08.810 align:middle line:84%
who treats-- He's
one of the few who

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:11.370 align:middle line:84%
has a clinic where he
treats people with this.

00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:14.920 align:middle line:84%
And he finds, as many
American physicians have,

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:17.650 align:middle line:84%
that the treatment of
severe burns, in particular,

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:20.400 align:middle line:84%
with the accumulator is
nothing less than miraculous.

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:24.170 align:middle line:84%
He says the failure
to treat severe burns

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:26.150 align:middle line:84%
with the orgone
accumulator constitutes

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:27.250 align:middle line:90%
medical malpractice.

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:29.270 align:middle line:90%
It is so good in this.

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And yet, in this
country, the FDA-- bam!

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:34.244 align:middle line:90%
They smashed it apart.

00:23:34.244 --> 00:23:35.410 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we're getting ahead.

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:38.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We know that
from him and other guests.

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:41.710 align:middle line:84%
This has been a pattern
for many decades now.

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:42.830 align:middle line:90%
What about cancer?

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:45.390 align:middle line:84%
He was working with some
clients with cancer?

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:48.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: He did experimental
cancer therapy with people.

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:50.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What kind of
results was he seeing?

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.580 align:middle line:90%
>>DEMEO: Mixed results.

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:54.560 align:middle line:84%
Because what he found
is that the accumulator

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:55.970 align:middle line:90%
disintegrated tumors.

00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:59.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you had a tumor that's
on the exterior of the body,

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:02.610 align:middle line:84%
it's not such a problem, because
the detritus, the breakdown

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:05.500 align:middle line:84%
products, then discharge
outside yourself.

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:08.120 align:middle line:84%
But if you have a
deep organ tumor

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:09.990 align:middle line:84%
and it begins to
break down, the body

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:12.360 align:middle line:84%
can be flooded with
detritus, And then you

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:15.480 align:middle line:84%
get a clogging of the liver
and the kidneys and the lungs,

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:19.581 align:middle line:84%
and people can die from the
secondary complications.

00:24:19.581 --> 00:24:21.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let me
ask you a question.

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:23.820 align:middle line:84%
What if that were utilized with
a lot of what's known today

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:25.732 align:middle line:84%
that detoxes the body
at the same time?

00:24:25.732 --> 00:24:26.440 align:middle line:90%
>>DEMEO: Exactly.

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:28.770 align:middle line:84%
And some of the physicians
that work with this,

00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:30.740 align:middle line:84%
they advocated going
on the Gerson coffee

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:34.470 align:middle line:90%
enemas and dietary changes.

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:37.550 align:middle line:84%
You can't have a diet of
potato chips and M and Ms

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:41.980 align:middle line:84%
and expect to sit in the--
drinking alcohol to no end

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:44.270 align:middle line:84%
and expect to sit in
an orgone accumulator

00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:45.145 align:middle line:90%
and come out dancing.

00:24:45.145 --> 00:24:46.269 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, absolutely.

00:24:46.269 --> 00:24:48.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've interviewed
Charlotte Gerson

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:53.100 align:middle line:84%
and the results they get down
there, also, they're not mixed.

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:54.520 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they're beyond mixed.

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:56.070 align:middle line:84%
They're getting very
positive results

00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:59.190 align:middle line:84%
just by simply cleaning the
body out and giving it a chance

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:01.230 align:middle line:84%
to let that life force
work inside itself

00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:02.580 align:middle line:90%
with its own intelligence.

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:04.540 align:middle line:84%
It seems like that's a
marriage made in heaven.

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:06.190 align:middle line:90%
>>DEMEO: It is, in my opinion.

00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:08.160 align:middle line:84%
But you know, Reich
was just at the point

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:11.900 align:middle line:84%
of showing what the
accumulator could

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:14.690 align:middle line:84%
do when all these attacks
descended upon him here

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:15.930 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:18.820 align:middle line:84%
So he started getting
attacked just at the time

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:24.170 align:middle line:84%
when his work was showing really
great, productive results.

00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:26.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which area of
his work and research

00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:27.820 align:middle line:90%
were they coming after him?

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:29.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: Well,
the FDA originally

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:33.056 align:middle line:84%
came after Reich on the
basis of a sex racket.

00:25:33.056 --> 00:25:33.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sex racket?

00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:35.510 align:middle line:90%
>>DEMEO: So-called sex racket.

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:40.190 align:middle line:84%
There were articles published
in the American press accusing

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:44.220 align:middle line:84%
Reich of using the
accumulator for some kind

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:45.380 align:middle line:90%
of sexual purposes.

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:47.399 align:middle line:84%
That he was-- It was
totally conjured up.

00:25:47.399 --> 00:25:48.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I've read about that.

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:49.648 align:middle line:90%
I've read the articles.

00:25:49.648 --> 00:25:52.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: Totally lies,
totally distorted.

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:55.520 align:middle line:84%
But you know, they
wouldn't publish rebuttals.

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:59.570 align:middle line:84%
And people's sexual anxieties
and the general public

00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:02.880 align:middle line:84%
get engaged, and so one
repeats after the other.

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And there was what Reich
called an emotional chain

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:10.610 align:middle line:84%
reaction, where just as happened
in Europe with the Communist

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:13.270 align:middle line:84%
and the Nazi press, you had
the press in the United States

00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:16.450 align:middle line:84%
began repeating, parroting
one after the other.

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:18.190 align:middle line:84%
And Reich used to
say-- and I think

00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:20.340 align:middle line:84%
he got this from Winston
Churchill-- he says,

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:23.290 align:middle line:84%
the big lie spreads
halfway around the world

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:26.373 align:middle line:84%
before the truth can
hardly get its trousers on.

00:26:26.373 --> 00:26:27.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:30.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: So yeah,
he tried to chase

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:35.760 align:middle line:84%
after these lies with the
truth, but eventually this

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:38.640 align:middle line:84%
triggered an investigation
from the FDA.

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.800 align:middle line:84%
They looked for,
but didn't find,

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:44.030 align:middle line:84%
any evidence for the
so-called sex racket.

00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And so then they went after
the orgone energy accumulator.

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:50.350 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't
really investigate it

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:51.420 align:middle line:90%
in any decent way.

00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:56.270 align:middle line:84%
They just assumed the
standard popular press

00:26:56.270 --> 00:26:59.692 align:middle line:90%
lies were what it was.

00:26:59.692 --> 00:27:01.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we'll get
to what happened to him

00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:05.080 align:middle line:84%
after that a little bit
later in our conversation.

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:08.230 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to say there, you have
the box that we've seen here

00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:10.320 align:middle line:84%
in the imagery, but there's
also a larger chamber

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:11.940 align:middle line:84%
that a person can
actually sit in.

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:12.641 align:middle line:90%
>>DEMEO: Yes.

00:27:12.641 --> 00:27:13.140 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:13.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you
tell us about that?

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:14.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: I built
several of these.

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:16.344 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I wrote
a book about it.

00:27:16.344 --> 00:27:18.470 align:middle line:84%
I found the doctors
in the United States

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:21.694 align:middle line:84%
had been slammed so hard by the
FDA and the medical societies,

00:27:21.694 --> 00:27:22.610 align:middle line:90%
they were immobilized.

00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:25.370 align:middle line:84%
They felt if they talked
about this too openly,

00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:27.210 align:middle line:84%
they would be
attacked themselves.

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:28.730 align:middle line:90%
So I was a young man.

00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:30.500 align:middle line:84%
Reich was dead
for several years.

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:32.650 align:middle line:84%
And I wind up building
these accumulators,

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:36.520 align:middle line:84%
and I could verify
many of the phenomenon

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:37.530 align:middle line:90%
that Reich talked about.

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And over the years,
I've dedicated

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:43.202 align:middle line:84%
a lot of time and energy
after I became a-- got my PhD

00:27:43.202 --> 00:27:44.910 align:middle line:84%
and became a professor
in the university.

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:50.010 align:middle line:84%
So I began making very good
experimental replications

00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:52.170 align:middle line:90%
of Reich's work.

00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:54.260 align:middle line:84%
Except I don't treat
people medically,

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:58.560 align:middle line:84%
but I tested the accumulator
out for the effect on plants.

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:01.000 align:middle line:84%
And found I could
boost the seedlings buy

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.667 align:middle line:84%
37% with very tightly controlled
experimental protocols.

00:28:04.667 --> 00:28:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And I have some pictures
I think I gave you.

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:06.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes we do.

00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:07.800 align:middle line:90%
We're taking a look.

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And now this is
across the board?

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:11.900 align:middle line:90%
I mean, a variety of seedlings?

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:13.290 align:middle line:90%
This was an average response?

00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:16.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: Well, I found a--
I developed a protocol that

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:19.090 align:middle line:84%
used mung bean seeds, because
they were fairly easy to get.

00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:22.419 align:middle line:84%
And that way other people
could replicate the protocol.

00:28:22.419 --> 00:28:25.085 align:middle line:84%
Other people have done-- There's
an organic gardener in Portugal

00:28:25.085 --> 00:28:27.600 align:middle line:84%
who got very exceptionally
good results.

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And she was systematically
doing different garden seeds

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:33.210 align:middle line:84%
and found that
she could increase

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:37.715 align:middle line:84%
the yield of her vegetable
garden quite dramatically.

00:28:37.715 --> 00:28:39.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
interesting, because if you

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:43.870 align:middle line:84%
look to the work of Rudolf
Steiner, and some other people,

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:46.000 align:middle line:84%
another man I interviewed
who is no longer with us,

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.820 align:middle line:90%
I mean, and indigenous people.

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:52.340 align:middle line:84%
They knew to try to use the most
saturated energies, life force

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:54.960 align:middle line:84%
energies, by planting
by a certain--

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:55.880 align:middle line:90%
>>DEMEO: Lunar cycles.

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:56.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Lunar cycle.

00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:57.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:00.224 align:middle line:84%
And this, you can totally
manage and control.

00:29:00.224 --> 00:29:02.640 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like you don't have
to wait for the lunar cycle.

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:04.681 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: Well, it works
best if you combine them.

00:29:04.681 --> 00:29:07.060 align:middle line:84%
You know, charge your
seeds in the accumulator

00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:08.972 align:middle line:90%
during the full moon.

00:29:08.972 --> 00:29:11.180 align:middle line:84%
Then you get some really,
really interesting results.

00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:15.230 align:middle line:84%
What was interesting from this
Portuguese farmer, a woman

00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:18.660 align:middle line:84%
named Yuta Espunka, she
found that the effects

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:21.976 align:middle line:84%
were transmittable to
the second generation.

00:29:21.976 --> 00:29:22.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:25.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: Yeah, you get the
seeds from the charged group

00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:28.420 align:middle line:84%
of seeds-- from the charged
vegetables or fruits,

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:31.260 align:middle line:84%
and you save them and plant them
again without charging them,

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:33.770 align:middle line:84%
and they show better results
than the seeds from the control

00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:33.940 align:middle line:90%
groups.

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:35.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it has to be
changing them genetically.

00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:36.450 align:middle line:90%
>>DEMEO: Well, what is genetics?

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:37.810 align:middle line:90%
You know, this is another issue.

00:29:37.810 --> 00:29:40.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
it's theoretically

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.060 align:middle line:84%
a web of intelligence
of some kind.

00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:43.893 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: Well, it's
something that's innate.

00:29:43.893 --> 00:29:45.162 align:middle line:90%
Let's leave it at that.

00:29:45.162 --> 00:29:47.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, those
would be genetically altered,

00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:49.887 align:middle line:90%
but perhaps in a good way.

00:29:49.887 --> 00:29:51.720 align:middle line:84%
And so what is it doing
to human beings that

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:53.210 align:middle line:90%
are spending time in there?

00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:55.080 align:middle line:90%
Is it also affecting our DNA?

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: Well I would think that
it reshapes you to-- you know,

00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:01.220 align:middle line:84%
it isn't like just
sitting in the accumulator

00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:05.250 align:middle line:84%
is going to change
your life necessarily.

00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:08.560 align:middle line:84%
But it's the whole business of
getting your breathing deeper,

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:10.540 align:middle line:90%
of changing your diet.

00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:12.260 align:middle line:90%
And use the accumulator.

00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:16.545 align:middle line:84%
I think what's needed is one
of these blinded experiments

00:30:16.545 --> 00:30:22.950 align:middle line:84%
where-- a protocol where
you have 100 families, all

00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:25.370 align:middle line:84%
of which who are given
an orgone accumulator

00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:27.980 align:middle line:84%
and asked to use
it as they want.

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
another 100 families

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:33.830 align:middle line:84%
that are of the same
socioeconomic background, age

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:34.610 align:middle line:90%
group, and so on.

00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:36.190 align:middle line:90%
A control group that aren't.

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:38.730 align:middle line:84%
And then you look at
their health down the road

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:39.522 align:middle line:90%
and see what it is.

00:30:39.522 --> 00:30:41.313 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That would
be really fascinating.

00:30:41.313 --> 00:30:43.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: We have a
good double-- two

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:45.360 align:middle line:84%
good double blind
controlled experiments

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:49.600 align:middle line:84%
on the orgone accumulator on
basic physiological measures.

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.390 align:middle line:84%
One from the University
of Marburg in Germany,

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:55.740 align:middle line:84%
and another from the University
of Vienna in Austria.

00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And they both
corroborated Reich on this

00:30:58.410 --> 00:31:00.205 align:middle line:84%
in a statistically
significant manner.

00:31:00.205 --> 00:31:01.330 align:middle line:90%
And they've been published.

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:03.180 align:middle line:84%
But it's one of these
kinds of research

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:06.150 align:middle line:84%
that nobody knows,
because it's not

00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:07.410 align:middle line:90%
promoted in the popular media.

00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:08.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, I understand.

00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:10.110 align:middle line:84%
Popular media has
been very mean to him

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:11.200 align:middle line:90%
the last couple of years.

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:11.620 align:middle line:90%
>>DEMEO: Yes.

00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We talked
off camera a little bit

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:15.310 align:middle line:84%
and I think you said there's
been-- a book came out

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:19.300 align:middle line:84%
and there's been a resurgence
of attack, new rounds of attack

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:21.949 align:middle line:84%
on Reich the last couple of
years, which is why there's

00:31:21.949 --> 00:31:23.740 align:middle line:84%
a plethora of articles
out there right now.

00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:24.323 align:middle line:90%
>>DEMEO: Yeah.

00:31:24.323 --> 00:31:26.130 align:middle line:90%
And it is really incredible.

00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:29.110 align:middle line:84%
The top newspapers
and magazines--

00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:29.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Such as?

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:33.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: Have no interest
in the authentic facts

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:34.370 align:middle line:90%
of Reich's work.

00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:39.500 align:middle line:84%
But the New York Times, the
London Observer, The Telegraph,

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:42.880 align:middle line:84%
The Independent, The
Los Angeles Times.

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:45.100 align:middle line:84%
You know, it just
boggles the mind.

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:48.360 align:middle line:84%
They publish slander, sexual
slander, against Reich.

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:53.500 align:middle line:84%
Making jokes about the orgone
accumulator as a sex box.

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And all of this
research that's done by

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:59.130 align:middle line:84%
credentialed scientists
working in universities

00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:02.300 align:middle line:84%
or in private clinics,
documenting their work

00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:04.950 align:middle line:84%
with exceptional care, and they
don't want to hear about it.

00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:06.300 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to
know anything about it.

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:08.883 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well then you almost
have to get into what would be,

00:32:08.883 --> 00:32:11.440 align:middle line:84%
I think, probably
accurately termed,

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:14.190 align:middle line:84%
a very much larger
conspiracy theory.

00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:16.890 align:middle line:84%
Keeping that man's work
away, keeping that technology

00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:18.400 align:middle line:84%
out of the hands
of the individual.

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And it is interesting
technology,

00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:22.380 align:middle line:84%
just to do a quick switch
away from that subject.

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:25.440 align:middle line:84%
We were at your place
a few years ago taping.

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:27.490 align:middle line:90%
I did two interviews with you.

00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:29.930 align:middle line:84%
The second tape
was going out-- we

00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:33.300 align:middle line:90%
went out to your accumulators.

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:35.450 align:middle line:84%
You had the large box
and the small one,

00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:39.465 align:middle line:84%
and everything disappeared
from that digital tape.

00:32:39.465 --> 00:32:41.840 align:middle line:84%
We got home, we were so excited
about all the cover video

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:42.800 align:middle line:90%
and the interview.

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:44.460 align:middle line:90%
There was nothing there.

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:47.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: Well we went into the
large orgone energy dark room--

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:49.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: With the camera.

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:52.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: And what we find
is that the electronics

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:56.950 align:middle line:84%
of circuits often are strangely
affected by concentrated orgone

00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:57.450 align:middle line:90%
energy.

00:32:57.450 --> 00:32:59.166 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We'll vouch for that.

00:32:59.166 --> 00:33:02.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: You know, what we find
is, for example, Reich talked

00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:06.700 align:middle line:84%
about if you charged up Geiger
tubes, that vacuum was--

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:08.490 align:middle line:84%
the properties of
the vacuum, which

00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:11.090 align:middle line:84%
is a partial vacuum in
the Geiger-Muller tube,

00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:12.270 align:middle line:90%
is affected.

00:33:12.270 --> 00:33:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And Reich was saying you could
get very high counts per minute

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:19.270 align:middle line:84%
from a standard Geiger tube from
ordinary background radiation.

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:21.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've been able
to verify that.

00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:25.120 align:middle line:84%
We get up to 4,000 counts per
minute from the orgone charged

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:28.360 align:middle line:84%
Geiger tube, while the control
one is just chirping away

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:29.765 align:middle line:90%
at 5 or 10 counts per minute.

00:33:29.765 --> 00:33:30.473 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:33:30.473 --> 00:33:32.910 align:middle line:90%
>>DEMEO: Oh, yeah.

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:35.880 align:middle line:84%
So Reich was
actually-- he developed

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:38.520 align:middle line:90%
from this principle a motor.

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:39.900 align:middle line:90%
He said this is a motor force.

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:44.350 align:middle line:84%
You're getting all these intense
pulses out of these vacuums.

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:47.610 align:middle line:84%
He made special vacuum tubes
of a much deeper vacuum

00:33:47.610 --> 00:33:51.555 align:middle line:84%
and he hooked it through
circuitry to a motor

00:33:51.555 --> 00:33:54.220 align:middle line:84%
and was able to get a
motor to turn from this.

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:56.900 align:middle line:84%
Now the details on this
were never fully published.

00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And nobody has really
corroborated that.

00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:00.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's another
type of free energy.

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:01.905 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: So it's a
type of free energy.

00:34:01.905 --> 00:34:04.760 align:middle line:84%
You hear about people talking
about zero point vacuum

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:05.850 align:middle line:90%
fluctuation and so on.

00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:08.659 align:middle line:84%
Reich was one of the first to
do this with these high vacuum

00:34:08.659 --> 00:34:09.570 align:middle line:90%
tubes.

00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:13.989 align:middle line:84%
And it's a bit of research
just begging to be replicated,

00:34:13.989 --> 00:34:19.130 align:middle line:84%
but the problem is, nobody
funds this research.

00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:21.170 align:middle line:84%
All my work is done
with great difficulty

00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:24.530 align:middle line:84%
out of my own pocket, with
some private donor money,

00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:29.650 align:middle line:84%
but nothing to speak of in terms
of modern scientific research.

00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:30.695 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:34:30.695 --> 00:34:31.610 align:middle line:90%
Well, OK.

00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:34.250 align:middle line:84%
So now let's take
it out to the cosmos

00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:36.500 align:middle line:84%
a little bit, as we talked
about a little bit earlier.

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:39.400 align:middle line:84%
He said that there is a
solar terrestrial component

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:40.620 align:middle line:90%
to this energy.

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:41.799 align:middle line:90%
And as above, so below.

00:34:41.799 --> 00:34:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to get into
cloud busting and all of it.

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:45.000 align:middle line:90%
>>DEMEO: Yes.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.340 align:middle line:84%
Well you think of the high
vacuum being permeated

00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:51.469 align:middle line:84%
with an energy that gives high
pulses with a Geiger counter,

00:34:51.469 --> 00:34:52.750 align:middle line:90%
or that can turn a motor.

00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:56.010 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about something
that's in the atmosphere,

00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:59.300 align:middle line:84%
but after you exclude
all of the atmosphere,

00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:01.740 align:middle line:84%
exclude all the
molecules of air.

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:02.920 align:middle line:90%
Something is in there.

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:04.650 align:middle line:84%
Now Reich was one
of the first people

00:35:04.650 --> 00:35:08.080 align:middle line:84%
to point out that the
Earth has an energy field.

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:11.650 align:middle line:84%
What he called the orgone
energy envelope of the Earth.

00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:17.280 align:middle line:84%
And he pointed to this long
before the astronauts came back

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:19.050 align:middle line:84%
with pictures of
the Earth showing

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:25.820 align:middle line:84%
that it has this blue-- the blue
aura of the Earth, if you will.

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:28.910 align:middle line:84%
And today, of course--
well, let me back up.

00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:32.940 align:middle line:84%
During Reich's time, the theory
was that space was empty.

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:34.411 align:middle line:90%
Totally empty space.

00:35:34.411 --> 00:35:34.910 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:35.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It was a vacuum.

00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:36.400 align:middle line:90%
Truly a vacuum.

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: It was a total
vacuum of emptiness.

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:41.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you go back
100 years earlier,

00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:43.440 align:middle line:84%
they talked about
the ether of space.

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:45.250 align:middle line:90%
But that was done away with.

00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:48.210 align:middle line:84%
Then in Reich's time,
you had Einstein's theory

00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:52.810 align:middle line:84%
and all of the empty space
theory, which was very popular.

00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:55.100 align:middle line:84%
Today, they're getting
back to the idea

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:57.400 align:middle line:84%
that there must be
something out there.

00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's given the name dark
matter, or the neutrino sea,

00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:03.340 align:middle line:90%
or the interstellar media.

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:05.910 align:middle line:84%
They have all different
kinds of terms for something

00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:11.620 align:middle line:84%
is out there, beyond just
merely ions or magnetic fields.

00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:15.160 align:middle line:84%
But ions and magnetic
fields and electrical fields

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:18.840 align:middle line:84%
combined, you know, they talk
about the plasma of space.

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:20.315 align:middle line:90%
And that gets closer.

00:36:20.315 --> 00:36:22.030 align:middle line:90%
But I don't think--

00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:25.750 align:middle line:84%
One of the criticisms of that
from the classical narrow minds

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:29.660 align:middle line:84%
is that there's not enough
ions or magnetic field

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:33.947 align:middle line:84%
or electric field to really
account for a true plasma.

00:36:33.947 --> 00:36:35.780 align:middle line:84%
But nevertheless, there's
all kinds of stuff

00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:39.330 align:middle line:84%
you can see out in space
that behaves like a plasma.

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:42.410 align:middle line:84%
So what's going on, I think,
is it's orgone energy.

00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:44.850 align:middle line:84%
It's the same energy
that Reich discovered.

00:36:44.850 --> 00:36:49.020 align:middle line:84%
It has components of a plasma,
but it's not exactly that.

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:50.790 align:middle line:84%
It's something that's
a little bit more.

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:52.550 align:middle line:90%
It's a life energy.

00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:53.820 align:middle line:90%
It's a life energy.

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And our instruments are, at the
present time, able to pick up

00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:59.330 align:middle line:90%
on only parts of it.

00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:01.760 align:middle line:90%
Not the whole thing.

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:04.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now that gets into
the whole subject of interface

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:06.401 align:middle line:84%
with our atmosphere
and moisture.

00:37:06.401 --> 00:37:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And I want to get back
to that box for a moment,

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:11.460 align:middle line:84%
because as I was
reading about this,

00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:13.970 align:middle line:84%
something was-- and I don't
even know what the question is,

00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:17.250 align:middle line:84%
exactly, except that he
found that inside the box--

00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:22.150 align:middle line:84%
the accumulator-- evaporation
did not occur at the same rate

00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:23.360 align:middle line:90%
as it does on the outside.

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:26.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, is that a matter of
it simply being enclosed?

00:37:26.490 --> 00:37:28.310 align:middle line:84%
Or is there something
else at play there?

00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:31.040 align:middle line:84%
Because that's very interesting,
as we all dehydrate.

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:31.980 align:middle line:90%
Everything dehydrates.

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:33.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: Well, he found
that orgone energy

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:39.600 align:middle line:84%
and water had a strong mutual
affinity for each other.

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:43.340 align:middle line:84%
That if you had-- if you
were making experiments

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:46.780 align:middle line:84%
with the orgone
accumulator, over time,

00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:49.650 align:middle line:84%
that the bright, sunny
days gave the best results.

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And rainy, overcast days
gave questionable results.

00:37:53.350 --> 00:37:56.730 align:middle line:84%
You get up to about
50% relative humidity

00:37:56.730 --> 00:37:58.470 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of the
physical effects

00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:03.750 align:middle line:84%
of the orgone accumulator, like
certain physics experiments

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:06.260 align:middle line:84%
that you can measure the
orgone energy phenomenon,

00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:09.030 align:middle line:84%
they become very difficult to
measure under high humidity.

00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:10.560 align:middle line:84%
Under the low
humidity conditions,

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:13.280 align:middle line:84%
they're very-- much
easier to measure,

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:15.040 align:middle line:90%
or they give stronger results.

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:16.680 align:middle line:84%
So this got him
thinking that there

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:19.770 align:middle line:84%
was a relationship
between rainy overcast

00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:22.070 align:middle line:90%
days and the orgone energy.

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:25.610 align:middle line:84%
That water was absorbing the
energy out of the atmosphere,

00:38:25.610 --> 00:38:28.085 align:middle line:84%
therefore making less of
it available at the Earth's

00:38:28.085 --> 00:38:28.585 align:middle line:90%
surface.

00:38:28.585 --> 00:38:30.543 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What would it
be doing in our bodies?

00:38:30.543 --> 00:38:33.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: Well, you know, when
you have rainy, overcast days,

00:38:33.310 --> 00:38:37.880 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people will sort
of be more relaxed, low key.

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:43.635 align:middle line:84%
Because some people get
triggering of health symptoms

00:38:43.635 --> 00:38:45.512 align:middle line:90%
that they have.

00:38:45.512 --> 00:38:46.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
think about this,

00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:48.303 align:middle line:90%
people go to live in the desert.

00:38:48.303 --> 00:38:50.316 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times in
the retirement years,

00:38:50.316 --> 00:38:51.690 align:middle line:84%
they want to go
to the desert, be

00:38:51.690 --> 00:38:54.080 align:middle line:84%
in the sunshine, clear
skies, and so forth.

00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the people end
up looking much more vital

00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:58.310 align:middle line:90%
than you would find elsewhere.

00:38:58.310 --> 00:38:59.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: Sunlight
is very powerful.

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:04.670 align:middle line:84%
And Reich also thought the sun
was radiating, or exciting,

00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:06.212 align:middle line:84%
at the very least,
the orgone energy.

00:39:06.212 --> 00:39:07.836 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I was getting to.

00:39:07.836 --> 00:39:09.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: And getting
people charged up.

00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:12.040 align:middle line:84%
In his laboratory
in Oslo, he had

00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:15.660 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of energy-radiating
structures there,

00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:18.660 align:middle line:84%
and he was getting a
tan through his skin

00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:21.537 align:middle line:84%
just from the orgone
radiation, even

00:39:21.537 --> 00:39:23.120 align:middle line:84%
though it was in the
middle of winter.

00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:25.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:39:25.110 --> 00:39:25.700 align:middle line:90%
Well, OK.

00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:27.820 align:middle line:84%
Those are just asides I
wanted to sneak in there,

00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:29.660 align:middle line:84%
because I wanted to get to
the whole notion of the cloud

00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:30.160 align:middle line:90%
buster.

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:32.230 align:middle line:84%
I think we've talked
about the box.

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:33.370 align:middle line:90%
We just touched on it.

00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:35.536 align:middle line:84%
I mean, really, you have
to take a look at the book.

00:39:35.536 --> 00:39:36.920 align:middle line:90%
And we can build our own boxes.

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:38.560 align:middle line:84%
This is not something
that's exotic.

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:39.770 align:middle line:84%
We can do it
ourselves, and we'll

00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:41.228 align:middle line:84%
get to that at the
end of the show.

00:39:41.228 --> 00:39:42.870 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
the cloud buster.

00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:43.870 align:middle line:90%
>>DEMEO: Yes.

00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:47.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, Reich stumbled over-- it
was one of these other things

00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:51.530 align:middle line:84%
that by some key
perceptive observations,

00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:54.420 align:middle line:84%
he observed that a
set of pipes lying

00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:58.290 align:middle line:84%
on the ground near
Lake Lookmoosemeguntic.

00:39:58.290 --> 00:39:59.080 align:middle line:90%
It's a--

00:39:59.080 --> 00:39:59.948 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Easy for you to say.

00:39:59.948 --> 00:40:00.823 align:middle line:90%
>>DEMEO: Indian word.

00:40:00.823 --> 00:40:02.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:04.930 align:middle line:84%
Mooselookmeguntic--
one of the two.

00:40:04.930 --> 00:40:07.030 align:middle line:84%
These pipes were
lying on the ground

00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:09.680 align:middle line:84%
with one end near
the water's edge

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:11.560 align:middle line:84%
and the other pointing
up in the atmosphere.

00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And he noticed, my
gosh, there's some kind

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:17.050 align:middle line:84%
of a change in the cloud
forms in that area.

00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:19.580 align:middle line:84%
So he did some further
experimentation,

00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:21.610 align:middle line:84%
and he developed this
instrument-- eventually

00:40:21.610 --> 00:40:25.910 align:middle line:84%
developed this instrument called
the clou-- which the slang

00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:28.570 align:middle line:84%
term is cloud busting,
but the technical term

00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:30.530 align:middle line:90%
is cosmic orgone engineering.

00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:32.380 align:middle line:84%
Because what he
found is that this

00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:34.630 align:middle line:84%
could change the
distribution of orgone energy

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:36.340 align:middle line:90%
charge in the atmosphere.

00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And he used this
not only to show

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:42.420 align:middle line:84%
that you could bust clouds,
as per cloud busting,

00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:46.110 align:middle line:84%
that pointing it at a cloud
would cause it to dissipate,

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:49.530 align:middle line:84%
but that the clouds in
the surrounding area

00:40:49.530 --> 00:40:51.260 align:middle line:90%
suddenly got bigger.

00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:54.450 align:middle line:84%
So there was this what he
called the orgonotic potential

00:40:54.450 --> 00:40:59.270 align:middle line:84%
at work that, when one orgone
energy system got stronger,

00:40:59.270 --> 00:41:01.630 align:middle line:84%
just as another one
was getting weaker.

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:02.130 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:41:02.130 --> 00:41:04.050 align:middle line:84%
So one is dissipating
while the other

00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:08.170 align:middle line:84%
is growing in a
pulsation, so to speak.

00:41:08.170 --> 00:41:10.000 align:middle line:84%
Now he did further
experimentation

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.340 align:middle line:84%
with this with the
cloud busting device.

00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And he found that by using
it on certain key points

00:41:16.050 --> 00:41:22.110 align:middle line:84%
on the horizon and other places,
that you could bring moisture

00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:24.470 align:middle line:90%
into an area that was dry.

00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:27.670 align:middle line:84%
So it became a tool,
an experimental tool,

00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:29.790 align:middle line:90%
for ending of drought.

00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:31.232 align:middle line:90%
And he did this several--

00:41:31.232 --> 00:41:33.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He did in the eastern
United States, as I recall?

00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:34.606 align:middle line:90%
>>DEMEO: That's right.

00:41:34.606 --> 00:41:36.150 align:middle line:84%
And particularly,
there was one time

00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:38.000 align:middle line:84%
when a group of
blueberry farmers

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.510 align:middle line:84%
were having a severe
drought in his area.

00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And they paid him a
couple of thousand bucks,

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:44.215 align:middle line:90%
and he brought rain for them.

00:41:44.215 --> 00:41:45.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:47.831 align:middle line:90%
The best rain dance.

00:41:47.831 --> 00:41:48.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:48.330 --> 00:41:52.834 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: Yeah, so I--
this was in the mid '50s

00:41:52.834 --> 00:41:54.000 align:middle line:90%
when he was doing this work.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.110 align:middle line:84%
He actually went
to Tucson, Arizona

00:41:56.110 --> 00:41:58.210 align:middle line:84%
under the very harsh
conditions there.

00:41:58.210 --> 00:42:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And he found that he could green
up some of the local desert

00:42:01.570 --> 00:42:04.770 align:middle line:84%
landscape and
increase the rains.

00:42:04.770 --> 00:42:10.830 align:middle line:84%
And this is written up in
one of his last bits of work.

00:42:10.830 --> 00:42:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And by that time, the
FDA clamped down on him

00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:16.580 align:middle line:90%
and he was in prison.

00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:17.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:18.120 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:20.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: And all of the
books on this subject

00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:23.100 align:middle line:84%
were burned by the
federal government.

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:25.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, it's
just so primitive.

00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:28.030 align:middle line:84%
It's just amazing
that happens still.

00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:31.140 align:middle line:84%
And you continued those
experiments and that work.

00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And you have been
contracted by certain--

00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:35.515 align:middle line:90%
was it by governments?

00:42:35.515 --> 00:42:38.050 align:middle line:84%
I know in the case
of Eritrea, Israel.

00:42:38.050 --> 00:42:39.560 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: Initially,
my work on this

00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:42.880 align:middle line:84%
was at the University of Kansas
when I was a graduate student.

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And I said, look, I
said, here we are.

00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:48.480 align:middle line:84%
We're studying climate and
drought and the problems

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:50.840 align:middle line:84%
of human society
under severe drought.

00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And this was when all
those horrible pictures

00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:55.880 align:middle line:84%
came from Ethiopia
with starving people.

00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I want to
try this thing out.

00:42:58.350 --> 00:42:59.470 align:middle line:90%
Let's see if it works.

00:42:59.470 --> 00:43:01.080 align:middle line:84%
If it works, it's
a big breakthrough.

00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:04.690 align:middle line:84%
So I had professors there and
they said, OK, let's do this.

00:43:04.690 --> 00:43:05.775 align:middle line:90%
Let's try it out.

00:43:05.775 --> 00:43:06.350 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:08.270 align:middle line:84%
They were very open
minded, very supportive.

00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:11.990 align:middle line:84%
And I had the university
support system to work with.

00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:13.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's pretty amazing.

00:43:13.410 --> 00:43:14.740 align:middle line:90%
>>DEMEO: Very amazing, in fact.

00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And so I had one of
these instruments,

00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:20.099 align:middle line:84%
I built it, a big device
sitting on a trailer.

00:43:20.099 --> 00:43:21.265 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you can see.

00:43:21.265 --> 00:43:22.180 align:middle line:90%
This is huge.

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:25.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: And I parked it out
for the experimental work

00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:28.900 align:middle line:84%
on the farm of Professor Robert
Nunley, who was a gem of a guy

00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:31.110 align:middle line:84%
and really opened
the doors for me.

00:43:31.110 --> 00:43:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And we tested it out
over a two year period

00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:37.590 align:middle line:84%
and was able to show that
when this device was worked

00:43:37.590 --> 00:43:40.400 align:middle line:84%
for a couple of hours,
that the rainfall patterns

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:44.590 align:middle line:84%
over the whole state of Kansas,
which was the study area,

00:43:44.590 --> 00:43:45.530 align:middle line:90%
were affected.

00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:49.620 align:middle line:84%
And that the clouds got
bigger, the rains got heavier.

00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:52.320 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to
show quantitatively

00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:55.770 align:middle line:84%
from the rainfall data that
you had these peaks in rainfall

00:43:55.770 --> 00:43:58.660 align:middle line:84%
following fairly quickly
after a couple of hours

00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:01.440 align:middle line:84%
of work with this
cloud buster device.

00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:05.894 align:middle line:84%
Now, this was a
breakthrough study.

00:44:05.894 --> 00:44:07.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So is it,
would you say, then,

00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:09.595 align:middle line:90%
is it robbing Peter to pay Paul?

00:44:09.595 --> 00:44:11.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: In this case,
it doesn't seem to be,

00:44:11.470 --> 00:44:14.050 align:middle line:84%
because the effects
from cloud busting

00:44:14.050 --> 00:44:17.300 align:middle line:84%
are not permanently tied to
the use of the instrument.

00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:21.102 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not putting
any chemicals into the sky.

00:44:21.102 --> 00:44:22.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not
using any electricity.

00:44:22.810 --> 00:44:23.360 align:middle line:90%
It's a hollow device.

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:24.859 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: It's not
using electricity,

00:44:24.859 --> 00:44:27.930 align:middle line:84%
there's no electromagnetic
frequencies that we know of.

00:44:27.930 --> 00:44:30.280 align:middle line:84%
It's sitting like
a passive antenna,

00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:31.960 align:middle line:90%
much like a lightning rod is.

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:34.200 align:middle line:90%
It's grounded, heavily grounded.

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's aim-- it's
like an antenna array,

00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:39.150 align:middle line:84%
and it can be pointed
to different parts

00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:42.150 align:middle line:84%
of the sky for
different purposes.

00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And when this is done in a
particularly correct way,

00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:47.420 align:middle line:84%
then you get these certain
atmospheric responses

00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:48.320 align:middle line:90%
that come from it.

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:51.810 align:middle line:84%
And the clouds build, and
then they propagate outwards.

00:44:51.810 --> 00:44:55.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It sounds like
a very balanced way.

00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:57.620 align:middle line:84%
If they're going to be
playing with geoengineering,

00:44:57.620 --> 00:44:59.322 align:middle line:84%
which they're
doing very heavily.

00:44:59.322 --> 00:45:01.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: Yeah, I'm against
this geoengineering stuff.

00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:02.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
they're doing it heavily.

00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And they're looking at
the risks of putting

00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:06.246 align:middle line:84%
these chemicals in
the air and so forth.

00:45:06.246 --> 00:45:08.380 align:middle line:84%
This sounds to me like
it was a really sane way

00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:11.340 align:middle line:84%
to have gone about it, if
it's really only-- if it truly

00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:14.104 align:middle line:84%
were only about creating
rain here and there.

00:45:14.104 --> 00:45:16.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: It has the
potential for destruction.

00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:16.990 align:middle line:90%
I have to say that.

00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:17.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's
talk about that.

00:45:17.690 --> 00:45:20.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: And Reich, at one
point, kept it all very secret.

00:45:20.210 --> 00:45:23.260 align:middle line:84%
He wanted it-- He wanted the
government to know about it.

00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:27.350 align:middle line:84%
He says that this has got to be
developed in a very quiet way,

00:45:27.350 --> 00:45:29.560 align:middle line:90%
otherwise there will be chaos.

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:33.110 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, the
government was hammering him.

00:45:33.110 --> 00:45:36.960 align:middle line:84%
So he decided, OK,
I better publish

00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:39.315 align:middle line:84%
this, because otherwise
it will die with me.

00:45:39.315 --> 00:45:41.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what were
the dangers of it?

00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:44.060 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: Well the dangers is,
is if you keep working day

00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:48.220 align:middle line:84%
after day with this
thing, a mild rainstorm

00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:52.100 align:middle line:84%
might be turned into a huge
damaging thunderstorm, or maybe

00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:53.930 align:middle line:90%
a tornado.

00:45:53.930 --> 00:45:56.339 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you could
trigger hurricanes with it,

00:45:56.339 --> 00:45:56.880 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:57.760 align:middle line:90%
There's all kinds of--

00:45:57.760 --> 00:45:59.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So he was able
to play with the weather

00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:00.920 align:middle line:84%
and direct weather
even back then,

00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:03.682 align:middle line:84%
but with this
essentially benign device

00:46:03.682 --> 00:46:05.140 align:middle line:84%
compared to what
they're doing now.

00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:06.670 align:middle line:90%
But that wasn't adopted.

00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:08.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: He was very
careful in his application,

00:46:08.770 --> 00:46:11.310 align:middle line:90%
as was I. I mean, 30 seconds.

00:46:11.310 --> 00:46:15.410 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes 20, 30 seconds,
1 minute of working this,

00:46:15.410 --> 00:46:17.955 align:middle line:84%
and you begin to see the
transformations taking place.

00:46:17.955 --> 00:46:19.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Now, what do you do?

00:46:19.290 --> 00:46:20.374 align:middle line:90%
It just points up?

00:46:20.374 --> 00:46:22.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: I'll describe
what I experienced once

00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:23.465 align:middle line:90%
in an operation in Florida.

00:46:23.465 --> 00:46:24.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:25.061 align:middle line:90%
>>DEMEO: Look at the sky.

00:46:25.061 --> 00:46:27.950 align:middle line:84%
It's got this steel gray
haze all over everything.

00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:30.030 align:middle line:84%
The clouds are very
weak, but there's

00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:33.080 align:middle line:84%
thin lines of clouds that are
stretching in certain areas,

00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:35.970 align:middle line:84%
and they're dark,
black looking clouds.

00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:38.740 align:middle line:84%
And everything is
immobilized, OK?

00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:41.810 align:middle line:84%
So I start to work the
cloud buster aiming

00:46:41.810 --> 00:46:45.930 align:middle line:84%
at those lines, which remind
me of like a contraction point.

00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:47.340 align:middle line:90%
Like if you had a, ugh--

00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:48.965 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like a
meridian in the body--

00:46:48.965 --> 00:46:50.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: Like I've got
a strain here, ugh.

00:46:50.810 --> 00:46:52.990 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I start working
on those and they

00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:56.180 align:middle line:84%
start evaporating within
like 20 or 30 seconds.

00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And OK, I said, well
that's interesting.

00:46:58.970 --> 00:47:00.740 align:middle line:90%
The wind is coming up.

00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:01.360 align:middle line:90%
Let me stop.

00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:02.568 align:middle line:90%
Let me just see what happens.

00:47:02.568 --> 00:47:04.320 align:middle line:90%
I stop, it continues.

00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:07.700 align:middle line:84%
The wind is coming up,
these lines disappear,

00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:11.300 align:middle line:84%
and then the other little
clouds start growing bigger.

00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:13.730 align:middle line:84%
And instead of looking
like shredded cotton,

00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:16.120 align:middle line:84%
they begin looking
like cauliflower.

00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:18.640 align:middle line:84%
And the sun breaks
out through the haze

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:20.490 align:middle line:90%
and the haze gets diminished.

00:47:20.490 --> 00:47:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And within about
six hours, there's

00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:26.120 align:middle line:84%
nice, big thunderstorms and a
frontal system moving through

00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:27.790 align:middle line:90%
with rain all over the place.

00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:30.560 align:middle line:84%
The first rain in about
five or six months.

00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:32.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It just sounds so
much more sane and healthy.

00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:34.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, geoengineering's
a reality

00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:36.850 align:middle line:84%
and it's coming to
a theater near us.

00:47:36.850 --> 00:47:37.530 align:middle line:90%
It already is.

00:47:37.530 --> 00:47:38.500 align:middle line:90%
It has been.

00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:42.080 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, what's so
galling is that this sounds

00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:46.271 align:middle line:84%
like benign, safer
type of instrumentation

00:47:46.271 --> 00:47:48.770 align:middle line:84%
could have been used all along,
if it were done responsibly.

00:47:48.770 --> 00:47:52.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: It depends on who
does it, how skilled they are.

00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:55.570 align:middle line:84%
You know, the problem is is
that people are putting plans

00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:57.560 align:middle line:84%
for cloud busters
on the internet

00:47:57.560 --> 00:47:59.610 align:middle line:84%
and saying everybody
should do it.

00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:02.440 align:middle line:84%
And so you're getting
a chaotic situation.

00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:05.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's
not good, either.

00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:08.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: It's like
Pandora's box, you know?

00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:12.885 align:middle line:84%
Pandora's box has been kicked
wide open, for better or worse.

00:48:12.885 --> 00:48:14.890 align:middle line:84%
The only bottom line
I tell people is

00:48:14.890 --> 00:48:19.700 align:middle line:84%
don't buy a house down
near a river or a creek.

00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:22.640 align:middle line:84%
Because the danger is we
go into a phase of weather

00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:27.655 align:middle line:84%
where small creeks could become
big, heavy flooding torrents.

00:48:27.655 --> 00:48:28.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:29.790 align:middle line:90%
Very unpredictable.

00:48:29.790 --> 00:48:32.580 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk a little bit
about the project in Ethiopia?

00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:34.960 align:middle line:84%
Also, the project in
Israel, and what you

00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:36.085 align:middle line:90%
were able to achieve there?

00:48:36.085 --> 00:48:37.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: After I
published my work

00:48:37.710 --> 00:48:40.310 align:middle line:84%
in the University
of Kansas, this

00:48:40.310 --> 00:48:45.720 align:middle line:84%
became known, although it
created big difficulties for me

00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:50.070 align:middle line:84%
thereafter within the
American university system.

00:48:50.070 --> 00:48:52.980 align:middle line:84%
I got phone calls,
amazingly, out of the blue--

00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:57.290 align:middle line:84%
the blue orgone--
from people who

00:48:57.290 --> 00:48:59.850 align:middle line:84%
were concerned about
drought in Israel.

00:48:59.850 --> 00:49:04.110 align:middle line:84%
This was in 1991
and there had been

00:49:04.110 --> 00:49:06.830 align:middle line:90%
a drought for about four years.

00:49:06.830 --> 00:49:09.104 align:middle line:90%
The worst drought in history.

00:49:09.104 --> 00:49:10.770 align:middle line:84%
And so they asked me
what could be done.

00:49:10.770 --> 00:49:13.145 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, a lot can
be done if you could fund it.

00:49:13.145 --> 00:49:14.830 align:middle line:84%
So we talked and
got some funding

00:49:14.830 --> 00:49:16.370 align:middle line:84%
available to bring
me over there.

00:49:16.370 --> 00:49:20.610 align:middle line:84%
We built the instrument
in Israel, tried it out,

00:49:20.610 --> 00:49:24.790 align:middle line:84%
and after about 10 days of
work going around the country

00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:29.310 align:middle line:84%
different places,
here comes a big storm

00:49:29.310 --> 00:49:30.760 align:middle line:90%
off the Mediterranean.

00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:33.930 align:middle line:84%
And usually, they were
diverted up to the north,

00:49:33.930 --> 00:49:37.060 align:middle line:84%
because again, the steel gray
haze, these blackish clouds

00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:40.660 align:middle line:84%
are all over, but there's
no rainfall for years now.

00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:43.770 align:middle line:84%
And so the reservoirs
are down to near nothing.

00:49:43.770 --> 00:49:46.550 align:middle line:84%
But this time, the
storm comes right in.

00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:49.740 align:middle line:84%
It comes right in and dumps
a lot of rain, dumps a lot

00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:50.935 align:middle line:90%
of snow.

00:49:50.935 --> 00:49:52.824 align:middle line:90%
They got snow in Jerusalem.

00:49:52.824 --> 00:49:54.740 align:middle line:84%
You might remember-- I
don't know if you know,

00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:58.530 align:middle line:84%
but they had a big
rain, snow episode

00:49:58.530 --> 00:50:00.320 align:middle line:90%
just recently in Jerusalem.

00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And they said in
the news reports,

00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:04.890 align:middle line:84%
it's the biggest rain
and snow in 20 years.

00:50:04.890 --> 00:50:08.000 align:middle line:84%
Well if you go back
20 years, that's

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.425 align:middle line:84%
when the other even bigger
rain, snow episode was.

00:50:11.425 --> 00:50:13.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
they were referring to.

00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:16.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: They're referring to
when we did our work in 1991.

00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And so the winter
of '91, '92 broke

00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:22.800 align:middle line:84%
all their historical records
going back to the Turks.

00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:27.830 align:middle line:84%
And like 100 years of
weather monitoring.

00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:30.930 align:middle line:84%
They have snow in
the Negev desert

00:50:30.930 --> 00:50:35.716 align:middle line:84%
and up on the mountains near
Eilat, which is unheard of.

00:50:35.716 --> 00:50:37.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why didn't
they continue?

00:50:37.930 --> 00:50:41.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: The
meteorologists objected.

00:50:41.250 --> 00:50:43.170 align:middle line:90%
The hydrologists objected.

00:50:43.170 --> 00:50:45.750 align:middle line:84%
They had multimillion
dollar contracts

00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:49.930 align:middle line:84%
for desalinization plants,
which is what they're doing now.

00:50:49.930 --> 00:50:52.130 align:middle line:84%
They're building these
enormously expensive

00:50:52.130 --> 00:50:56.790 align:middle line:84%
desalinization plants
that cost tens of millions

00:50:56.790 --> 00:50:59.320 align:middle line:84%
of dollars-- hundreds
of millions or billions

00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:02.730 align:middle line:84%
when you look at it overall--
with pipelines and so on.

00:51:02.730 --> 00:51:05.330 align:middle line:84%
So the irrigaters and
the infrastructure

00:51:05.330 --> 00:51:06.520 align:middle line:90%
for cloud seeding.

00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:07.740 align:middle line:90%
Israel has one of the--

00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:07.929 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:51:07.929 --> 00:51:10.387 align:middle line:84%
Politically, it was against
what was already on the agenda.

00:51:10.387 --> 00:51:12.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: The cloud seeders
are against this work.

00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:15.380 align:middle line:84%
In California, they
opposed my work.

00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:18.510 align:middle line:84%
The California cloud
seeders got me slandered

00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:21.230 align:middle line:84%
in the local
California newspapers

00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:24.350 align:middle line:84%
when I tried to introduce this
work to the state legislature

00:51:24.350 --> 00:51:25.307 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:51:25.307 --> 00:51:26.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what's
the agenda there?

00:51:26.890 --> 00:51:29.355 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: It costs maybe
tens of thousands of dollars

00:51:29.355 --> 00:51:32.540 align:middle line:84%
to do this work, as opposed
to hundreds of thousands

00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:34.990 align:middle line:90%
and millions by cloud seeding.

00:51:34.990 --> 00:51:37.840 align:middle line:90%
So there's, you know.

00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:38.600 align:middle line:90%
You know the math.

00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:40.430 align:middle line:90%
You know how the politics works.

00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:44.050 align:middle line:84%
But it's funny, they
said, we don't want rain

00:51:44.050 --> 00:51:45.760 align:middle line:90%
down here where our crops are.

00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:47.260 align:middle line:84%
We want rain up
there in mountain.

00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:50.160 align:middle line:84%
Go make it snow in the
mountains, that way it'll

00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:51.700 align:middle line:90%
drain into the reservoirs.

00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And then it'll go
into our pipelines

00:51:53.340 --> 00:51:57.350 align:middle line:84%
where we can meter it and go
out into the irrigation system.

00:51:57.350 --> 00:51:58.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:51:58.340 --> 00:52:01.045 align:middle line:90%
I see, I see.

00:52:01.045 --> 00:52:02.500 align:middle line:90%
I get the agenda.

00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:05.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: I might've been
able to go with the program,

00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:06.199 align:middle line:90%
but it just--

00:52:06.199 --> 00:52:08.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, can you create
a little water for your garden

00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:09.448 align:middle line:90%
when you need it?

00:52:09.448 --> 00:52:11.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: Well, it's
not quite that way.

00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:15.240 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you trigger
it, it's like roulette.

00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:17.770 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time you put
your money on the table

00:52:17.770 --> 00:52:20.670 align:middle line:84%
and it goes into the
pockets of the casino.

00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:24.080 align:middle line:84%
But when you do it right
and it comes through,

00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:25.850 align:middle line:90%
you win the jackpot.

00:52:25.850 --> 00:52:27.840 align:middle line:90%
Everybody benefits.

00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:31.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, well
wonderful works by him,

00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:36.330 align:middle line:84%
but in reality, his payment
was very harsh and cruel.

00:52:36.330 --> 00:52:37.700 align:middle line:90%
And he did end up in jail.

00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:42.159 align:middle line:84%
And that was one of the
most expensive FDA witch

00:52:42.159 --> 00:52:43.825 align:middle line:84%
hunts in history from
what I understand.

00:52:43.825 --> 00:52:44.400 align:middle line:90%
>>DEMEO: Yes.

00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:44.900 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:46.983 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, we talked
about this off camera.

00:52:46.983 --> 00:52:49.935 align:middle line:84%
$2 million were put into that
investigation in the day.

00:52:49.935 --> 00:52:51.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DEMEO: 1950s money.

00:52:51.090 --> 00:52:54.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that had to
be more like $20 million,

00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:58.440 align:middle line:84%
or maybe even more, today, put
into investigating this man

00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:01.000 align:middle line:84%
to shut him up and just
eliminate his work.

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:02.850 align:middle line:90%
To get him.

00:53:02.850 --> 00:53:05.270 align:middle line:84%
So what did they
finally get him on?

00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:06.230 align:middle line:90%
What happened to him?

00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:08.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: Well the
actual charge-- the

00:53:08.590 --> 00:53:10.550 align:middle line:84%
FDA got an injunction
against him

00:53:10.550 --> 00:53:14.820 align:middle line:84%
called "prohibiting the
interstate transportation

00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:16.510 align:middle line:90%
of mislabeled merchandise."

00:53:16.510 --> 00:53:19.520 align:middle line:84%
So they said the accumulator
is mislabeled merchandise,

00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:21.610 align:middle line:84%
because the orgone
energy does not exist.

00:53:21.610 --> 00:53:24.510 align:middle line:84%
They got a judge to declare
orgone energy does not exist,

00:53:24.510 --> 00:53:26.580 align:middle line:90%
based upon no evidence.

00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:28.890 align:middle line:84%
But you know, ignoring all
the evidence that did exist,

00:53:28.890 --> 00:53:30.390 align:middle line:90%
but that's what he said.

00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:34.940 align:middle line:84%
So the accumulator is banned
and the books that document

00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:41.000 align:middle line:84%
the orgone energy were labeled
as advertising literature.

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:42.840 align:middle line:84%
Books were
advertising literature

00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:44.625 align:middle line:84%
for the accumulator,
which was mislabeled.

00:53:44.625 --> 00:53:46.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it
was resear-- those

00:53:46.250 --> 00:53:47.541 align:middle line:90%
were his research books, right?

00:53:47.541 --> 00:53:49.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: His research
books and his journals.

00:53:49.850 --> 00:53:53.540 align:middle line:84%
There was a-- That was
the court injunction.

00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:57.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the
Reich's assistants

00:53:57.530 --> 00:53:59.500 align:middle line:84%
moved some books
and accumulators

00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:02.120 align:middle line:90%
across state lines.

00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:04.380 align:middle line:84%
This was when Reich was
in Tucson, Arizona doing

00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:05.670 align:middle line:90%
his cloud busting experiments.

00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:07.550 align:middle line:90%
He didn't know about it.

00:54:07.550 --> 00:54:11.720 align:middle line:84%
But this assistant moved this
stuff across the state line,

00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:15.090 align:middle line:84%
the FDA had their spies,
they learned about it,

00:54:15.090 --> 00:54:17.460 align:middle line:84%
and so Reich and
the assistant were

00:54:17.460 --> 00:54:20.120 align:middle line:84%
hauled into court
on contempt charges

00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:23.260 align:middle line:84%
for violating the
original injunction.

00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:27.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, the courts refused to
look at any of the evidence

00:54:27.290 --> 00:54:29.370 align:middle line:84%
in favor of orgone
energy, in favor

00:54:29.370 --> 00:54:32.060 align:middle line:90%
of Reich's experimental work.

00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:35.950 align:middle line:84%
Reich lost the case
by-- on that basis.

00:54:35.950 --> 00:54:38.560 align:middle line:84%
They said, we're not interested
in the issue of orgone energy.

00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:40.920 align:middle line:84%
We're only interested if you
violated the original court

00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:42.420 align:middle line:90%
injunction.

00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And so he was
convicted and sentenced

00:54:45.150 --> 00:54:46.450 align:middle line:90%
to two years in prison.

00:54:46.450 --> 00:54:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And it was appealed all the
way up to the Supreme Court.

00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:52.290 align:middle line:84%
The Supreme Court, as
well as the appeals court

00:54:52.290 --> 00:54:54.710 align:middle line:84%
in Portland, Maine, they
all had the opportunity

00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:57.100 align:middle line:84%
to review the case
with open eyes

00:54:57.100 --> 00:55:01.206 align:middle line:84%
where books were
identified as being

00:55:01.206 --> 00:55:02.580 align:middle line:84%
burned by the
federal government.

00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:04.200 align:middle line:90%
They all chose to ignore it.

00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:07.640 align:middle line:84%
So in my view, the appeals
court and the US Supreme Court

00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:11.040 align:middle line:84%
are culpable for the
burning of books.

00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:12.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:55:12.910 --> 00:55:15.530 align:middle line:84%
So the sad end to that
story is he died in prison.

00:55:15.530 --> 00:55:21.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: He died in
prison in November 1957.

00:55:21.350 --> 00:55:24.840 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, very sad end to
a great man's life.

00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:27.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you picked
up this work, when?

00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:28.270 align:middle line:90%
In the '70s?

00:55:28.270 --> 00:55:29.440 align:middle line:90%
Late '60s or early '70s?

00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:30.986 align:middle line:90%
>>DEMEO: Well, late '60s.

00:55:30.986 --> 00:55:35.820 align:middle line:84%
I became-- I went through some
of the orgone therapy sessions

00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:36.405 align:middle line:90%
that he did.

00:55:36.405 --> 00:55:37.613 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, wow, you know?

00:55:37.613 --> 00:55:39.910 align:middle line:84%
It energized me just
from that alone.

00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:41.740 align:middle line:90%
My breathing got deeper.

00:55:41.740 --> 00:55:45.410 align:middle line:84%
And then I began building
orgone accumulators,

00:55:45.410 --> 00:55:46.660 align:middle line:90%
and doing experiments.

00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:48.326 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Replicating
experiments, yeah.

00:55:48.326 --> 00:55:52.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: Going into the
university and doing it openly.

00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:55.590 align:middle line:84%
I taught for about 10 years
as a professor at university.

00:55:55.590 --> 00:55:57.760 align:middle line:84%
Illinois State University,
later the University

00:55:57.760 --> 00:56:01.700 align:middle line:84%
of Miami, Southern
Illinois-- excuse

00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:06.029 align:middle line:84%
me-- University
of Northern Iowa.

00:56:06.029 --> 00:56:08.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're out there
doing the academic thing.

00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:10.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: I was doing
it academically,

00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:12.980 align:middle line:84%
and the whole time,
the lightning bolts

00:56:12.980 --> 00:56:14.930 align:middle line:84%
were hitting me from
the skeptic clubs.

00:56:14.930 --> 00:56:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And I had hate mail coming to
the chairman of my departments

00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:23.290 align:middle line:84%
from-- sometimes from
anonymous people.

00:56:23.290 --> 00:56:26.190 align:middle line:84%
Hate mail to my
relatives, to my wife.

00:56:26.190 --> 00:56:27.770 align:middle line:90%
These people were--

00:56:27.770 --> 00:56:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this was over
the orgone accumulator?

00:56:30.270 --> 00:56:30.540 align:middle line:90%
>>DEMEO: This was--

00:56:30.540 --> 00:56:31.664 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And cloud buster?

00:56:31.664 --> 00:56:35.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: Accusing
me of being a quack,

00:56:35.450 --> 00:56:38.930 align:middle line:84%
of everything, of mass
murder with the cloud buster.

00:56:38.930 --> 00:56:40.790 align:middle line:84%
These were not
from professionals,

00:56:40.790 --> 00:56:43.540 align:middle line:84%
but eventually the professionals
got involved with the attacks

00:56:43.540 --> 00:56:48.500 align:middle line:84%
as well, but under more
contrived kinds of reasons.

00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:50.750 align:middle line:84%
At one point at
Illinois State, I

00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:54.750 align:middle line:84%
had five different chairman
of five different departments

00:56:54.750 --> 00:56:56.460 align:middle line:84%
writing letters
against me, calling

00:56:56.460 --> 00:56:58.340 align:middle line:90%
for my head on a platter.

00:56:58.340 --> 00:57:01.910 align:middle line:84%
I had to consult a lawyer
to tell them back off

00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:03.590 align:middle line:90%
or I'll sue you.

00:57:03.590 --> 00:57:05.579 align:middle line:84%
So I completed my
teaching contract,

00:57:05.579 --> 00:57:07.620 align:middle line:84%
but the problem is when
you're a young professor,

00:57:07.620 --> 00:57:10.640 align:middle line:84%
you're not-- you
haven't got tenure.

00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:13.906 align:middle line:84%
So they put you on a temporary
three or four year contract.

00:57:13.906 --> 00:57:16.030 align:middle line:84%
When you complete it, they
say thank you very much,

00:57:16.030 --> 00:57:17.850 align:middle line:90%
but you know, your a hot potato.

00:57:17.850 --> 00:57:18.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're a hot potato.

00:57:18.210 --> 00:57:18.620 align:middle line:90%
Get out of here.

00:57:18.620 --> 00:57:20.578 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: Please find some
other place to go to.

00:57:20.578 --> 00:57:21.870 align:middle line:90%
And so I kept hopscotching.

00:57:21.870 --> 00:57:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And at a certain point, I
said, I can't do this anymore.

00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:28.520 align:middle line:84%
So I moved to
California and developed

00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:30.230 align:middle line:90%
the opening of my own institute.

00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:31.830 align:middle line:90%
And that's worked very well.

00:57:31.830 --> 00:57:33.735 align:middle line:90%
I got to do the work in Israel.

00:57:33.735 --> 00:57:39.500 align:middle line:84%
I later did work in Namibia
by government invitation,

00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:40.160 align:middle line:90%
once again.

00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:41.790 align:middle line:90%
And they supported it.

00:57:41.790 --> 00:57:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest project
was a five year project

00:57:44.550 --> 00:57:46.980 align:middle line:84%
sponsored by the government
of Eritrea, which

00:57:46.980 --> 00:57:49.970 align:middle line:84%
is a small little
country near Ethiopia.

00:57:49.970 --> 00:57:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And that was done over
a five year period.

00:57:52.620 --> 00:57:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And we literally changed
the equation for them.

00:57:57.390 --> 00:58:00.600 align:middle line:84%
They had a 30 year
drought problem,

00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:04.090 align:middle line:84%
which was ended the
year we started.

00:58:04.090 --> 00:58:08.550 align:middle line:84%
30 years of drought ended
the year we started our work.

00:58:08.550 --> 00:58:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And the stats on food
imports are very interesting.

00:58:13.050 --> 00:58:15.860 align:middle line:84%
The first year we arrived,
they spent something

00:58:15.860 --> 00:58:20.600 align:middle line:84%
like $130 million
to import food.

00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:22.580 align:middle line:84%
About the third
year in, they were

00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:25.137 align:middle line:90%
spending about $20 million.

00:58:25.137 --> 00:58:25.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:26.910 align:middle line:90%
That's a success story.

00:58:26.910 --> 00:58:28.493 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: We didn't
get the difference.

00:58:28.493 --> 00:58:29.320 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:31.528 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you got to
feel good about your work.

00:58:31.528 --> 00:58:33.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: We got expense
money and a good feeling,

00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:35.405 align:middle line:90%
and that's about it.

00:58:35.405 --> 00:58:36.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, yeah.

00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And a nice case study
to talk about later

00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:39.495 align:middle line:84%
and pass on to
the grandchildren.

00:58:39.495 --> 00:58:41.410 align:middle line:90%
>>DEMEO: That's right.

00:58:41.410 --> 00:58:43.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We only have
about a minute left,

00:58:43.230 --> 00:58:44.510 align:middle line:90%
so I have a question for you.

00:58:44.510 --> 00:58:47.450 align:middle line:84%
This is really--
this is a simple one.

00:58:47.450 --> 00:58:50.930 align:middle line:84%
Is orgone why the
sky is blue, then?

00:58:50.930 --> 00:58:53.680 align:middle line:84%
>>DEMEO: Well, that's
an interesting question.

00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:57.530 align:middle line:84%
I think that we can make
a good scientific argument

00:58:57.530 --> 00:59:00.640 align:middle line:84%
in competition with the
classical theory of Rayleigh's

00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:02.440 align:middle line:90%
scattering of light waves.

00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:03.620 align:middle line:90%
Let's just leave it at that.

00:59:03.620 --> 00:59:04.161 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:59:04.161 --> 00:59:06.516 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's been wonderful
talking with you again.

00:59:06.516 --> 00:59:07.890 align:middle line:84%
I hope we can do
this again soon.

00:59:07.890 --> 00:59:10.400 align:middle line:84%
You have another book
coming out very shortly,

00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:12.780 align:middle line:84%
which is "In Defense of
Wilhelm Reich," right?

00:59:12.780 --> 00:59:13.220 align:middle line:90%
>>DEMEO: That's right.

00:59:13.220 --> 00:59:15.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, well it'll be
out in a couple months' time,

00:59:15.390 --> 00:59:17.010 align:middle line:84%
so hopefully you're
going to come back

00:59:17.010 --> 00:59:17.940 align:middle line:90%
and we'll get into some more.

00:59:17.940 --> 00:59:18.880 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot more
to talk about.

00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:19.266 align:middle line:90%
>>DEMEO: Oh, I'd love to.

00:59:19.266 --> 00:59:20.099 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:59:20.099 --> 00:59:20.675 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:59:20.675 --> 00:59:22.800 align:middle line:84%
Again, if you're interested
in the world of Wilhelm

00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:27.650 align:middle line:84%
Reich and James DeMeo, you
can go to orgonelab.org.

00:59:27.650 --> 00:59:30.020 align:middle line:84%
The blueprints to build
your own orgone accumulator

00:59:30.020 --> 00:59:33.460 align:middle line:84%
are available there, along with
research, books, and much more.

00:59:33.460 --> 00:59:37.510 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.

00:59:37.510 --> 00:59:46.234 align:middle line:90%
