>>FRANK DE LUCA: I really
had to go back to zero

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.400 align:middle line:84%
and say, now, why would I
talk about the Enneagram?

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.079 align:middle line:84%
I drank the Kool-Aid
a long time ago.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.552 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: But not everybody has.

00:00:17.552 --> 00:00:20.370 align:middle line:84%
If they had this language, if
they had this point of view,

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.560 align:middle line:84%
oh, it would just
be so much more fun.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.880 align:middle line:84%
We have a, kind of,
contracted self--

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:25.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.640 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: --and an expanded self.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very well put.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.150 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: They keep longing
for that perfect other

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.245 align:middle line:90%
who will see me in my depth.

00:00:32.245 --> 00:00:33.045 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.530 align:middle line:84%
I did not know the
rude cashier's son was

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.420 align:middle line:90%
expelled from school yesterday.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.220 align:middle line:84%
I did not know the
careless driver

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.990 align:middle line:84%
who pulled in front
of me just got word

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.360 align:middle line:90%
that his wife was in the ICU.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.750 align:middle line:84%
I do know that erring
on the side of kindness

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.845 align:middle line:90%
never hurt a soul.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.930 align:middle line:10%
I think all of us
enjoy seeing ourselves

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.720 align:middle line:10%
and others through the lens
of different assessment tools

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.710 align:middle line:10%
or archetypes.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.730 align:middle line:84%
One such tool is the Enneagram,
which I find to be very useful.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.910 align:middle line:84%
Frank Deluca began using
the Enneagram decades ago

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.100 align:middle line:84%
for creating more
positive relationship

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.690 align:middle line:90%
in his personal and work life.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.150 align:middle line:84%
As the years went on, he
began taking this knowledge

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.250 align:middle line:84%
and distilling
it, until he found

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.530 align:middle line:90%
the perfect essential you.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.660 align:middle line:84%
His book, "A Field
Guide to Humans:

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.210 align:middle line:84%
Using the Enneagram to
Improve Your Relationships,"

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.540 align:middle line:84%
is this distillation,
replete with beautiful art

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.450 align:middle line:90%
and personal stories.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.700 align:middle line:90%
And I have to tell you, Frank.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.220 align:middle line:84%
I've been telling everyone,
you got to get a bunch of these

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.590 align:middle line:84%
as gifts for people
because you did

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.030 align:middle line:84%
something different
with this book

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.100 align:middle line:90%
than what I've seen before.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.510 align:middle line:90%
Enneagram books are fun.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.390 align:middle line:84%
But a, you've made
it into an art piece.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.540 align:middle line:84%
But even more
importantly, you actually

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.180 align:middle line:84%
did take your, what, 30,
40 years of knowledge

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.950 align:middle line:84%
and distill each
of the archetypes.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.470 align:middle line:84%
So you can recognize yourself
in this wonderful little book.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.340 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.020 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Thank you for noticing.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you put
a lot of work into it.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.690 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: I did.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:59.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Isn't it glad
somebody noticed, huh--

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:00.710 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Right, exactly, sure.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.728 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --because
you need a publisher.

00:02:02.728 --> 00:02:03.770 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Yeah, it's true.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.978 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So with you,
first of all, this is--

00:02:06.978 --> 00:02:09.020 align:middle line:84%
some people know about
the Enneagram, some don't.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I've done anything
on the Enneagram for years.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.360 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, let's
talk about the history

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.560 align:middle line:90%
of the Enneagram a bit itself.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.890 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to
start going into your history

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:19.690 align:middle line:90%
with the Enneagram.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.560 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: OK, sure.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.190 align:middle line:10%
The Enneagram as a symbol has--

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.830 align:middle line:10%
we don't know how
long it's been around.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.050 align:middle line:84%
Some attribute it to
Pythagoras and sacred geometry.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.210 align:middle line:84%
Others think it kind of
came in the Middle Ages

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.320 align:middle line:84%
with a confluence of mysticism,
Christian mysticism, Judaic,

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.450 align:middle line:90%
and Islamic.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.960 align:middle line:90%
But we don't really know.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.930 align:middle line:84%
We don't have facts
about that symbol.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.500 align:middle line:10%
What we do know is
that in the 19--

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.210 align:middle line:10%
about 1915, 1920, a man, a
teacher, mystic, Gurdjieff--

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.010 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.230 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: --presented
this to his students.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.450 align:middle line:84%
But he didn't talk about
it in terms of personality.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.810 align:middle line:84%
He talked about it in
terms of the movements

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.145 align:middle line:90%
of the energy of life.

00:03:04.145 --> 00:03:05.270 align:middle line:90%
And that it's kind of the--

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.890 align:middle line:84%
I kind of look at it
as a map of the cosmos.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.480 align:middle line:90%
And you can read a lot into it.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.710 align:middle line:84%
So he didn't teach the
Enneagram of personality.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.460 align:middle line:84%
But he talked about chief
features in each one.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And he taught, actually,
through movement.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And there were dances that
went with the Enneagram.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.800 align:middle line:90%
You move ahead to the late 60's.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And a Bolivian man
in South America,

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.010 align:middle line:84%
another kind of mystic teacher,
began to teach in his teachings

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.090 align:middle line:90%
with the Enneagram.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And he began to add
personality called

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.250 align:middle line:90%
ego fixations on top of it.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.890 align:middle line:84%
And he used it as
part of his program

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.340 align:middle line:84%
for spiritual development
and enlightenment.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:57.300 align:middle line:84%
In about, I think, 1970, a
man named Claudio Naranjo,

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.770 align:middle line:90%
he was from South America.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:00.450 align:middle line:84%
But he was working
in the United States.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.070 align:middle line:90%
He was a psychiatrist.

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.790 align:middle line:84%
And he was also very interested
in personality systems

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.040 align:middle line:90%
and psychometrics--

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.520 align:middle line:90%
a lot of other things.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.630 align:middle line:84%
He went to South America kind
of on a personal journey.

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.240 align:middle line:84%
And he spent time
with Oscar Ichazo.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.250 align:middle line:84%
And he was introduced
to the Enneagram

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.920 align:middle line:90%
as Oscar was working with it.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.290 align:middle line:84%
When he came back to the
United States, that's

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.600 align:middle line:84%
when things really
began, I think, as far

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.080 align:middle line:84%
as our understanding of what
we have as the Enneagram today.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.660 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of the Big
Bang of the Enneagram,

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.670 align:middle line:84%
in that what came
together was these kind

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.240 align:middle line:84%
of mystical teachings,
with his understanding

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.410 align:middle line:84%
of modern psychology
and personality systems.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.395 align:middle line:84%
So he began to do
the blending of--

00:04:43.395 --> 00:04:44.478 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:04:44.478 --> 00:04:46.680 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: --spirituality,
mysticism, and psychology.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
really what you were

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:48.660 align:middle line:90%
interested in professionally.

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:49.500 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Yes.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now let's
go to you and talk

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.350 align:middle line:84%
about you professionally, and
how you intersected with it.

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:58.350 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: So the--
it was like, 1989.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:59.910 align:middle line:90%
Things happened in strange ways.

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.180 align:middle line:84%
But someone gave me a book
called "The Enneagram."

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.710 align:middle line:90%
It was by Helen Palmer.

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.340 align:middle line:90%
And this is interesting.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.420 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't quite,
couldn't quite, absorb it.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:14.380 align:middle line:84%
But shortly after that, I was
on a retreat, a 10-day retreat.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And the person
who was running it

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.840 align:middle line:84%
had just done training
in the Enneagram.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.640 align:middle line:90%
And she had a colleague.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.440 align:middle line:84%
And she said to the
colleague, because I

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.857 align:middle line:84%
was going to work
with this woman,

00:05:23.857 --> 00:05:25.170 align:middle line:90%
would you please type Frank?

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.270 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
what this was about.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And she came away saying,
I think he's a type I.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.923 align:middle line:90%
And my friend said, oh no.

00:05:31.923 --> 00:05:33.090 align:middle line:90%
That was the first response.

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, oh no.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.730 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: But what happened
is that I began to study.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:39.750 align:middle line:90%
And I began--

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.080 align:middle line:84%
I made friends with this woman,
who was a trained teacher.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.170 align:middle line:84%
And as I began my training
and as a therapist

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:48.630 align:middle line:84%
and seeing clients, I
would consult with her

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.280 align:middle line:84%
from the Enneagram
point of view.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.840 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
this person might be?

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.020 align:middle line:84%
And I was doing
consulting with companies.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.192 align:middle line:84%
And I would bring her in to
help me understand these people.

00:05:58.192 --> 00:05:59.400 align:middle line:90%
And they would work with her.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.490 align:middle line:84%
So I was able to watch
and learn from her.

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And I just kept doing more
study and more learning.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And I'd had private
practice as a therapist.

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:13.210 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: And as I sat
there with people,

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:14.880 align:middle line:84%
I thought, oh, if
they only knew this.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah, yeah,

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:19.302 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: It would speed
things up just greatly.

00:06:19.302 --> 00:06:20.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
start blending it?

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.860 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: So I said,
well, I got to--

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to have to teach this.

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And I began to teach,
I guess, in 2007, just

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:34.500 align:middle line:84%
to clients, only certain clients
who I felt would be open to it.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.060 align:middle line:90%
And that began to spread.

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.168 align:middle line:84%
But still, I was interested
in family and friends

00:06:38.168 --> 00:06:40.710 align:middle line:84%
knowing this truthfully because
it would make my life easier,

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:41.510 align:middle line:90%
is what I thought.

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:42.338 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:42.338 --> 00:06:44.130 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: If they had
this language, if they

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:46.800 align:middle line:84%
had this point of view,
oh, we could just--

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.570 align:middle line:84%
it would just be
so much more fun.

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And truthfully, that's what
I love about it the most.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.460 align:middle line:90%
There's so much joy that comes--

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:54.525 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:06:54.525 --> 00:06:57.300 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: --of not being
locked in to these patterns.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I agree,
especially if you

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:02.940 align:middle line:84%
can come from the
understanding, every one of us

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:07.200 align:middle line:84%
is making decisions and looking
through a lens of life that

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.980 align:middle line:84%
is unique and different
from the other.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:11.340 align:middle line:84%
And we're making an assumption
that someone kind of

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.350 align:middle line:84%
understands life through a
similar lens as ourselves.

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:16.240 align:middle line:90%
That's not true at all.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.060 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: It's not.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.462 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All you have to do
is get married or whatever.

00:07:20.462 --> 00:07:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find
that out, you know?

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.712 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Yeah, well
there's where it really

00:07:23.712 --> 00:07:24.930 align:middle line:90%
shows up, in relationships.

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:26.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:28.110 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: And we recognize
that, oh my god,

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:30.270 align:middle line:84%
you really have a whole
different take on things,

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:30.900 align:middle line:90%
don't you?

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:31.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.527 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Yes, and when we see
people with a different take,

00:07:34.527 --> 00:07:36.360 align:middle line:84%
we assume there's
something wrong with them.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:36.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:38.670 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Because don't you
know, this is the way it is?

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:39.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:40.692 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: And they say, no.

00:07:40.692 --> 00:07:42.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's not
how I see it at all.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.260 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: That's not
how I see it at all.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:44.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:46.300 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: So it really
is about perception.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:50.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, you and I talked
about this before, off camera,

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:52.290 align:middle line:90%
before we prepared for this.

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking about
how it allows a person

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:59.460 align:middle line:84%
to set up your relationships
with others really based

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:03.360 align:middle line:90%
on compassion and understanding.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:06.480 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Yes, that's one of the
great gifts of these teachings.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:10.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't know anything
that has allowed me

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:13.930 align:middle line:84%
and people I know to
develop our compassion.

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:16.873 align:middle line:84%
And I really emphasize
in my book, kindness.

00:08:16.873 --> 00:08:17.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, you do.

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:20.165 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I've written something
down here from your book.

00:08:20.165 --> 00:08:22.330 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Yeah,
because I had to say--

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the Enneagram is
one of the tools I have.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:27.810 align:middle line:84%
But I've been studying
things for the last 40 years

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:30.300 align:middle line:84%
in teaching, kind of from
the human potential movement,

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.049 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:36.059 align:middle line:84%
And when I wrote this book, I
really had to go back to zero

00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:39.480 align:middle line:84%
and say, now, why would I
talk about the Enneagram?

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.502 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:40.502 --> 00:08:42.419 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: I drank the
Kool-Aid a long time ago.

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:43.380 align:middle line:90%
But not everybody has.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:44.338 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:08:44.338 --> 00:08:46.930 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: So why the
Enneagram, why self awareness?

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:47.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:49.990 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: What is this all about?

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:54.300 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of came to see
that if we can't be kinder

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:57.880 align:middle line:84%
to one another, then does all
of our consciousness work really

00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:58.680 align:middle line:90%
matter?

00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, it doesn't.

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:05.370 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't mind my reading,
this first page in the book,

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:09.840 align:middle line:84%
it says, "I did not know
the rude cashier's son was

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.700 align:middle line:90%
expelled from school yesterday.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.500 align:middle line:84%
I did not know the
careless driver

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.270 align:middle line:84%
who pulled in front
of me just got word

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:17.370 align:middle line:90%
that his wife was in the ICU.

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:19.650 align:middle line:84%
I did not know that
my sarcastic remark

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:21.270 align:middle line:90%
had hurt my friend so deeply.

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:25.870 align:middle line:84%
I do know that I easily
forget how tender we all are.

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:29.280 align:middle line:84%
I do know that erring
on the side of kindness

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.200 align:middle line:90%
never hurt a soul.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.770 align:middle line:90%
And that was beautiful."

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:38.190 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Yeah, that was--

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:40.060 align:middle line:84%
yeah, I use poetry in
the book, as you know.

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:40.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:46.330 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Because to
describe types is one thing.

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:48.760 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted to find other
ways, other channels.

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.298 align:middle line:90%
And so the artwork, the colors--

00:09:50.298 --> 00:09:51.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, beautiful.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:53.950 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: --the
poetry, not all of us

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:55.580 align:middle line:84%
have linear minds
that we use only.

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:56.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.600 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: And so the poetry--

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.140 align:middle line:84%
and I'm aiming for
the heart there.

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:00.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.070 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Because you asked
about differences earlier.

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:03.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.650 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: And I've come to
see, we really can't resolve

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:07.310 align:middle line:90%
many differences mentally.

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:08.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:10.990 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: It can only really
be resolved through the heart.

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:11.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.550 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Where we become human--

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:13.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is so true.

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:14.350 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: --with another human.

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:16.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In fact,
I even tried using

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:19.820 align:middle line:84%
the Enneagram with someone
who's totally in the head.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:23.860 align:middle line:84%
It didn't work at all because
the same defensiveness and all

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:25.750 align:middle line:84%
that kind of remained
that was there

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:28.510 align:middle line:84%
to begin with because
if you can't drop just

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:31.100 align:middle line:84%
into the vulnerability of
your heart, and say, look,

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:32.290 align:middle line:90%
we're just different.

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:34.540 align:middle line:84%
Can we look at those
differences and how

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:36.160 align:middle line:90%
they might work together?

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.280 align:middle line:84%
So you have to be brave
enough and vulnerable enough

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.700 align:middle line:84%
to allow yourself to be
that honest with yourself,

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:43.780 align:middle line:90%
and each other.

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:46.070 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Yes, it's not
for the faint of heart.

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:47.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not
because a lot of people

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.920 align:middle line:84%
don't want to know that there's
a significant difference there

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.320 align:middle line:84%
that probably isn't
going to be bridged.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.847 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't mean it's
the end of the dialogue

00:10:55.847 --> 00:10:56.680 align:middle line:90%
or the relationship.

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.540 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean
it's the end of it.

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:00.580 align:middle line:84%
But it's the
elephant in the room

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:03.635 align:middle line:84%
that you just haven't been
willing to talk about, right?

00:11:03.635 --> 00:11:04.510 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Well, it is.

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And what's great is that
the Enneagram gives you

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:11.373 align:middle line:84%
a impersonal way to talk
about something personal.

00:11:11.373 --> 00:11:12.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Exactly,
exactly, that's

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:14.500 align:middle line:90%
what's so beautiful about it.

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:15.640 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: It is, it is.

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:18.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I agree with what
you said in the very beginning,

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.170 align:middle line:84%
and what we talked
about off camera.

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:21.820 align:middle line:84%
If there was ever a
time in the world,

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.573 align:middle line:84%
right now is the
time where we need

00:11:23.573 --> 00:11:25.240 align:middle line:84%
to start understanding
each other better

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:28.390 align:middle line:84%
because we have
such polarization.

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:29.920 align:middle line:90%
People are so siloed.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.890 align:middle line:84%
People are so defensive
and judgmental

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:34.570 align:middle line:90%
and hurt right now at large.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's everything in the
media, is reinforcing that.

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:39.850 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Yes.

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:42.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's why
when I read this book,

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:48.010 align:middle line:84%
I thought, yay, this is so
accessible and so pretty.

00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:51.310 align:middle line:84%
So the combination of the
aesthetics and the usefulness

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:52.750 align:middle line:90%
is-- that's my sweet spot.

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:54.830 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Well, that's
what I was aiming for.

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:55.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you did it.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.485 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: The aesthetics
will communicate something.

00:11:57.485 --> 00:11:59.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I know this is
going to bore you to death.

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:02.930 align:middle line:84%
However, we're all looking for
something of ourselves in here.

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:03.730 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Yes.

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:06.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so if
you would indulge me.

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And let's go through the types
in the most essential truth.

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:15.590 align:middle line:84%
So each person can start seeing
themselves in this story.

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:17.420 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk about
pairings and such--

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:18.220 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Yeah.

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:20.053 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --they can
kind of read themselves

00:12:20.053 --> 00:12:21.160 align:middle line:90%
into the story a bit.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:21.580 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Sure.

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:22.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So--

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:22.790 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: I'll do my best.

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:23.748 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --you're a 1?

00:12:23.748 --> 00:12:24.550 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: I am.

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:26.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, so there you go.

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:28.090 align:middle line:90%
You're admitting to it, OK.

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:31.807 align:middle line:84%
Yes, so let's talk about the
essence of the 1's of the world

00:12:31.807 --> 00:12:33.015 align:middle line:90%
because there are nine types.

00:12:33.015 --> 00:12:33.320 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Right.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there's
a lot of you.

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:35.440 align:middle line:90%
There are a lot of 1's.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Yes, there are
not enough, probably.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: If you do say so.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.270 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Well, oh, 1's--

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:46.990 align:middle line:84%
you see, what I
like to look for is

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:49.060 align:middle line:84%
what's at the heart
of the 1's, and then

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:53.290 align:middle line:84%
what happens because each
type has particular strength.

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And they do that over and
over, use that strength.

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:58.030 align:middle line:84%
But that strength
becomes overdone.

00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:00.730 align:middle line:84%
The strength for a 1 is
to have a basic sense

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:04.780 align:middle line:84%
of what's right and wrong,
a highly moral development,

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:07.750 align:middle line:84%
a sense of how things
should be in the world,

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:10.420 align:middle line:84%
and a sense that we
could all get along.

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:13.930 align:middle line:84%
And improvement is
really essential to a 1.

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:16.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can imagine
living with the one, then.

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:18.585 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes because
everybody's got to improve,

00:13:18.585 --> 00:13:19.960 align:middle line:84%
not just the 1's,
everybody else.

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:20.877 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: That's right.

00:13:20.877 --> 00:13:23.620 align:middle line:84%
My partner, I tell him, look,
there is a special place

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:24.920 align:middle line:90%
in heaven for partners of 1's.

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.282 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of 1's?

00:13:27.282 --> 00:13:28.990 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Because
everything is constantly

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:29.960 align:middle line:90%
an improvement project.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:30.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:31.802 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Myself to start.

00:13:31.802 --> 00:13:32.602 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:32.602 --> 00:13:35.440 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: So I can never quite
match up to the expectation.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.450 align:middle line:84%
Basically, 1's
have a sense of how

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:39.140 align:middle line:90%
things could be and should be.

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:40.600 align:middle line:90%
And there's how things are.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And the gap creates
resentment and irritation.

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:44.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.750 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: So 1's
aren't openly angry.

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:50.270 align:middle line:84%
But they're kind of, under
the surface, like, irritated--

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:51.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:52.070 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: --all the time.

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:56.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so does that
sense also become the downfall,

00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:58.730 align:middle line:84%
the very thing that
is their strength,

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:00.550 align:middle line:84%
which is to have
this moral compass--

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:00.790 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Right.

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:03.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --this innate
knowing of right and wrong.

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:03.450 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Yeah.

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:05.325 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It also can
become very judgmental.

00:14:05.325 --> 00:14:08.740 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: We can be heavy-handed
with it, I will admit.

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:11.320 align:middle line:84%
The Inquisition-- it's
like, there's a sense of,

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:12.280 align:middle line:90%
punish those.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:13.540 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's the extreme.

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:15.430 align:middle line:84%
What I have to say
about each type

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:17.950 align:middle line:84%
is that people talk about
levels of development.

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:20.140 align:middle line:84%
I kind of look at as
a little more simple,

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:23.060 align:middle line:84%
to say we have a kind
of contracted self--

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:23.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:24.820 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: --and an
expanded itself.

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:25.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very well put.

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:27.580 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: And so
the contracted one

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:29.710 align:middle line:84%
is angry, and wanted
to punish people

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:32.320 align:middle line:84%
for doing things wrong,
mostly in the mind.

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.820 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
always express it.

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:34.600 align:middle line:90%
But it's an inner dialogue.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:35.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's there.

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:36.123 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: It's there.

00:14:36.123 --> 00:14:38.620 align:middle line:84%
The more expansive
one is, what can we

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:41.320 align:middle line:84%
do to bring better
life to people?

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:42.160 align:middle line:90%
And how can--

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:42.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Improve things.

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:43.060 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: --I be generous.

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:43.977 align:middle line:90%
And how can I improve?

00:14:43.977 --> 00:14:46.430 align:middle line:84%
But how can I come from
my heart when I do it.

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:47.350 align:middle line:90%
And that's a big--

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:49.490 align:middle line:84%
I think for every type,
that's where it really

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:50.290 align:middle line:90%
begins to shift.

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:52.582 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're going to
look at that in each type.

00:14:52.582 --> 00:14:56.688 align:middle line:84%
So where would a 1 best
be placed in the world of,

00:14:56.688 --> 00:14:58.480 align:middle line:84%
if you're offering your
gifts to the world,

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:01.720 align:middle line:84%
whether it's through career,
or a family, or volunteer

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.220 align:middle line:90%
friendship, where do they shine?

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:04.720 align:middle line:90%
Where are they best situated?

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.220 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: We're
really good teachers.

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:07.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, I bet, yeah.

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.940 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: We like to help
people find the way, you know?

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:14.080 align:middle line:84%
So teaching, things that
require-- and it depends.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.640 align:middle line:84%
We could say there's
a wing, which

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:18.820 align:middle line:84%
means the type next to us, which
is the 2, in my case, which

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:21.520 align:middle line:84%
means I would like to really
help people through teaching.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.930 align:middle line:84%
I would like to see
people get better.

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:30.550 align:middle line:84%
And so 1's are, they're just--
anything that gives them

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:31.638 align:middle line:90%
a chance to organize.

00:15:31.638 --> 00:15:32.680 align:middle line:90%
I mean, 1's can organize.

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:33.880 align:middle line:84%
You put anything
in front of a 1,

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:35.110 align:middle line:90%
they can usually organize it.

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:38.047 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I need to find a 1.

00:15:38.047 --> 00:15:39.880 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: They'll just
clear out everything--

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:41.898 align:middle line:84%
not so much that they're
neat, but it kind of

00:15:41.898 --> 00:15:43.690 align:middle line:84%
is a sense that there's
a place for things.

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:44.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:45.730 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: And that
means physical things.

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:46.750 align:middle line:90%
It means mental things.

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:48.760 align:middle line:84%
It means everything-- there's
a place for everything.

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:49.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:51.380 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: And some 1's are
really good with that, yeah.

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:57.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So for a 1, if you're
looking at a client, and--

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.190 align:middle line:84%
have you seen, in your
clients over the years,

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:03.520 align:middle line:84%
that there is a preponderance
of people who have a propensity

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.980 align:middle line:84%
toward teaching, or art
teachers who are 1's?

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:08.440 align:middle line:84%
Or are most people not
living their truth?

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.600 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Well, it
doesn't mean that they

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.790 align:middle line:84%
fall into certain
occupations better.

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:14.750 align:middle line:84%
But wherever they go,
that preoccupation

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:15.550 align:middle line:90%
is there with them.

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:16.508 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:16:16.508 --> 00:16:18.700 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: And so yes,
I have seen 1's--

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:21.740 align:middle line:84%
I've seen 1's working in
finance, and making sure things

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:22.540 align:middle line:90%
are exact.

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:26.510 align:middle line:84%
I've seen 1's working
in a lot of fields.

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:29.050 align:middle line:84%
But you can always
usually spot a 1

00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:33.710 align:middle line:84%
by understanding they're
very critical of themselves.

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And so they often can be
critical of other people

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:39.610 align:middle line:84%
without really knowing
they project a lot.

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:40.823 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:40.823 --> 00:16:42.490 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: But it could
be any occupation.

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:44.200 align:middle line:84%
I can't say I've really
seen one occupation.

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's why I
was just wondering if 1-- like,

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:47.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to ask
this at the end.

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:49.990 align:middle line:84%
What happens when you're
living your not true self?

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:51.723 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk about
that a little later

00:16:51.723 --> 00:16:53.890 align:middle line:84%
when we get done with the
archetypes, if I remember.

00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:54.690 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: OK.

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:57.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so let's go
through to the number two,

00:16:57.310 --> 00:16:58.110 align:middle line:90%
then.

00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:01.750 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: OK, 2's are
focused on others

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:04.819 align:middle line:90%
and being helpful to others.

00:17:04.819 --> 00:17:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And they would like to know
that what they do counts,

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:12.940 align:middle line:84%
and that people will acknowledge
them for what they do.

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:14.830 align:middle line:84%
So it gets tricky
because again, strength.

00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:15.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:16.430 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Here I am.

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:17.319 align:middle line:90%
I'm helping you.

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:19.393 align:middle line:84%
Other side might
feel like, enough.

00:17:19.393 --> 00:17:20.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I've helped.

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And no one's honoring,
or respecting,

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.490 align:middle line:90%
or even noticing me.

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:25.589 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: And they can
flip over into anger--

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:26.389 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:26.389 --> 00:17:28.500 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: --and not
being appreciated.

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:32.040 align:middle line:84%
And 2's, when they're really
in their expanded self,

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:34.500 align:middle line:84%
are just the most loving,
wonderful people because they

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:36.700 align:middle line:90%
can anticipate your needs.

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:38.640 align:middle line:84%
They know before you
say or do anything.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:39.450 align:middle line:90%
They're watching.

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:40.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:42.940 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: And they're attuned
to the emotional life.

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:43.740 align:middle line:90%
I didn't say this.

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:46.050 align:middle line:84%
But we're in the-- called
the feeling center,

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:47.280 align:middle line:90%
2's, 3's, and 4's.

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And so 2's are very
attuned to emotions,

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:52.380 align:middle line:90%
mostly other people's, though.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.420 align:middle line:84%
And they're trying
to encourage people

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:55.520 align:middle line:90%
to have positive emotions.

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.010 align:middle line:90%
They're the first cheerleaders.

00:17:57.010 --> 00:17:57.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:17:57.810 --> 00:17:59.820 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: They're, you
can do it, great support

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:00.870 align:middle line:90%
people in that way.

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:03.060 align:middle line:84%
What they're not so
good at is understanding

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:05.490 align:middle line:84%
their own feelings
and their own needs.

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes kind
of a prideful thing,

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:09.670 align:middle line:90%
that I know what you need.

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:12.080 align:middle line:84%
And for it to-- to turn
it around, I'm fine.

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:12.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm fine.

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.230 align:middle line:90%
I don't need anything.

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:16.230 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Like I said, the
kind of classic thing.

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:18.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, so might
you find caregivers

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:19.470 align:middle line:90%
in this category?

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:20.640 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Often caregivers.

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:23.770 align:middle line:84%
I have found also that women
sometimes over-type themselves

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:24.570 align:middle line:90%
in 2.

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:25.653 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, I think so.

00:18:25.653 --> 00:18:28.470 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Because of their role
as mothers, or just in life.

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:29.970 align:middle line:84%
And they just kind
of take on that--

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:31.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even though
they're not a natural 2.

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:32.130 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Right.

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:32.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:35.010 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Right, so I always,
if people tell me they're a 2

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:36.690 align:middle line:84%
if they're women, I
kind of usually check it

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:37.800 align:middle line:90%
a little bit further to see.

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:38.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.710 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: But yes, it could
be certainly nurturing

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:44.430 align:middle line:84%
roles: nurses, teachers,
again, in this case.

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:46.410 align:middle line:84%
But they could be in
corporate America as well.

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:46.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure, sure, anywhere.

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:48.180 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: But
they're focused on--

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:49.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Others and
the needs of others

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:49.930 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: --others.

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:51.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's
really important for us,

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:54.090 align:middle line:84%
if we see someone in our
life who is like that,

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:56.228 align:middle line:84%
to respect and honor
them for what they give.

00:18:56.228 --> 00:18:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Appreciate them.

00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:58.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Appreciate them.

00:18:58.110 --> 00:18:59.550 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: And express
appreciation--

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:00.375 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Express appreciation.

00:19:00.375 --> 00:19:00.780 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: --help
get you a long way.

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:02.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A long--
OK, these are good.

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:05.380 align:middle line:84%
That's why I wanted to get
through the types individually.

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:07.960 align:middle line:84%
So we can learn how to be
with each other better.

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:08.760 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Yeah.

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, so number 3's.

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.230 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: 3's are often
called achievers.

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of think of them
as, like, thoroughbred horses.

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And out of the gate,
they go for the goal.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.650 align:middle line:90%
They're going to win the race.

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:24.870 align:middle line:84%
They don't have-- that's
all they can think about,

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:26.845 align:middle line:90%
is where they're going.

00:19:26.845 --> 00:19:28.720 align:middle line:84%
They don't think about
even how to get there.

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:29.520 align:middle line:90%
They just move.

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.080 align:middle line:84%
They're good
strategists though, too.

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:33.125 align:middle line:84%
If you put something in
front of a 3 and say,

00:19:33.125 --> 00:19:34.500 align:middle line:84%
here's where you
want to be, they

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:36.042 align:middle line:84%
will figure out the
way to get there.

00:19:36.042 --> 00:19:37.920 align:middle line:84%
So they're very
focused on tasks,

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:42.070 align:middle line:84%
very focused on goals, very
focused on accomplishments.

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:45.660 align:middle line:84%
They identify so much with
that, that what happens

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:47.790 align:middle line:84%
is that they forget
about anything

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:49.930 align:middle line:90%
else in life except that.

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And so feelings-- feelings
kind of get in the way for 3's.

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:56.997 align:middle line:84%
It's like, it'll slow me
down if I take time to feel.

00:19:56.997 --> 00:19:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And if someone wants to come and
share their feelings with me,

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:00.330 align:middle line:90%
oh really?

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:01.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Do we have to?

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:02.890 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: We have a lot to do.

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And so I've learned, and I
kind of put it in the book,

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:09.175 align:middle line:84%
I think, if you're around
3's, don't express feelings

00:20:09.175 --> 00:20:11.550 align:middle line:84%
to them unless they really
asked for something like that.

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:12.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:14.710 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Because it's
not that they don't care.

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:18.090 align:middle line:84%
It's just that they're focused
on task and moving ahead.

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:22.975 align:middle line:84%
And so now, our country
is mostly a 3 country.

00:20:22.975 --> 00:20:23.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:25.170 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: It's kind
of a 3, 1 country.

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:26.070 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of funny.

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:27.990 align:middle line:84%
But we really value
people who are

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:32.010 align:middle line:84%
self-made people, people
who will accomplish things

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:33.210 align:middle line:90%
over all odds.

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:35.130 align:middle line:90%
We'll fight.

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:36.690 align:middle line:90%
And we'll compete.

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:38.410 align:middle line:90%
3's are very competitive.

00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:42.775 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a wonderful skill
to have, but again, overdone.

00:20:42.775 --> 00:20:44.400 align:middle line:84%
Relationships can
get really difficult.

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.483 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I was just
going to bring that up.

00:20:46.483 --> 00:20:53.160 align:middle line:84%
So you must feel kind of run
over or overlooked, oftentimes,

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.930 align:middle line:84%
if you're in
companionship with a 3.

00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:57.570 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Yes, often, 3's
will be so focused on--

00:20:57.570 --> 00:21:00.040 align:middle line:84%
and it's not just career,
but their image of success.

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:00.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:03.090 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: So 3's are
very image-oriented.

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's not only
that I do good things,

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:08.020 align:middle line:84%
but people are
seeing me do that.

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:10.410 align:middle line:84%
So if you are in
partnership with a 3,

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:13.060 align:middle line:84%
they're going to want to
make sure you look good.

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:13.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:15.480 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: And they'll make
sure that you show well.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.563 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everybody's got
to look good, show well.

00:21:17.563 --> 00:21:20.160 align:middle line:84%
So for women, you might
be an arm ornament to a 3.

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.160 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: It could be.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I think I've been
in that role a couple times.

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:26.280 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Right, yeah.

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.920 align:middle line:84%
But the beautiful part of
3's is that they're just

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.650 align:middle line:84%
so good at knowing
how to do things.

00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:36.510 align:middle line:10%
They have a sense of competence,
oftentimes, and just the sense

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:37.960 align:middle line:10%
of being able to do.

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:41.130 align:middle line:10%
And I always-- because as a
1, I might overthink things.

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:43.158 align:middle line:90%
3's don't generally overthink.

00:21:43.158 --> 00:21:44.700 align:middle line:84%
They kind of go,
here's the decision.

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:45.950 align:middle line:90%
Here's what we're going to do.

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:46.830 align:middle line:90%
Done, next.

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:48.872 align:middle line:84%
And it's very simple to
be with them in that way.

00:21:48.872 --> 00:21:51.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it actually
makes people around them,

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:52.832 align:middle line:84%
especially in work
or even family,

00:21:52.832 --> 00:21:55.290 align:middle line:84%
kind of feel comfortable that
they know what they're doing.

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:56.100 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Yes.

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:58.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so you can kind
of relax and say, he's got it.

00:21:58.650 --> 00:21:58.980 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Yes.

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:00.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or she's got it, yeah.

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:02.040 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Now, they only--
they will only focus on things

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:03.180 align:middle line:90%
that matter to them usually.

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:04.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, yeah, right.

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:05.760 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: So there's
that part of it.

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.500 align:middle line:84%
But yes, and so I
have found myself--

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:11.400 align:middle line:84%
I have in the book, I
think, a 6 working for a 3.

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And the 6 can get a good sense
of confidence from the 3.

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:15.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:17.150 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Because they're moving.

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:19.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, OK, number 4.

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:21.500 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: OK, number
4, it's often

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:25.140 align:middle line:84%
called a tragic romantic, which
is in a way, a terrible name.

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:29.270 align:middle line:84%
But 4's-- we talked about
2's being focused on other

00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:30.170 align:middle line:90%
people's feelings.

00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And 3 is kind of saying,
do we really have to?

00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:33.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:38.860 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: And 4 is saying,
that's life, deep feelings--

00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:41.660 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily happy
feelings-- sad, any of them--

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:42.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:43.260 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: --matter.

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And they're kind of,
really, I would call them

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:49.540 align:middle line:84%
the deep divers in the world
of emotions and feelings.

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:50.740 align:middle line:90%
They're very comfortable.

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:55.030 align:middle line:84%
They're very comfortable
in tragic situations, or--

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:59.920 align:middle line:84%
I know of, I think, four 4's
who are all grief counselors

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.090 align:middle line:90%
and have written on this.

00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And they're wonderful
at supporting people

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:06.520 align:middle line:84%
through these difficult times
because to them, it's rich.

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And what I've learned to
appreciate about 4's is

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:10.750 align:middle line:90%
the richness that they carry.

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And they focus on authenticity,
focus on things being real,

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:16.810 align:middle line:90%
people being real with them.

00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:20.830 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to mess around
with a 4, try to be phony.

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:21.970 align:middle line:90%
They will spot it.

00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And they will
often let you know.

00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:25.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:26.320 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Be very forthright.

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And I found, at times, kind of
being intimidated around 4's

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:32.650 align:middle line:84%
because they can be
really present with you.

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And you kind of feel
like if you're fudging,

00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:36.400 align:middle line:84%
or if you're not
being authentic,

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.320 align:middle line:90%
they're going to feel it.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:41.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, they can go overboard too,
where all of life is feeling.

00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:43.750 align:middle line:90%
And it's about their feelings.

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:47.213 align:middle line:84%
And so we all have to stop
and listen to your feelings.

00:23:47.213 --> 00:23:48.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your
perceptions and feelings.

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:52.240 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Your perceptions.

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:55.035 align:middle line:84%
And they can kind of get
seduced by their own feelings,

00:23:55.035 --> 00:23:56.410 align:middle line:84%
meaning that they
get hypnotized.

00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:59.232 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They get full
of themselves a bit, yeah.

00:23:59.232 --> 00:24:00.190 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: They're very--

00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:02.770 align:middle line:84%
I had a 4 client for
a number of years.

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:05.470 align:middle line:84%
When she came to
me, she had gone

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:07.517 align:middle line:90%
through a very unhappy divorce.

00:24:07.517 --> 00:24:09.100 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't something
she really wanted.

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:11.980 align:middle line:84%
She had lost a very,
very close friend.

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:14.980 align:middle line:84%
She had lost her career and
was starting over again.

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:18.460 align:middle line:84%
She was just really-- so she
cried the first six months.

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And I don't-- that's not unusual
for a 4 to experience losses.

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's one
thing about 4's, is

00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:27.790 align:middle line:84%
that they are very attuned
to loss, and then the desire

00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:33.220 align:middle line:84%
to find a way to fulfill that
sense of emptiness and loss.

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And that can be-- that's why
sometimes it's tragic romance.

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:38.440 align:middle line:84%
They keep longing for
that perfect other,

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:40.990 align:middle line:84%
that perfect person
who will get me,

00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:43.300 align:middle line:90%
who will see me in my depth.

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:44.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh yeah?

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:49.720 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Uh-oh-- and be
able to meet me there.

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:51.355 align:middle line:84%
And they're often
frustrated because--

00:24:51.355 --> 00:24:52.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
you can't find it.

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:53.755 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: You can't find it.

00:24:53.755 --> 00:24:56.225 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's not possible,
to get it from another.

00:24:56.225 --> 00:24:57.850 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: And so
they'll dismiss people.

00:24:57.850 --> 00:24:58.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:00.100 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: It's like, OK,
I thought you were it.

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:00.940 align:middle line:90%
But you're not.

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:04.372 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
yeah, OK, all right.

00:25:04.372 --> 00:25:05.330 align:middle line:90%
We'll get back to that.

00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:07.240 align:middle line:90%
So let's go to the 5.

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:11.320 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: The 5's are
wonderful researchers.

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.160 align:middle line:90%
They want to know the truth.

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:14.830 align:middle line:90%
They want to go to the source.

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:18.490 align:middle line:84%
They want to understand
life through their heads.

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:21.700 align:middle line:90%
I have, oh, a friend who has--

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:23.170 align:middle line:90%
a music researcher.

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:25.270 align:middle line:84%
He has gone into
the instruments,

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:28.120 align:middle line:84%
and the way that Bach,
when he wrote his music

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:30.160 align:middle line:84%
with the kind of quill
and the lighting.

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:32.350 align:middle line:84%
And he has the most
beautiful details

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:33.910 align:middle line:90%
about how things are done.

00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:37.270 align:middle line:84%
5's love to figure out
how things are done.

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:40.300 align:middle line:90%
And they often will--

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:43.092 align:middle line:84%
I have it in the book, someone
with books behind them.

00:25:43.092 --> 00:25:44.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:46.330 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Not all 5's or
studious are scholarly.

00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:48.238 align:middle line:84%
But our best scholars
are usually 5's.

00:25:48.238 --> 00:25:50.530 align:middle line:84%
A lot of my professors in
graduate school were probably

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:51.330 align:middle line:90%
5's.

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:54.850 align:middle line:84%
They'll take-- as the 4's take
a deep dive into emotions,

00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:56.480 align:middle line:84%
the 5's take a deep
dive into thoughts.

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:57.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Into knowledge.

00:25:57.250 --> 00:25:57.790 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Into knowledge.

00:25:57.790 --> 00:25:58.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:58.030 --> 00:26:00.580 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: They really are
so hungry for knowledge.

00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And they love having
intellectual debates.

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:06.580 align:middle line:84%
I know some friends who are in
a group called The Philosophers,

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:08.500 align:middle line:84%
and run by a
philosophy professor.

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:10.450 align:middle line:84%
And they discuss
philosophy that way--

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:10.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:11.493 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: --you know?

00:26:11.493 --> 00:26:12.760 align:middle line:90%
And it's a pastime.

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:13.700 align:middle line:90%
And it's a passion.

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:14.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.370 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: And it works great.

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:19.510 align:middle line:84%
The emotional side
for 5's, not so sure.

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:22.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, my son
sounds a bit like a 5.

00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:24.055 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he started
two philosophy clubs,

00:26:24.055 --> 00:26:28.130 align:middle line:84%
a Socrates Club in two different
colleges-- universities.

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:28.930 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:29.080 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Yeah.

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --he didn't
talk about his emotions.

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:31.840 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: No, 5's--

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:35.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But he loved the
field of theory and ideas,

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:36.550 align:middle line:90%
and a great researcher.

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:39.472 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Exactly,
5's are very private.

00:26:39.472 --> 00:26:40.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
very private, yeah.

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:43.780 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: And they often
feel that other people

00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:44.918 align:middle line:90%
are kind of intrusive.

00:26:44.918 --> 00:26:46.960 align:middle line:84%
They want to know-- they
want to know how I feel?

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.090 align:middle line:84%
Please, there's a
little barrier here

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:51.890 align:middle line:84%
because they feel easily
overwhelmed by others,

00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:53.620 align:middle line:90%
especially by emotion.

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And they want to go away and
think about how they feel.

00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:59.950 align:middle line:84%
And they want to
analyze it, you see.

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:02.830 align:middle line:84%
I had a client for a number
of years who was a 5.

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:06.220 align:middle line:84%
He came in with his wife through
an employee assistance program.

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:08.350 align:middle line:90%
We had three sessions together.

00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:10.883 align:middle line:84%
And then she kind of
pinned a note to him,

00:27:10.883 --> 00:27:11.800 align:middle line:90%
and said, here, Frank.

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:13.750 align:middle line:84%
You take care of
him now, in private.

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:17.390 align:middle line:84%
So I saw him for
a couple of years.

00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:20.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, I found that he-- it
was very difficult for him

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:22.118 align:middle line:84%
to really know what
to do in therapy.

00:27:22.118 --> 00:27:24.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you have
to talk about your feelings.

00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:26.600 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Yes, and so I would
say, how was your week?

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:28.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me think
about what I did.

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:30.420 align:middle line:84%
And he would go through
a list of things.

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:32.940 align:middle line:84%
And he would tell me about an
argument he had with his wife,

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:33.740 align:middle line:90%
and what she says.

00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:35.210 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, how
is that for you?

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And he would just sit
there for a long time,

00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:41.610 align:middle line:84%
and have to think,
how was that for me?

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:44.730 align:middle line:84%
He had to really go
deep to access that.

00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And also, it wasn't
like-- a 4, if they

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:49.320 align:middle line:90%
came in, would be talking.

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:50.550 align:middle line:90%
A 5 is kind of quiet.

00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And I learned to really
respect 5's need for privacy,

00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:58.747 align:middle line:84%
and understand that they need
to have that internal space

00:27:58.747 --> 00:28:00.330 align:middle line:84%
because they feel
there's so much they

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:02.110 align:middle line:90%
have to think about and learn.

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:05.490 align:middle line:84%
There's not much time for
anything else, or energy.

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:06.757 align:middle line:90%
It's about energy.

00:28:06.757 --> 00:28:08.590 align:middle line:84%
They feel they have to
contain their energy.

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:11.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So maybe with fives
in relationship, oftentimes,

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:13.740 align:middle line:84%
the partner feels they can't get
a deep connection emotionally.

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:14.400 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Very much so.

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:15.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, OK.

00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:16.860 align:middle line:90%
And 6?

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:21.210 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: 6's are--
it's a great point.

00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:22.925 align:middle line:90%
I'm with a 6.

00:28:22.925 --> 00:28:25.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A 1 and a 6,
we'll talk about that later.

00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:26.800 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Well, yeah,
that's a whole thing.

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:31.500 align:middle line:84%
But 6's-- the 5, 6, and 7
are called to be fear-based,

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:33.420 align:middle line:90%
and the mental types.

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:36.490 align:middle line:84%
5's feel overwhelmed by
the world, the outer world.

00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:37.740 align:middle line:90%
So they go to the inner world.

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:38.978 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:38.978 --> 00:28:40.020 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: I'll skip ahead.

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:42.250 align:middle line:84%
But 7's are kind of
afraid of the inner world.

00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:43.590 align:middle line:90%
So they play in the outer world.

00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:45.490 align:middle line:84%
The 6's are kind
of afraid of both.

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:46.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:47.760 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: It's like, if I--

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.710 align:middle line:90%
the world is not a safe place.

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:51.540 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
people are up to.

00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:54.120 align:middle line:84%
I can't really trust
what's going on.

00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:56.430 align:middle line:90%
I need to check things out.

00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:57.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm a little cynical.

00:28:57.900 --> 00:28:59.010 align:middle line:90%
But I'm careful.

00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:02.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'm watching out for
me and for my loved ones.

00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:05.430 align:middle line:90%
So they tend to be suspicious.

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:07.380 align:middle line:84%
And not that they
want to go in, they

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:10.230 align:middle line:84%
have a hard time being
certain about what

00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:13.320 align:middle line:84%
they think is really true, or
what they feel is really true.

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:16.560 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of doubt
that goes on in the 6.

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And 6's that were incredibly,
often, community-oriented,

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.230 align:middle line:90%
they will take up the cause.

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:24.240 align:middle line:90%
They will be protesters.

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:26.265 align:middle line:84%
If something doesn't
feel right in the world,

00:29:26.265 --> 00:29:28.890 align:middle line:84%
they're going to make sure that
they do their part because it's

00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:31.530 align:middle line:90%
more like the we for the 6.

00:29:31.530 --> 00:29:33.210 align:middle line:84%
And they can be
very compassionate.

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:34.980 align:middle line:84%
And really, right
there, the thing

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:39.360 align:middle line:84%
that really distinguishes
6's is their loyalty.

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.080 align:middle line:90%
And I feel it in my own life.

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:41.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:44.850 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: I mean, when someone
is a 6 and they're with you,

00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:45.060 align:middle line:90%
that's it.

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:46.185 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're with you.

00:29:46.185 --> 00:29:48.540 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: There is nothing
coming between that.

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:51.150 align:middle line:90%
And that's an incredible gift.

00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:53.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they're very
relationship, people-oriented.

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:55.830 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Very much so,
unless they get so phobic,

00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:56.920 align:middle line:90%
and they can't deal with people.

00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:57.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You want
to know it's true--

00:29:57.740 --> 00:29:59.630 align:middle line:84%
and Howard Hughes, and
have Kleenex on your--

00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:00.450 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Yes, that's probably--

00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:01.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --Kleenex
boxes on their feet.

00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:03.062 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: --a very contracted 6.

00:30:03.062 --> 00:30:05.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah, and 7's?

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:07.560 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: 7's love life.

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.360 align:middle line:90%
7's love to play.

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:11.310 align:middle line:90%
7's love opportunities.

00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:12.840 align:middle line:84%
They love to
travel, or they just

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:17.430 align:middle line:84%
love to have freshness, and
new things, and stimulation--

00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:19.350 align:middle line:84%
and especially in
the outer world.

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:21.840 align:middle line:84%
You want your travel
agent to be a 7.

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:22.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and so they
know where the good stuff is.

00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:23.730 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: I've gone
traveling-- not just--

00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:24.450 align:middle line:90%
but your travel guide.

00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:26.130 align:middle line:84%
They're going to just--
the best restaurants,

00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:27.090 align:middle line:90%
I'll show you this.

00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:27.960 align:middle line:90%
It's great.

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And I love the 7 friends
that I have in my life.

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:35.010 align:middle line:84%
And they will tend
to think about what

00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:36.570 align:middle line:90%
will make them happy.

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And they just
assume that you will

00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:40.650 align:middle line:84%
go along being happy with
what they're happy with.

00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:44.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, so a little
self-absorption, perhaps.

00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:45.450 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: It kind of sets in.

00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:46.110 align:middle line:90%
There's a tenet.

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:46.910 align:middle line:90%
We all have it.

00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:49.680 align:middle line:84%
But the 7's-- because how could
you not enjoy what I'm doing?

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:49.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:50.550 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Look at this.

00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:51.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's so cool.

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:51.900 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Yeah.

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:52.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:55.380 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: So 7's have
difficulty in relationship

00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:59.100 align:middle line:84%
because they tend to not be able
to easily go into where someone

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:02.310 align:middle line:84%
else is, especially
if someone is sad

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:05.230 align:middle line:84%
or if someone is having
not positive emotions.

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:06.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:07.572 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: They just
kind of don't know

00:31:07.572 --> 00:31:09.180 align:middle line:84%
where to go because
7's, the fear

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:10.950 align:middle line:84%
that they have of
the inside, what

00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:15.220 align:middle line:84%
would happen if I found out that
I'm not as happy as I think?

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:16.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:17.812 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: What would
happen if I go in there

00:31:17.812 --> 00:31:21.270 align:middle line:90%
and it's difficult things?

00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And 7's will tend to make light
of situations that are heavy.

00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:28.410 align:middle line:84%
And they can be the comics
for us, which can really help.

00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:30.835 align:middle line:84%
But at a certain point,
you want to say, cool it.

00:31:30.835 --> 00:31:31.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:33.502 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Just be here
with what's going on.

00:31:33.502 --> 00:31:36.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, even if it's
uncomfortable and painful.

00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:38.790 align:middle line:90%
Give them a hug.

00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:40.080 align:middle line:90%
Number 8?

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:44.735 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Number 8's are
full of great energy.

00:31:44.735 --> 00:31:46.110 align:middle line:84%
They're kind of
bigger than life.

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:47.568 align:middle line:84%
Often, they're
actually big people.

00:31:47.568 --> 00:31:50.065 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean fat, but I mean,
just kind of big presence.

00:31:50.065 --> 00:31:50.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:52.398 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: And when
I've done panels,

00:31:52.398 --> 00:31:54.570 align:middle line:84%
which means you ask
people to come and talk

00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:57.690 align:middle line:84%
about being that type, and
there's rows set up, often,

00:31:57.690 --> 00:31:59.880 align:middle line:84%
the 8's will separate their
chairs from one another

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:01.810 align:middle line:84%
because they want
their own territory.

00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:05.770 align:middle line:84%
And so 8's are very
much command people.

00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:07.650 align:middle line:84%
They will look at a
situation and assume

00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:09.300 align:middle line:84%
the commanding
position, whether or not

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:11.520 align:middle line:90%
anyone asks them to do it.

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:14.230 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with an 8 who
is a CEO of a company.

00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:18.480 align:middle line:84%
He was great because he
wants to get to business.

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:20.022 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't want to
go through any BS.

00:32:20.022 --> 00:32:20.822 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:20.822 --> 00:32:22.872 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: And after a few
minutes of conversation,

00:32:22.872 --> 00:32:23.830 align:middle line:90%
OK, I think we're done.

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:25.420 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:26.440 align:middle line:90%
And I just love that.

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:27.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:28.140 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Because you
know where you stand.

00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And he would tell
you where you were.

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:29.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:31.200 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Yeah, so
8's are great--

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He'll tell
you where you stand.

00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:34.305 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Yes, tell you
where he was, and--

00:32:34.305 --> 00:32:35.472 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And where you are.

00:32:35.472 --> 00:32:38.310 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: --wherever you are,
and where you need to be.

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:41.010 align:middle line:84%
But there's this, oftentimes,
a gruffness about 8's.

00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:43.600 align:middle line:90%
They don't have much finesse.

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:44.938 align:middle line:90%
They can be kind of bold, and--

00:32:44.938 --> 00:32:46.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Bull in a china shop.

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:47.438 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: --insensitive, yeah.

00:32:47.438 --> 00:32:50.130 align:middle line:84%
But when you get to
know them, oh my god,

00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:52.290 align:middle line:84%
they are the most
tender-hearted people.

00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And they are out to protect
the vulnerable in life.

00:32:55.450 --> 00:32:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And if they pick up that
you need their support,

00:32:57.790 --> 00:32:59.790 align:middle line:84%
they are there
completely for you.

00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:02.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can't get
any better support

00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:05.700 align:middle line:84%
than from an 8, who will step
up and fight for you if need be.

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:09.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if you're in
a relationship with an 8,

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:10.950 align:middle line:84%
you'd find that it's
kind of-- you're

00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:13.058 align:middle line:84%
going to be assessed
quite a bit.

00:33:13.058 --> 00:33:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to be
told how things are going.

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:16.500 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand,
if you need them,

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:17.623 align:middle line:90%
they're going to be there.

00:33:17.623 --> 00:33:18.540 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Very much so.

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:19.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:33:19.050 --> 00:33:21.210 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Yeah, I think
that's a good way to say it.

00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:23.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, now we get to 9's.

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:29.070 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: 9's-- 9's
have this, externally,

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:32.160 align:middle line:84%
this most wonderful kind of
plastic demeanor oftentimes.

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:33.960 align:middle line:90%
Most people just love 9's.

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:36.930 align:middle line:84%
They're very easy to be
around because 9's, it's

00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:39.472 align:middle line:84%
kind of like a sea
anemone, or something

00:33:39.472 --> 00:33:40.680 align:middle line:90%
that's just kind of floating.

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:41.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Flows with things.

00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:43.080 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: And they
float with things.

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:46.740 align:middle line:84%
And they don't really have a
lot of attention on themselves,

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:48.100 align:middle line:90%
it looks like, because it--

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:50.070 align:middle line:84%
and so the strength
and the weakness

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:52.900 align:middle line:84%
is that they can go
along with people.

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:55.080 align:middle line:84%
But then you don't know
really where they are,

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:56.280 align:middle line:90%
or what they want.

00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:58.468 align:middle line:84%
And 9's often wake up--
let's say that you're

00:33:58.468 --> 00:33:59.760 align:middle line:90%
in a relationship with someone.

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And they thought-- they would
call it merging with somebody.

00:34:03.150 --> 00:34:05.910 align:middle line:84%
That energy is, OK, I'll
just become that energy.

00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:11.580 align:middle line:84%
And they may wake up later
and say, how did I get here?

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:12.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh yeah.

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:15.179 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: So they have a hard
time knowing their own needs

00:34:15.179 --> 00:34:16.080 align:middle line:90%
and desires.

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:17.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:21.000 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: And yet they're the
most wonderful mediators.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.139 align:middle line:84%
They know how to see
all points of view.

00:34:23.139 --> 00:34:26.610 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of-- it's at
the top of the Enneagram,

00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:28.679 align:middle line:84%
of the Triangle, of
the Inner Triangle.

00:34:28.679 --> 00:34:33.090 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of like this
wonderful overview of people,

00:34:33.090 --> 00:34:34.500 align:middle line:90%
and a sense of accepting.

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:36.330 align:middle line:90%
Like, everyone has a place.

00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:39.420 align:middle line:84%
We really could really use
a lot more 8's, you know?

00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:42.030 align:middle line:84%
But 9's have
difficulty sometimes

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:44.909 align:middle line:84%
mobilizing themselves
or taking charge.

00:34:44.909 --> 00:34:46.170 align:middle line:90%
They can do it.

00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:50.940 align:middle line:84%
But it's not their most
natural place, you see.

00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:53.050 align:middle line:84%
So they really like
working in teams.

00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:54.810 align:middle line:90%
And they can say--

00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:56.790 align:middle line:84%
coordinate different
people working together.

00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:58.290 align:middle line:90%
And they're excellent at that.

00:34:58.290 --> 00:35:00.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But they can
get lost in other people

00:35:00.330 --> 00:35:02.160 align:middle line:84%
and not know what
their needs are, not

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:04.305 align:middle line:84%
know where they begin
and someone else ends?

00:35:04.305 --> 00:35:06.150 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Right, yeah,
and you don't find out

00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:07.942 align:middle line:84%
until they get really
angry about something

00:35:07.942 --> 00:35:08.790 align:middle line:90%
you didn't know.

00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:10.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.060 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: And they
don't know either.

00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:12.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:13.130 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: I'm sorry.

00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:14.250 align:middle line:90%
They-- I touched myself.

00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:17.050 align:middle line:90%
They don't know.

00:35:17.050 --> 00:35:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And so it can be hard
to know where a 9 is.

00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:21.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:24.340 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: So in partnership, you
have to kind of pull things out

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:25.140 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:25.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:29.940 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: And 9's feel that if
they express a strong opinion,

00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:33.660 align:middle line:84%
that might send you away
because what their focus really

00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:34.900 align:middle line:90%
is on connecting.

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:35.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:37.500 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: They feel
essential to stay connected.

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:37.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh yeah.

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:40.290 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: If I have a
disagreement and we disconnect,

00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:41.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to feel panicky.

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right, OK.

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:46.060 align:middle line:90%
So thank you so much.

00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:47.550 align:middle line:84%
You're so good at
explaining this.

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I guess 40
years of practice helps.

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:53.070 align:middle line:84%
But I would like to talk
just a little bit, then.

00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:56.310 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned a 1 and a 6, you
and your partner, a 1 and a 6.

00:35:56.310 --> 00:36:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And then talk about
a really easy sort

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:02.670 align:middle line:84%
of combination or
match, if we're

00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:06.200 align:middle line:84%
looking at just kind of
classically, cliche, easy.

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:08.700 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: The one that comes to
mind, this is a real classic,

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:10.194 align:middle line:90%
is the 1, 7.

00:36:10.194 --> 00:36:11.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:13.800 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: You think about a
rule-based, wanting to do

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:15.900 align:middle line:90%
things right, a little uptight.

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:20.770 align:middle line:84%
Make sure that you don't
just loosely do something.

00:36:20.770 --> 00:36:21.630 align:middle line:90%
But think about it.

00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:23.190 align:middle line:90%
You want to be appropriate.

00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:25.080 align:middle line:84%
You want to act--
that's very important,

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:28.470 align:middle line:84%
act appropriately A 7,
it's like, let's go.

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:29.290 align:middle line:90%
And let's play.

00:36:29.290 --> 00:36:30.290 align:middle line:90%
Why are you so uptight?

00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:32.290 align:middle line:84%
I think there's plenty
of movies about this kind

00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:32.940 align:middle line:90%
of archetypal thing.

00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:33.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, oh yeah.

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:35.070 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Lighten up, would you?

00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:36.510 align:middle line:90%
The 7 will say to the 1.

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:39.473 align:middle line:84%
And the 1 will say, why don't
you pull it in a little bit?

00:36:39.473 --> 00:36:40.890 align:middle line:84%
It's like you're
always out there.

00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:43.135 align:middle line:84%
And we have serious things
to do here, you know?

00:36:43.135 --> 00:36:44.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if
someone else would say,

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:46.950 align:middle line:84%
wow, that seems like
pretty opposite, you'd say,

00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:48.387 align:middle line:90%
no, this is a good match.

00:36:48.387 --> 00:36:49.470 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Well, the thing--

00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:50.885 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because they pull
something out of each other.

00:36:50.885 --> 00:36:51.900 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: You do.

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:54.060 align:middle line:90%
And if you can take that, and--

00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:56.960 align:middle line:90%
but here's the secret.

00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:01.310 align:middle line:84%
You have to see that you have
that other person in you.

00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:02.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:04.040 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: The one thing, and
I haven't read about this,

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:05.498 align:middle line:84%
but I've observed
through the years

00:37:05.498 --> 00:37:08.390 align:middle line:84%
that oftentimes, people
are in partnerships

00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:12.380 align:middle line:84%
or significant relationships
with people who

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:15.110 align:middle line:90%
they share the connecting line.

00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:18.050 align:middle line:90%
The 1 connects over to the 7.

00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:20.930 align:middle line:84%
Some say that, for the
1, is a heart space.

00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:24.260 align:middle line:84%
When I feel expanded,
I can go there.

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:27.200 align:middle line:84%
For the 7's to come to the 1,
it's usually not too pretty

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:29.390 align:middle line:90%
because they get critical.

00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:34.370 align:middle line:84%
But I have found that we
tend to attract people

00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:37.775 align:middle line:84%
who are connected to us
through these connecting lines

00:37:37.775 --> 00:37:38.930 align:middle line:90%
of the Enneagram.

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to
use relationship

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:43.530 align:middle line:84%
as a path for growth,
this can really work.

00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:44.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:48.200 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Because it's your
shadow that's over there.

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:51.830 align:middle line:84%
We're oftentimes drawn to the
person who is our own shadow.

00:37:51.830 --> 00:37:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And then we make them
wrong, as a 1 would.

00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:55.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:57.380 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: But we have to
learn to embrace that.

00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:58.297 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:37:58.297 --> 00:38:01.160 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: And the counterpoint
to the narrowness--

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:02.480 align:middle line:90%
each type is fine.

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:03.630 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing wrong.

00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:04.970 align:middle line:90%
It's just that it gets narrow.

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And the Enneagram is
so brilliant in saying,

00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:09.620 align:middle line:90%
expand out.

00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:13.010 align:middle line:84%
You actually have all of these
other eight qualities in you.

00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:15.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, you're
not just one thing.

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:19.110 align:middle line:84%
It just might-- you might be the
dominantly express one thing.

00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:19.910 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Exactly.

00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:21.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
when you look at it,

00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:24.410 align:middle line:84%
it's often two or even
three dominant parts

00:38:24.410 --> 00:38:25.290 align:middle line:90%
that will come up.

00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And if you take
classic Enneagram

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:29.380 align:middle line:90%
tests, which you can do online.

00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:31.130 align:middle line:84%
You can find one and
do a little Enneagram

00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:32.600 align:middle line:90%
test, and a bunch of questions.

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And it overlays
pretty well with what

00:38:34.850 --> 00:38:37.730 align:middle line:84%
you would kind of self-identify
in your book, I noticed.

00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:42.550 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's talk about maybe a
more challenging combination,

00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:43.350 align:middle line:90%
classically.

00:38:43.350 --> 00:38:46.660 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Yes, I
don't know-- well,

00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:48.230 align:middle line:84%
it's dramatic, if
not challenging.

00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:51.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm just thinking about
this, like, the 4 and 8.

00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:52.490 align:middle line:90%
They're both very intense.

00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:53.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:55.450 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: The 4 is very
intense with feelings

00:38:55.450 --> 00:38:58.870 align:middle line:84%
and inner feelings, and
having to be an individual.

00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:00.820 align:middle line:90%
And no one's really like me.

00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:04.900 align:middle line:84%
The 8, as you know, is kind of
a very strong, intense energy,

00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:07.460 align:middle line:90%
more outwardly directed.

00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:08.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:11.660 align:middle line:84%
But if you take a movie like
"Vicky Cristina Barcelona."

00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:12.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:14.200 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Javier Bardem
and Penelope Cruz?

00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:15.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, boom.

00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:16.962 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: These explosions.

00:39:16.962 --> 00:39:18.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it
ended up in marriage--

00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:18.910 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Yes.

00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:19.952 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --in real life.

00:39:19.952 --> 00:39:23.643 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Yeah, but that to me, I
don't know if it's challenging.

00:39:23.643 --> 00:39:25.060 align:middle line:84%
But it is because
they really have

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:27.550 align:middle line:84%
to monitor the intensity
since they both share that.

00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:28.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:31.100 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: It's kind of like their
overdone strains can really

00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:33.700 align:middle line:90%
take them down a certain path.

00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:39.880 align:middle line:84%
I think for challenging,
let's say a 2 and a 5.

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:41.800 align:middle line:90%
The 2 wants to really--

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:42.937 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Help and please.

00:39:42.937 --> 00:39:44.020 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Please, you know.

00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:45.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the 5 is
saying, like, I'm researching.

00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:46.510 align:middle line:90%
Don't bug me.

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:47.320 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to think about it.

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:47.980 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to feel that.

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:48.580 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: OK, honey.

00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:49.720 align:middle line:90%
I'll leave you a cup of coffee.

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:50.762 align:middle line:90%
And I'll leave you alone.

00:39:50.762 --> 00:39:52.615 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:39:52.615 --> 00:39:55.780 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so that could feel a
little dry, a little painful,

00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:56.830 align:middle line:90%
for the two.

00:39:56.830 --> 00:39:57.340 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Yes.

00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:58.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
that makes sense.

00:39:58.240 --> 00:39:59.690 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: And intrusive
on the 5's part.

00:39:59.690 --> 00:40:00.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
intrusive on the 5.

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:01.637 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: And they
just keep trying

00:40:01.637 --> 00:40:03.290 align:middle line:84%
to get into their
own privacy more.

00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:05.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and so
you just-- they keep

00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:08.170 align:middle line:90%
pulling away from you, yeah.

00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:10.540 align:middle line:84%
So I did the little test
because I'm looking--

00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:11.450 align:middle line:90%
I love your book.

00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:12.400 align:middle line:90%
So I'm looking at it.

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:13.780 align:middle line:84%
And my husband
and I both did it.

00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:14.110 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: OK.

00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:15.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so I
told you our numbers.

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:16.330 align:middle line:90%
And you didn't even comment.

00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:17.380 align:middle line:90%
You just started laughing.

00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:18.940 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Well, tell me
again because you said--

00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:19.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, well,
what it was, what we

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:22.810 align:middle line:84%
came up with in the test-- we
took an online test, right?

00:40:22.810 --> 00:40:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And we ended up where
I was like, a 7, 9, 2.

00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:30.150 align:middle line:90%
And he was a 4, 8, 1.

00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:30.950 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: OK.

00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:34.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
started laughing.

00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:35.750 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: I laugh a
lot with this stuff.

00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:37.420 align:middle line:90%
Well, I have to think about why.

00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:38.690 align:middle line:90%
If I take your first one, 7?

00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:39.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:39.490 --> 00:40:41.080 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: You think
you might be a 7.

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:43.155 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: 7-- 7, 9,
one of the two-- both.

00:40:43.155 --> 00:40:43.955 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: 7 and 9.

00:40:43.955 --> 00:40:46.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it seemed
a little more 7 than 9.

00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:48.910 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: OK, and him,
the first one being?

00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:50.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 4, 8.

00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:51.500 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Oh, OK.

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:53.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is that
why you laughed?

00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:54.040 align:middle line:90%
That intensity.

00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:54.840 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: --the 4.

00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:56.575 align:middle line:90%
Well, a 4, 8 is--

00:40:56.575 --> 00:40:57.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So intense.

00:40:57.450 --> 00:40:57.770 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Very intense.

00:40:57.770 --> 00:40:59.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He's so
brilliant, but so intense.

00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:00.130 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Yes.

00:41:00.130 --> 00:41:00.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:01.592 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: They're intense.

00:41:01.592 --> 00:41:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And especially for 7's
who want to keep things up

00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:08.200 align:middle line:90%
and light, 4's can really--

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:10.480 align:middle line:84%
the 7's feel like, that 4
is really dragging me down.

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:12.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it can
rain on your parade.

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And the 4 is saying, can't
you just be where this is?

00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:19.150 align:middle line:84%
Can't you be where I
am with the suffering?

00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:20.980 align:middle line:90%
And life has suffering.

00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:22.220 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, suffering?

00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:23.020 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:25.487 align:middle line:84%
Can't we get over
that part faster?

00:41:25.487 --> 00:41:26.320 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: You got it.

00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:27.370 align:middle line:90%
You know this stuff.

00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:28.953 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh yeah.

00:41:28.953 --> 00:41:30.370 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: That's
what would happen.

00:41:30.370 --> 00:41:33.490 align:middle line:84%
And so to grow
together, the 4 would

00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:35.200 align:middle line:84%
have to understand
that sometimes, it's

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:36.117 align:middle line:90%
OK to just lighten up.

00:41:36.117 --> 00:41:36.917 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:36.917 --> 00:41:37.900 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: And enjoy.

00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:38.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:39.147 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: And they can.

00:41:39.147 --> 00:41:42.308 align:middle line:84%
And the 7 has to once in a
while say, OK, maybe life--

00:41:42.308 --> 00:41:43.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'll suffer with you.

00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:44.770 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: --is not always
going to be up and happy.

00:41:44.770 --> 00:41:45.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:47.620 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: And there's some
richness in what you have--

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:48.490 align:middle line:90%
what you're holding here.

00:41:48.490 --> 00:41:48.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:51.190 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: And I've seen 7's
begin to really appreciate

00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:53.570 align:middle line:84%
that because 4's can
help bring the 7 in.

00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:54.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:54.370 --> 00:41:56.080 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: And 7's
generally need that.

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:58.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah,
and then the other part

00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.590 align:middle line:90%
was the 9 and then the 8.

00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:01.900 align:middle line:84%
And we both relate
strongly to those as well.

00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:03.670 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Well, actually, very
good because those are wings,

00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:04.180 align:middle line:90%
meaning that--

00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:04.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:07.450 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: --if you are
a 7 with an 8 wing,

00:42:07.450 --> 00:42:08.600 align:middle line:90%
and he's a 9 with a--

00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:09.400 align:middle line:90%
or an 8 with a--

00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:10.233 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He's a 4--

00:42:10.233 --> 00:42:11.525 align:middle line:90%
well, I don't know about wings.

00:42:11.525 --> 00:42:13.150 align:middle line:84%
But he just came
out dominant, 4, 8.

00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And I came out
dominant, 7 and 9.

00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:17.800 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Yeah, yeah, yeah, so--

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:20.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that squishy part,
just flowing and wanting to be

00:42:20.650 --> 00:42:21.610 align:middle line:90%
part of--

00:42:21.610 --> 00:42:24.560 align:middle line:84%
and flowing in with, and
saying, how did I get here,

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:26.020 align:middle line:90%
I totally get that one.

00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:28.570 align:middle line:84%
You can't tell yourself from
someone else in the room--

00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:29.000 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Right.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:29.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --anyone in the room.

00:42:29.830 --> 00:42:30.630 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Yeah.

00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:32.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and
then his ability

00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:34.190 align:middle line:90%
to say, hey, this is how it is.

00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:36.820 align:middle line:90%
And I can handle it, the 8.

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:38.650 align:middle line:84%
I know where everyone's
supposed to be--

00:42:38.650 --> 00:42:39.980 align:middle line:90%
take their place.

00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:41.180 align:middle line:90%
And it is interesting.

00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:45.430 align:middle line:84%
There's so much richness and so
much up and down to work with.

00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:50.110 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Oh, it's just-- it's
a wonderful thing to watch.

00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:53.650 align:middle line:84%
And once you begin to know the
Enneagram more and integrated,

00:42:53.650 --> 00:42:55.130 align:middle line:84%
you begin to see
it all around you.

00:42:55.130 --> 00:42:55.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:42:55.930 --> 00:42:58.882 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: And it becomes
almost entertainment,

00:42:58.882 --> 00:43:00.090 align:middle line:90%
too because you're watching--

00:43:00.090 --> 00:43:00.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I think so.

00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:01.810 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:02.700 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: --people
do their things.

00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:03.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, the thing
I like about your book

00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:05.910 align:middle line:84%
is that because it's
so approachable.

00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:10.530 align:middle line:84%
It's direct-- and because
you made it so essential when

00:43:10.530 --> 00:43:15.960 align:middle line:84%
you got down to the values of
each one, the characteristics,

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:17.880 align:middle line:90%
and how to interact with them.

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:19.660 align:middle line:90%
It was just so to the point.

00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:20.460 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Good.

00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:22.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That you could
use the book for people

00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:23.680 align:middle line:90%
who are unfamiliar with it.

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:23.970 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Yes.

00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:25.345 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
could even have

00:43:25.345 --> 00:43:27.480 align:middle line:84%
fun at a dinner
party or whatever,

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:30.302 align:middle line:84%
and play with these
parts so that you

00:43:30.302 --> 00:43:32.010 align:middle line:84%
start understanding
and seeing each other

00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:33.108 align:middle line:90%
in a whole different way.

00:43:33.108 --> 00:43:35.400 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Even if you don't
know your type or someone's,

00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:37.710 align:middle line:90%
you at least go, I'm curious.

00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:38.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:43:38.850 --> 00:43:40.520 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: And that's
the opening door--

00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:41.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:43.050 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: --to say,
I'm curious now.

00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:46.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and just with
this innate understanding,

00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:48.090 align:middle line:84%
there's more compassion
if we can accept

00:43:48.090 --> 00:43:49.230 align:middle line:90%
that we're all different.

00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:52.090 align:middle line:84%
And here, you're going to
see we're all very different.

00:43:52.090 --> 00:43:53.910 align:middle line:84%
We come from a completely
different place

00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:56.940 align:middle line:84%
of what we need, desire,
want, and don't want.

00:43:56.940 --> 00:43:59.910 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Yes, and
we all have things

00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:02.890 align:middle line:84%
we want to move towards and
things we want to avoid.

00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:03.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:05.523 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: I mean, I've
seen through the years

00:44:05.523 --> 00:44:07.630 align:middle line:90%
that people are very simple.

00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:08.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We are.

00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:09.230 align:middle line:90%
We're amoeba.

00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:11.370 align:middle line:84%
We scootch away from
the uncomfortable.

00:44:11.370 --> 00:44:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And we're attracted to the
things that are sweet and nice.

00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:15.630 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: And everyone
is doing that.

00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:16.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Everyone.

00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:17.220 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: But in their own way.

00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:18.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:44:18.210 --> 00:44:22.080 align:middle line:84%
That-- in fact, we used to joke
about that, about the amoeba

00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:23.100 align:middle line:90%
quality of life.

00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:28.110 align:middle line:84%
Or if it's uncomfortable, I
just start scootching away.

00:44:28.110 --> 00:44:30.930 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Yeah, and so I
find that compassion really

00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:34.870 align:middle line:84%
helps because you want people to
be more in their expanded self.

00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:35.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:38.530 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: And when you lead from
your heart, people feel it.

00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:39.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:40.620 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: And they relax.

00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:41.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:41.130 --> 00:44:41.890 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: And they relax.

00:44:41.890 --> 00:44:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And they're kind of
OK with who they are.

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And they show more
of who they are.

00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:47.190 align:middle line:90%
And you meet.

00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's this meeting, human
to human is what I call it.

00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:54.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's fun if you
can just drop the defenses

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.010 align:middle line:84%
and say, hey, we all
have our burdens.

00:44:56.010 --> 00:44:57.270 align:middle line:90%
And we all have our beauty.

00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:59.010 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about it.

00:44:59.010 --> 00:44:59.970 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Exactly.

00:44:59.970 --> 00:45:01.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Any final thoughts?

00:45:01.210 --> 00:45:03.840 align:middle line:84%
This has been a
lovely conversation.

00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:09.090 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: I want to just say that
earlier, that the kindness is

00:45:09.090 --> 00:45:11.170 align:middle line:90%
just the medicine.

00:45:11.170 --> 00:45:11.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:13.530 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: And I find
the Enneagram--

00:45:13.530 --> 00:45:15.155 align:middle line:84%
you asked about the
world and so forth.

00:45:15.155 --> 00:45:16.290 align:middle line:90%
This is great medicine.

00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:17.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:19.155 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: I tried to make
the medicine go down

00:45:19.155 --> 00:45:20.478 align:middle line:90%
a little easier with my book.

00:45:20.478 --> 00:45:22.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, you
have a lot of sugar

00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:23.950 align:middle line:84%
in there, that beautiful
artwork and the distillation.

00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:24.750 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Yeah, I love the--

00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:25.920 align:middle line:90%
Nancy, who did my artwork--

00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:26.753 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Beautiful.

00:45:26.753 --> 00:45:29.640 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: --I am so grateful.

00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:34.470 align:middle line:84%
But it's-- I just find it gives
me a place to sit in life where

00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:36.240 align:middle line:90%
I can appreciate people.

00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:38.850 align:middle line:84%
There are people who
still really bother me.

00:45:38.850 --> 00:45:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And there are
people who, I just--

00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:40.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But you're a 1.

00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:41.823 align:middle line:90%
They'll always bother you.

00:45:41.823 --> 00:45:44.760 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: Oh, you can
just turn the wrong way.

00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:46.440 align:middle line:10%
And I'm angry at you, you know?

00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:48.180 align:middle line:10%
But it's a practice, then.

00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:49.660 align:middle line:10%
So I'm not saying,
go and be nice.

00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:50.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:53.220 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK: I'm just saying, do
the practice of kindness, which

00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:57.360 align:middle line:84%
means, how do I
allow myself to see

00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:01.820 align:middle line:84%
if I can understand life from
another person's point of view?

00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:03.090 align:middle line:90%
I may not like it.

00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:04.880 align:middle line:10%
But I can at least
see what it is,

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:09.590 align:middle line:10%
and see in my own human self if
I have that same place in me.

00:46:09.590 --> 00:46:11.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's the
beauty of the Enneagram.

00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:13.770 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
writing this beautiful book.

00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:14.978 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK: Thank you very much.

00:46:14.978 --> 00:46:16.250 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it, Regina.

00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:18.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Again, Frank's book
is titled: "A Field Guide

00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:21.920 align:middle line:84%
to Humans: Using the Enneagram
to Improve Your Relationships,"

00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:23.840 align:middle line:84%

major booksellers--

such a sweet and
personal reading.

00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:28.790 align:middle line:84%
It allows us to be kinder, as
we just talked about, and more

00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:30.200 align:middle line:90%
understanding with one another.

00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:33.593 align:middle line:10%
And we're all in our
beautiful and unique journey.
