>>BILLY CARSON:
Welcome to "Disclosure"

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.470 align:middle line:10%
with Dr. Steven Greer.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.830 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we explore
manifestations of contact.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:25.630 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Greer, welcome.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:26.713 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVEN GREER: Thank you.

00:00:26.713 --> 00:00:27.830 align:middle line:90%
Great to be here with you.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.872 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: In your paper
"Extraterrestrials and New

00:00:29.872 --> 00:00:33.473 align:middle line:84%
Cosmology," you talk about
several types of contact.

00:00:33.473 --> 00:00:34.640 align:middle line:90%
Can you explain that for us?

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.057 align:middle line:10%
>>GREER: What it's
really about is

00:00:36.057 --> 00:00:41.960 align:middle line:10%
understanding how ET
civilizations manifest

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.520 align:middle line:10%
in our space time.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.040 align:middle line:84%
Remember, extraterrestrial
civilizations

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:53.210 align:middle line:84%
have the ability to phase
from a very non-3D energy

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.590 align:middle line:84%
field all the way into
full manifestation.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.540 align:middle line:84%
So you can have, for example,
an entire spacecraft, 3D.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.910 align:middle line:84%
That spacecraft, many people
who have observed this--

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.010 align:middle line:84%
we've had this happen
on our expeditions--

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.240 align:middle line:84%
can then fold into space time,
and all you see is a sphere.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.530 align:middle line:84%
A red, pulsing sphere
or orange, or whatever.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.150 align:middle line:90%
And then it can unfold back out.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.980 align:middle line:84%
So this confuses people, because
they said, which came first?

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.570 align:middle line:90%
Or was the sphere part of it?

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.460 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, it's all
part and parcel of it

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.430 align:middle line:90%
enfolding within space time.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.130 align:middle line:84%
And this is why you have so
many unusual manifestations.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.610 align:middle line:84%
Often, we will have a contact
event where we'll be sitting.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.890 align:middle line:84%
We're meditating
out under the stars,

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.480 align:middle line:84%
and there'll be
a brilliant burst

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.400 align:middle line:84%
of light right in the
center of this circle, maybe

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.440 align:middle line:90%
four feet above the ground.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.900 align:middle line:84%
It's usually right around
or above the puja table

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.950 align:middle line:84%
where I do the Sanskrit
Vedic meditation.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And it will burst so
brightly that even

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.050 align:middle line:84%
with your eyes closed,
you'll see your eyelid veins.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And everyone is sort of
permeated with a consciousness

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.990 align:middle line:90%
light.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.430 align:middle line:84%
So the light is actually imbued
with consciousness, almost

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.040 align:middle line:90%
at a celestial, fine level.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And people are just
awakened into a state

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.850 align:middle line:90%
of amazing consciousness.

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.950 align:middle line:90%
That's happened many times.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.590 align:middle line:84%
Another time up
north of Phoenix,

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.740 align:middle line:84%
out near the national
forest, a craft came in.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.140 align:middle line:90%
We were in meditation.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And literally, I was looking
just at the right point,

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.280 align:middle line:84%
because I was told
mentally, look up behind me.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.660 align:middle line:90%
So I just had to look like this.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.420 align:middle line:84%
At that instant, it
looked like the heavens

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.830 align:middle line:90%
had been rent asunder.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.700 align:middle line:84%
It looked like there
was a parting of space.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And in that parting of space,
this beautiful blue ship

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.710 align:middle line:84%
appeared and suffused
the entire team

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.320 align:middle line:84%
for just an instant in
this blue white light.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.040 align:middle line:90%
It lit up the entire desert.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And everyone saw
this, of course.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.130 align:middle line:90%
It was brilliant.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And so you can have
everything from a full 3D

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.280 align:middle line:84%
to events like that that
happened, and come and go

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.510 align:middle line:90%
very quickly.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.790 align:middle line:84%
And then of course,
the teleportation right

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.550 align:middle line:90%
onto the site of ET beings.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.950 align:middle line:84%
Now interestingly, that goes
all the way from physical bodies

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.870 align:middle line:90%
and they're walking around--

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.018 align:middle line:90%
and we'll be meditating.

00:03:22.018 --> 00:03:23.060 align:middle line:90%
You'll hear them walking.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.860 align:middle line:90%
They'll touch you.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.580 align:middle line:90%
You look, there's nothing there.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's because they don't
have to be fully visible,

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.400 align:middle line:90%
be sort of cloaked.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.640 align:middle line:84%
And they'll go around and
do energy work with people.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.860 align:middle line:90%
But you hear them walking.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.570 align:middle line:84%
This happens almost every
expedition that I conduct.

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And then you have this other
really amazing phenomenon

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.510 align:middle line:84%
where the ETs will
control the environment.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.320 align:middle line:84%
So we'll be sitting
out in a remote area,

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.670 align:middle line:84%
and the ET craft will be
partially in this dimension,

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.460 align:middle line:84%
so much so that you
can almost-- it sounds

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.520 align:middle line:84%
like an echo when you speak,
like you're bouncing off

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.500 align:middle line:90%
the walls, but it's clear air.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And in one instance, I remember
we were up in Joshua Tree

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.140 align:middle line:90%
in the center of the park.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.210 align:middle line:84%
And it was about 38
degrees that night.

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.130 align:middle line:90%
It was quite cold.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And this energy field
manifested around us

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.440 align:middle line:90%
that was extraterrestrial.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.910 align:middle line:90%
Very subtle.

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And we had this echoey
effect as we spoke.

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.650 align:middle line:10%
And you could see
subtle energies,

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.210 align:middle line:10%
almost like celestial
level of energy around us.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.390 align:middle line:84%
And beings moving,
but not quite 3D.

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And the temperature went
up to 69 degrees from 38.

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.530 align:middle line:84%
So it went up 31 degrees
in a short amount of time.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.860 align:middle line:84%
You could walk 20 yards outside
our circle and it was freezing.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.960 align:middle line:84%
So it did a controlled
environment.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.220 align:middle line:84%
People were literally
pulling their jackets off.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.830 align:middle line:84%
There are so many ways
that these happen.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.200 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite,
sort of whimsical things

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.020 align:middle line:84%
was up on Blanca Peak
in Southern Colorado.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And a member of our team, as
we were doing the meditation,

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.650 align:middle line:84%
silently asked the ETs if they
could just use the Big Dipper--

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.530 align:middle line:84%
you know, the four stars that
are in the dipper and then

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:10.730 align:middle line:90%
the three in the handle--

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.910 align:middle line:84%
and just turn them on and
off in kind of a code.

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.490 align:middle line:84%
He was a mathematician,
a computer guy.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, as
soon as this thought

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:24.470 align:middle line:84%
left his brain to the ETs,
in a crystal clear sky--

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.080 align:middle line:84%
we were up at 9,000
or 10,000 feet--

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.810 align:middle line:84%
each star, and
sometimes two at a time,

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.870 align:middle line:84%
would go on and off
signaling to us.

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.310 align:middle line:90%
And this went on for 23 minutes.

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.313 align:middle line:84%
So we have unbelievable
amount of footage

00:05:38.313 --> 00:05:39.230 align:middle line:90%
of this sort of thing.

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.100 align:middle line:90%
It's very subtle.

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.170 align:middle line:90%
So what is that?

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:43.640 align:middle line:90%
They were communicating in code.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.280 align:middle line:84%
It was a sequence
that we recorded.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.040 align:middle line:84%
When we got back to our
condos late at night,

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.310 align:middle line:84%
3:00 in the morning, all
the clocks and all the units

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.630 align:middle line:84%
were flashing some number that
was related to that pattern.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.660 align:middle line:84%
Really unusual,
higher consciousness,

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:04.030 align:middle line:90%
transdimensional manifestations.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:09.040 align:middle line:84%
It's really quite beautiful
how this all unfolds.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:13.402 align:middle line:84%
One time at Mount Shasta,
we were in meditation.

00:06:13.402 --> 00:06:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And this gets into the Vedic
concept of name and form

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.950 align:middle line:84%
where the
thought-sound component

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:23.230 align:middle line:90%
can manifest the object.

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:25.360 align:middle line:90%
It's called name and form.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.640 align:middle line:84%
So the word for water in
Sanskrit is [SANSKRIT]..

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.130 align:middle line:84%
At a certain level of
consciousness and vibration,

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:35.110 align:middle line:90%
you can manifest water.

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.220 align:middle line:84%
But the ETs have technologies
as well as innate abilities

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:40.180 align:middle line:90%
to do this.

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.470 align:middle line:84%
So we're sitting in a circle
in this national forest.

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:48.760 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, we hear
this tone that comes through

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:54.280 align:middle line:84%
from southwest to northeast,
headed towards Mount Shasta.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.340 align:middle line:90%
And everyone hears it.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.660 align:middle line:90%
Eyes were closed.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And what everyone saw
in their mental image

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.600 align:middle line:84%
was a sort of gray
metallic sphere

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.530 align:middle line:84%
that was consciousness and
ET, zip, zip, zip, zip,

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.200 align:middle line:84%
zip like a string
of pearls moving

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:15.140 align:middle line:84%
through the circle at ground
level, or above the ground,

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:18.340 align:middle line:84%
but at our level where
we're sitting in the chairs.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.270 align:middle line:90%
Very unusual.

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.880 align:middle line:84%
We have a tape recording of
that signal that moved through.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.470 align:middle line:84%
So there's almost an
infinite number of ways

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:29.260 align:middle line:84%
that civilizations that
are interstellar and are

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.660 align:middle line:84%
at that level of technology
and consciousness

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.000 align:middle line:90%
can manifest and interface.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.910 align:middle line:84%
So it can be in thought,
it can be in light,

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:43.280 align:middle line:84%
it can be in matter, it can
be in natural phenomena.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.790 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that happened
about a year and a half ago,

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:48.700 align:middle line:84%
we were at Joshua
Tree National Park.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And this sort of thing
has happened many times.

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:54.670 align:middle line:84%
It looks like we have an
aircraft coming in on a landing

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:56.890 align:middle line:90%
approach with landing lights.

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:57.910 align:middle line:90%
So we're looking at it.

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:01.150 align:middle line:84%
To me, it felt like
it wasn't human.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:05.470 align:middle line:84%
But as it got closer, you heard
the jet engines, all that.

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:09.610 align:middle line:84%
But suddenly, in a crystal clear
sky, it gets right above us

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:11.680 align:middle line:90%
and dematerializes.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.110 align:middle line:84%
Now no one was filming it,
because everybody assumed

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:17.920 align:middle line:84%
this is obviously an airplane
going into Palm Springs

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.510 align:middle line:90%
or Orange County or LAX.

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:25.420 align:middle line:84%
In reality, they were
masquerading as a jet,

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.070 align:middle line:90%
but they weren't.

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And this has happened
multiple times.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:34.130 align:middle line:84%
We've also had a lot of
phenomenon with weather

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:38.830 align:middle line:84%
where we'll be doing
our CE5 contact

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:41.980 align:middle line:90%
and we'll have a cloud appear.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:42.859 align:middle line:90%
And then the cloud--

00:08:42.859 --> 00:08:43.659 align:middle line:90%
it's really windy.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:44.260 align:middle line:90%
It never moves.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:44.860 align:middle line:90%
Never moves.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:47.560 align:middle line:84%
And you'll start seeing objects
light up around the edge of it,

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:48.760 align:middle line:90%
moving around.

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:53.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, this happened in
Arizona for about 45 minutes

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:55.030 align:middle line:90%
that we videotaped.

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And it was a cloud
that they had created

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:02.052 align:middle line:84%
to keep around the craft
while they were meditating

00:09:02.052 --> 00:09:03.010 align:middle line:90%
and connecting with us.

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:04.960 align:middle line:90%
And everyone, everyone saw this.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.880 align:middle line:84%
So that's what
you're dealing with,

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.480 align:middle line:84%
and that's what you have
to prepare for mentally,

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:14.100 align:middle line:84%
and really do a reality check
at every step of what you're

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:14.900 align:middle line:90%
doing.

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:18.850 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're making
contact in a pure-hearted way,

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:20.722 align:middle line:90%
they're going to come.

00:09:20.722 --> 00:09:22.180 align:middle line:84%
And they're going
to come, however,

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.080 align:middle line:84%
in ways you may
not be expecting.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.320 align:middle line:84%
So you have to almost
suspend your prejudices

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.500 align:middle line:84%
and just observe and
be interactive as

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:33.910 align:middle line:84%
opposed to wanting to
impose your beliefs on what

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:35.360 align:middle line:90%
the ET civilizations might do.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.160 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Right.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.060 align:middle line:90%
Just be open.

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:37.690 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: Be open.

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:39.648 align:middle line:84%
And that's hard for
people, because we all have

00:09:39.648 --> 00:09:41.620 align:middle line:90%
our own predetermined ideas.

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:42.430 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Exactly.

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:43.230 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Greer,
some people suggest

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:49.150 align:middle line:84%
that apparitions are holograms
from other dimensions.

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:51.530 align:middle line:84%
Can you go into that
a little bit deeper?

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:54.820 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: I know people who work
in classified projects that

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:57.850 align:middle line:84%
have the ability to
stage things using

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:02.950 align:middle line:84%
very advanced generation,
beyond what people can imagine,

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:05.950 align:middle line:90%
holographic technologies.

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:09.280 align:middle line:84%
An ET civilization
can similarly do that,

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.620 align:middle line:84%
although generally they
don't have to stage anything.

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:15.250 align:middle line:90%
They simply can present in--

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:16.390 align:middle line:90%
it's not a hologram.

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:21.460 align:middle line:84%
It looks almost like a hologram
or something almost astral

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:24.520 align:middle line:84%
that you can see, but
it's actually them

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:28.990 align:middle line:84%
just appearing partially
in 3D for security reasons

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:31.480 align:middle line:90%
or so that you're not scared.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.820 align:middle line:84%
The big trick here
is also realizing

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:37.810 align:middle line:84%
that 70 years and
trillions of dollars

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:40.750 align:middle line:84%
in R&D and classified
projects have enabled--

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:43.210 align:middle line:84%
and we haven't touched
the surface on this--

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:48.220 align:middle line:84%
of what the intelligence
community and contractors

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:50.410 align:middle line:84%
that are in unacknowledged
special access projects

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:52.000 align:middle line:90%
can simulate.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.950 align:middle line:90%
So that's one of the problems.

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:57.820 align:middle line:84%
You have to know that
whatever you think

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:00.040 align:middle line:90%
can be done go way past that.

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.480 align:middle line:10%
Ben Rich, the head of the
Lockheed Skunk Works, he said,

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.340 align:middle line:10%
look.

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:05.440 align:middle line:10%
Anything that you've
seen or can imagine

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:08.318 align:middle line:10%
from "Star Trek" or "Star
Wars," we have already done it.

00:11:08.318 --> 00:11:09.610 align:middle line:90%
It's sitting out in the desert.

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:11.950 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't talking about Area 51.

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:16.330 align:middle line:10%
He was talking about the cube
and the underground facility

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:18.790 align:middle line:10%
for the Lockheed Skunk
Works out in the high desert

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:20.080 align:middle line:10%
of California.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:25.360 align:middle line:10%
And I think that there can
be deceptive operations,

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.000 align:middle line:10%
because they can stage--

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.500 align:middle line:10%
the humans can stage things
that look very extraterrestrial.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:35.080 align:middle line:10%
And then just to add
another layer of this

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.570 align:middle line:10%
is that many people
have confused

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:41.830 align:middle line:10%
interdimensional beings
with extraterrestrials

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:44.160 align:middle line:10%
that could be transdimensional.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.590 align:middle line:90%
So again, we have humans.

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:47.700 align:middle line:90%
We have 3D.

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:51.100 align:middle line:84%
We have classified projects that
can simulate almost anything.

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:55.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's add to that the
fact that most people conflate

00:11:55.260 --> 00:12:01.200 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial vehicles and
manifestations, let's say,

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.280 align:middle line:90%
with--

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.020 align:middle line:84%
they don't know, most
people, that there

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:07.610 align:middle line:84%
are classified technologies
that are the anti-gravity craft

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:08.410 align:middle line:90%
and stuff.

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:10.308 align:middle line:84%
This is mostly
what's in the news.

00:12:10.308 --> 00:12:11.850 align:middle line:84%
There aren't ET ones
they're showing.

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:14.340 align:middle line:84%
They're showing
ours, staging things.

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:18.840 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a whole
bunch of other phenomenon.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:21.900 align:middle line:84%
If you want to hear one of the
weirdest things that's true,

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:25.200 align:middle line:84%
a man who worked in the cube
at the Lockheed Skunk Works

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:30.600 align:middle line:84%
described to me an area where
they had an electronic device

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.540 align:middle line:84%
that people could connect
to, and that would take them

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:36.990 align:middle line:84%
into not another planet,
but into another dimension

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:43.830 align:middle line:84%
and see some horrifying boojum
creature, and pull it into 3D,

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:46.140 align:middle line:84%
and it'd be running
around the lab.

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:49.200 align:middle line:84%
I know other scientists
outside the Skunkworks

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.380 align:middle line:84%
have done this through very
high-voltage systems where

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:54.630 align:middle line:84%
they cross into these
other dimensions.

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:57.810 align:middle line:84%
So this is where a little
knowledge is a dangerous thing.

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:01.080 align:middle line:84%
We have to have enough
knowledge of the cosmology

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.840 align:middle line:84%
to have discernment to
know what's going on.

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of been
lost in this discussion,

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:09.030 align:middle line:84%
because it's a
little bit detailed.

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:11.670 align:middle line:84%
But if you just
remember, there's ET,

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:14.250 align:middle line:84%
there's human that
can simulate the ET,

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:16.710 align:middle line:84%
and there are another
whole category.

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:21.585 align:middle line:84%
And most of what is talked
about in the UFO culture

00:13:21.585 --> 00:13:25.503 align:middle line:84%
is a gemish of all three
without any discernment.

00:13:25.503 --> 00:13:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And I think we have to
reach that discernment,

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:29.128 align:middle line:84%
or we're going to be
hopelessly confused,

00:13:29.128 --> 00:13:32.410 align:middle line:84%
but more importantly can
be deceived, all right?

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of this
obfuscation and confusion

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:40.380 align:middle line:84%
has been deliberate,
because as the Vedas say,

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:43.380 align:middle line:84%
knowledge is the
greatest purifier.

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:46.590 align:middle line:84%
When you have the knowledge,
you can purify and clarify.

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:49.363 align:middle line:84%
And I think this
obfuscation is not helpful.

00:13:49.363 --> 00:13:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: During some
of your CE5 events,

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:55.050 align:middle line:84%
you talk about this being
named Bijou that manifests.

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:57.900 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us a little
bit more about Bijou?

00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:59.820 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: Well, this is
one of many episodes.

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:03.690 align:middle line:84%
The reason I talk about it
is that this one actually let

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:06.160 align:middle line:90%
us take a photograph of him.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.300 align:middle line:84%
So some years ago, we were up
at Joshua Tree National Park.

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.310 align:middle line:90%
I think it was 2009.

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And we were doing the
protocols for CE5 contact,

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:19.620 align:middle line:84%
and we were doing it
for a couple of hours.

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:20.790 align:middle line:90%
Took a break.

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:24.175 align:middle line:84%
And I went down from
our site on geology

00:14:24.175 --> 00:14:27.610 align:middle line:90%
to a road towards the east.

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:33.040 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I did, that's
where in '96 an ET craft came

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:36.878 align:middle line:84%
in and land-- went straight into
the Earth and lit up all of--

00:14:36.878 --> 00:14:38.170 align:middle line:90%
a whole bunch of people saw it.

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:40.730 align:middle line:84%
It was about 300 feet in
diameter, teal blue green.

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:44.200 align:middle line:84%
So we knew that that was a
transdimensional interstellar

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.970 align:middle line:90%
center right out in that plane.

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:51.027 align:middle line:84%
So I went out there with
a few of my team members,

00:14:51.027 --> 00:14:52.610 align:middle line:84%
and we were talking
and what have you.

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:56.890 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, right on
my right shoulder--

00:14:56.890 --> 00:15:01.630 align:middle line:84%
and right often for me
means future, left is past--

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:05.020 align:middle line:84%
is this sort of
grapefruit-sized, golden-white

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:06.130 align:middle line:90%
sphere.

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:08.800 align:middle line:84%
And several people see, and
it's hovering right there.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is in pitch darkness
out in the wilderness.

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:14.350 align:middle line:90%
And I go, they're here.

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And so it leaves and goes up
towards where our circle is.

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.780 align:middle line:84%
So I go back and get
everyone organized.

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:25.660 align:middle line:84%
We get to the circle, and we
hear four or five ETs talking.

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:27.280 align:middle line:90%
And nothing's visible.

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:31.660 align:middle line:84%
So they're there very spatially
in terms of their talking.

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:36.040 align:middle line:84%
But with the eyes, you cannot
see their physical bodies.

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:36.880 align:middle line:90%
Very strange.

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:37.960 align:middle line:90%
So I say, look.

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:41.750 align:middle line:84%
Everyone needs to get
calm and organized here.

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:45.320 align:middle line:84%
This is full-on
contact happening.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And one of my
friends, Raven, who's

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:50.980 align:middle line:84%
in the "Close Encounters
of the Fifth Kind" movie,

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:52.750 align:middle line:90%
takes a photograph.

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:54.580 align:middle line:90%
I say, right there.

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And everyone had
heard female voices.

00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:59.230 align:middle line:84%
Most of these ETs
sounded female.

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:01.840 align:middle line:84%
There was one that I heard
that was a male voice.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:06.610 align:middle line:84%
And she takes a picture, and
in that picture is this ET,

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:13.240 align:middle line:84%
and just floating slightly
above where our chairs are.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And in the photograph
to the left,

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:18.250 align:middle line:84%
you'll see there's a
sphere, an orb, that's

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:20.470 align:middle line:84%
putting out this really
unusual light that

00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:22.300 align:middle line:90%
illuminates all the chairs.

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:24.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's an energy
beam that is holding

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:27.580 align:middle line:90%
the ET, floating in the desert.

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:31.750 align:middle line:84%
So that photograph,
very interestingly

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:37.450 align:middle line:84%
when you analyze it, it was the
sphere that was by my shoulder.

00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:39.700 align:middle line:84%
But that was the
entire collective

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:43.210 align:middle line:84%
of ETs and their craft
folding into space time.

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And then the ETs were teleported
in conscious energy field

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:52.270 align:middle line:84%
onto the desert, almost at
an astral level, but enough

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:55.780 align:middle line:84%
that the camera was
able to get this one ET

00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:59.140 align:middle line:84%
who came into this dimension
just enough, and he's waving.

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:01.577 align:middle line:84%
He's literally going
hi right at me.

00:17:01.577 --> 00:17:02.410 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Incredible.

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:05.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: And he has this sort of
whitish thing on the head that

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:06.730 align:middle line:90%
looks like a yarmulke.

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:08.780 align:middle line:84%
So after that
happened, we go back

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:10.540 align:middle line:84%
and say, look, we need
to get in a circle,

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:12.760 align:middle line:84%
because we're going to
continue this contact.

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:14.619 align:middle line:84%
So we have this
magnetic detector

00:17:14.619 --> 00:17:16.780 align:middle line:90%
that starts going on and off.

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:18.880 align:middle line:90%
When I asked this ET--

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:23.109 align:middle line:84%
and I was told by the ET
that his name was Bijou.

00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, is
this your name?

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:26.863 align:middle line:84%
It goes beep, beep
twice, which means yes.

00:17:26.863 --> 00:17:28.780 align:middle line:84%
And we're out in the
middle of the wilderness.

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:30.580 align:middle line:84%
That thing should not
be doing anything.

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:31.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Right.

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:34.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: Then I got the
information from him

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.180 align:middle line:84%
that he was from the
Andromeda Galaxy.

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:39.100 align:middle line:90%
And again, beep, beep.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.390 align:middle line:90%
So I repeated it.

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:43.180 align:middle line:84%
This goes on for about
45 minutes or an hour

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:47.320 align:middle line:84%
of this dialogue telepathically
and with the electronics

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:49.030 align:middle line:90%
confirming.

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:50.020 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting.

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And basically, you can
have any electronic device

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:57.950 align:middle line:84%
and ask these ETs to
take it over and use it.

00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And so we had this
wonderful encounter.

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And this went on
for quite some time.

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:07.210 align:middle line:84%
And so that ET is a senior
ambassador from the Andromeda

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:11.440 align:middle line:84%
Galaxy, which is the closest
galaxy to the Milky Way.

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:14.020 align:middle line:10%
It's about two and a half
million light years from Earth.

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:17.830 align:middle line:10%
And we've had many experiences
with that same contingent

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:21.530 align:middle line:10%
who come, pop in and
out at these events.

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:23.230 align:middle line:90%
So it's really quite beautiful.

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:24.130 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Wow.

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:26.060 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, we're talking
about intergalactic.

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:28.060 align:middle line:84%
But what's the terminology
that you like to use?

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:30.350 align:middle line:84%
Instead of intergalactic,
is there a different term?

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:31.570 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: Well, if it's
from another galaxy,

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:32.590 align:middle line:90%
it's intergalactic.

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:34.795 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is
intergalactic, interstellar,

00:18:34.795 --> 00:18:36.040 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't matter.

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:39.220 align:middle line:84%
To go from point A to B, they're
dropping out of space time.

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:42.190 align:middle line:84%
It seems as far away as
our minds go linearly.

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:44.200 align:middle line:84%
And going through these
other dimensions, boom.

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.000 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.570 align:middle line:90%
Right here.

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's done
technologically, of course,

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:53.680 align:middle line:84%
with consciousness systems that
interface with their spacecraft

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:54.910 align:middle line:90%
and their beings.

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:55.780 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Right.

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:57.970 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Greer, in
addition to the beeps

00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:00.226 align:middle line:84%
and the communication
with Bijou,

00:19:00.226 --> 00:19:03.670 align:middle line:84%
were there of any other type
of a profound experience

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:05.230 align:middle line:90%
that you walked away with?

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:06.030 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: Yes.

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:07.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was being
made very clear to us

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:12.120 align:middle line:84%
that the CE5 contact
teams were having contact

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.250 align:middle line:84%
with many, many
civilizations of which there

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:15.960 align:middle line:90%
are almost an infinite number.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:21.060 align:middle line:84%
But there were certain ones that
were being introduced to humans

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:24.700 align:middle line:84%
for the first time through
humans coming together, saying,

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:27.000 align:middle line:90%
we're ready through CE5 contact.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.290 align:middle line:84%
So everyone's thinking
everything is stationary.

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:31.170 align:middle line:90%
It's evolving and unfolding.

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And so I came away
with this understanding

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:38.880 align:middle line:84%
that many of these
civilizations are waiting for us

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.740 align:middle line:84%
to be in a state
of consciousness

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:43.230 align:middle line:84%
and coherence and
peaceful intent,

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:45.122 align:middle line:90%
and then they get introduced.

00:19:45.122 --> 00:19:46.830 align:middle line:84%
Have they been aware
of the Earth before?

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:48.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, they have.

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:51.120 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of
direct contact, that's

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:56.120 align:middle line:84%
something that kind of humans
have to be the leading partner.

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:57.630 align:middle line:90%
It's like a dance.

00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:58.820 align:middle line:90%
This is our planet.

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:01.500 align:middle line:84%
And even though these
other civilizations maybe

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:04.230 align:middle line:84%
have been around for
millions of years,

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:07.290 align:middle line:84%
they're not going to invade,
contrary to the movies.

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:10.050 align:middle line:84%
They're waiting for
us to welcome them.

00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:13.560 align:middle line:84%
But not with guns
and bombs, you know?

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:14.760 align:middle line:90%
That's not a welcome.

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:17.670 align:middle line:84%
So if people move in that
direction, they come.

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:20.760 align:middle line:84%
But it's not just
some stationary set

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:22.060 align:middle line:90%
of civilizations.

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:24.510 align:middle line:84%
It's a growing number
that are being added.

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:26.970 align:middle line:84%
Because in the
next 1,000 years--

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:29.670 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I've ever
said this publicly--

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:34.170 align:middle line:84%
all intelligent civilizations
that are interstellar capable

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:36.960 align:middle line:84%
will be united
together with Earth.

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:38.670 align:middle line:90%
That's where we're headed.

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:41.940 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: There's another ET
that you refer to as the healer.

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:43.800 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us
about the healer?

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.650 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: Yeah, and this
is a wonderful photograph.

00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:48.480 align:middle line:84%
This happened a
couple years ago up

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:51.240 align:middle line:84%
in Oracle, Arizona,
ironically named.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:54.960 align:middle line:84%
It's up in the mountains above
Tucson, about 5,000 feet up,

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:55.770 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:20:55.770 --> 00:21:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And we had a number of sightings
of objects far in the sky,

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:04.740 align:middle line:84%
and we had one
golden ship fly over

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:10.050 align:middle line:84%
that was from the one star
system out near Arcturus.

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:13.140 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's Arcturus directly,
it's that sector of space.

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:14.670 align:middle line:90%
And all this started unfolding.

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:20.160 align:middle line:84%
So we had right behind my chair
and a couple other people an ET

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.570 align:middle line:90%
walking.

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:25.440 align:middle line:10%
David Marconi, who wrote "Enemy
of the State" with Will Smith,

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.060 align:middle line:10%
he was there and had a camera.

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:30.850 align:middle line:10%
And I said, David, point
the camera over this way.

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And so he puts the camera
over in that direction,

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:37.350 align:middle line:84%
and it was this
ruby red teardrop.

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:39.330 align:middle line:90%
And the camera caught this ET.

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:42.060 align:middle line:84%
So the camera light
cells were able to catch

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:45.030 align:middle line:90%
the entire 5, 6-foot tall ET.

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:46.380 align:middle line:90%
Very triangular head.

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:48.030 align:middle line:90%
Sort of a bird-like beak.

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:49.920 align:middle line:90%
So I said, well, they're here.

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:52.230 align:middle line:84%
We saw the photograph
immediately.

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And we began to meditate and
connect with that civilization.

00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:58.500 align:middle line:10%
So what's beautiful
about this is

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:00.450 align:middle line:10%
that this man
throughout the night

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:03.360 align:middle line:10%
continued to have contact.

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.310 align:middle line:10%
So he stayed up to almost dawn.

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:09.180 align:middle line:10%
And we have video of
this red object that

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:11.370 align:middle line:10%
keeps coming in and
out of this dimension

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:12.900 align:middle line:10%
that he connects
to and is having

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:15.900 align:middle line:10%
this beautiful
cosmic consciousness

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:17.780 align:middle line:10%
experience with this being.

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And at the very end of the
night he goes, and by the way,

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.200 align:middle line:90%
could you just--

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:24.060 align:middle line:90%
I have so much hard hearing.

00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:26.100 align:middle line:84%
It's so hard for me
to hear anything.

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:27.760 align:middle line:90%
Can you fix this?

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And just sort of
serendipitously,

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:30.870 align:middle line:90%
and goes to bed.

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:32.880 align:middle line:90%
In the morning, he wakes up.

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.800 align:middle line:84%
His hearing is
completely restored

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:38.490 align:middle line:84%
as if he was a young
person with normal hearing.

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:39.780 align:middle line:10%
Threw away his hearing aids.

00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:43.830 align:middle line:10%
And to this day, he's
completely healed by this ET

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:45.300 align:middle line:10%
that you're seeing
the picture of.

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:48.990 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, he wasn't
trying to make contact

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:52.180 align:middle line:84%
for a selfish reason
like his own hearing.

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:54.760 align:middle line:84%
He was doing it in
a pure-hearted way

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:59.530 align:middle line:84%
to be part of the cosmic family,
and then incidentally asked.

00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:01.990 align:middle line:84%
So the lesson in
this is if you do

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:06.940 align:middle line:84%
CE5 for some self-aggrandizing
purpose only, it won't happen.

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:08.890 align:middle line:84%
If it happens, it'll
happen because you're

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:11.980 align:middle line:84%
in the right heart and mind
space, and then they'll do it.

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:13.305 align:middle line:90%
It's a real lesson.

00:23:13.305 --> 00:23:14.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's beautiful.

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:16.847 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: It seems like they have
like a prime directive of sorts

00:23:16.847 --> 00:23:18.860 align:middle line:84%
where we have to
reach out to them.

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:21.580 align:middle line:84%
They're waiting for us to reach
out through consciousness,

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:22.910 align:middle line:90%
and then they can interact.

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:23.710 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: Yep.

00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:26.050 align:middle line:84%
Together as groups
and in consciousness.

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:28.330 align:middle line:90%
And then anything is possible.

00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:31.180 align:middle line:84%
I will tell you on these
expeditions, 30 years of them,

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:33.160 align:middle line:84%
thousands of events
like this have happened.

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: There was
another encounter

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:36.820 align:middle line:84%
you had at Boca Grande
with another being.

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:40.060 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk us or walk us
through that experience?

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:42.535 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: Yeah, so
we're on the beach.

00:23:42.535 --> 00:23:45.130 align:middle line:84%
It's on the Gulf
Coast, Boca Grande.

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And fairly remote
stretch of beach.

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And we're setting up, and I'm
walking out with some people,

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:54.160 align:middle line:84%
and with someone
who had a camera.

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:57.160 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly on the beach,
I see this energy,

00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:01.120 align:middle line:84%
scintillating energy
manifesting in front of us.

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:02.722 align:middle line:90%
Not very high.

00:24:02.722 --> 00:24:06.700 align:middle line:90%
Maybe a couple feet.

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And so a person with a
camera, I say, be very still

00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:13.570 align:middle line:90%
and take a photograph here.

00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:16.810 align:middle line:10%
And he takes a photograph, and
in the photograph instantly

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:20.530 align:middle line:10%
we see this almost
crystal and light being.

00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:21.490 align:middle line:10%
You zoom in on it.

00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:25.610 align:middle line:10%
You'll see the eyes, almost
like a chakra energy system.

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:28.330 align:middle line:10%
And it looks like
a halo around it.

00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:31.990 align:middle line:10%
That is a toroid, a
donut-shape energy field

00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:36.610 align:middle line:10%
that is holding and manifesting
this transdimensional ET

00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:41.950 align:middle line:10%
being that's from a civilization
about a billion years more

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:44.890 align:middle line:10%
developed than we are, and
are one of the civilizations

00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:47.890 align:middle line:10%
that I call the
guardians of Earth.

00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:50.290 align:middle line:84%
But this was
actually an ET being

00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:52.720 align:middle line:84%
that is from a very
advanced civilization where

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:56.110 align:middle line:84%
everyone on that planet
is in god consciousness.

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And even their
spacecraft when we've

00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:00.640 align:middle line:84%
seen them are
emanating consciousness

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:02.530 align:middle line:90%
at the level of the celestial.

00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And so these kind of
beings are always with us.

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:07.840 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they don't come
on clearly enough where

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:10.390 align:middle line:90%
we can photograph and see them.

00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:13.900 align:middle line:84%
But they're extremely advanced,
and the level of consciousness

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:19.840 align:middle line:84%
is a beautiful level of
enlightened civilizations

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:24.070 align:middle line:84%
that have been around for
quite an ancient time.

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:26.980 align:middle line:90%
Which, again, over history--

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:28.900 align:middle line:84%
and I think a lot
of scripture, people

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:32.500 align:middle line:84%
have had experiences
genuinely with other celestial

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:36.340 align:middle line:84%
or beings from other dimensions
that are higher dimensions.

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:39.070 align:middle line:84%
But if you have an experience
with something like this

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:44.490 align:middle line:84%
and you don't understand ET
technology and transdimensional

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:46.770 align:middle line:84%
physics, you could be
forgiven for thinking

00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:49.840 align:middle line:84%
that this was an angelic
being, or what have you.

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:53.610 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think you photograph
angels very often, frankly.

00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:57.300 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] But my
point is that there's

00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:03.330 align:middle line:84%
an overlap where the more we
know and share and experience,

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:05.400 align:middle line:84%
and also the higher
we go in consciousness

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:08.130 align:middle line:84%
in our experiences,
we'll have discernment.

00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:10.620 align:middle line:84%
Because the discernment of
perceiving a lot of this

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:12.990 align:middle line:84%
is based on the level
of consciousness

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:14.820 align:middle line:90%
of the experiencer.

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:15.990 align:middle line:90%
It's the old Vedic saying.

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:18.170 align:middle line:90%
The world is as you are.

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Right.

00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:19.770 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: Right?

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:20.820 align:middle line:90%
That world is as you are.

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:22.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: As these
contact experiences

00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:25.840 align:middle line:84%
continue, how do you think it's
going to affect consciousness

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:26.640 align:middle line:90%
on this planet?

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:29.760 align:middle line:90%
And also, to what end?

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:33.150 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: Really, I think the
more people come together

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:36.580 align:middle line:84%
in meditative states
and make contact,

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:39.690 align:middle line:84%
it's actually like the whole
concept of morphogenic fields

00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:41.670 align:middle line:90%
and the 100th monkey effect.

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:43.950 align:middle line:84%
It actually is
affecting everyone.

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:45.840 align:middle line:84%
So the beauty of
it is that we all

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:48.510 align:middle line:84%
think we're islands,
doing this on our own.

00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:50.040 align:middle line:84%
It actually is
affecting everyone

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.740 align:middle line:84%
in a very positive
way, but it's also

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:58.020 align:middle line:84%
creating the resonant field
for a future of open contact

00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:02.760 align:middle line:84%
and universal peace and where
humanity will take its place,

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:04.470 align:middle line:84%
and the Earth will
take its place

00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:07.080 align:middle line:90%
amongst the other civilizations.

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And the Earth is a
beautiful planet.

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:10.950 align:middle line:10%
It's a destination
planet, we call it,

00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:13.590 align:middle line:10%
because it's so
beautiful and so diverse,

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:18.180 align:middle line:10%
and it's of great interest to
civilizations in the cosmos.

00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And humanity has
great potential.

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:23.940 align:middle line:84%
So I think the more that
people do this and understand

00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:26.940 align:middle line:84%
that in meditative states
and higher consciousness,

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:29.610 align:middle line:84%
in development of higher states
of consciousness, which we'll

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:33.390 align:middle line:84%
get into in a later episode,
happening while you're

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:36.990 align:middle line:84%
doing contact, it creates
this field effect that's

00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:39.730 align:middle line:84%
affecting your neighbors that
don't know you're doing it.

00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:44.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's that whole 1% effect,
the so-called Maharishi effect.

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:49.830 align:middle line:84%
You put 1% of meditators of the
population who are in the town

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:51.990 align:middle line:90%
meditating, 200,000 people.

00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, you only
need 2,000 people.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.010 align:middle line:84%
And they find crime
rates go down,

00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:59.970 align:middle line:84%
coherence goes up,
ER visits go down.

00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:02.520 align:middle line:84%
So what's fascinating
about that is

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:05.640 align:middle line:84%
that when we're doing the
CE5 contact, it's sort of--

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:09.900 align:middle line:84%
we're pioneering in a resonant
field in consciousness,

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:11.820 align:middle line:90%
potentiating the future.

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:15.000 align:middle line:84%
In my view of it, we're
actually manifesting

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000 align:middle line:84%
a future that already
exists and bringing it

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:24.240 align:middle line:84%
from the empyrean realm of the
ideas and potential into 3D.

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:27.120 align:middle line:10%
So we're actually
manifesting that good future.

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:28.620 align:middle line:10%
And there are other
people who might

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:30.750 align:middle line:10%
want to manifest a
different future that's

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:33.690 align:middle line:10%
not so great with conflict
and war and division.

00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:36.540 align:middle line:84%
But I think the
more people remain

00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:39.000 align:middle line:84%
in a positive state
of manifestation,

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.700 align:middle line:84%
the more we're going to see
our civilization transformed

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:42.687 align:middle line:90%
in that direction.

00:28:42.687 --> 00:28:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's the
real meaning of this.

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:49.140 align:middle line:84%
And my experience with
this over most of my life

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:52.720 align:middle line:84%
is that that's why the
ETs want us to do this.

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.930 align:middle line:84%
They want us to
do it because it's

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:59.130 align:middle line:84%
how we evolved and can
fulfill our destiny

00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:01.650 align:middle line:84%
to become an interstellar
civilization that's

00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:06.240 align:middle line:84%
enlightened in a golden
age of human existence.

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what
this whole next era

00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:10.990 align:middle line:90%
of human evolution is about.

00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:11.790 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Yeah.

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:13.425 align:middle line:84%
I'm really looking
forward to it.

00:29:13.425 --> 00:29:14.550 align:middle line:10%
Well, thank you, Dr. Greer.

00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:15.613 align:middle line:10%
>>GREER: Thank you.

00:29:15.613 --> 00:29:17.280 align:middle line:10%
>>BILLY: I'm Billy
Carson, and thank you

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.260 align:middle line:10%
for watching this
episode of "Disclosure"

00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:20.760 align:middle line:10%
with Dr. Steven Greer.

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:25.010 align:middle line:90%
