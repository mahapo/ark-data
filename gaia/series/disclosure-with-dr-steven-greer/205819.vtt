00:00:18.332 --> 00:00:20.540 align:middle line:10%
>>BILLY CARSON: Welcome to
Disclosure with Dr. Steven

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:21.340 align:middle line:10%
Greer.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.030 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we
discuss the forces

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.190 align:middle line:10%
against contact and disclosure.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:25.990 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Greer, welcome.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.073 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVEN GREER: Thank you.

00:00:27.073 --> 00:00:28.040 align:middle line:90%
Love being with you.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.150 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Absolutely.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.130 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Greer in the
mid to late 1990s,

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.090 align:middle line:84%
you had an experience
at Crestone Mount Shasta

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.200 align:middle line:90%
and Joshua Tree.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.030 align:middle line:84%
Can you expand on
those experiences

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.830 align:middle line:90%
and tell us about them?

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.490 align:middle line:10%
>>GREER: Well, we began doing
more of the CE5 contact work

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.710 align:middle line:10%
and, of course, one
track we're trying

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.910 align:middle line:10%
to resolve the secrecy issues.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.030 align:middle line:84%
The other we keep
the process going,

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.600 align:middle line:84%
where I'm training people
to become ambassadors

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.520 align:middle line:84%
to other planetary systems
and the CE5 contact protocol.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.440 align:middle line:10%
So we began having
amazing contact.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.610 align:middle line:10%
And if you look at the Close
Encounters of the Fifth Kind

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.940 align:middle line:10%
documentary is the tip of
the iceberg of all the things

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:08.990 align:middle line:10%
that happened.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.210 align:middle line:10%
But we started having more
and more direct contact

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.500 align:middle line:10%
with various civilizations up
on Mount Shasta; in Crestone,

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.930 align:middle line:10%
Colorado; in Joshua Tree.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.240 align:middle line:10%
And these were amazing events,
where mass witnessed craft

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.000 align:middle line:10%
would come over, would
be signaling to us,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.040 align:middle line:10%
objects would
partially materialize

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.340 align:middle line:10%
in the field with us, people
would have direct ET contact

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.750 align:middle line:10%
experiences, and on and on.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, as that's going on, over
the course of the same time,

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.460 align:middle line:84%
we're working to try
to resolve this crisis

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.850 align:middle line:84%
inside the government
that's really transnational

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.370 align:middle line:84%
outside the government
in many ways, at least

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:47.990 align:middle line:90%
for most government officials.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And those events began
to be more and more noted

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.020 align:middle line:84%
by the intelligence
community because they're

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.990 align:middle line:84%
monitoring those things
and they certainly

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.770 align:middle line:84%
knew when we would have an
ET object that would appear

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.230 align:middle line:84%
and they don't have
to fly in from space.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.360 align:middle line:84%
They can just
"materialize," quote,

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.800 align:middle line:84%
unquote, in this area of space
where you are, and often even

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.270 align:middle line:90%
come up from underground.

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.790 align:middle line:84%
And we have systems
in space that

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.670 align:middle line:84%
can track objects 25 miles
into the Earth by the way.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.180 align:middle line:84%
So those were being
noted and then often

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.010 align:middle line:84%
were attempts to
interfere with it.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.480 align:middle line:10%
So like at Mount Shasta,
we had an event take place

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.630 align:middle line:10%
where there were
aircraft overhead,

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.410 align:middle line:10%
as soon as we had a contact
event where a massive object

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.240 align:middle line:10%
that was out in space.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.550 align:middle line:10%
It was so large that it
was seen from Vancouver

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.580 align:middle line:10%
all the way to LA that
we had vectored in

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.970 align:middle line:10%
and as it came over,
we signal to it

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.640 align:middle line:10%
and it turned and
signaled to us.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.670 align:middle line:84%
To give an idea how big
it was it way up in space

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.170 align:middle line:84%
but it was 2/3 the size of
the Triangle in Pegasus.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, so large it was
seen up and down the West Coast

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.280 align:middle line:84%
and it came when we were
doing this contact protocol,

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.350 align:middle line:84%
then included a
meditation and prayer

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.780 align:middle line:90%
for the healing of the Earth.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And so we knew it
was the ET saying,

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.430 align:middle line:84%
yes, this is
exactly what we want

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.050 align:middle line:84%
to join you with energetically
and in consciousness.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Right.

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: But then
immediately afterwards, we

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.810 align:middle line:90%
had helicopters over us.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.490 align:middle line:90%
We had jet fighters over us.

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.598 align:middle line:84%
We had all kinds of people
had boots on the ground.

00:03:28.598 --> 00:03:30.140 align:middle line:84%
People that we had
night scopes could

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.410 align:middle line:84%
see coming through
the woods in camo,

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.110 align:middle line:90%
coming off a military vehicle.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.890 align:middle line:84%
So there was all this sort of
cat and mouse game going on

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.100 align:middle line:90%
around that time.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And there were some really
nasty directional energy weapons

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.640 align:middle line:84%
that were pointed at
me and a small team

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.680 align:middle line:84%
that went to White Sands where
we were doing a CE5 contact

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.420 align:middle line:84%
to sort of clear the Akashic
Record, the energy of what

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.410 align:middle line:84%
had happened at the atomic
bomb site near there

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.170 align:middle line:84%
in White Sands Missile
range in New Mexico.

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.840 align:middle line:10%
So these things began
to sort of escalate.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.650 align:middle line:84%
So all of that
contact, as we were

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.400 align:middle line:84%
training more and more
thousands of people

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.290 align:middle line:84%
all over the world
to make contact,

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.050 align:middle line:84%
the intelligence community
was engaging in all kinds

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.490 align:middle line:84%
of counter measures
and especially

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:22.950 align:middle line:84%
with people who were really
starting to dig into this.

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:28.640 align:middle line:84%
I think that it was a
time from 1991 to 1998,

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.670 align:middle line:84%
I had been approached
every year by a man

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.150 align:middle line:90%
if I wanted protection.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.140 align:middle line:90%
And I said no.

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.910 align:middle line:90%
And that was a mistake.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.780 align:middle line:84%
So in '98, we corrected that
after some really tragic events

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.290 align:middle line:84%
happened to my team and that's
been resolved since then.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.420 align:middle line:84%
Since 1998, no one
has been threatened.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.710 align:middle line:90%
No one's been harmed.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.510 align:middle line:84%
But there was a time there
that was very difficult.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And as we were
moving this forward,

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.840 align:middle line:84%
there were some
rather nasty folks

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.650 align:middle line:84%
who have directional energy
weapons and other means

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.870 align:middle line:90%
to induce disease states.

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.570 align:middle line:90%
Now, these are nonlocal.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.240 align:middle line:84%
They're what are called scalar,
faster than the speed of light

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.590 align:middle line:90%
and that can be used to heal.

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.940 align:middle line:90%
They can also be used to harm.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.013 align:middle line:10%
And so pretty much
the same month,

00:05:15.013 --> 00:05:16.430 align:middle line:10%
Congressman Schiff,
who was really

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:22.270 align:middle line:10%
pushing on the Roswell event,
and myself, and Shari Adamiak,

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.980 align:middle line:10%
who helped me at the very
beginning of the CE5 contact

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.380 align:middle line:10%
effort in '91, she got involved.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.790 align:middle line:84%
All got aggressive
metastatic cancers and died.

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:34.590 align:middle line:90%
I didn't die.

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:35.600 align:middle line:90%
I almost did.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.450 align:middle line:84%
I have a big scar
here and there.

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And I had metastatic
malignant melanoma,

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.370 align:middle line:84%
which is the
deadliest of all and I

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.350 align:middle line:90%
was supposed to die first.

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.580 align:middle line:84%
We thought would but it
turned out, Shari passed away.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:54.340 align:middle line:10%
So and then tragically just
before that in the mid '90s,

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.960 align:middle line:10%
the former director of
the CIA, Bill Colby,

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.780 align:middle line:10%
had approached a
member of my board.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.190 align:middle line:10%
And was going to offer one
of these solid-state zero

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.980 align:middle line:10%
point free energy device
and about $50 million

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:13.510 align:middle line:10%
in seed funding to get it out.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't like the
fact that at the time,

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.820 align:middle line:84%
I was told it was a senior
intelligence official.

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.760 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know, it was Mr
Colby, the CIA director

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.050 align:middle line:90%
Colby who was retired.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.520 align:middle line:90%
He was getting up in years.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.260 align:middle line:90%
He was fed up with the secrecy.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.800 align:middle line:84%
He was sickened by what was
happening to the planet.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.460 align:middle line:84%
But I thought it should have
been a very public event

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.980 align:middle line:84%
because if it's done in the
public, as I said early on,

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.027 align:middle line:84%
I was told by a early
intelligence guy

00:06:39.027 --> 00:06:40.610 align:middle line:84%
get on Larry King,
get on these shows,

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:41.860 align:middle line:90%
or you're a dead man walking.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:42.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm quoting.

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.610 align:middle line:10%
So I didn't like the way it
was this sort of skullduggery

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.020 align:middle line:10%
but that's the way
he wanted to do it.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:53.140 align:middle line:10%
So the week, he was supposed to
meet with a member of my board.

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:54.460 align:middle line:90%
That meeting never happened.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:59.440 align:middle line:84%
They found him floating South
of DC in the Potomac River.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.440 align:middle line:10%
And his close friend
who set it up,

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.110 align:middle line:10%
told me, yes, that
was a wet works.

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.330 align:middle line:10%
Now his son thought
he commited suicide.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.670 align:middle line:10%
Other people said it
was a boating accident.

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:13.030 align:middle line:10%
You know, it was a
death defying period

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:19.060 align:middle line:10%
and it taught me that if someone
offers you help, you take it,

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:21.250 align:middle line:10%
even if it seems unsavory.

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:24.070 align:middle line:84%
So what was put in
place at that time,

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:27.700 align:middle line:84%
after this, the person who
came to me every year offering,

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.040 align:middle line:84%
he called it
executive protection.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.670 align:middle line:84%
So we have had no problem
since then, since 1998.

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:37.090 align:middle line:84%
We had to also
change directions.

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:39.430 align:middle line:84%
We were trying to do
this through the White

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:40.960 align:middle line:90%
House and the Congress.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.050 align:middle line:84%
I concluded those people were
never going to do this properly

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:47.410 align:middle line:84%
and that was the inception of
the public Disclosure Project

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:49.660 align:middle line:90%
that people know about.

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:56.620 align:middle line:84%
But in the event, the night
that Shari Adamiak passed away,

00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:01.240 align:middle line:84%
she introduced me to
this ET named Kindness.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.940 align:middle line:84%
And Kindness-- I
call her Kindness--

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:08.050 align:middle line:84%
perfectly round head,
not like our shape

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:12.340 align:middle line:84%
and no pinna, no outside
ears, very fine featured,

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:17.530 align:middle line:84%
beautiful eyes, and she was
introduced to me by Shari

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:19.300 align:middle line:84%
from the spirit
world and this was

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.880 align:middle line:84%
an ET that could go, of
course, transdimensional--

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:22.690 align:middle line:90%
3D.

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:24.910 align:middle line:84%
Or when they're
transdimensional,

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:27.790 align:middle line:84%
they're very close to
the astral spirit world.

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:33.610 align:middle line:84%
That ET and her craft has
appeared at every single CE5

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:35.239 align:middle line:90%
contact event since 1998.

00:08:35.239 --> 00:08:36.039 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Wow.

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:36.909 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: Without exception.

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:37.450 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Incredible.

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:38.250 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: Yeah.

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:39.330 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:40.770 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: So what
is the connection

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:43.230 align:middle line:90%
between Kindness and your team?

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:46.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: She is a senior
interstellar diplomat.

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:49.980 align:middle line:84%
In those civilizations,
it's your intelligence,

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:53.490 align:middle line:84%
and your spiritual
development, and your empathy,

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:57.990 align:middle line:84%
and all those, so when you talk
about interstellar diplomats

00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:01.980 align:middle line:84%
and people who contact humans
from other star systems that

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:02.820 align:middle line:90%
is the criterion.

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:04.920 align:middle line:84%
And she's a very
senior one in this sort

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.230 align:middle line:90%
of interplanetary coalition.

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:09.720 align:middle line:84%
I never got her proper
name because to me,

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:14.610 align:middle line:84%
she was like an avatar, a
perfect kindliness, so kind.

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:17.250 align:middle line:90%
And so I just call her Kindness.

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:20.620 align:middle line:84%
We have a great many videos
and pictures of the craft.

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:23.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: The craft is Kindness
or Kindness in the craft?

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:23.790 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: In the craft.

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:24.210 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: In the craft.

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:25.010 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: Yeah.

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:29.850 align:middle line:84%
But the craft is conscious
with the awareness of pilot.

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:30.650 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Its pilot.

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:30.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:32.358 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: We'll get
into that later.

00:09:32.358 --> 00:09:34.650 align:middle line:84%
The integration of
these technologies

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:36.442 align:middle line:90%
with consciousness and thought.

00:09:36.442 --> 00:09:37.900 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: So Dr
Greer, you mentioned

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:41.140 align:middle line:84%
the Disclosure Project earlier
and the things that led up

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:43.060 align:middle line:84%
to it almost coming
into fruition

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.730 align:middle line:84%
and then all of
a sudden in 2001,

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:47.875 align:middle line:84%
you put out the Disclosure
Project but something

00:09:47.875 --> 00:09:49.000 align:middle line:90%
happened during that event.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.200 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell us what it was?

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.000 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: Yes.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.460 align:middle line:84%
So interestingly, the
public doesn't know this.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:58.840 align:middle line:10%
The entire event was jammed
for the first hour trying

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:02.110 align:middle line:10%
to get out of the
National Press Club event,

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:05.650 align:middle line:10%
I'm sure by operatives
within these use apps.

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:08.260 align:middle line:10%
And as I mentioned, our
people had seen them

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.050 align:middle line:10%
on the roofs the night
before in the wee hours.

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:17.560 align:middle line:10%
And we also had a great deal
of interest in the major media,

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:20.170 align:middle line:10%
I mean but I found out
that the intelligence

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:22.810 align:middle line:10%
community contacted all
the major networks and says

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:25.310 align:middle line:10%
don't play this again,
take this down, et cetera,

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:29.530 align:middle line:10%
and so on, which is why I
was up on CNN, and headline

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:33.010 align:middle line:10%
news, and various
things, and then dropped.

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And I got very
detailed information

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:39.130 align:middle line:84%
on why that was torpedoed
because it wasn't just,

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:41.737 align:middle line:84%
oh, there's a UAP, we
don't know where they are,

00:10:41.737 --> 00:10:43.570 align:middle line:84%
where they're coming
from, or what they are.

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:45.460 align:middle line:84%
It was very detailed
information.

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:48.310 align:middle line:84%
You know, people who had been
involved with the ET bodies,

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:50.350 align:middle line:84%
on reverse engineering,
and all kinds

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:53.830 align:middle line:84%
of very specific
information, all of which

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:56.450 align:middle line:84%
were credentialed people who
had had top secret clearances,--

00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:57.250 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Yeah.

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:58.610 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: --et cetera, and so on.

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:02.020 align:middle line:84%
So in the way, it was
a transition phase

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:07.660 align:middle line:84%
from the us deciding
in '98, that late '97,

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:11.980 align:middle line:84%
'98, when I was
battling for my life,

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:18.250 align:middle line:84%
Shari was, that we need to
take this to the people now.

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:19.690 align:middle line:90%
Here's why.

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:23.590 align:middle line:84%
I needed from '91
or '92 until '98

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:27.250 align:middle line:84%
to establish the
criminal illegal nature

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:28.690 align:middle line:90%
of these projects.

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:31.420 align:middle line:90%
And this is an important step.

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:34.120 align:middle line:84%
We've created something
called an unless otherwise

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:39.970 align:middle line:84%
directed memo and that's a
military, my military advisor

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:45.070 align:middle line:84%
said, look, you know, you
have to do something formally,

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:47.860 align:middle line:84%
where you notify the heads of
all the agencies and government

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:50.770 align:middle line:84%
departments that you're
going to go forward

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:53.440 align:middle line:90%
based on an assessment.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And that unless
otherwise directed,

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:57.280 align:middle line:90%
my assessment is correct.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.390 align:middle line:90%
That's what a UNOD letter is.

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:01.660 align:middle line:90%
It's a very specific tactic.

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:06.130 align:middle line:84%
And so we created this and
we have it on our website

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:09.040 align:middle line:84%
and it went to the heads
of all the agencies,

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.870 align:middle line:90%
return receipt requested.

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:12.060 align:middle line:90%
We have a record of it.

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And in this letter, it
says here's our assessment.

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:18.370 align:middle line:84%
I brief the following officials
that we've talked about

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:21.070 align:middle line:84%
and members of Congress
and senior people

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:22.210 align:middle line:90%
around the president.

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And they have been denied
access to these projects.

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:28.120 align:middle line:84%
Therefore those
projects are illegal.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.720 align:middle line:90%
They're unconstitutional.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:33.190 align:middle line:84%
And the National Security Oath
and non-disclosure agreements

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:36.430 align:middle line:84%
that all personnel have
signed are null and void.

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:37.420 align:middle line:90%
We're vitiating them.

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:40.330 align:middle line:90%
We're vacating them.

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And unless otherwise directed,
by the end of January 1998,

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:47.890 align:middle line:84%
we're going to move forward with
top secret documents that are

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:52.300 align:middle line:84%
not declassified, top secret
witnesses who did sign

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:56.770 align:middle line:84%
nondisclosure agreements and
exonerate them and they cannot

00:12:56.770 --> 00:13:00.310 align:middle line:84%
be prosecuted under any of
the laws of the United States

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:03.460 align:middle line:84%
because the projects
are illegal.

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:07.340 align:middle line:84%
And an illegal project cannot
use the law to defend itself.

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:10.330 align:middle line:84%
Now to this date as of
the sitting right here,

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:14.020 align:middle line:84%
no one from the government
even an unacknowledged special

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:17.048 align:middle line:84%
access project has said, you're
wrong because if they said

00:13:17.048 --> 00:13:18.340 align:middle line:90%
I was wrong, I'll say prove it.

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:18.670 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Yeah.

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:20.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: I can take
this into court

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:21.880 align:middle line:84%
with our constitutional
attorneys

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.170 align:middle line:90%
and prove the opposite.

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:25.450 align:middle line:84%
That, in fact, these
are illegal, rogue,

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:26.840 align:middle line:90%
unconstitutional projects.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:27.640 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Right.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.245 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: So at that point,
we want to give them

00:13:30.245 --> 00:13:31.120 align:middle line:90%
a little bit of time.

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:36.040 align:middle line:84%
Then we organized the
2001 National Press Club

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:39.427 align:middle line:84%
event and that was
a big undertaking--

00:13:39.427 --> 00:13:41.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: Even though
disclosures like a drip

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.220 align:middle line:84%
by drip type of
disclosure so far

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.220 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of the people
that have been involved,

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:48.460 align:middle line:84%
including yourself
may not be able to see

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:49.487 align:middle line:90%
the fruit of the labor.

00:13:49.487 --> 00:13:51.070 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like
we're planting seeds

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:52.120 align:middle line:84%
for trees that
are going to grow,

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.150 align:middle line:84%
we'll never sit-in the
shade of these trees.

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:55.140 align:middle line:90%
So how do you feel about that?

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:56.350 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
is going to happen

00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:57.910 align:middle line:84%
and how many people
do you think are

00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:01.190 align:middle line:84%
going to be able to see
this come to fruition?

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:03.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: Well, actually
the false disclosure

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:04.960 align:middle line:90%
is happening right now.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.940 align:middle line:84%
The actual disclosure,
we did already.

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:11.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, here, we have
hundreds of hours of videotape

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:12.130 align:middle line:90%
on my YouTube channel.

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:14.740 align:middle line:90%
There's 70 top secret witnesses.

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:17.530 align:middle line:84%
The books Unacknowledged
and Disclosure.

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:20.170 align:middle line:10%
I have all the
transcripts and documents.

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:21.970 align:middle line:90%
Basically, that's been done.

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:25.600 align:middle line:84%
What people confuse
is that they think

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.880 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be done
by the president.

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, most of the
presidents, even if they

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:34.030 align:middle line:84%
want to do this are
pretty much encouraged,

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:36.130 align:middle line:90%
and that's a mild word, not to.

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:39.850 align:middle line:90%
So,-- and threatened.

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:44.440 align:middle line:10%
But most people know, you know,
it was like Carol Rosin saw

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:49.220 align:middle line:10%
in the 1970s, when she was
in Fairchild Industries,

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:52.060 align:middle line:10%
the first women
executives in aerospace.

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:57.100 align:middle line:84%
A plan she went into an office
meeting and there was a plan

00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:00.460 align:middle line:84%
from going all the way forward
through now of all these

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.710 align:middle line:84%
countries we were going to
invade and attack and there

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:05.680 align:middle line:84%
were names on there, like she
didn't know Yemen and Iraq

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:08.390 align:middle line:84%
and they weren't even on the
radar and in the mid '70s--

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:09.190 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Right.

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:10.330 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: --of anybody.

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:12.430 align:middle line:10%
And so this long
term strategic plan

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:16.330 align:middle line:10%
was mapped out back in
the '50s, '60s, '70s,

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:19.780 align:middle line:10%
and that includes staging
and this sort of threat

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:21.910 align:middle line:10%
from outer space that
Wernher von Braun, who

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:23.860 align:middle line:10%
invented the rocket
for Adolf Hitler

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:25.440 align:middle line:10%
warned about on his deathbed.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:29.150 align:middle line:10%
That was a deathbed
warning from this guy.

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:32.230 align:middle line:10%
And I think that many of the
people involved in that project

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:35.260 align:middle line:10%
knows that it's a
multigenerational long term

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:39.280 align:middle line:10%
project to try to
create a world,

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.600 align:middle line:10%
let's call it a unified
world but in the wrong way,

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.400 align:middle line:10%
in my opinion.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.200 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Yeah.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:45.730 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: They want to unify
the world in war and division,

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:48.190 align:middle line:84%
instead of in peace
and universal peace.

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:51.590 align:middle line:84%
I think is 180 degrees opposite
of where we should be going.

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:54.130 align:middle line:84%
So, but that's been
a very long term

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:57.310 align:middle line:84%
project of people who want
to keep endless wars going,

00:15:57.310 --> 00:16:00.430 align:middle line:84%
military industrial
spending, all this stuff,

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:02.800 align:middle line:84%
and the way they control
the public is through fear.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.470 align:middle line:84%
But remember, that's a long
term effort because you

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:06.920 align:middle line:90%
can't do that all at once.

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:07.720 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Yeah.

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:12.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: It's like the Nazis,
it was years and years of blood

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:16.780 align:middle line:84%
libel and the Elders of Zion,
and all kinds of caricatures

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:21.370 align:middle line:84%
of Jewish people and what
have you, to do what they did.

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:25.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, basically this is a much
more expanded global version

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:27.710 align:middle line:90%
of that kind of thinking.

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And so there's been this
long term acculturation

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:33.280 align:middle line:90%
and disinformation project.

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.500 align:middle line:84%
So the '50s, '60s, '70s,
'80s, up through now,

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:38.170 align:middle line:84%
that's when they started
seeding this subject

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:43.720 align:middle line:84%
with all kinds of frightening
caricatures of aliens.

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:47.290 align:middle line:84%
They launched what I call
ekso exoracism, where there's

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:50.920 align:middle line:84%
the good ETs, of course,
look like someone from Norway

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:53.060 align:middle line:84%
and the bad ones look
different from us.

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:57.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is prima
facie blatant racism.

00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:00.190 align:middle line:84%
But the New Age
UFO community just

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:01.630 align:middle line:84%
laps this up,
thinking, oh, great

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:06.040 align:middle line:84%
because they don't realize that
within us is this tribal nature

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:08.290 align:middle line:84%
to be afraid of
other and that's what

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:11.230 align:middle line:84%
we have to go into higher
consciousness to transcend

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:13.869 align:middle line:84%
or we'll never make peace
on this planet or in space.

00:17:13.869 --> 00:17:17.829 align:middle line:84%
The big challenge of our
time is going into not just

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:22.450 align:middle line:84%
human oneness but universal
consciousness and oneness

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:24.609 align:middle line:84%
because if you just
unite the world

00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:27.040 align:middle line:84%
and we're all working
together as a planet

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.800 align:middle line:84%
but we're fighting another
planetary civilization,

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.390 align:middle line:90%
this is not going forward.

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:33.640 align:middle line:84%
This is absolutely
going way back

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:35.890 align:middle line:90%
to a time of utter destruction.

00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:39.280 align:middle line:84%
So that's the agenda long term
of the intelligence community--

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.560 align:middle line:84%
keep the technology
secret, except the things

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:45.340 align:middle line:84%
we can monetize like
digital, OK, chips and fiber

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:46.390 align:middle line:90%
optics and stuff.

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And let's get the
people on board

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.670 align:middle line:84%
with this agenda of a
threat from outer space.

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:56.020 align:middle line:84%
It's the biggest
hoax ever committed

00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:58.780 align:middle line:84%
in the known
history of humanity.

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:00.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: So Dr Greer,
in the same way

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:03.730 align:middle line:84%
that there's a lot of
disinformation in the media

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:05.680 align:middle line:84%
and spinning this
in a negative way

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.750 align:middle line:84%
are there not any powerful
people in the world

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:10.330 align:middle line:84%
trying to go with the
positive and true and correct

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:11.290 align:middle line:90%
information?

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:12.090 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: No.

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:14.230 align:middle line:84%
Because the ones who
would have that view

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:16.540 align:middle line:90%
are not cleared to access.

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:19.720 align:middle line:84%
This gets-- and this is
the sine qua non of access.

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:21.550 align:middle line:10%
When I was briefing
Lord Hill-Norton, who

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:24.130 align:middle line:10%
was a five star
Admiral Sea Lord,

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:25.570 align:middle line:10%
had been Head of
Ministry, Defense

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:28.030 align:middle line:10%
Head in the United Kingdom,
and on the Head of the Military

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:32.350 align:middle line:10%
Committee for NATO, and he
got very interested in this.

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:35.170 align:middle line:84%
He made speeches on the
floor of the House of Lords

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:37.120 align:middle line:84%
and what have you in
the United Kingdom

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.640 align:middle line:90%
about this issue and UFOs.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.650 align:middle line:90%
But he never had access.

00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:44.350 align:middle line:84%
So I went to his
home in Hampshire

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:47.690 align:middle line:84%
and he wanted me to bring the
presidential briefing packet.

00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:49.930 align:middle line:84%
So I did and he
says, I want to know,

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:52.390 align:middle line:84%
why I was never told this,
the whole time I was head

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:56.570 align:middle line:84%
of the Ministry of Defense
of one of the Five Eyes,

00:18:56.570 --> 00:19:00.160 align:middle line:84%
on the big intelligence
gathering countries, United

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.870 align:middle line:84%
Kingdom and also
at NATO and I said,

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:06.530 align:middle line:84%
well let me answer your
question with a question.

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:09.017 align:middle line:84%
What would you
have done Admiral?

00:19:09.017 --> 00:19:10.600 align:middle line:10%
If you had found out
there was a group

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.300 align:middle line:10%
of people running
illegally that had

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:15.580 align:middle line:10%
the solutions to the world's
environmental problems

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:19.300 align:middle line:10%
and poverty problems, who have
been creating endless conflict

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:20.950 align:middle line:10%
and war and are
planning to create

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:24.460 align:middle line:10%
an interplanetary
scenario of conflict

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:27.760 align:middle line:10%
and that they have engaged
in murder, mayhem, theft;

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:29.590 align:middle line:10%
all manner of
criminal activities

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:33.685 align:middle line:10%
up to and including
drug running and stuff.

00:19:33.685 --> 00:19:36.060 align:middle line:84%
He says, I wouldn't have stood
for it for a bloody minute

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:37.352 align:middle line:90%
and he was in a lather over it.

00:19:37.352 --> 00:19:38.152 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Right.

00:19:38.152 --> 00:19:40.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: I said that's
why they didn't tell you.

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:41.910 align:middle line:90%
I said they do a soul biopsy.

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:42.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm a doctor.

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:44.180 align:middle line:90%
I've got-- a soul biopsy.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:46.290 align:middle line:84%
They do an assessment
of your psychology.

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:49.580 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not willing to
go along with that agenda,

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:53.810 align:middle line:84%
you're going to at the most get
a few crumbs of information.

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:55.868 align:middle line:84%
You're not going
to get full access

00:19:55.868 --> 00:19:57.410 align:middle line:84%
and you're certainly
not going to get

00:19:57.410 --> 00:20:00.020 align:middle line:90%
any control over the project.

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:02.780 align:middle line:90%
So that's the catch-22 of this.

00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:05.990 align:middle line:84%
The folks who are good folks
in government and operations

00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:08.555 align:middle line:84%
rarely have any real
knowledge or access

00:20:08.555 --> 00:20:10.430 align:middle line:84%
or they have a little
snippet here and there.

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:11.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: But not
enough to do anything.

00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:13.348 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: But not enough
to do anything and they

00:20:13.348 --> 00:20:14.870 align:middle line:84%
in particular, even
if they're read

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:17.940 align:middle line:84%
into it, a president that's
read into it in some detail.

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:18.740 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Yeah.

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:21.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: If they were to
try to intervene and change

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:24.410 align:middle line:84%
the direction of those
projects, they would basically

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:25.400 align:middle line:90%
be told get lost.

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.620 align:middle line:10%
We're not taking an
order from you and this

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:30.320 align:middle line:10%
you know, I mean go back to
the testimony of our disclosure

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:33.680 align:middle line:10%
witnesses and also
Daniel Sheehan,

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:36.680 align:middle line:10%
who after Carter was elected.

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.870 align:middle line:10%
President Carter,
he ran on a platform

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:41.540 align:middle line:10%
to disclose this
information in '76.

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:45.350 align:middle line:10%
You know, now that's what,
you know, like 45 years ago.

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:49.460 align:middle line:10%
And the outgoing CIA Director
was George H. W. Bush.

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:52.190 align:middle line:10%
And when President Carter
asked about this issue,

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:55.040 align:middle line:10%
President Bush said, we're not
going to tell you anything.

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:56.550 align:middle line:10%
You don't have a need to know.

00:20:56.550 --> 00:21:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And so Carter had to turn to
the Congressional Research

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:03.260 align:middle line:84%
Service and other people to try
to put some information for him

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:07.280 align:middle line:84%
and some of those people
approached Daniel Sheehan,

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.020 align:middle line:90%
the attorney to look into it.

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And he got some
information but Carter

00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:15.680 align:middle line:84%
was never allowed to
control this issue.

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:18.200 align:middle line:84%
But to my knowledge,
no other president had.

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:22.350 align:middle line:10%
Now, President Reagan was given
a little more information.

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:26.120 align:middle line:10%
But Colonel Holman, who was
on the interagency committee

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:28.520 align:middle line:10%
trying to sell Star Wars SDI--

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.950 align:middle line:10%
Strategic Defense Initiative--
to President Reagan

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:35.750 align:middle line:10%
told me personally before he
died that they would go in.

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:37.760 align:middle line:84%
They tried to sell
this to Carter

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:41.300 align:middle line:84%
and he went by, because
Carter's a very smart guy.

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:46.700 align:middle line:84%
Reagan kind of got manipulated
and they went into the Reagan

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:49.340 align:middle line:84%
White House and said,
look, we have this threat

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:51.200 align:middle line:90%
from outer space.

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.480 align:middle line:84%
Let's use the Cold
War as the reason

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:56.990 align:middle line:84%
we need these weapons
in space but it's really

00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:58.940 align:middle line:90%
so we can fight the aliens.

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:02.600 align:middle line:84%
And Reagan took it
hook, line, and sinker,

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:05.420 align:middle line:84%
which is why you see these
speeches like at the UN, that's

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:07.100 align:middle line:90%
in our documentary.

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:11.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Perhaps we need some outside
universal threat to make us

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:14.240 align:middle line:90%
recognize this common bond.

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:19.400 align:middle line:10%
I occasionally think how quickly
our differences worldwide

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:23.210 align:middle line:10%
would vanish, if we were
facing an alien threat

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:25.390 align:middle line:10%
from outside this world.

00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:26.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: Well, why
do humans always

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:28.910 align:middle line:90%
have to be at war to unite?

00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:30.620 align:middle line:90%
We can unite in peace and love.

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:31.420 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Right.

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:34.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: And you know,
someone recently told me,

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:36.930 align:middle line:84%
who's associated with the
intelligence community.

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:39.560 align:middle line:84%
He said yes, we all
know that there's

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:41.270 align:middle line:90%
no threat from the aliens.

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:42.830 align:middle line:90%
This guy said this flat out.

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:46.920 align:middle line:84%
You can't get any money for
butterflies and dandelions.

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.700 align:middle line:84%
I said, what do you mean
butterflies and dandelions?

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And he was referring
to the fact--

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:55.310 align:middle line:84%
peaceful contact, world peace,
all these beautiful things.

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:57.050 align:middle line:90%
You can't get defense money.

00:22:57.050 --> 00:22:59.930 align:middle line:84%
You can't get contractor money
and that's what this is about.

00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:01.970 align:middle line:84%
You have to scare the
hell out of people.

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:03.080 align:middle line:90%
You have to scare people.

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:05.420 align:middle line:84%
And then the government
will authorize more money.

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:06.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what they
did to Ronald Reagan.

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:07.750 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Yeah.

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:10.730 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: So we're trying
to correct that dynamic.

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:12.380 align:middle line:90%
Obviously, we're the underdog.

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:16.193 align:middle line:90%
But it's a fight worth fighting.

00:23:16.193 --> 00:23:18.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: It seems like
the only president that

00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:21.840 align:middle line:84%
may have had any insight would
have been Bush Senior, I mean,

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:22.640 align:middle line:90%
that he was in CIA.

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:23.440 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: Yes.

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:24.320 align:middle line:90%
George HW Bush.

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:26.840 align:middle line:10%
He was on the
committee, actually

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:28.940 align:middle line:10%
Dick Cheney was
on this committee.

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:31.490 align:middle line:10%
Senator John Warner
in the Senate

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:33.680 align:middle line:10%
was a minor, had a
little sliver of it,

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:37.250 align:middle line:10%
his son has recently told us
in a three hour interview.

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:42.230 align:middle line:10%
And you know, Senator Cranston
was very heavily involved,

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:43.640 align:middle line:10%
the old Senator Cranston.

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:46.250 align:middle line:84%
I know who a lot
of the people are.

00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:52.020 align:middle line:84%
So and again it has nothing
to do with their position

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:54.300 align:middle line:84%
but they've been brought
up often through the system

00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:58.080 align:middle line:84%
and then placed here,
there, and everywhere.

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And then they will lie
to their colleagues.

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:02.970 align:middle line:84%
One of the ways this
works, just to give you

00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:05.670 align:middle line:84%
a little more detail is that
if you have a Senator that

00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:09.330 align:middle line:84%
is involved, one of his jobs
is to turn to his brethren

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:11.880 align:middle line:84%
in the Senate, it's
a club of 100 people

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:14.130 align:middle line:90%
and say, oh, this isn't true.

00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:15.750 align:middle line:84%
If it were true,
I'd know about it.

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:17.500 align:middle line:84%
And oh, OK, because
they trust each other.

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.710 align:middle line:84%
It's like doctor to
doctor, lawyer to lawyer,

00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:21.390 align:middle line:90%
there's a certain peerage.

00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:23.880 align:middle line:84%
And so that's also how
these organizations work.

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:27.030 align:middle line:84%
People have these sweeping
conspiracy theories.

00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:29.025 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you another
great example,

00:24:29.025 --> 00:24:30.780 align:middle line:84%
right after the
Disclosure Project.

00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:34.260 align:middle line:84%
I was in San Francisco,
doing an event,

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:37.710 align:middle line:84%
and there was the Bohemian Grove
up in Northern California was

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:40.140 align:middle line:84%
having a meeting,
that was called

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:43.170 align:middle line:84%
and a man who came
to the meeting I held

00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:45.780 align:middle line:84%
had been at the
Bohemian Grove meeting.

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:49.980 align:middle line:10%
And he was a very well-off
European financier and what

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:50.795 align:middle line:10%
have you--

00:24:50.795 --> 00:24:52.170 align:middle line:10%
and he said, you
know, this issue

00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:54.270 align:middle line:10%
came up at the Bohemian Grove.

00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And someone got up in front
of the whole crowd of all

00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:59.880 align:middle line:84%
these elites and said, I've
been with the government

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:01.140 align:middle line:90%
for decades.

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:02.670 align:middle line:90%
None of this is true.

00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And if it were true,
I would know about it.

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:06.360 align:middle line:90%
You can trust me.

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:09.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm one of your fellow
Bohemian Grove people

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.920 align:middle line:84%
and just trust me that this
is all just made up nonsense

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.510 align:middle line:90%
that Dr Greer is saying.

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:17.010 align:middle line:90%
And it worked for most of them.

00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:19.620 align:middle line:84%
But this guy came to my
meeting and said, you know,

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:21.990 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't square with
what I see that you put out

00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:24.720 align:middle line:84%
there's too much, too
many corroborating

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.550 align:middle line:84%
top secret witnesses
and documents.

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:30.120 align:middle line:84%
I said yes, I mean those people
are placed in your organization

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:32.520 align:middle line:90%
to deceive the rest of you.

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And so that's true of
all these organizations.

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:36.540 align:middle line:84%
People talk about the
Bilderbergers and--

00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:40.140 align:middle line:84%
Even in those groups, 90%
of the people involved

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:42.420 align:middle line:84%
would have no
clearance into this

00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:45.713 align:middle line:84%
and the few that do or embedded
to lie to their brethen.

00:25:45.713 --> 00:25:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: They've
been infiltrated.

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:47.850 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: Yes.

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:49.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: Their own secret
society has been infiltrated.

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:50.440 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: Yes.

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:51.390 align:middle line:90%
Very, very effective.

00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:51.930 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Yes.

00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:52.763 align:middle line:90%
Well that's amazing.

00:25:52.763 --> 00:25:52.860 align:middle line:90%


00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:53.100 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: Yup.

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:54.725 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: Wow, that's
very enlightening.

00:25:54.725 --> 00:25:57.510 align:middle line:10%
So Dr Greer you had expressed
earlier in the interview

00:25:57.510 --> 00:26:01.690 align:middle line:10%
that at one point it seemed like
your team was being attacked.

00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:04.080 align:middle line:84%
and then afterwards,
you had taken

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.460 align:middle line:90%
a little bit of outside help.

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:06.360 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: Mm-hmm.

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:09.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: And so now, after
all this has happened,

00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:12.090 align:middle line:84%
do you think that you're being
assisted by some outside forces

00:26:12.090 --> 00:26:13.770 align:middle line:84%
or was there any other
assistance that you're still

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:14.700 align:middle line:90%
getting at this time?

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:20.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: Well, certainly there
are multiple layers of support.

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:24.030 align:middle line:84%
There are people who are in
these classified projects, who

00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:27.810 align:middle line:84%
very much are appalled,
like Bill Colby was

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:29.610 align:middle line:90%
at what's going on.

00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:31.860 align:middle line:90%
He was supportive.

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:35.790 align:middle line:84%
There are people who aren't in
those unacknowledged projects

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:41.040 align:middle line:84%
who are in senior positions
in government and other places

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:43.450 align:middle line:90%
who are also very supportive.

00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:45.630 align:middle line:84%
The extraterrestrial
civilizations

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:46.530 align:middle line:90%
are very supportive.

00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:48.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm certain of that.

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And we have the
support of the public.

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the
level that, you know,

00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:56.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a religious person.

00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:58.140 align:middle line:84%
But I'm very
spiritually oriented

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:02.730 align:middle line:84%
and I know that
there are celestial

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:09.150 align:middle line:84%
and beings from other higher
dimensions that are very, very

00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:11.610 align:middle line:90%
protective and supportive.

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:14.850 align:middle line:84%
With all that, I've
never done this thinking

00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:16.620 align:middle line:84%
that I could get
out of it alive.

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:20.560 align:middle line:84%
I've always assumed that there's
a very good chance, I won't.

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:22.350 align:middle line:10%
And the main way
that they've been

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:24.330 align:middle line:10%
able to contain
what we're doing is

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:27.810 align:middle line:10%
through defamation of
character, marginalization,

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:31.500 align:middle line:10%
endless public attacks,
and also blacklisting.

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:33.390 align:middle line:10%
So you know, I've
been blacklisted

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:35.370 align:middle line:10%
from a lot of the
major media because I

00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:37.440 align:middle line:10%
won't stick to the
script of we don't

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:40.742 align:middle line:10%
know what these things are and
those are people who do that.

00:27:40.742 --> 00:27:41.700 align:middle line:90%
I don't want any names.

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:44.070 align:middle line:84%
But if you see them
on the news, those

00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:46.410 align:middle line:84%
are people that they will
allow to speak because they're

00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:49.920 align:middle line:84%
basically telling half truths
that are worse than a lie.

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:52.530 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's the
most effective way.

00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:56.610 align:middle line:84%
They realized they couldn't do
it tactically or they just flat

00:27:56.610 --> 00:27:58.038 align:middle line:90%
out kill us.

00:27:58.038 --> 00:27:59.580 align:middle line:84%
But if they can do
it this other way,

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:01.330 align:middle line:84%
it's quite effective
in many ways.

00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:02.700 align:middle line:90%
So it's frustrating.

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:05.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's this
iterative long term.

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:07.240 align:middle line:84%
It's an ultra marathon
that we're doing.

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:08.040 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Yeah.

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:09.150 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: So--

00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:11.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: Dr Greer, thank
you for this interview.

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:12.040 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: Thank you.

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:13.165 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: I am Billy Carson.

00:28:13.165 --> 00:28:15.390 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for watching
Disclosure with Dr Steven

00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:16.190 align:middle line:90%
Greer.

00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:18.440 align:middle line:90%
