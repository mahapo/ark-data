00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to "Disclosure
with Dr. Steven Greer."

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.510 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we
explore disinformation,

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.340 align:middle line:90%
and the disclosure agendas.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.160 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Dr. Greer.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.130 align:middle line:90%
Great to be here with you.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.750 align:middle line:90%
Very important topic today.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:30.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.500 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Greer, since 2017, there's
been a lot of mainstream media

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.960 align:middle line:90%
coverage about the UAPs.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.352 align:middle line:84%
Can you lead us
into that, and what

00:00:38.352 --> 00:00:39.560 align:middle line:90%
you're exactly trying to say?

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.010 align:middle line:84%
And how come they're
trying to really put it off

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.940 align:middle line:90%
to the general public.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.550 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, what's actually
happening is that when

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.760 align:middle line:10%
"Unacknowledged--" our film--

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.050 align:middle line:10%
reached over 650 million
people who had seen it,

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.540 align:middle line:10%
there was a counterintelligence
operation that

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.940 align:middle line:10%
released the Tic Tac footage.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.620 align:middle line:10%
Now, that footage-- they
authorized a controlled leak.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.090 align:middle line:10%
It was not a leak.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:06.140 align:middle line:10%
It was deliberate.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.250 align:middle line:10%
This was a trial balloon.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.840 align:middle line:10%
It's what you do in Washington.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.520 align:middle line:10%
And that, of course,
they were ordered

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.110 align:middle line:10%
to cover on the
mainstream media.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.930 align:middle line:10%
Remember what Attorney
Daniel Sheehan

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.090 align:middle line:10%
said-- that the only
time you get coverage

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.610 align:middle line:10%
on something like this
is when it's authorized

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.160 align:middle line:10%
by the CIA and people
in the intelligence

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.540 align:middle line:10%
community-- in the mainstream
media, not the fringe media.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.690 align:middle line:10%
So once that went
mainstream, we knew

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:35.100 align:middle line:10%
that they had pulled the trigger
on the false flag disclosure.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.480 align:middle line:84%
So the result of it was, of
course, mainstream media all

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.860 align:middle line:90%
over the world covering this.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.080 align:middle line:10%
Now, everyone I know,
and the people on my team

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.360 align:middle line:10%
who work for the
Lockheed Skunk Works

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.070 align:middle line:10%
and are in the
aerospace industry,

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.080 align:middle line:10%
immediately knew that
those Tic Tac objects

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.210 align:middle line:10%
were ours made by Lockheed Skunk
Works, classified anti-gravity.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.760 align:middle line:10%
Now, the dog and pony show
in the mainstream media

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.473 align:middle line:10%
is to say, gee, we don't
know what these are.

00:01:58.473 --> 00:02:00.140 align:middle line:84%
We're going to call
them something new--

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.280 align:middle line:84%
UAPs-- and have this studied
agnosticism, as I call it.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.560 align:middle line:90%
Well, we don't know.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.970 align:middle line:90%
In fact, they do know.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.690 align:middle line:10%
And so people, with the
To the Stars Academy--

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.080 align:middle line:10%
it was headed up by a band
member named Tom DeLonge,

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.880 align:middle line:10%
but he got pulled in by members
of the intelligence community

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.400 align:middle line:10%
and was fed all
this disinformation.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.560 align:middle line:10%
He was convinced the
aliens were a threat.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.380 align:middle line:10%
He was told that he
needed to do this.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.300 align:middle line:10%
And basically, he was set up.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.040 align:middle line:10%
And the result of it is that
they were doing this to strike

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.340 align:middle line:10%
back across the narrative
we were putting out by doing

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.180 align:middle line:10%
the exposÃ© of unacknowledged
special access projects

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.040 align:middle line:10%
in the documentary
"Unacknowledged."

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.850 align:middle line:84%
So that's actually how
that rolled out, and why.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.910 align:middle line:84%
Since then, of course, the
silver lining is the subject

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.680 align:middle line:84%
has become OK to talk about,
because it's in the mainstream

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.430 align:middle line:84%
media all the time now,
instead of it always just being

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.530 align:middle line:90%
"pooh-poohed" and debunked.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.390 align:middle line:10%
The problem with it
is every single story

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.107 align:middle line:10%
about it has a bit of
information which say the Tic

00:03:10.107 --> 00:03:15.710 align:middle line:10%
Tac, or recently, the triangles
over our navel destroyers

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.650 align:middle line:10%
that Senator Reid recently
said were Russian--

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.080 align:middle line:10%
because we had said
they were man-made,

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.660 align:middle line:10%
so he pivoted to
saying Russian--

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.480 align:middle line:10%
and they're actually from
our classified unacknowledged

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.640 align:middle line:10%
special access projects
from the high desert

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.020 align:middle line:10%
out in California, and at
other aerospace contractors.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.707 align:middle line:84%
So the public is being
deceived, and the Congress

00:03:37.707 --> 00:03:40.520 align:middle line:90%
is, as have been presidents.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.380 align:middle line:84%
So what's very
important for people

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.980 align:middle line:84%
to understand is that if
it's in the mainstream media,

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.620 align:middle line:84%
be very skeptical
about the narrative

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.510 align:middle line:84%
and what they're
actually putting out,

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.220 align:middle line:84%
because mostly what
they're putting out

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.100 align:middle line:90%
are known craft that we have.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, sitting and
looking at this--

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.420 align:middle line:84%
on one hand, it's
gratifying to see it's

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.530 align:middle line:90%
being talked about seriously.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.130 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
it's very dangerous,

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.240 align:middle line:84%
because what they're doing is
putting out false information

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.790 align:middle line:84%
and misdirects, and
attaching to each story.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.250 align:middle line:84%
If you look at it
carefully, it's

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.120 align:middle line:84%
a bit subliminal that it's
a national security threat.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.390 align:middle line:84%
You use words like "swarming"
our Navy destroyers.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.000 align:middle line:84%
They'll use words
like "incursions"

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.910 align:middle line:90%
into our nuclear facilities.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.030 align:middle line:84%
It's all fear-based,
war-mongering terms.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.710 align:middle line:84%
So now we're living through
that false disclosure

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.280 align:middle line:84%
that the public
thinks, oh, they're

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.560 align:middle line:90%
finally disclosing this.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.130 align:middle line:84%
No, they're disclosing it in a
way that suits their agenda--

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:41.450 align:middle line:90%
to get more money.

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:42.560 align:middle line:90%
>> And with the media--

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.700 align:middle line:90%
just for the viewers--

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.882 align:middle line:84%
how are they being
told, or who's

00:04:45.882 --> 00:04:47.090 align:middle line:90%
telling them what to put out?

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.840 align:middle line:84%
It seems like, when
you look at the media,

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.690 align:middle line:84%
they're all coming
with the same story.

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, that is coordinated.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.370 align:middle line:10%
Now, as you know,
when Daniel Sheehan

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.170 align:middle line:10%
did the Pentagon Papers--

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.960 align:middle line:10%
and he did, also, many
other cases, Iran Contra,

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.320 align:middle line:10%
of the most important
national security cases

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.890 align:middle line:10%
of the last 50 years,
and he saw a document

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.860 align:middle line:10%
in Project Mockingbird and
some others that listed,

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.930 align:middle line:10%
back in the '70s, 42 people who
were on the payroll of the CIA

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.930 align:middle line:10%
who were dual agents
working inside the media.

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.010 align:middle line:84%
So one of the problems
is the general public

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.690 align:middle line:90%
thinks we have a free press.

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.290 align:middle line:90%
Well, to a point.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:27.940 align:middle line:84%
But on something this
important, that top secret memos

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.282 align:middle line:84%
I have state is the
most sensitive issue

00:05:31.282 --> 00:05:32.740 align:middle line:84%
in the history of
the United States

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.780 align:middle line:84%
exceeding the development
of the hydrogen bomb.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.870 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have
all manner of corruption

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.810 align:middle line:84%
of what we're supposed to
have to have a free press.

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.670 align:middle line:10%
And as I told you,
Bob Schwartz, who

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.820 align:middle line:10%
was on the board of "Time Life"
told me flat out in the '90s,

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.610 align:middle line:10%
the media becomes
scribes taking dictation

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.500 align:middle line:10%
at the right hand
of the king, which

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.170 align:middle line:10%
are these powerful interests
who want to maintain

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:54.260 align:middle line:10%
a certain narrative.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.040 align:middle line:10%
So this is where
one of the problems

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.400 align:middle line:10%
is that how do you get
this information out

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.220 align:middle line:10%
if the mainstream media
has been corrupted

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.070 align:middle line:10%
and is being directed
in a certain area?

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.320 align:middle line:84%
Only cover things
that are half-truths--

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.700 align:middle line:90%
that's what the media is doing--

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.700 align:middle line:84%
and always put this
spin on it that

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.410 align:middle line:84%
is a threat to our
national security.

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:15.880 align:middle line:90%
Where does that lead?

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.640 align:middle line:84%
Right to what Wernher Von
Braun, who invented the rocket,

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.640 align:middle line:84%
said that they will
play this last card.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And that last card
will be an alien threat

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:29.290 align:middle line:84%
to unite the world around a
militaristic global of response

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:30.250 align:middle line:90%
in space.

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And we're right at
that inflection point.

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.043 align:middle line:84%
And it is a really big thing
that's happening right now.

00:06:35.043 --> 00:06:37.210 align:middle line:84%
>> So basically, you're
saying that these incursions

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:38.905 align:middle line:84%
in our airspace are
not really a threat?

00:06:38.905 --> 00:06:42.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Actually, the ones that are
being man-made are a threat,

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:45.820 align:middle line:84%
because they're the ones that
would stage or hoax and pretend

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.110 align:middle line:90%
to be an alien threat.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.050 align:middle line:10%
The actual ET events
that we know of,

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.850 align:middle line:10%
for example, the people that we
initially got to come forward,

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:58.630 align:middle line:10%
a dozen of them, about our
nuclear facilities being

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:03.310 align:middle line:10%
surveilled by extraterrestrial
vehicles, all of them

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:07.780 align:middle line:10%
have told me their sense was
that the ETs were concerned

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.510 align:middle line:10%
that those weapons systems
not only could destroy

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:14.320 align:middle line:10%
all life on Earth, but,
number 2, when they go off,

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.370 align:middle line:10%
it actually causes this
transdimensional pulse

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:21.740 align:middle line:10%
that damages
transdimensional space-time,

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.880 align:middle line:10%
which is their superhighway
of travel and communication.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And that they didn't
feel they were hostile,

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:30.700 align:middle line:84%
but they were trying to
warn us of the danger, which

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:31.670 align:middle line:90%
is reasonable.

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:33.730 align:middle line:84%
So it seems like with
these UAPs, which we

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:35.170 align:middle line:90%
know are really probably ours.

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:36.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Some are.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:37.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, some of them.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:39.610 align:middle line:84%
If they're going to stage
a false flag attack,

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:42.280 align:middle line:84%
for example, it could be kind of
like a Gulf of Tonkin incident

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.355 align:middle line:84%
where nobody can even
see what happens.

00:07:44.355 --> 00:07:46.480 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden there's a
rumor that this thing now

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.063 align:middle line:84%
has attacked because they've set
the stage that they can swarm

00:07:49.063 --> 00:07:52.280 align:middle line:84%
us and they've been doing flybys
and all the fears are already

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.080 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.680 align:middle line:84%
>> And the public's been
prompted little by little.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.700 align:middle line:84%
It's a brainwashing, slow
brainwashing program.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:04.720 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the other
example of the Iraq War.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.730 align:middle line:10%
I mean, Colin Powell's
chief of staff.

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:09.730 align:middle line:10%
Secretary of state, chief of
staff, went public and said,

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:13.720 align:middle line:10%
we found out we were being fed
deliberately false intelligence

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:17.920 align:middle line:10%
by Dick Cheney, who was a
member of this committee,

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:22.000 align:middle line:10%
about Iraq so that we
would go into that war.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.410 align:middle line:10%
And it was completely
based on falsehoods.

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:28.120 align:middle line:10%
So it isn't as if there's no
historical record or proof

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:29.410 align:middle line:10%
that this has been done.

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:32.390 align:middle line:84%
The big one is
unfolding right now.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And the only way to deter it and
stop it is to expose the fraud.

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:39.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Some people are waiting for
this Project Blue Beam hologram

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:40.720 align:middle line:90%
in the sky.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.802 align:middle line:84%
But I think they've
already set the stage.

00:08:42.802 --> 00:08:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And all they have
to do is just say

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.750 align:middle line:84%
it happened now because they've
already built the fear up.

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:49.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and that
started in the 1950s.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:52.720 align:middle line:84%
So keep in mind that
the disinformation and

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:56.350 align:middle line:84%
psychological preparation
for this began in the '50s

00:08:56.350 --> 00:09:00.010 align:middle line:84%
when they started
using man-made UFOs

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:02.800 align:middle line:84%
and certain dressed-up
shorter guys

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.010 align:middle line:84%
and things with deformities
to stage abductions

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:07.120 align:middle line:90%
and do other things.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.940 align:middle line:84%
I know the tactical teams
who are doing the animal

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.250 align:middle line:84%
mutilations, which
were all portrayed

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:15.430 align:middle line:90%
as UFO-equal-alien events.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:19.120 align:middle line:84%
This is all part of the
psychological preparation

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.480 align:middle line:84%
for people, A,
hating the aliens,

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.730 align:middle line:84%
or believing they're the
good ones and the bad ones

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:26.480 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
side with the good ones

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:30.250 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to have a
"Star Wars" battle in space.

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:31.420 align:middle line:90%
That's the narrative.

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:34.300 align:middle line:84%
It's embedded in human
nature to believe it,

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:38.230 align:middle line:84%
because we are
fundamentally tribal.

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:40.075 align:middle line:84%
And if something's
different from us,

00:09:40.075 --> 00:09:41.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these are the
roots of racism, right.

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:42.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.350 align:middle line:90%
>> And misogyny and homophobia.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:47.300 align:middle line:84%
If it's different from
us, we have to fight it.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:48.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:51.280 align:middle line:84%
>> So we have to go to a
higher state of consciousness

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.950 align:middle line:84%
to transcend those
fracture lines,

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:58.225 align:middle line:84%
or we're going to hurl straight
into quite a dangerous future.

00:09:58.225 --> 00:10:01.630 align:middle line:84%
>> There seems to be a
real concerting effort

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:04.190 align:middle line:84%
for disclosure and
disinformation.

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:05.380 align:middle line:90%
How do we curtail this?

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:09.490 align:middle line:84%
>> We have to
develop discernment.

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:14.020 align:middle line:10%
We've released an emergency
documentary called "The Cosmic

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:17.060 align:middle line:10%
Hoax" that proves what
the technologies are

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.850 align:middle line:10%
that we have related to this.

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:24.240 align:middle line:10%
Because one of the problems
is, in the UFO discussion,

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.970 align:middle line:10%
and particularly in
the mainstream media,

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:28.880 align:middle line:10%
they always say it's a mystery
and we don't know what it is.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.540 align:middle line:10%
Senator John Warner's son is
on the record saying, that's

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:34.310 align:middle line:10%
nonsense, we do
know what they are.

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:37.640 align:middle line:10%
And his father was on this
committee with George HW Bush.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.730 align:middle line:10%
Senator John Warner's son
is on the record saying

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:43.640 align:middle line:10%
that his grandfather,
Paul Mellon,

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:47.000 align:middle line:10%
told him prior to his
death that he was on a team

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.560 align:middle line:10%
with General Patton and
Allen Dulles that went over

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:55.610 align:middle line:10%
to Germany and retrieved a
disk that was not a ramjet,

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:59.090 align:middle line:10%
but it was an anti-gravity disk
that they had not perfected

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:02.630 align:middle line:10%
and brought it back to America
with the top scientists

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:03.570 align:middle line:10%
to work on it.

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:05.810 align:middle line:84%
>> So with that being said,
how do we really navigate these

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:07.935 align:middle line:84%
murky waters of the
information and disinformation?

00:11:07.935 --> 00:11:10.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Honestly, if
it's at this point,

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:13.250 align:middle line:84%
and I will notify the
public if this changes,

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:17.060 align:middle line:84%
if it's in the mainstream media,
it is some version of a spin

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:19.310 align:middle line:84%
and disinformation,
unfortunately.

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:21.860 align:middle line:90%
I mean, just bottom line it.

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And the usual suspects
that are out there speaking

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.400 align:middle line:84%
on this or either speaking
from not being informed

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.900 align:middle line:90%
or from a script.

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that the reason
I left my medical career

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:37.130 align:middle line:84%
and did the
Disclosure Project was

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:43.680 align:middle line:84%
to put together the knowledge
of the details of who, what,

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.070 align:middle line:90%
where, how, all in our archive.

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:47.780 align:middle line:84%
It's on our YouTube,
it's everywhere.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:51.410 align:middle line:10%
That, I would say, people have
to study because the Disclosure

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:56.190 align:middle line:10%
Project is the gold standard
for disclosing information.

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:58.640 align:middle line:10%
And if you're looking
to the mainstream media

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.230 align:middle line:10%
to get educated on this--

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:03.597 align:middle line:10%
or worse, the UFO
subculture-- you're

00:12:03.597 --> 00:12:05.180 align:middle line:10%
going to be in the
wilderness forever.

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:08.450 align:middle line:84%
You have to question
whenever there's

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:12.140 align:middle line:84%
a threat narrative attached,
you know that's disinformation.

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:16.520 align:middle line:84%
And the objects they show,
so far, through these leaks

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.637 align:middle line:90%
have all been man-made.

00:12:18.637 --> 00:12:20.970 align:middle line:10%
>> That makes sense what
you're saying because even like

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:23.390 align:middle line:10%
hearing that disclosure that
you did when you had all

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:25.970 align:middle line:10%
the military officers coming
forward-- the former military--

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:30.200 align:middle line:10%
and talking about the UFO
showing up at the missile silos

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.720 align:middle line:10%
and deactivating the nukes.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.470 align:middle line:84%
They didn't activate
them and launch them.

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:34.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:36.020 align:middle line:84%
>> But nobody ever
talks about that.

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And the man who was in
the silo, one of them

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:44.270 align:middle line:84%
said, the message he got was
that, please don't blow up

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:45.560 align:middle line:90%
this beautiful planet.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:49.820 align:middle line:84%
But if you do launch these, we
can intervene to minimize it.

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:51.590 align:middle line:90%
That was the message he got.

00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:53.930 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, fast forward
a couple of years,

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:56.930 align:middle line:84%
and those same
witnesses are repackaged

00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:59.930 align:middle line:84%
into this alien
invasion and incursion

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:02.600 align:middle line:84%
into our readiness
for nuclear missiles.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.150 align:middle line:10%
So it all gets the
same set of facts

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:08.540 align:middle line:10%
to diametrically
opposite assessments.

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And the one that
is always tilting

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.840 align:middle line:84%
towards fear and
invasion scenarios, that

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.780 align:middle line:84%
is being scripted by the
intelligence community.

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:21.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, whether everyone out there
saying that is on the payroll,

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:22.070 align:middle line:90%
I doubt it.

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:26.720 align:middle line:84%
All they have to do is
echo and parrot that line.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.835 align:middle line:84%
If you don't, you
will be blacklisted.

00:13:28.835 --> 00:13:30.845 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so Dr. Greer,
based on what you know,

00:13:30.845 --> 00:13:34.400 align:middle line:84%
are there any altruistic parts
of the government agencies that

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:37.100 align:middle line:84%
really want to bring forth
the truth and disclose that

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:38.400 align:middle line:90%
to the population of the world?

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I think there are people
in government who do.

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:44.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if the center of
gravity in terms of operational

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:49.520 align:middle line:84%
control or control by those
elements, unfortunately.

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:54.260 align:middle line:84%
So you have many good
people who are appalled.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And this is in "Close
Encounters of the Fifth Kind."

00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:59.930 align:middle line:84%
It's seen by millions of
people, many celebrities.

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:01.850 align:middle line:84%
And they're getting
a lot of pushback.

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:06.950 align:middle line:84%
So it's a big issue, because
if you don't stay on the leash

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:08.700 align:middle line:90%
and you go off.

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:11.420 align:middle line:10%
So luckily, that's
why I refused to ever

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:14.300 align:middle line:10%
be put on a leash when I
was offered the $2 billion

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:17.480 align:middle line:10%
from General Stubblebine,
because I knew that those

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.460 align:middle line:10%
had strings attached.

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:20.990 align:middle line:10%
And I know that Dr. Puthoff--

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:22.940 align:middle line:10%
one of his best
friends is on my team--

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:25.040 align:middle line:10%
and said, look--
years ago he said,

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:28.230 align:middle line:10%
I have to say these things,
even if they're not true.

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:31.910 align:middle line:10%
I know that there are already
zero-point energy devices that

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:34.110 align:middle line:10%
save the planet, but
I can't admit it.

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:37.190 align:middle line:84%
And if I did, they would
kill me and my wife

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:39.980 align:middle line:84%
and my children and my
grandchildren, flat out.

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:41.720 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard that
from so many people.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.600 align:middle line:84%
So I have some
sympathy for people who

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:47.240 align:middle line:90%
got in bed with this disaster.

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.340 align:middle line:84%
But it's still, at
a certain point,

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:52.160 align:middle line:84%
you either need to be
quiet or tell the truth.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.493 align:middle line:84%
You cannot just stand up and
continue to tell the public

00:14:54.493 --> 00:14:55.293 align:middle line:90%
lies.

00:14:55.293 --> 00:14:57.700 align:middle line:84%
>> You had a meeting with the
president from the previous

00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:58.500 align:middle line:90%
administration.

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.167 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us a
little bit about that?

00:15:00.167 --> 00:15:03.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'd personally have
provided the briefings for it.

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:05.510 align:middle line:84%
And there are people
on my team who

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:09.680 align:middle line:84%
are very good friends with
the previous administration.

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:13.730 align:middle line:10%
And what was very distressing
is that we had found out

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:19.840 align:middle line:10%
that after this 2017 TTSA
release of the Tic Tac,

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:24.550 align:middle line:10%
I found out that there were very
key people in the committee,

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:26.350 align:middle line:10%
the Majority
Intelligence Committee,

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:29.650 align:middle line:10%
dealing with this UFO issue
going into the White House

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:33.550 align:middle line:10%
and had brainwashed the vice
president and the president

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:35.710 align:middle line:10%
that there was an
alien threat, that we

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:39.640 align:middle line:10%
needed to have weapons in space,
we needed to gear up for war.

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And, voila, we have
the Space Force.

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:46.330 align:middle line:84%
So when I found that out, and it
wasn't through internet gossip

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:50.360 align:middle line:84%
this is a very close
friend of the president

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:51.160 align:middle line:90%
and vice president.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:51.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:56.050 align:middle line:84%
>> I put together a briefing
for them and started trying

00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:58.990 align:middle line:84%
to advise them not to
go in that direction.

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:02.770 align:middle line:84%
Because the only thing worse
than the secrecy we've had

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:06.310 align:middle line:84%
is a false disclosure
that panics the planet

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:07.660 align:middle line:90%
into World War III.

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:08.900 align:middle line:90%
This we don't need.

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:14.380 align:middle line:84%
So I worked really hard,
starting in August of 2020

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:16.990 align:middle line:84%
until the end of
that administration

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:19.300 align:middle line:90%
and Biden being sworn in.

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:22.072 align:middle line:84%
Now we're pivoting to get
materials to the Biden folks.

00:16:22.072 --> 00:16:23.530 align:middle line:84%
And there's a member
of my team who

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:24.880 align:middle line:90%
grew up with President Biden.

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:28.010 align:middle line:84%
And so we're hopeful we
can get that information.

00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:32.530 align:middle line:84%
Now whether it changes
anyone's going to do, I doubt,

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:35.540 align:middle line:84%
because my understanding
is the president and vice

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:37.540 align:middle line:84%
president-- and by the
way, the vice president's

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:38.920 align:middle line:90%
chairman of the Space Council.

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:39.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:40.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Traditionally.

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And they generally do as they're
told on this sort of issue.

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:48.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Obama all but admitted
that I can't talk about this.

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And he's ordered not
to-- order by whom?

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.300 align:middle line:90%
He's the chief executive, right.

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:55.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's something
way above the Office

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:58.090 align:middle line:90%
of the Presidency.

00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:02.740 align:middle line:84%
And so whether or not anything
would come of it or obligation

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:04.540 align:middle line:84%
to provide the
truth and say, look,

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:08.859 align:middle line:84%
you have been provided a very
partial bit of the picture.

00:17:08.859 --> 00:17:11.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's been spun
in the direction

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:14.319 align:middle line:84%
of wanting to
create war in space

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:18.160 align:middle line:84%
and weaponizing space,
et cetera, and so on.

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And that this is not
true and that you

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:24.130 align:middle line:84%
have been targeted, just
like Ronald Reagan was,

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:28.240 align:middle line:84%
who was also a Republican
and an outsider.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:30.830 align:middle line:84%
He had never been in the
National Security system.

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:33.730 align:middle line:84%
And so those sort of
people are easy pickings

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:38.770 align:middle line:84%
for people to come in and give
them cherry-picked information,

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:42.070 align:middle line:84%
like Cheney gave Colin Powell
cherry-picked information that

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:43.780 align:middle line:90%
got us into the Iraq war.

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:49.360 align:middle line:84%
The same thing goes on
on this ET and UFO issue.

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:52.750 align:middle line:84%
So, unfortunately,
when I found that out,

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:56.800 align:middle line:84%
I was in a full-on
emergency mode.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:03.460 align:middle line:84%
So I did a 20-minute video brief
for the president, the vice

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:06.160 align:middle line:84%
president, and for
Vladimir Putin that were

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:07.660 align:middle line:90%
delivered into their hands.

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And then there is
a document there,

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:12.670 align:middle line:84%
which you may want to
look through, if you wish.

00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:15.100 align:middle line:10%
That's the presidential
briefing document

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:18.250 align:middle line:10%
that went to the president
and the vice president.

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:20.530 align:middle line:84%
And we update this
each administration

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:23.830 align:middle line:84%
whenever we get new important
intelligence and information.

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:26.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Now something that has always
confused me a little bit is

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:29.057 align:middle line:84%
that I noticed that we have
the Space Command for years.

00:18:29.057 --> 00:18:31.140 align:middle line:84%
Now all of a sudden we had
to get the Space Force.

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:34.303 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, we already
had a Space Command.

00:18:34.303 --> 00:18:35.220 align:middle line:90%
What's the difference?

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.020 align:middle line:90%
Do you know?

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:40.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, Space Command has been
a long standing interagency

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:45.480 align:middle line:84%
division of the Pentagon to
coordinate things in space,

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.280 align:middle line:84%
military satellites
and what have you.

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:50.490 align:middle line:84%
The Space Force is a whole
new branch of the military.

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:55.690 align:middle line:84%
We have the Navy, Marines,
Air Force, Army, Coast Guard.

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:56.760 align:middle line:90%
This is a new one.

00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:02.460 align:middle line:10%
And that ups it to a more
official standing, funding,

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:08.370 align:middle line:10%
that then has under it US Space
Command and the Navy and Deep

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:10.290 align:middle line:10%
Space Network and
all these things.

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:13.320 align:middle line:84%
But it's all preparatory
to telling the public

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:18.330 align:middle line:84%
that we have to engage
in a conflict in space,

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:21.540 align:middle line:84%
which, if you know
anything about the science,

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:26.640 align:middle line:84%
you look at this as a scientist
or physicist, the technologies

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:29.550 align:middle line:84%
that you're dealing with
that Ben Rich alluded to

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:32.400 align:middle line:84%
beyond what you see in
"Star Trek" and "Star Wars."

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And then you think, these
extraterrestrial civilizations

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:40.080 align:middle line:84%
are thousands or millions of
years more advanced from us.

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:44.370 align:middle line:84%
Those systems used
in a conflict,

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:49.590 align:middle line:84%
a military-type conflict, would
be a nanosecond detonation,

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:52.500 align:middle line:84%
both planets destroyed--
the entire planet.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.950 align:middle line:84%
So this is simply not
possible unless you

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:57.310 align:middle line:90%
want an extinction-level event.

00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:58.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:01.263 align:middle line:84%
>> And, I mean, there are
some lunatics out there.

00:20:01.263 --> 00:20:03.180 align:middle line:84%
They're called eschatologists,
just people who

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:04.710 align:middle line:84%
study the end of
the world and want

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:06.090 align:middle line:90%
the end of the world to happen.

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:09.570 align:middle line:84%
But unless you're
an absolute fanatic

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:11.320 align:middle line:84%
who wants to see the
end of the world,

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:12.930 align:middle line:90%
this is not very good news.

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is
why it isn't plausible

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:19.590 align:middle line:84%
that we can engage in
that kind of conflict,

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:22.680 align:middle line:84%
but it would create trillions
of dollars in funding

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:26.820 align:middle line:84%
to the military industrial
complex and the industrialists

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:29.665 align:middle line:84%
that are behind a lot
of this manipulation.

00:20:29.665 --> 00:20:30.540 align:middle line:90%
Because who benefits?

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:33.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the people who benefit
from these endless wars

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.470 align:middle line:90%
aren't the people being bombed.

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's not our soldiers
being blown apart.

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:38.670 align:middle line:90%
It's not the American taxpayer.

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:40.740 align:middle line:90%
It's not the Earth's biosphere.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.420 align:middle line:90%
It's not the future of humanity.

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:46.170 align:middle line:84%
It's a certain set
of people who benefit

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:49.208 align:middle line:84%
from this kind of
endless conflict.

00:20:49.208 --> 00:20:50.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, just like the--

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:53.550 align:middle line:84%
>> And the big one isn't
terrorism or the Soviet Union

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:55.110 align:middle line:90%
and the Cold War-- it's this.

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:57.750 align:middle line:84%
This is what they've been
planning for 70 years.

00:20:57.750 --> 00:21:00.540 align:middle line:10%
And Wesley Clark, Four
Star General Wesley Clark

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:03.240 align:middle line:10%
saw part of it too and
admitted it on Democracy Now.

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:04.605 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, on camera.

00:21:04.605 --> 00:21:05.880 align:middle line:10%
>> On camera.

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.760 align:middle line:10%
And for every general
like Wesley Clark,

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:11.700 align:middle line:10%
I've spoken to 10 people
like Carol Rosin, when

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:14.560 align:middle line:10%
she was an aerospace
executive, who had seen it.

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:15.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.820 align:middle line:84%
>> So the public needs to
understand that's the kind

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:18.960 align:middle line:90%
of manipulation happening.

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:21.450 align:middle line:84%
And we just see-- it's
like The Who who said,

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:22.590 align:middle line:90%
we won't be fooled again.

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:23.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:24.390 align:middle line:90%
>> After Vietnam.

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:25.485 align:middle line:90%
Well, we have been fooled.

00:21:25.485 --> 00:21:25.800 align:middle line:90%
>> >> Oh, yeah.

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:27.900 align:middle line:84%
It's time for us to
not be fooled again.

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And we have to
rise up as a people

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:34.150 align:middle line:84%
and say we're not going to be
deceived, we want the truth,

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:37.110 align:middle line:84%
we want peace on this planet,
and we want peace in space.

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:39.540 align:middle line:84%
We need to keep the
weapons out of space.

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:43.020 align:middle line:84%
>> So, Dr. Greer, is the ET
contact strictly in the hands

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:44.910 align:middle line:84%
of the military
industrial complex?

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:48.060 align:middle line:84%
Or, can there be
everyday people doing it?

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:51.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the worst-case
scenario is contact with these

00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:53.535 align:middle line:84%
civilizations is
left to militarists.

00:21:53.535 --> 00:21:55.882 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:55.882 --> 00:21:58.890 align:middle line:84%
>> We don't have our State
Department or the United

00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:03.230 align:middle line:84%
Nations, which I've advised when
I was at the UN several times,

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:05.480 align:middle line:84%
that they take an
initiative to do this.

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:08.150 align:middle line:84%
Luckily, the French
government did.

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:11.720 align:middle line:84%
Some years ago, they committed
to making a peaceful contact.

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:15.590 align:middle line:84%
And I went there and helped
train Admiral Moran and others.

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And the document about that is
the most important UFO document

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:19.910 align:middle line:90%
ever written.

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting is that
the CE5 Contact Initiative

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:31.100 align:middle line:84%
is the anecdote to the
endless trapping of this

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:33.440 align:middle line:84%
in a black project
of the military.

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:36.740 align:middle line:84%
Because why should we,
the people of the Earth,

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:41.000 align:middle line:84%
cede that territory to
people who are sociopathic

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.860 align:middle line:90%
and want endless war?

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:44.900 align:middle line:84%
They may be high
functioning sociopaths,

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:46.220 align:middle line:90%
but they're sociopaths.

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:49.820 align:middle line:84%
I think we the people who
want peace and a better world

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:52.640 align:middle line:84%
and an enlightened
world need to go out,

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:56.510 align:middle line:84%
and using CE5
contact protocols--

00:22:56.510 --> 00:23:00.650 align:middle line:84%
I did the template, make
them your own, go at it--

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:05.300 align:middle line:84%
and show these civilizations
most humans aren't like that.

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:06.830 align:middle line:84%
They know that
already, but we need

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:08.590 align:middle line:90%
to actually put it into action.

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:11.150 align:middle line:10%
So I actually think that
the way that a lot of this

00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:14.420 align:middle line:10%
is going to get resolved
is in mass consciousness,

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:17.540 align:middle line:10%
consciousness-raising,
the morphogenic field

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:19.430 align:middle line:10%
of this 1% effect.

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:23.600 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if we had 1% of the
world's population meditating,

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:25.430 align:middle line:90%
remote viewing, making contact.

00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:27.020 align:middle line:90%
That's 75 million people.

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:28.260 align:middle line:90%
But that's doable.

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:30.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some of the
celebrities I'm working with

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:31.770 align:middle line:90%
have a 100 million followers.

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:33.860 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's
eminently doable.

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:37.070 align:middle line:84%
It takes a lot of work to
organize that grassroots

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:40.130 align:middle line:84%
and not let this be
a top-down process.

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:43.340 align:middle line:84%
Top down, because at
the top of the pyramid

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:46.520 align:middle line:84%
here are folks who are addicted
to endless war, because it

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:50.690 align:middle line:84%
benefits their centralized
control and power

00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:53.780 align:middle line:84%
control over the populace,
control over the economy,

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:54.960 align:middle line:90%
and their power.

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.413 align:middle line:84%
And I think we
need to say, look,

00:23:56.413 --> 00:23:58.080 align:middle line:84%
it's we the people
are going to do this.

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:01.070 align:middle line:84%
So I think the
worst-case scenario

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:04.970 align:middle line:84%
is for people to be
sheeple and to be passive.

00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
time to lean into it.

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:10.790 align:middle line:84%
And so I just think
that we have to say,

00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:13.910 align:middle line:84%
we can do this peacefully
in an enlightened way,

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:16.610 align:middle line:84%
but we need to step
up the game and we

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:19.310 align:middle line:84%
need to be active
and not passive

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:22.530 align:middle line:84%
and just let this
tsunami roll over us.

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:24.600 align:middle line:90%
And so that's a call to action.

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:25.670 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's a movement.

00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:29.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Up until now, we've seen
this very slow drip disclosure

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:30.530 align:middle line:90%
happening.

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:32.832 align:middle line:84%
How long do you think it's
going to be before we're

00:24:32.832 --> 00:24:34.040 align:middle line:90%
going to see real disclosure?

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:35.957 align:middle line:84%
Or do you think we're
ever going to get there?

00:24:35.957 --> 00:24:38.570 align:middle line:90%
>> The truth is that it's there.

00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:40.460 align:middle line:84%
But to the extent
people haven't seen it,

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:41.795 align:middle line:84%
because it's been
banned out of the media.

00:24:41.795 --> 00:24:42.595 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:24:42.595 --> 00:24:46.730 align:middle line:84%
>> If you look at, I
mean, literally a 100-plus

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:49.610 align:middle line:84%
whistleblowers that are
in the Disclosure Project.

00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:52.190 align:middle line:84%
There's much more detail in
that than the dog and pony show

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:54.080 align:middle line:90%
you're seeing on TV now.

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:55.580 align:middle line:90%
So that's been done.

00:24:55.580 --> 00:25:00.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, if the question is,
when is a truthful official

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:03.910 align:middle line:84%
disclosure going to happen,
I wouldn't hold more breath.

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:05.545 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've been
doing this briefing

00:25:05.545 --> 00:25:10.530 align:middle line:84%
at the level of the presidency
and CIA directors since '92,

00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:11.470 align:middle line:90%
'93.

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:16.120 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not sanguine that
a truthful disclosure

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:18.280 align:middle line:84%
is forthcoming from
any world leader.

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:19.360 align:middle line:90%
We're working on it.

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:20.770 align:middle line:90%
And one can be hopeful.

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:23.410 align:middle line:84%
I think it's more important
that we the people

00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:26.860 align:middle line:84%
get this information
and continue

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:30.410 align:middle line:84%
to get disclosure
whistleblowers to come forward,

00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:32.860 align:middle line:84%
put the information
out, and then network

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:33.770 align:middle line:90%
it with social media.

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:35.590 align:middle line:84%
You can network it
to a lot of people,

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:37.900 align:middle line:84%
many more people than frankly
read the "New York Times"

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:38.860 align:middle line:90%
or watch CNN.

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:41.350 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's kind
of what we need to do.

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:45.250 align:middle line:84%
I think just like contact
with these civilizations,

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:49.180 align:middle line:84%
disclosure needs to be
a grassroots movement.

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:52.870 align:middle line:84%
Because that's
why, by the way, I

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:57.350 align:middle line:84%
gave up on it happening out of
the government, here or abroad,

00:25:57.350 --> 00:26:02.470 align:middle line:84%
and pivoted to a public
National Press Club event that

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:05.260 align:middle line:84%
had hundreds of millions of
people seeing it to say, look,

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:08.620 align:middle line:84%
the people need to
deal with this now.

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:10.225 align:middle line:84%
So I think the ball
really needs to be

00:26:10.225 --> 00:26:11.350 align:middle line:90%
in the hands of the people.

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:13.540 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're
allowing the power

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:17.860 align:middle line:84%
elites to do the
right thing, look,

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:21.880 align:middle line:84%
a stopped broken clock
is right twice a day,

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:27.070 align:middle line:84%
but history is not on the
favor of any real enlightened

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:32.200 align:middle line:84%
truthful non-xenophobic,
non-warmongering disclosure

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:34.880 align:middle line:90%
coming out of official quarters.

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:36.010 align:middle line:90%
So I think we--

00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:37.240 align:middle line:90%
the people need to do it.

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:38.460 align:middle line:90%
I think it's very important.

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:40.960 align:middle line:84%
>> You made that point, I think
in the last episode as well,

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.990 align:middle line:84%
that the people need to lead and
the government should follow,

00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:44.950 align:middle line:90%
or they will follow.

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:45.520 align:middle line:90%
>> They will.

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:46.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Once the people lead.

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:46.630 align:middle line:90%
They have to.

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:47.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:49.070 align:middle line:90%
I had a very strange experience.

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:51.970 align:middle line:84%
We were storyboarding
the Disclosure Project

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:54.490 align:middle line:84%
in the National Press
Club in the year 2000.

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And we were in the
living room of my house.

00:26:56.570 --> 00:26:59.860 align:middle line:84%
I live out on a farm
out in the country

00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:03.310 align:middle line:84%
down the road from
Thomas Jefferson's house.

00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And we're writing
this out and I swear,

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:09.790 align:middle line:84%
on my right side I heard
Thomas Jefferson's voice come

00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:13.700 align:middle line:84%
in and say, the next
American Revolution.

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:15.340 align:middle line:84%
And I turned to
everyone and said it.

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:16.210 align:middle line:90%
And they went, what.

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:19.390 align:middle line:84%
I said, he seems to
be around in spirit.

00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:21.670 align:middle line:84%
And I think we have
to look at this--

00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:24.220 align:middle line:84%
it's a peaceful revolution
of knowledge and truth

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:25.270 align:middle line:90%
and enlightenment.

00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's in the hands
of we the people.

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:30.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you envision a day soon
where we'll have actual open

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:32.380 align:middle line:84%
contact with these
advanced civilizations?

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:33.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:36.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the whole CE5
Contact Initiative

00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:37.990 align:middle line:90%
that's happening now.

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:40.360 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
evidence and experiences

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:44.440 align:middle line:84%
of thousands of people doing
this, it's happening now.

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:48.220 align:middle line:10%
Now, again, you don't see
the contact events that

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:50.170 align:middle line:10%
are in "Close Encounters
of the Fifth Kind,"

00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:53.980 align:middle line:10%
even though they're astounding
and there are photos and videos

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:55.390 align:middle line:10%
and multiple witnesses.

00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:57.340 align:middle line:10%
You'd think that
would be front page.

00:27:57.340 --> 00:28:00.910 align:middle line:10%
It isn't, because they don't
want the public to know this.

00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:03.310 align:middle line:10%
Because the only thing more
dangerous than disclosing

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:05.410 align:middle line:10%
their little dirty
military secrets

00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:09.700 align:middle line:10%
is for the mainstream
media to let the public

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:12.700 align:middle line:10%
know that you can make contact
with these civilizations,

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:14.500 align:middle line:10%
and you do not need
the government.

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:15.550 align:middle line:10%
Go around it.

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:18.970 align:middle line:10%
You see, leave the Pentagon
behind, leave the government

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:24.940 align:middle line:10%
behind, and do this as a citizen
of the universe, as a denizen,

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:26.620 align:middle line:10%
a dweller of the cosmos.

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:28.570 align:middle line:10%
And I think that's
really what's empowering.

00:28:28.570 --> 00:28:30.370 align:middle line:10%
So it's actually happening now.

00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:34.540 align:middle line:10%
Now at some point, I think there
will be an open contact event.

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:38.800 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to have to be
sure that anything like that

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:41.920 align:middle line:84%
isn't spun in the direction
of an alien invasion.

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the real problems.

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:46.570 align:middle line:84%
Because again, like
the nuclear cases,

00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:51.340 align:middle line:84%
you can take the same event
and spin it in a direction

00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:53.380 align:middle line:90%
that galvanizes fear.

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:56.230 align:middle line:84%
And then, through fear,
you can control people.

00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:57.850 align:middle line:90%
Fear is the spirit killer.

00:28:57.850 --> 00:28:59.380 align:middle line:90%
Fear is the mind killer.

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:01.600 align:middle line:10%
So I think that
what's going to happen

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:04.390 align:middle line:10%
is that the public
have to become

00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:08.290 align:middle line:10%
awake enough and aware enough
to know what the false narrative

00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:10.090 align:middle line:10%
is, know what the truth is.

00:29:10.090 --> 00:29:14.080 align:middle line:84%
That they go forward and
are ready for open contact,

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:15.880 align:middle line:90%
globally, then it will happen.

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:18.920 align:middle line:84%
But we have some work
to do until then.

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:20.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Dr. Greer.

00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:21.285 align:middle line:10%
>> Thank you.

00:29:21.285 --> 00:29:22.710 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm Billy Carson.

00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:24.270 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
watching "Disclosure

00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:26.660 align:middle line:90%
with Dr. Steven Greer."

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:31.000 align:middle line:90%
