>>BILLY CARSON:
Welcome to "Disclosure"

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.820 align:middle line:10%
with Dr. Steven Greer.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.830 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we
discuss the origins

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.430 align:middle line:10%
of The Disclosure Project.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:26.560 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Dr. Greer.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.643 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVEN GREER: Thank you.

00:00:27.643 --> 00:00:28.790 align:middle line:90%
Great being with you.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: Dr. Greer,
what events kicked off

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.450 align:middle line:90%
the Disclosure in 1993?

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.950 align:middle line:10%
>>GREER: Yeah, a
lot of people don't

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.170 align:middle line:10%
know that the roots of
the disclosure movement

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.050 align:middle line:10%
go way back.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.280 align:middle line:10%
As I mentioned, 1992,
after the events

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.040 align:middle line:10%
in the CE5 that
happened, that led

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.980 align:middle line:10%
to a series rapidly
evolving events,

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.240 align:middle line:10%
including the people
who reached out

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.840 align:middle line:10%
to me who were close
to President Clinton

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.010 align:middle line:10%
and who informed me quite
unbelievably at the time--

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.210 align:middle line:10%
I didn't believe it--

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.460 align:middle line:10%
that the president and
the director of the CIA

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.660 align:middle line:10%
had been denied access to these
unacknowledged special access

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.620 align:middle line:10%
projects.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.000 align:middle line:84%
So around that
time, I had a number

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.110 align:middle line:84%
of what I call the white hat
friendly people in military

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.260 align:middle line:84%
and intelligence
circles, some of whom

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.300 align:middle line:84%
had been in unacknowledged
special access projects, which

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.920 align:middle line:84%
were the very top secret,
compartmented operations,

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.880 align:middle line:90%
who wanted to help.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:34.040 align:middle line:84%
And so we began to talk
and discuss what to do.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.230 align:middle line:10%
This initiative that came
from people in the White House

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.240 align:middle line:10%
was to set up a
briefing between me

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.660 align:middle line:10%
and the DCI, the Director
of Central Intelligence, CIA

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.820 align:middle line:10%
Director Woolsey.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.093 align:middle line:10%
In the letter it says,
and rather astonishingly,

00:01:51.093 --> 00:01:52.760 align:middle line:10%
the most powerful
interests in the world

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.460 align:middle line:10%
are going to try to stop
this and that we have

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:02.930 align:middle line:10%
to be very careful, and that
these leaders in our country

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.450 align:middle line:10%
are not read into,
which is military speak

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.610 align:middle line:10%
for briefed on this issue.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.600 align:middle line:84%
Now leading up to this,
[LAUGHS] some people

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.690 align:middle line:84%
who were with Laurance
Rockefeller reached out to me.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And I did a series of
trips up to New York

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.220 align:middle line:84%
to meet with those
folks, and eventually was

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.830 align:middle line:84%
invited out to the
Rockefeller Ranch in 1993

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.800 align:middle line:84%
with a number of
people in this field.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And his interest was mainly
in the CE5 contact events.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.170 align:middle line:84%
And he was supportive
of doing this.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.910 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, he was
surrounded by a lot

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.620 align:middle line:84%
of operatives that diverted
his interest eventually.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And people talk about the
Rockefeller initiative.

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.840 align:middle line:84%
There was no around
Rockefeller initiative.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.660 align:middle line:10%
It was called Project
Starlight that I

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.320 align:middle line:10%
founded with a group of military
people and administration

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.010 align:middle line:10%
people to get this
information to the right folks

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.450 align:middle line:10%
in the government who were
not being told the truth.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And Laurance Rockefeller
was very supportive of that,

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:17.930 align:middle line:84%
so he hosted us there
in September of 1993.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.290 align:middle line:84%
In the meanwhile-- he
didn't know this either,

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.950 align:middle line:84%
Laurance Rockefeller
was astonished.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.033 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, where
are you going after here?

00:03:26.033 --> 00:03:28.920 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'm going to
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.050 align:middle line:84%
to brief the head of the
Foreign Aerospace Science

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.460 align:middle line:84%
and Technology Center, which is
where all the original Roswell

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.710 align:middle line:84%
debris and all that
stuff was sent.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.410 align:middle line:84%
And I was meeting
with the colonel,

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.620 align:middle line:84%
trying to get them
to de-conflict

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.130 align:middle line:84%
their operations with our
CE5 contact operations.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.510 align:middle line:84%
That's what that
meeting was about.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.280 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, the
colonel said, well,

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.790 align:middle line:84%
what if some of
these civilizations

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.780 align:middle line:90%
aren't friendly or hostile?

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.880 align:middle line:84%
I said, sir, with
all due respect,

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.480 align:middle line:84%
given the galactically stupid
things we've been doing,

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.970 align:middle line:84%
if they were hostile, they
would have been point, set,

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.120 align:middle line:84%
match the day we detonated
that first atomic bomb.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And the intelligence officer
was scribbling furiously,

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:12.890 align:middle line:90%
Bruce Ashcroft.

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.360 align:middle line:90%
It was very kind of comical.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.730 align:middle line:84%
But you know, it showed
the kind of thinking

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.050 align:middle line:90%
in those military circles.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.760 align:middle line:90%
We don't control these things.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.930 align:middle line:90%
Therefore, they're a threat.

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.250 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, we're
going to kill them.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.583 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was boom, boom, boom.

00:04:24.583 --> 00:04:25.620 align:middle line:90%
It's that simple.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.510 align:middle line:84%
So just beforehand, I was at
a meeting out here in Phoenix.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
group of folks who

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.100 align:middle line:84%
were members of this
committee, dealing

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.190 align:middle line:84%
with these classified
systems, dealing with UFOs,

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.440 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial intelligence.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.910 align:middle line:90%
And it was late at night.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.500 align:middle line:90%
10:00, 11 o'clock at night.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.500 align:middle line:10%
They said, look, we know
all about your meeting

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.500 align:middle line:10%
with CIA Director
Woolsey that's coming up.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.312 align:middle line:10%
You don't need to meet with the
president or the CIA director.

00:04:53.312 --> 00:04:55.020 align:middle line:10%
They don't know
anything, and they're not

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.150 align:middle line:10%
going to know anything.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.880 align:middle line:84%
If you want to talk to people
dealing with this issue,

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.140 align:middle line:90%
you meet with people like us.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's this conference
room full of suits.

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.240 align:middle line:84%
We're the ones who
do all the WFO--

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.790 align:middle line:84%
Work For Others-- contracting
for the government.

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.760 align:middle line:84%
We're the ones who are running
the supercomputers backing up

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.650 align:middle line:90%
the global financial system.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.110 align:middle line:84%
We're the ones-- and
he goes on and on.

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And also, we're the
ones cooperating

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.550 align:middle line:84%
with certain orders
of Jesuit priests

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.030 align:middle line:84%
in the technology transfer
programs and with the Vatican.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm going, this is
like something out of--

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:27.750 align:middle line:90%
through the rabbit hole.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And at first, I thought he
had to be making this up.

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's turned out, every
word he said was true.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.723 align:middle line:90%
So I got back to Peterson.

00:05:35.723 --> 00:05:38.140 align:middle line:84%
Said, look, there's a group
that knows about this meeting,

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:39.460 align:middle line:90%
and he went ballistic.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.260 align:middle line:90%
How can they know?

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.710 align:middle line:84%
I said, John, they have
ways of monitoring things

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:48.070 align:middle line:84%
that don't require speed of
light signals and phones.

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.200 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.840 align:middle line:84%
That can interface space
time electronically,

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.570 align:middle line:90%
remotely, scalar.

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.140 align:middle line:90%
Faster than the speed of light.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.630 align:middle line:84%
So I said, just
don't worry about it.

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.320 align:middle line:90%
So we have the meeting.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.340 align:middle line:84%
The first few minutes,
I have a briefcase

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.260 align:middle line:84%
full of all these
evidence and pictures

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.390 align:middle line:84%
and government
documents and stuff.

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.220 align:middle line:90%
He says, I know this is true.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.990 align:middle line:90%
I know these things are real.

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.200 align:middle line:84%
What I don't understand
is why the president and I

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.940 align:middle line:90%
are being denied access.

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.440 align:middle line:84%
So the whole conversation
was about the nature

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.900 align:middle line:84%
of these unacknowledged
special access projects,

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.060 align:middle line:84%
that they are highly
compartmented,

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.165 align:middle line:90%
that they are not--

00:06:28.165 --> 00:06:31.510 align:middle line:84%
people who are in the Senate or
the White House, a few of them

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.600 align:middle line:84%
are read into them, but they're
cooperating with the secrecy.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.180 align:middle line:10%
Most of them have no idea.

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:41.830 align:middle line:84%
It turned out that the rank
you have, like in the military,

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.830 align:middle line:84%
in the Pentagon, or
the CIA has nothing

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.993 align:middle line:84%
to do with whether
you're told about it.

00:06:46.993 --> 00:06:48.910 align:middle line:84%
It's whether or not
you're willing to go along

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:51.220 align:middle line:90%
with the agenda of the secrecy.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.360 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.230 align:middle line:84%
But what was interesting
about this to me--

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:55.563 align:middle line:90%
so we went through the material.

00:06:55.563 --> 00:06:58.330 align:middle line:84%
I explained the structure of
these unacknowledged special

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.885 align:middle line:84%
access projects and how
they were being run.

00:07:01.885 --> 00:07:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And he said, yeah, I'm
just sort of a guy who

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.310 align:middle line:84%
goes up on Capitol Hill
and brings tens of billions

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:08.320 align:middle line:90%
of dollars back to the CIA.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.660 align:middle line:84%
But he admitted that
there were many projects

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.570 align:middle line:84%
he was not read into, even
though he was the director.

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:19.240 align:middle line:84%
So at the end of it,
I had put together

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.970 align:middle line:84%
a set of executive
order recommendations

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:23.750 align:middle line:90%
for the president.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.110 align:middle line:90%
When I handed it to him--

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:27.820 align:middle line:84%
and I said, we
really need your help

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.990 align:middle line:84%
disclosing this and
getting this problem fixed.

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.823 align:middle line:90%
And he looked at me.

00:07:30.823 --> 00:07:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And says, Dr. Greer,
how do we disclose that

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:36.330 align:middle line:90%
which we have no access to?

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:39.795 align:middle line:84%
And my wife and I are at this
meeting going, holy crap.

00:07:39.795 --> 00:07:42.270 align:middle line:90%
This is really a bad situation.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:45.060 align:middle line:84%
That was my introduction
to through the looking

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:49.920 align:middle line:84%
glass of mirrors and craziness
of the national security state.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:55.030 align:middle line:10%
Ultimately, the thing that
was the most hopeful thing

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:58.810 align:middle line:10%
at this meeting was
his wife, Sue Woolsey.

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:02.500 align:middle line:10%
And she had the insight to ask--

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.050 align:middle line:10%
she said, Dr. Greer,
what I don't understand

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:08.920 align:middle line:10%
is how are they communicating
across the vastness

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.230 align:middle line:10%
of interstellar distances?

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:13.080 align:middle line:84%
Because at the
speed of light, it

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.430 align:middle line:84%
would take millions of
years or thousands of years

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:17.268 align:middle line:84%
to get a signal
from point A to B.

00:08:17.268 --> 00:08:18.560 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yeah, that's right.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And look at our
Milky Way galaxy.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.345 align:middle line:90%
100,000 light years across.

00:08:22.345 --> 00:08:24.580 align:middle line:84%
And a light year isn't
a measure of time.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:25.900 align:middle line:90%
It's a measure of distance.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:30.400 align:middle line:84%
It's how far a beam of
light goes at 186,000

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.855 align:middle line:90%
miles per second for a year.

00:08:32.855 --> 00:08:33.730 align:middle line:90%
Now think about that.

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:37.840 align:middle line:84%
186,000 miles every
second for a year.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.039 align:middle line:90%
That's one light year.

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:42.429 align:middle line:84%
The Milky Way's
100,000 of those.

00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:46.750 align:middle line:84%
So 1% across the
Milky Way galaxy,

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:49.420 align:middle line:84%
1,000 light years,
at the speed of light

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.310 align:middle line:84%
to say, hello,
how are you doing,

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:53.710 align:middle line:84%
would take 1,000 years
to get the signal there

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:56.490 align:middle line:84%
and another 1,000 years
to get the signal back.

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:58.810 align:middle line:84%
That's the time since
the birth of Christ, OK?

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:00.130 align:middle line:90%
So I said, look.

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:01.900 align:middle line:84%
So the speed of
light is completely

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:07.770 align:middle line:84%
insufficient for any and all
interstellar civilizations.

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:12.390 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, they are using
trans-dimensional physics

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:14.160 align:middle line:84%
that involves faster
than the speed

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.550 align:middle line:84%
of light interface with thought
consciousness and devices.

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:20.040 align:middle line:90%
And it goes two ways.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.860 align:middle line:10%
Technology-assisted
consciousness

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.200 align:middle line:10%
where your conscious
thought is assisted

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.350 align:middle line:10%
by a technology and
consciousness-assisted

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:31.410 align:middle line:10%
technologies where your
mind assists the device.

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:34.330 align:middle line:90%
It flows both directions.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.000 align:middle line:90%
And that's what they're using.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:36.800 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Right.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.420 align:middle line:84%
Is this likened to quantum
entanglement and quantum

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:43.140 align:middle line:84%
physics where two particles
communicate instantaneously,

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:44.530 align:middle line:90%
bypassing space and time?

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:45.330 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: Yes.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:48.220 align:middle line:84%
It's what Einstein
called the spooky effect.

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And when you're dealing with
that level of entanglement,

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:55.720 align:middle line:84%
take that times infinity
when you're dealing

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.940 align:middle line:90%
with consciousness and thought.

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:02.620 align:middle line:84%
So the whole cosmos is this
interrelated, interwoven,

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:05.710 align:middle line:84%
non-local-- and
non-local means it's not

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:09.550 align:middle line:84%
a straight line in space time,
but it's within each other,

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:11.480 align:middle line:90%
and proximity is right there.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.380 align:middle line:84%
So we think, oh, the Andromeda
galaxy as two and a half

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:17.543 align:middle line:90%
million light years away.

00:10:17.543 --> 00:10:19.960 align:middle line:84%
At the speed of light, it takes
you two and a half million

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.460 align:middle line:90%
years to get there.

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:26.140 align:middle line:84%
But within this entangled,
interrelated cosmos

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:29.620 align:middle line:84%
on a quantum level, it's
actually right here.

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:31.040 align:middle line:90%
It's right here.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:31.960 align:middle line:90%
Now, what is here?

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it gets into this
discussion of dimensions

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:35.740 align:middle line:90%
and thought and consciousness.

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:38.470 align:middle line:84%
But that's what all
interstellar civilizations

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:40.290 align:middle line:90%
have to have mastered.

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:41.290 align:middle line:90%
And so I explained that.

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And that was
actually, to me-- what

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:45.490 align:middle line:84%
that said to me, because
to be honest with you,

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:47.350 align:middle line:84%
when she first
asked the question,

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:49.180 align:middle line:84%
I thought, I'd better
not answer this,

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:51.410 align:middle line:90%
because I will discredit myself.

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
fulfillment of what

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:56.510 align:middle line:84%
I was told in 1991 by an
intelligence officer who

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:59.640 align:middle line:84%
had been involved in
this area for decades.

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And he said, if you tell
the truth, it hides itself.

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:08.780 align:middle line:84%
It will discredit you, because
the truth is so much more

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:12.830 align:middle line:84%
bizarre than the fiction
that's out there on UFOs.

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:14.540 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's time
for people to know

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:15.920 align:middle line:90%
the truth and the whole truth.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:16.720 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Mm-hmm.

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:17.660 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:20.630 align:middle line:84%
CIA Director James Woolsey
denied the purpose of a dinner

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:22.220 align:middle line:90%
party that you had attended.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:23.722 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell us about that?

00:11:23.722 --> 00:11:24.680 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: Yes, actually.

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:25.940 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't just a dinner party.

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:28.640 align:middle line:10%
That was the cover for a
briefing for the CIA director.

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:30.500 align:middle line:10%
And I can prove it
from the letters

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:33.290 align:middle line:10%
I received from the
man who set it up

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:37.190 align:middle line:10%
and who hosted it, John Peterson
of the Arlington Institute.

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And the reason this happens,
as I often sort of joke,

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:45.020 align:middle line:84%
is that in Washington, how
do you know they're lying?

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:45.960 align:middle line:90%
Their lips are moving.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:46.760 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: [LAUGHS]

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.343 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: So if their
lips are moving--

00:11:48.343 --> 00:11:52.400 align:middle line:84%
so after he left office, I
never talked about this meeting.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:56.300 align:middle line:84%
In fact, less than a year after
the meeting, which took place

00:11:56.300 --> 00:12:02.550 align:middle line:84%
on December 13, 1993,
in the Washington area,

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:05.460 align:middle line:84%
I was on "Larry King"
for a special he

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:08.400 align:middle line:90%
did that was out near Area 51.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.440 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't speak of it.

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:13.560 align:middle line:84%
I didn't speak of it till
he was out of office,

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.450 align:middle line:90%
because I didn't want--

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:17.220 align:middle line:84%
I felt that while
he was in office,

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:21.630 align:middle line:84%
I should give him enough
freedom to proceed internally

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:25.410 align:middle line:84%
to see if he could get
control of the situation.

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:27.660 align:middle line:84%
Of course, he
didn't, and there's

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:29.430 align:middle line:90%
this follow-on story to this.

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:33.300 align:middle line:84%
But when he later denied
that that was the purpose

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:34.770 align:middle line:90%
of the meeting, I simply--

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:37.110 align:middle line:84%
and he had everyone at
the meeting except me

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:38.740 align:middle line:90%
and my wife sign this letter.

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:43.230 align:middle line:84%
He, the CIA director, his
wife, the host, John Peterson,

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:47.460 align:middle line:84%
and his wife, saying that
that wasn't what happened.

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:50.040 align:middle line:84%
Which, of course, was
calling me a liar.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, well,
unfortunately, I

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:55.230 align:middle line:84%
keep everything in my
archive, and here's

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:58.770 align:middle line:84%
the letter setting up the
meeting that explicitly

00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:00.400 align:middle line:90%
says what it's about.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.600 align:middle line:90%
So here's the problem.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.490 align:middle line:84%
There's so many people who keep
covering up and lying and lying

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:07.750 align:middle line:84%
and lying, and it's
very worrisome.

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:09.130 align:middle line:10%
So I just push back on it.

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:09.930 align:middle line:10%
Say, no.

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:10.620 align:middle line:10%
This is what happened.

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:11.662 align:middle line:10%
It's very matter of fact.

00:13:11.662 --> 00:13:14.370 align:middle line:10%
I don't make up stories.

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:15.730 align:middle line:90%
And luckily, I can prove it.

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:17.560 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] So that was that.

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.690 align:middle line:84%
Now interestingly,
after that meeting--

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:22.020 align:middle line:90%
so that's December '93--

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:24.510 align:middle line:84%
I ended up a couple
of months later

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:27.060 align:middle line:84%
having a very close
friend of the president--

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:30.090 align:middle line:84%
Clinton-- come to my
home in North Carolina.

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:32.580 align:middle line:90%
And he blurts out--

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.730 align:middle line:84%
he says, well, the
president's very--

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:38.040 align:middle line:84%
and his people are very
supportive of what you've

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:41.220 align:middle line:84%
recommended, that
secrecy on this be ended,

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.080 align:middle line:84%
we bring out these
technologies, that people

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.910 align:middle line:84%
know we're not alone
in the universe,

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:48.060 align:middle line:84%
within a framework of it
being a positive announcement,

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:49.890 align:middle line:90%
not something scary.

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:52.620 align:middle line:84%
However, his people
are convinced

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:54.690 align:middle line:84%
that if President
Clinton does that,

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:57.320 align:middle line:84%
he will end up
like Jack Kennedy.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And I start laughing,
because I think,

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.370 align:middle line:84%
oh, this is a bad
John le Carre novel.

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:03.680 align:middle line:84%
It's like a bad
conspiracy novel.

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.360 align:middle line:90%
And he says, stop.

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.380 align:middle line:90%
We're not joking.

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:07.640 align:middle line:90%
And he tells me--

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:09.530 align:middle line:84%
this was the
follow-up-- he says,

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:12.470 align:middle line:84%
the president won't
do anything about this

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:13.790 align:middle line:90%
because it is too dangerous.

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:15.350 align:middle line:90%
Too risky.

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:18.200 align:middle line:90%
But you should I said, what?

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.880 align:middle line:90%
I have no official standing.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing this as a non-profit,
non-governmental organization.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:27.050 align:middle line:84%
And he said, yes, but
they think you can do it.

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:31.340 align:middle line:84%
I said, what you really are
saying is I'm expendable.

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And he looked me
right in the eyes.

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:33.920 align:middle line:90%
This is so Washington.

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.540 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you're expendable.

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:36.710 align:middle line:90%
I went, OK, great.

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:37.790 align:middle line:90%
So I'm the throwaway.

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:39.660 align:middle line:84%
I always tell people,
I'm the throwaway guy.

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:40.460 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Right.

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:41.240 align:middle line:10%
>>GREER: Yeah.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.060 align:middle line:10%
>>BILLY: Interesting.

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:43.435 align:middle line:10%
>>GREER: So that's
what happened.

00:14:43.435 --> 00:14:46.070 align:middle line:10%
And subsequently,
Laurance Rockefeller

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:50.990 align:middle line:10%
did host the Clintons out at his
ranch in the summer of '94, '95

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:52.520 align:middle line:10%
that period.

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:56.390 align:middle line:84%
Allegedly a vacation, but it
was for them to get brought up

00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:57.380 align:middle line:90%
to speed on this.

00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.810 align:middle line:84%
I put together a
very large collection

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:02.630 align:middle line:84%
of cases and briefing
materials that was then

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:06.200 align:middle line:84%
rewritten by Antonio
Huneeus and some people,

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:11.492 align:middle line:84%
and that was provided
subsequently by biding his time

00:15:11.492 --> 00:15:12.950 align:middle line:84%
and getting out of
the White House.

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:15.830 align:middle line:84%
He was kind of pulled
in to a certain level

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:19.670 align:middle line:84%
by George H.W. Bush, who
was a long-standing member

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:21.050 align:middle line:90%
of the committee.

00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:23.810 align:middle line:84%
200, 300 people
who were operating

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:25.455 align:middle line:90%
these clandestine organizations.

00:15:25.455 --> 00:15:26.255 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Hmm

00:15:26.255 --> 00:15:26.630 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: Yeah.

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:28.880 align:middle line:10%
>>BILLY: That's interesting,
because when you bring up

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:33.320 align:middle line:10%
Laurance Rockefeller, I remember
when Hillary Clinton was

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.910 align:middle line:10%
running for president.

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:38.540 align:middle line:10%
There's a famous picture of her
leaving the Rockefeller Ranch.

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And in her hand, if you zoom in,
she's got a book about aliens.

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:42.260 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: Yes.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.200 align:middle line:84%
And that was all a
follow-on to the--

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.280 align:middle line:90%
well, actually, in '94--

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.363 align:middle line:90%
I need to tell this story.

00:15:47.363 --> 00:15:49.850 align:middle line:84%
A very interesting
thing that happened.

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:52.850 align:middle line:84%
I had a meeting
with some people who

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:56.870 align:middle line:90%
were wanting to help with this.

00:15:56.870 --> 00:16:01.370 align:middle line:84%
Some had been State Department,
military, unacknowledged

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:02.750 align:middle line:90%
projects.

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And we had a meeting at
the Monroe Institute,

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:09.782 align:middle line:84%
which is very near where
my home in Virginia is now.

00:16:09.782 --> 00:16:11.990 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that's where
Robert Monroe, Bob Monroe

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:14.390 align:middle line:84%
would train army
intelligence people

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:19.340 align:middle line:84%
and others in their version of
remote viewing, what have you.

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And we had this meeting, and
that's when we said, look,

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:30.680 align:middle line:84%
we're going to continue
this going forward.

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:37.340 align:middle line:84%
But at any rate, in '94,
this continued to unfold.

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, we had
this amazing meeting

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:44.220 align:middle line:84%
with the first Disclosure
Project witnesses.

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
we're now, in 2021,

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:50.090 align:middle line:84%
the 20-year anniversary
of what everyone knows

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:51.827 align:middle line:90%
as The Disclosure Project.

00:16:51.827 --> 00:16:53.660 align:middle line:84%
But there was all this
preparatory work that

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:57.180 align:middle line:90%
led up to it back in the '90s.

00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:00.620 align:middle line:84%
So it took from '92
or '93 until 2001

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:03.360 align:middle line:84%
to get everything
in order for that.

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.490 align:middle line:90%
And this is the back story.

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:06.740 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't know
this back story, which

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:09.073 align:middle line:84%
I think is important, because
there are a lot of lessons

00:17:09.073 --> 00:17:12.200 align:middle line:84%
I learned and the public can
learn about how things operate.

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And so you know, we
had the first gathering

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:17.750 align:middle line:84%
of military
witnesses, cosmonauts,

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:22.880 align:middle line:84%
astronauts at Asilomar,
a facility near Monterey

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:26.089 align:middle line:84%
in California in
the summer of 1995.

00:17:26.089 --> 00:17:30.050 align:middle line:84%
And that was
supported financially,

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:33.500 align:middle line:84%
funded by Rockefeller,
but I was running it.

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:37.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, people in the UFO culture--
oh, the Rockefeller initiative.

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:39.590 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't organizing or
running any of these things.

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:40.520 align:middle line:90%
We were.

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And it was an attempt
to pull people together

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.680 align:middle line:84%
who would come forward
with credentials--

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:49.320 align:middle line:84%
and astronaut Edgar Mitchell
was there, amongst others.

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:52.520 align:middle line:84%
And it was the first
gathering like this.

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:56.180 align:middle line:84%
I had entrusted someone involved
in the UFO community to video

00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:57.620 align:middle line:90%
and audiotape all of it.

00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, he
stole all of those,

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:01.700 align:middle line:90%
and I think he was an operative.

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:04.070 align:middle line:84%
So we don't have a record
of that, unfortunately.

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:06.060 align:middle line:84%
It was all confiscated
and stolen.

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:06.860 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Yeah.

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:08.600 align:middle line:84%
I was going to
actually ask you, when

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.850 align:middle line:84%
you're doing these kind
of clandestine meetings

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:13.580 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning
stages, there's so much

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:15.800 align:middle line:84%
opening opportunity for
people to come and kind of

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:18.890 align:middle line:84%
be plants and gather
intel and find out what

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:20.340 align:middle line:90%
the heck you're doing.

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:21.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: Well, the people who
want to know what I'm doing

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:23.742 align:middle line:84%
know what I'm doing in
real time, you know?

00:18:23.742 --> 00:18:25.460 align:middle line:84%
I tell this
hilarious story early

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:29.960 align:middle line:84%
on of sitting in
my house, and there

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:32.240 align:middle line:84%
was one of these guys
whose family were

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:36.320 align:middle line:84%
some of the original founders
of the National Security Agency

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.000 align:middle line:90%
came in and he said, look.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.830 align:middle line:84%
If you want us to
know what you're doing

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:44.000 align:middle line:84%
or even the president, just
sit in your office and talk.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.440 align:middle line:90%
Or pick up the phone and talk.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.570 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter if
there's a dial tone.

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:48.890 align:middle line:90%
It was really quite funny.

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And he was literally
telling the truth.

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:53.070 align:middle line:84%
But there was a lot
to learn from them.

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:54.860 align:middle line:10%
And I learned-- I
mean, it was very hard.

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:56.740 align:middle line:84%
I have never been
in the government.

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:59.140 align:middle line:84%
Never gotten an Indian head
nickel from the government.

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:02.575 align:middle line:90%
Turned down a lot.

00:19:02.575 --> 00:19:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And I certainly didn't
understand the structure

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.570 align:middle line:84%
of these unacknowledged
special access projects

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:11.650 align:middle line:90%
until '93 or '94, that period.

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:13.577 align:middle line:84%
Nor had I been
read into, briefed

00:19:13.577 --> 00:19:15.910 align:middle line:84%
on who they were, where they
were, who was running them,

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:17.350 align:middle line:90%
why they were running them.

00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:22.340 align:middle line:84%
By '93, '94, '95, I knew
all that at that point.

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And so you know, began
providing that information

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:27.910 align:middle line:84%
to members of Congress
and world leaders

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:31.360 align:middle line:84%
other places to
get them informed

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:34.870 align:middle line:84%
on what they should have never
been lied to about, frankly.

00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:36.880 align:middle line:84%
And that meeting in
1995 was important,

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:40.300 align:middle line:84%
because it was like the
beginning nucleus of what later

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:43.420 align:middle line:84%
become the congressional
briefing that we did privately

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:48.100 align:middle line:84%
in 1997, and then the
big Disclosure Project

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:49.510 align:middle line:90%
event in 2001.

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:51.780 align:middle line:90%
But what I ran into--

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:53.580 align:middle line:90%
just like with Clinton--

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:56.010 align:middle line:90%
nobody wanted to take this on.

00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:59.490 align:middle line:84%
They were either afraid or they
were afraid of being ridiculed,

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:04.260 align:middle line:84%
or they were just afraid
of having a wetworks team--

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:07.020 align:middle line:84%
wetworks are assassination
teams at the CIA--

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:08.620 align:middle line:90%
take them out.

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:10.710 align:middle line:84%
So that was actually
the genesis of this,

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:12.450 align:middle line:84%
and it was called
Project Starlight.

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: Now, you've interviewed
a lot of high-profile people.

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:16.950 align:middle line:84%
You've had meetings with a
lot of high-profile people.

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:19.207 align:middle line:84%
They've disclosed a lot
of information to you.

00:20:19.207 --> 00:20:20.790 align:middle line:84%
How much of that do
you think is real,

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:24.240 align:middle line:84%
and how much do you think may
have been false information?

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:27.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: Well, just to be clear,
the people I've met with who

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:31.170 align:middle line:84%
are senior people in government
here and in other countries,

00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:35.860 align:middle line:84%
ministers of defense or what
have you, those were people--

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:36.840 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.450 align:middle line:84%
I would say if I'm
called in for a meeting,

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:41.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm the last stop
on the F train,

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:45.210 align:middle line:90%
because they've been sidelined.

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:50.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's separate
from the now 980-plus

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:53.280 align:middle line:84%
military intelligence
corporate witnesses

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.090 align:middle line:84%
and whistleblowers who
give me information.

00:20:56.090 --> 00:21:01.740 align:middle line:84%
So those people-- luckily,
we have a big enough database

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:04.920 align:middle line:84%
that, for example,
we had one person who

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:08.550 align:middle line:84%
was going to do one
of the presentations,

00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:12.660 align:middle line:84%
because he had been in
an aerospace company,

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:16.890 align:middle line:84%
at the 1997 briefings
for Congress.

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered
through Edgar Mitchell

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:25.960 align:middle line:90%
that this man was embellishing.

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:29.680 align:middle line:84%
And my military advisor
and Edgar Mitchell

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:31.640 align:middle line:90%
were at a bar later at night.

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:35.830 align:middle line:90%
And I busy, running all this.

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And this man started
telling what I think

00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:42.970 align:middle line:84%
were initially true
things, but then he

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:47.410 align:middle line:84%
went off telling stories
that they both knew

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:49.540 align:middle line:90%
were fact-checkably false.

00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:52.450 align:middle line:84%
So they contacted me, and
I had him escorted out

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:53.900 align:middle line:90%
of the premises.

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:56.860 align:middle line:84%
So if someone comes with
some grand story that

00:21:56.860 --> 00:22:00.040 align:middle line:84%
doesn't hold together, you know,
I'm not going to include that.

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:05.830 align:middle line:84%
Or if, in fact, they're not able
to provide their credentials.

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:09.340 align:middle line:84%
Some of the ones who've
surfaced have amazing accounts,

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:11.290 align:middle line:90%
but there's no corroboration.

00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:15.430 align:middle line:84%
So if it's an incredible story
but there are no corroborating

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:18.820 align:middle line:84%
whistleblowers, evidence,
documents, badges,

00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:21.530 align:middle line:84%
checkable things,
I don't include it.

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:24.412 align:middle line:10%
So if someone
comes forward who's

00:22:24.412 --> 00:22:26.680 align:middle line:10%
a professional
disinformation agent,

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:32.230 align:middle line:10%
but I get him to talk about the
military staging abductions,

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:34.280 align:middle line:10%
if it was only him that
had said that to me,

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:35.440 align:middle line:10%
I would have discounted it.

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:37.330 align:middle line:84%
But I have at least
a dozen people

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:40.240 align:middle line:84%
who he doesn't know who
have told me very similar--

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:42.220 align:middle line:84%
the modus operandi,
how it's done,

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:44.560 align:middle line:90%
who's done, why they do it.

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:48.235 align:middle line:84%
So that's how we build our
information nexus that way.

00:22:48.235 --> 00:22:50.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: You kind of
built your own database.

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:52.533 align:middle line:84%
And you can always fall
back on and check stories

00:22:52.533 --> 00:22:53.950 align:middle line:84%
against other
people's information

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:55.720 align:middle line:84%
as well as verifying
credentials.

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:56.560 align:middle line:90%
That's fantastic.

00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:01.570 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: Basically, our group is
its own private, whistleblower,

00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:03.700 align:middle line:84%
intelligence
gathering organization

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:06.280 align:middle line:84%
that went from a
dozen people who

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:08.380 align:middle line:84%
had been in these
programs that had

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:12.227 align:middle line:84%
top secret involvement to now
hundreds that are legitimate.

00:23:12.227 --> 00:23:13.060 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Incredible.

00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:13.390 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: Yeah.

00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:15.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: Dr. Greer, what
other outstanding information

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:17.780 align:middle line:90%
have you come across?

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:20.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: Yeah, you know,
it's so much, the archive

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:22.370 align:middle line:90%
and the meetings.

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:25.770 align:middle line:84%
You figure almost
1,000 people who

00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:27.270 align:middle line:84%
are whistleblowers
who have given me

00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:28.680 align:middle line:90%
information, documents.

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:32.410 align:middle line:10%
Early on, I had a very
interesting person approach

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:34.150 align:middle line:10%
me--

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:35.830 align:middle line:10%
and I still have the
original envelope

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:37.120 align:middle line:10%
this was sent to me in--

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:41.230 align:middle line:10%
who sent me a top secret
document, not declassified,

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:44.770 align:middle line:10%
that he got out of the vault
at the National Security Agency

00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:49.450 align:middle line:10%
that is a wiretap summary
signed by James Jesus Angleton

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:52.750 align:middle line:10%
III who was the big
mole hunter at the CIA

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:54.550 align:middle line:10%
back in the early '60s.

00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:57.850 align:middle line:10%
And then this is
dated 1962, August.

00:23:57.850 --> 00:24:03.340 align:middle line:10%
And it's a wiretap of
Marilyn Monroe threatening

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:05.680 align:middle line:10%
Bobby Kennedy, the
attorney general,

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:08.680 align:middle line:10%
and telling her friend
Rothberg, an art

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:11.170 align:middle line:10%
dealer in New York, that she
was going to hold a press

00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:14.980 align:middle line:10%
conference to tell the world
what President Kennedy had told

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:19.570 align:middle line:10%
her about the objects from
outer space recovered in New

00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:23.080 align:middle line:10%
Mexico in the 1940s, et cetera.

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And it has Project
Moondust on it.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:27.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, this has not
been declassified.

00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:29.290 align:middle line:10%
And I got it and I published it.

00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:32.560 align:middle line:10%
And you take that--
and I have hundreds

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:34.910 align:middle line:10%
and hundreds and hundreds
of documents like that.

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:38.740 align:middle line:84%
But this man had been involved
very early on, his family,

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:42.310 align:middle line:84%
in the running, founding of
the National Security Agency.

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:46.360 align:middle line:84%
Used to be called No Such
Agency Exists, because it

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.850 align:middle line:90%
was initially not acknowledged.

00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:52.360 align:middle line:10%
And it was interesting,
because when I showed--

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:55.930 align:middle line:10%
there was an old actor and
singer named Burl Ives.

00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:57.730 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people
may remember him.

00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:00.010 align:middle line:10%
And he and his wife, Dorothy,
were very supportive,

00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:01.600 align:middle line:10%
interested in what
we were doing.

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:04.270 align:middle line:10%
So he was getting elderly,
so I went to his home

00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:08.050 align:middle line:10%
and sat on the edge of his bed
and showed him this document,

00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:12.100 align:middle line:10%
because he had told me he was
friends with Marilyn Monroe

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:14.590 align:middle line:10%
when she died or was killed.

00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And they knew she
had been murdered,

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:20.950 align:middle line:84%
and it wasn't an accidental
overdose of drugs,

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:22.160 align:middle line:90%
but they never knew why.

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.880 align:middle line:84%
So I gave Burl
Ives this document.

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.410 align:middle line:90%
And he went, oh my god.

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:30.640 align:middle line:84%
This is why I said yes,
because they had wiretapped her

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:33.340 align:middle line:84%
and they were following
what she was doing.

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:34.630 align:middle line:90%
This was early '60s.

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:38.890 align:middle line:84%
I think President Kennedy
knew that that was a hit,

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:41.560 align:middle line:84%
and he was very
unhappy about it.

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:43.030 align:middle line:84%
He didn't order
it. it would have

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:47.450 align:middle line:84%
been beyond the presidential
level of activity.

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:53.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think that at that
point, it became clear to me

00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:57.190 align:middle line:84%
when I got that document that
there are a lot of people who

00:25:57.190 --> 00:26:01.120 align:middle line:84%
have vanished who were
on the process of blowing

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:04.240 align:middle line:84%
the whistle on some things
who, if they had done so,

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:09.760 align:middle line:84%
were so prominent that the
whole world would have watched.

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:13.610 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, that cost
Marilyn Monroe her life.

00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:14.410 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Wow.

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:15.250 align:middle line:90%
Incredible.

00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:16.960 align:middle line:84%
Isn't it something
that every time we

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:21.130 align:middle line:84%
have someone that is just
about to give the information,

00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:25.240 align:middle line:84%
right on the precipice, just
about to put it out there,

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:26.620 align:middle line:84%
something always
happens to them?

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:28.787 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: Well, the only
people who were cleared like

00:26:28.787 --> 00:26:31.840 align:middle line:84%
in the mainstream media
to talk about this--

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:34.270 align:middle line:84%
in big media you see
all the time right now--

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:37.480 align:middle line:84%
are people that the intelligence
community wants them on those

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:40.120 align:middle line:84%
shows because they
almost always spin

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:43.660 align:middle line:84%
this in the direction of a
national security threat,

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:46.510 align:middle line:84%
or something that the military
industrial complex can

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:47.860 align:middle line:90%
make a lot of money on.

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:50.290 align:middle line:84%
So how do you grow
that whole industry?

00:26:50.290 --> 00:26:52.930 align:middle line:84%
Instead of fighting
one little country

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:57.100 align:middle line:84%
in the Middle East against
us, move it up to space.

00:26:57.100 --> 00:27:00.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm giving a hint of
the future episodes.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.910 align:middle line:90%
That's what that's all about.

00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:05.830 align:middle line:10%
So the whole thing happening
now in the media on Disclosure

00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:10.360 align:middle line:10%
is what I called the
disclosure that serves secrecy.

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:13.187 align:middle line:10%
I wrote a paper in
1999 by that title.

00:27:13.187 --> 00:27:14.770 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: So Dr.
Greer, what is the end

00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:16.210 align:middle line:90%
result of this initiative?

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And why do you think
you had so much access

00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:22.553 align:middle line:84%
to high-level individuals in
the intelligence communities?

00:27:22.553 --> 00:27:24.220 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: Well, that
is a great question.

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:25.803 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think a
lot of it was just

00:27:25.803 --> 00:27:30.210 align:middle line:84%
networking, people who were
sympathetic to the calls

00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:31.740 align:middle line:90%
of universal peace.

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:33.600 align:middle line:10%
I mean, the motto
of our organization

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:36.060 align:middle line:10%
is one universe, one people.

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:40.290 align:middle line:10%
And we should view ourselves
as all one expression

00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:43.920 align:middle line:10%
of the great being, and that
the conscious spirit within us

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:47.310 align:middle line:10%
and extraterrestrial
people is the same.

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:48.455 align:middle line:90%
It's a singularity.

00:27:48.455 --> 00:27:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And there are a
lot of people who

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:53.580 align:middle line:84%
are very concerned, who've been
in these classified projects,

00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:56.850 align:middle line:84%
that this whole
endeavor has been taken

00:27:56.850 --> 00:27:59.550 align:middle line:84%
in a very destructive
direction, which

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:01.680 align:middle line:84%
would lead to an
extinction-level event

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:04.030 align:middle line:90%
for the Earth and humanity.

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:06.672 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that's why
they have been very supportive.

00:28:06.672 --> 00:28:08.880 align:middle line:84%
But there are other people
who really want to hold on

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:10.950 align:middle line:90%
to that threat narrative.

00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:14.700 align:middle line:84%
But the friendly people
will open a lot of doors

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:19.350 align:middle line:84%
if you're doing things credibly
and with a higher purpose.

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:21.570 align:middle line:84%
So you know, obviously,
I have a lot of enemies

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:24.010 align:middle line:84%
and I have a lot of friends
[LAUGHS] in various places.

00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:25.530 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's what happens.

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:30.013 align:middle line:84%
And then people who want senior
officials to know, they set up

00:28:30.013 --> 00:28:30.930 align:middle line:90%
those meetings for me.

00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:32.950 align:middle line:90%
I never do a cold call.

00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:35.520 align:middle line:84%
So I don't contact a member
of the Senate Intelligence

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:38.070 align:middle line:84%
Committee and say, would
you like a briefing?

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:41.200 align:middle line:84%
Their people or someone who
knows them reaches out to me.

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:43.548 align:middle line:84%
That's how the CIA
director meeting happened.

00:28:43.548 --> 00:28:45.090 align:middle line:84%
That's how the
meetings have happened

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:46.740 align:middle line:84%
with Ministers of
Defense of Canada

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:48.810 align:middle line:90%
and Great Britain and Australia.

00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:49.930 align:middle line:90%
It's just how it happens.

00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:50.730 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Yeah.

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:52.530 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Greer, thank you very
much for this interview.

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:53.335 align:middle line:90%
It was great.

00:28:53.335 --> 00:28:54.210 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: My pleasure.

00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:55.320 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: I'm Billy Carson.

00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:57.790 align:middle line:10%
Thank you for watching
"Disclosure" with Dr. Steven

00:28:57.790 --> 00:28:58.590 align:middle line:10%
Greer.

00:28:58.590 --> 00:29:02.200 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:03.000 align:middle line:90%
