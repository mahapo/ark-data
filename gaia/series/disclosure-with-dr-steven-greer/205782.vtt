is a significant force, bearing

Dr. Greer, welcome
to "Disclosure."

00:00:48.387 --> 00:00:49.470 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVEN GREER: Thank you.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:50.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm very happy to meet you.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:51.890 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Yes, same here.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.290 align:middle line:84%
Your whole journey
began in 1973 when you

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.530 align:middle line:90%
had a near-death experience.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.410 align:middle line:10%
Can you tell us about that?

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: In the spring
of 1973, I got very sick.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.380 align:middle line:84%
And I had this
experience where I

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:09.500 align:middle line:84%
left my body in a very clear
way, went out into space,

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.685 align:middle line:84%
and had sort of a contact
not with extraterrestrials.

00:01:12.685 --> 00:01:16.760 align:middle line:84%
But it was two points
of consciousness that

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.050 align:middle line:90%
were divine avatar-type beings.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.490 align:middle line:90%
And it was beautiful.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.335 align:middle line:84%
And towards the end of it in
this state of consciousness,

00:01:27.335 --> 00:01:30.560 align:middle line:84%
I was told I could
either go with them

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.640 align:middle line:90%
or come back to Earth.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.480 align:middle line:90%
And I said--

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.480 align:middle line:84%
I had the presence of mind
to say thy will be done.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.320 align:middle line:90%
What do you want me to do?

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm 17, totally
uneducated about any

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.760 align:middle line:90%
of these issues.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.925 align:middle line:84%
And they said, you
should go back.

00:01:43.925 --> 00:01:46.520 align:middle line:84%
A few months later,
I go off to college.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.050 align:middle line:84%
And in 1973 in October,
I'm up in the mountains

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.360 align:middle line:90%
of North Carolina, meditating.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.850 align:middle line:90%
And just before sunset--

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.990 align:middle line:90%
and I'm up at 5,000 feet.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.270 align:middle line:90%
And I see this--

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.240 align:middle line:84%
right before I
sit to meditate, I

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.280 align:middle line:84%
look over towards the
southwest, and there's

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.310 align:middle line:90%
a seamless metallic disk.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same disk I had
seen when I was eight or nine.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.100 align:middle line:84%
I'd seen one of
these ET craft when

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.290 align:middle line:84%
I was a very young boy
with my twin sister

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.540 align:middle line:84%
and some other people in my
neighborhood in Charlotte,

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.490 align:middle line:90%
North Carolina.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:20.750 align:middle line:90%
I went oh, they're back.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.800 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think
anything more about it.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.370 align:middle line:84%
And I sit to
meditate, and I have

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.260 align:middle line:84%
this profound, deep meditation
that lasted a very long time.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.720 align:middle line:84%
Because by the time I ended
it, it was pitch black

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.450 align:middle line:84%
and the Milky Way
was above my head.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:36.920 align:middle line:90%
Gorgeous.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.970 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
it, I stood up.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.830 align:middle line:90%
And a beautiful thought--

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.950 align:middle line:84%
it felt like it was
telepathically sent to me--

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.290 align:middle line:84%
and it would sound
strange said, behold

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.250 align:middle line:84%
what a beautiful
universe God has made.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And with that, I went
right back into that state

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.380 align:middle line:84%
that I was in when I had died
six months earlier in March

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.640 align:middle line:90%
of '73.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.830 align:middle line:90%
And I was just standing there.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.960 align:middle line:84%
And below the crest of this
mountain, there was a glow.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And I went, oh, I don't
know what that is.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And then I was aware that
there was this being.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.580 align:middle line:84%
But I thought it was a deer
standing up on its legs.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.150 align:middle line:10%
And it was an ET.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.410 align:middle line:10%
Beautiful almond eyes.

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:25.940 align:middle line:10%
And came over and
touched my jacket.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.470 align:middle line:90%
And I had a ski jacket on.

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.180 align:middle line:90%
It was very cold.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.970 align:middle line:84%
Touched me on my right
shoulder, physically.

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And it was 3D and sort
of fully materialized.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.810 align:middle line:90%
Dematerialized, rematerialized.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.050 align:middle line:84%
Very similar to what Colonel
Corso had happen at White Sands

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.000 align:middle line:90%
back in the '50s.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.870 align:middle line:90%
And touched me.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.420 align:middle line:90%
And with that, I vanished.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.690 align:middle line:90%
And I was on a craft for about--

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.960 align:middle line:84%
I found out later about
three or four hours.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And it was during
that experience

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.670 align:middle line:84%
that we experimented with
and created the CE5 Contact

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.370 align:middle line:84%
protocols, although I
didn't call it that then.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.580 align:middle line:84%
And it was using consciousness
and remote viewing

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.030 align:middle line:84%
and what I call coherent thought
sequencing where you guide them

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.630 align:middle line:84%
in to where you're located
with a laser-like intent, heart

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.670 align:middle line:90%
and mind together.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.079 align:middle line:90%
We'll get into this.

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And that is really how the CE5
Contact protocols got started.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.830 align:middle line:90%
And it was fascinating.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And that really began
my whole experience

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.680 align:middle line:84%
within six months of
near-death experience,

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.130 align:middle line:84%
exploring consciousness,
and then from there

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.630 align:middle line:84%
sort of creating the CE5
Contact protocols where

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.080 align:middle line:84%
humans make contact with
these civilizations directly.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.920 align:middle line:84%
And it was all because of this
sort of amazing consciousness

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.697 align:middle line:90%
exploration that happened.

00:04:51.697 --> 00:04:53.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: Can you
describe these beings

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.343 align:middle line:90%
and exactly what you learned?

00:04:55.343 --> 00:04:56.760 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: Well, it
was interesting,

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:02.130 align:middle line:84%
because everyone has all these
caricatures of these beings.

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.890 align:middle line:84%
They don't seem to fit
any of the caricatures.

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.410 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, there were
different types of beings.

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:12.460 align:middle line:84%
So there were one group that
were maybe 39 inches tall.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.310 align:middle line:90%
I mean, very, like--

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.860 align:middle line:90%
less than four feet.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.480 align:middle line:90%
A little over three feet.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.180 align:middle line:90%
No hair.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:26.250 align:middle line:84%
The other ones were very
tall and sort of luminous.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.600 align:middle line:84%
There was a group that had
very triangular kind of heads

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.310 align:middle line:90%
like a praying mantis.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:33.810 align:middle line:84%
Later I found out
that these were

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.590 align:middle line:84%
master healers in the cosmos
from a planet where they're

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.060 align:middle line:90%
very renowned for healing.

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.060 align:middle line:84%
They have specializations
of capabilities,

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.350 align:middle line:90%
but very much work together.

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.870 align:middle line:84%
It's very much opposite of what
the UFO lore is in mythology.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.440 align:middle line:84%
But most of the
experience was not linear.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.900 align:middle line:84%
It was-- you sort of
dematerialized out in space.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And what was interesting, as
we were sitting in this craft,

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.980 align:middle line:84%
you think, well, there are
walls like in this building.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:03.780 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.400 align:middle line:84%
You're looking as
if you're floating

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.290 align:middle line:90%
in a bubble that's translucent.

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: In some
kind of force field?

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.110 align:middle line:10%
>>GREER: I think it has to do
with extremely advanced fiber

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.420 align:middle line:10%
optic-type systems in
the shell of the craft.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.690 align:middle line:84%
So you can be out there
and it looks exactly

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.340 align:middle line:84%
like you're just
floating freely.

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:22.140 align:middle line:90%
But you're not.

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.940 align:middle line:84%
You're actually in a structure,
an environmentally controlled

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:25.740 align:middle line:90%
structure.

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:26.620 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: That's incredible.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:27.660 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: Yeah.

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.700 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time, to
be honest with you,

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.780 align:middle line:84%
was spent me
teaching them what it

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.680 align:middle line:84%
was like for a boy, a young
man of 18 to experience

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.740 align:middle line:84%
cosmic consciousness on
Earth and how that could

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.800 align:middle line:84%
be used, these states
of consciousness,

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.500 align:middle line:90%
to communicate in the future.

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And I knew it would be
something for the future,

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.290 align:middle line:90%
but at that time I didn't know.

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:53.250 align:middle line:84%
You know, I had no real sense
of the timeline of when I

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:54.792 align:middle line:90%
would start the projects that--

00:06:54.792 --> 00:06:56.250 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: So with
these beings, this

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:59.740 align:middle line:84%
was more like an exploratory
consciousness experiment.

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.020 align:middle line:90%
Would you say that?

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:05.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: We were co-creating
these protocols for future use

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.160 align:middle line:90%
very specifically.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.615 align:middle line:90%
I knew it was for future use.

00:07:07.615 --> 00:07:09.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: Can you describe the
process of the co-creation?

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.790 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: Yeah.

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:15.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and the co-creation
part was me meditating

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.390 align:middle line:84%
and them seeing me
meditate and experiencing

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:21.660 align:middle line:84%
that near-death-type
level of clarity

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:26.130 align:middle line:84%
in samadhi consciousness,
cosmic consciousness.

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:31.390 align:middle line:84%
And then how that could be
used to actuate remote viewing,

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:32.190 align:middle line:90%
it's called now.

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:35.070 align:middle line:84%
But seeing distant
places, seeing future,

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:39.805 align:middle line:84%
but also then connecting to the
ET systems and guiding them in.

00:07:39.805 --> 00:07:41.430 align:middle line:84%
Then what I learned
is that they have--

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:42.870 align:middle line:90%
and we'll get into this more--

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:45.330 align:middle line:84%
they have technologies
that interface

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:49.380 align:middle line:84%
with the consciousness
field and directed thought.

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:54.150 align:middle line:84%
Not random thought, what
I call coherent thought,

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:58.350 align:middle line:84%
as clearly as we pick up a radio
frequency from our cell phone

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:00.040 align:middle line:90%
or TV station.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:04.560 align:middle line:84%
So those civilizations that are
interstellar, they have to--

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.600 align:middle line:84%
by going faster than
the speed of light,

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:10.600 align:middle line:84%
they've had to explore
trans-dimensional physics,

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:15.930 align:middle line:84%
including faster than speed
of light communications, which

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:18.403 align:middle line:90%
exist, and classified projects.

00:08:18.403 --> 00:08:19.320 align:middle line:90%
We've worked on these.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:23.190 align:middle line:84%
But those civilizations
have perfected it

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:26.940 align:middle line:84%
to a level of really
profound accuracy.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And so this is something
that I experienced.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:30.880 align:middle line:90%
I didn't understand it.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:35.909 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously, it's
taken me 40-some years

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:38.070 align:middle line:90%
to sort of unpack that.

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:40.110 align:middle line:84%
Because intellectually,
I didn't understand it.

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:42.659 align:middle line:84%
Experientially, it
was very simple.

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:44.790 align:middle line:84%
You connect to the
fact that you're awake.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:46.890 align:middle line:84%
You connect to that
aspect of consciousness

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:51.240 align:middle line:84%
that is this field consciousness
that's unbounded, infinite.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.250 align:middle line:84%
You then can see any
point in space time.

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:57.450 align:middle line:84%
And then when you connect
with an ET craft or person,

00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:00.600 align:middle line:84%
you then zoom in and
show them where you are.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.490 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:04.650 align:middle line:90%
It's very simple.

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:09.210 align:middle line:84%
But also, it was under this
sort of ethical premise

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:12.360 align:middle line:84%
of universality that
we're all one being.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And I realize that,
well, they're strange

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.100 align:middle line:90%
and they're different from me.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.710 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we still have racism
on this planet and everything

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:20.510 align:middle line:90%
else.

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:23.760 align:middle line:84%
But from their point
of consciousness,

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.650 align:middle line:84%
it's like, what's the
color of consciousness?

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:27.900 align:middle line:84%
What's the gender
of consciousness?

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.600 align:middle line:84%
What's the ethnicity
of consciousness,

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:34.950 align:middle line:84%
of that basic universal
field of consciousness?

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:36.878 align:middle line:90%
Well, it doesn't have a color.

00:09:36.878 --> 00:09:37.920 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have a gender.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.680 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't even have a planet.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.210 align:middle line:90%
It's not even humanism.

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:43.920 align:middle line:90%
It's universal.

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And so that I
realized was something

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.360 align:middle line:84%
that these
civilizations absolutely

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:52.920 align:middle line:84%
understood, not only from the
point of view of their paradigm

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.410 align:middle line:84%
but from their
operating systems.

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:59.760 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, this
continued where

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.850 align:middle line:84%
I was up in the
mountains, North Carolina.

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And before I'd go
to bed, I would

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:09.180 align:middle line:84%
do these protocols to see--
well, maybe see if this works.

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.130 align:middle line:84%
Every single night
the rangers and police

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:14.400 align:middle line:84%
would report UFOs
all over the area.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.890 align:middle line:84%
And I finally realized
I shouldn't do this

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:19.560 align:middle line:84%
without having some
purpose, so I stopped.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.960 align:middle line:84%
It kind of freaked me out,
to be honest with you.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.510 align:middle line:84%
So after that, I
decide, you know,

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:29.740 align:middle line:84%
I really want to become
an expert on meditation.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:33.720 align:middle line:84%
So I went to become a meditation
teacher, the old Maharishi

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.310 align:middle line:90%
International University.

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:39.240 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly,
during that period

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:42.570 align:middle line:84%
of learning to become a
teacher of meditation,

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:45.090 align:middle line:90%
we went over to Isola, France.

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:47.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's up in the
Maritime Alps up above

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.100 align:middle line:90%
Nice near the Italian border.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And that was the last phase of
becoming a meditation teacher.

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:57.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is now
the summer of 1975.

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And one morning, I
said, you know what?

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:03.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to break out
of my meditation routine

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:06.360 align:middle line:84%
that they had us on and I'm
going to do the CE5 Protocols.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.860 align:middle line:90%
And it was before lunch.

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.220 align:middle line:90%
So I sit and I do the--

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:10.950 align:middle line:90%
I go in the meditation.

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:13.530 align:middle line:90%
I go deep into meditation.

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:18.090 align:middle line:84%
I allowed my conscious
mind to expand universally.

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:23.430 align:middle line:84%
I then scan for ET
craft or civilizations,

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:25.030 align:middle line:90%
and I get a sense of one.

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:29.050 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't-- and I just
said, oh, well, I'm here.

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:30.210 align:middle line:90%
My name is Steve.

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:32.440 align:middle line:84%
I very childishly
said, my name's Steve.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.040 align:middle line:90%
You don't remember me.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And then I show
them where we are.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:36.700 align:middle line:90%
So I show them--

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:40.720 align:middle line:84%
I vector them in, like you'd
vector in a jet to JFK Airport.

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:44.350 align:middle line:84%
I vector them in with
my thought very clearly

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:48.070 align:middle line:84%
to that mountain and
that hotel complex

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:51.010 align:middle line:90%
up in the French Maritime Alps.

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:56.170 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, this
beautiful, seamless, metallic,

00:11:56.170 --> 00:12:01.210 align:middle line:84%
silvery tetrahedron materializes
in a blue alpine sky,

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:03.380 align:middle line:90%
probably 1:00 in the afternoon.

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:07.360 align:middle line:84%
And this was the first mass
witnessed CE5, close encounter

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.870 align:middle line:84%
of the fifth kind, which is
when humans initiate the contact

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:11.920 align:middle line:90%
and make contact.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And there were a whole
bunch of people from France

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.200 align:middle line:84%
who were on the course who
were up ahead of us, pointing.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.720 align:middle line:84%
So this was a mass
witness daytime.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:23.920 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, I think what
happened, people were--

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.230 align:middle line:90%
this was big, and it was close.

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And I think once people
began to be afraid,

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:33.310 align:middle line:84%
they pick up on that
fear and they back off.

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:38.170 align:middle line:84%
Contrary to the human
hoaxed contact events,

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:41.800 align:middle line:84%
what UFO people call abductions
and mutilations, all that,

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.710 align:middle line:84%
the actual ET events, if
they sense you're afraid,

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:46.320 align:middle line:90%
they just back off.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.120 align:middle line:90%
And they did.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.970 align:middle line:84%
So they backed off and then
dematerialized in a blue sky.

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:50.770 align:middle line:90%
Didn't fly off.

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.420 align:middle line:90%
It just vanished.

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:54.280 align:middle line:90%
So that was in 1975.

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And that was the first
mass-witnessed event.

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:01.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I realized,
you can do this for people.

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:03.790 align:middle line:90%
You can do this with a group.

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And it dawned on me then that's
something that at some point

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:12.190 align:middle line:84%
we should do as a
civilization on Earth.

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:14.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: What more can you
tell us about the structure?

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.570 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: Just one key
thing about the structure,

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:19.630 align:middle line:84%
and this is how you determine
an extraterrestrial vehicle

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:21.940 align:middle line:84%
from the ones that are
the anti-gravity vehicles

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:24.460 align:middle line:84%
from Lockheed Skunk
Works and Northrop,

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:27.130 align:middle line:84%
is that they're
completely seamless.

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:31.780 align:middle line:84%
They have this extraordinary
energy about it.

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:34.570 align:middle line:84%
And the consciousness
of the occupants

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:37.360 align:middle line:90%
is transmitted in the structure.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's like AI at
the level of seamless

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:43.690 align:middle line:84%
interface between the
consciousness of the pilot

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:46.180 align:middle line:84%
or whoever's commanding
it and that structure.

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:47.180 align:middle line:90%
And you can feel it.

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:50.645 align:middle line:84%
You could feel that this was--
the structure itself was awake.

00:13:50.645 --> 00:13:51.520 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Interesting.

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:52.320 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: Yeah.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: As you continued to
test your contact protocols,

00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:58.180 align:middle line:84%
there was an event
with UAPs at the FAA.

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:00.080 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell us about that?

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.130 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: Yes.

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:03.770 align:middle line:84%
And actually, in the
intelligence community,

00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:07.010 align:middle line:84%
they call them ETVs,
Extraterrestrial Vehicles,

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:13.275 align:middle line:84%
or ARVs, Alien Reproduction
Vehicles or Electrogravitics.

00:14:13.275 --> 00:14:14.930 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: I've heard
ARVs quite a bit.

00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:15.730 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: Yep.

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:19.190 align:middle line:84%
So the UAP term was
invented recently

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:22.530 align:middle line:84%
as a way of obfuscating
and hiding the truth.

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:25.640 align:middle line:90%
Remember, words are important.

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:27.860 align:middle line:84%
So that's my editorial
comment on the question.

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:28.660 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: [LAUGHS]

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:33.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: But going
further, two years later,

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:38.660 align:middle line:84%
a couple years later, this
event happened where, again,

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:40.295 align:middle line:84%
there was a part
of me that says--

00:14:40.295 --> 00:14:41.420 align:middle line:90%
you want to pinch yourself.

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:42.220 align:middle line:90%
Is this true?

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:43.190 align:middle line:90%
Can this really happen?

00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:43.520 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Yeah.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:43.940 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: You know?

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:49.490 align:middle line:84%
So I was back in North Carolina,
and I was up near Blowing Rock

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:51.860 align:middle line:84%
out in the Blue Ridge, off
the Blue Ridge Parkway.

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And I had a
housemate, and we had

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.600 align:middle line:84%
this little two-bedroom
place on the lower

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.060 align:middle line:84%
level of a house overlooking
Grandfather Mountain.

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:02.930 align:middle line:84%
It's a 6,000-foot mountain
out in the Blue Ridge.

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And I suddenly realized, you
know, I want to try this.

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:07.490 align:middle line:90%
It just came to me.

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:10.705 align:middle line:90%
So I go into quiet meditation.

00:15:10.705 --> 00:15:12.080 align:middle line:84%
Again, I'm doing
this before I go

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:16.595 align:middle line:84%
to bed, which be careful
what you do right

00:15:16.595 --> 00:15:17.947 align:middle line:90%
before you go to bed.

00:15:17.947 --> 00:15:19.280 align:middle line:90%
A lot of cool things can happen.

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.440 align:middle line:90%
You've got to be ready for it.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And so I go into
this deep meditation,

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:28.820 align:middle line:84%
and I asked the ETs to
come and visit where I am.

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:32.810 align:middle line:84%
And again, I expand my
awareness, go into this state

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:33.890 align:middle line:90%
where I can sense--

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:35.150 align:middle line:90%
see where they are.

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:37.040 align:middle line:90%
I introduce myself.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.310 align:middle line:84%
And in a spirit of
peaceful contact,

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:43.340 align:middle line:84%
invite them to come to
where I'm located there.

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:46.970 align:middle line:84%
But kind of being, I guess,
in a sense looking back

00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:50.220 align:middle line:84%
on it, rather childish
about it, I said, well,

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:54.050 align:middle line:84%
if you don't remember who I
am, I was born and grew up

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:54.950 align:middle line:90%
in Charlotte.

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:58.130 align:middle line:84%
So I show them and guide
them to the city of Charlotte

00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:00.050 align:middle line:84%
and the part of
town I grew up in.

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:02.990 align:middle line:84%
And then from there, guide them
up to the Blue Ridge Mountains,

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:04.550 align:middle line:90%
northwest.

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:08.360 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, it
turns out, I go to sleep.

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:09.530 align:middle line:90%
I wake up.

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And there's this
kind of blue craft,

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:17.690 align:middle line:84%
maybe 20 feet outside the
window with this energy,

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:19.400 align:middle line:90%
this beam of energy coming in.

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:25.700 align:middle line:84%
And inside my room was an
ET, but not materialized.

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:29.780 align:middle line:84%
I could sense it, its
intelligence, and it was there.

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:33.380 align:middle line:10%
Now my roommate at this
point who's in a bedroom

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:37.880 align:middle line:10%
next door wakes up and sees this
craft right outside the window,

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:42.470 align:middle line:10%
and can feel the consciousness
of this ET in the house.

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:45.388 align:middle line:84%
So he comes running
out and runs in.

00:16:45.388 --> 00:16:46.430 align:middle line:90%
He says, what did you do?

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And he's like-- but he was
very upset in a sense about it,

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:52.590 align:middle line:84%
because I hadn't warned
him I was going to do this.

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, this
ET, which was sort of--

00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:58.220 align:middle line:90%
almost like a hologram.

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:01.310 align:middle line:84%
You could sense it, but it
wasn't fully materialized yet,

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:05.060 align:middle line:84%
because they can go in and
out of dimensions, varnished.

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:08.480 align:middle line:84%
The craft then moved around
to the front of the house.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:10.520 align:middle line:84%
So we run out into
the living room.

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:12.440 align:middle line:90%
There's a big picture window.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.960 align:middle line:84%
It was nighttime, but
off in that direction

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.460 align:middle line:90%
is Grandfather Mountain.

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:21.079 align:middle line:84%
And it goes in front of the
picture window, and it goes--

00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:21.890 align:middle line:90%
[SWISH]

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:24.230 align:middle line:84%
Makes an arc and
goes out, and kind of

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:26.270 align:middle line:84%
makes a loop over
Grandfather Mountain.

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:27.150 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:27.950 align:middle line:90%
And vanished.

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:29.420 align:middle line:90%
I said, oh, wow.

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:33.080 align:middle line:84%
They're still able to do this,
or I'm still able to do this.

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:34.330 align:middle line:90%
So I wasn't sure.

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:36.470 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're always
doubting you can do things

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:40.295 align:middle line:84%
that you can do until it kind
of becomes really determined.

00:17:40.295 --> 00:17:42.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, I later find
out-- the next day,

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:45.530 align:middle line:84%
it's all in the papers that
that craft that I had sort

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:47.340 align:middle line:90%
of vectored over Charlotte--

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:48.140 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Sightings?

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:48.940 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:52.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: --was chased by the
police helicopter, the Snoopy

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.220 align:middle line:84%
helicopter they called
it for the police.

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:59.300 align:middle line:84%
It was on radar at the Charlotte
Douglas International Airport.

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:02.546 align:middle line:84%
Back then, Eastern
Airlines pilots saw it.

00:18:02.546 --> 00:18:04.320 align:middle line:10%
>> Ah, Snoopy 2,
you know something?

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.250 align:middle line:10%
I'm not seeing the
target right now.

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:08.050 align:middle line:10%
>> Negative, Roger.

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:09.780 align:middle line:10%
We got something out
here flying around.

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:11.197 align:middle line:10%
I don't believe
in flying saucers,

00:18:11.197 --> 00:18:12.310 align:middle line:10%
but it ain't an aircraft.

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:13.310 align:middle line:10%
I don't know what it is.

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:15.440 align:middle line:10%
>> Sounds like a
close encounter.

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.370 align:middle line:10%
>> Snoopy 2, Roger.

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:20.860 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: And I had someone
inside the FAA take that tape,

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:22.320 align:middle line:90%
and I have it.

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:24.240 align:middle line:84%
Actually, part of it
is in "Close Encounters

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.410 align:middle line:90%
of the Fifth Kind."

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
ET's way of saying,

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:33.360 align:middle line:84%
you can be very specific
in what your guidance is

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.730 align:middle line:84%
in the stream of
coherent thought,

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:37.620 align:middle line:84%
the sequencing of
coherent thought,

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:39.780 align:middle line:84%
which is what I call
it, to guide them.

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:42.240 align:middle line:84%
Because they were saying,
yeah, we picked up on the fact

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.610 align:middle line:84%
that you said go here
and then come here.

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And they went there and then
came up to the mountains.

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And I went-- that was a
really teaching moment.

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:51.720 align:middle line:84%
I share these things
because they're

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:55.440 align:middle line:84%
teachable moments
of the specificity

00:18:55.440 --> 00:19:00.150 align:middle line:84%
that these civilizations have
to follow specific information.

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:01.715 align:middle line:84%
And it's quite
magical and beautiful.

00:19:01.715 --> 00:19:03.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: Yeah,
that's incredible.

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:05.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're literally
picking up your consciousness

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:09.462 align:middle line:84%
and taking direct communication
or instructions from that,

00:19:09.462 --> 00:19:10.920 align:middle line:84%
and then following
through with it.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:11.720 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: Yes.

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:12.660 align:middle line:90%
If you're clear.

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're
scattered, whatever.

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:18.000 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is I found
out they're not interested--

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.280 align:middle line:84%
as soon as someone
becomes afraid

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:22.800 align:middle line:84%
or if they have
prejudices, if they've

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:26.460 align:middle line:84%
studied the UFO subject, which
is filled with mythologies

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:30.150 align:middle line:84%
of horrible, negative
information that's all false--

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:32.400 align:middle line:84%
they aren't interested,
because they're not

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.430 align:middle line:84%
interested in what
I call exoracism,

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:37.890 align:middle line:84%
this sort of
extrapolation of bigotry

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:39.900 align:middle line:90%
to different species in space.

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:42.150 align:middle line:84%
So they're only really
interested in people who have--

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:45.345 align:middle line:84%
who are pure-hearted about
it and not prejudiced.

00:19:45.345 --> 00:19:46.470 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: That's incredible.

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:47.450 align:middle line:90%
That's fantastic, actually.

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:47.700 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: Yeah.

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:48.510 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Yeah.

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:50.310 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people seem
to have pure hearts

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:52.260 align:middle line:84%
and great intentions,
and they can't

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.182 align:middle line:90%
seem to manifest these UFOs.

00:19:54.182 --> 00:19:55.890 align:middle line:84%
How do you think that
you were able to do

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:57.600 align:middle line:90%
this at a very young age?

00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: I think
everyone can do this.

00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
key here is, do you

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:06.330 align:middle line:84%
have a higher purpose besides
your own entertainment

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:07.870 align:middle line:90%
to have a contact experience?

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:10.140 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they're
interested in interfacing

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:12.780 align:middle line:84%
with humans who are
ready to help build

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:16.290 align:middle line:84%
a bridge between
Earth and humanity

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:19.050 align:middle line:84%
and these civilizations
as we go forward

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:23.410 align:middle line:84%
into a cosmic civilization
and join the cosmic cultures.

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:27.780 align:middle line:84%
So if that's your prevailing
motivation and intent,

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:29.050 align:middle line:90%
then that's different.

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:32.550 align:middle line:84%
The other thing, there are a
lot of exigencies and conditions

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:35.730 align:middle line:84%
that can affect whether
an object appears in 3D,

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:37.590 align:middle line:90%
or maybe it's in 6D.

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:40.440 align:middle line:84%
For example, we've
had experiences

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:44.040 align:middle line:84%
where nothing is in this
dimension that you can see,

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.470 align:middle line:84%
but our electronics
will start communicating

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:50.070 align:middle line:84%
in a language that's a
trans-dimensional electronic

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:54.690 align:middle line:84%
situation, because there are
aircraft that are military,

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:58.200 align:middle line:84%
ready to pounce on
these craft and hit them

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:00.990 align:middle line:84%
with an electronic-directed
energy weapon.

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:03.790 align:middle line:84%
So I think that there
are a lot of conditions.

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:05.710 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that it's
unique to me at all.

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:09.090 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we did an
ethnography looking back

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:12.330 align:middle line:84%
and found that there were many,
many people who had done--

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:15.270 align:middle line:84%
had close encounters of the
fifth kind-types experiences.

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And in ancient cultures, whether
it was drumming or chanting,

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:24.270 align:middle line:84%
they would get into a state
of coherence as a group

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:27.700 align:middle line:84%
and have a contact
experience to star people.

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:29.880 align:middle line:84%
So in reality, I don't
think this is new.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:34.680 align:middle line:84%
I've simply sort of
articulated and formulated

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:37.770 align:middle line:84%
a series of protocols so
people can have something

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:38.850 align:middle line:90%
to start with.

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And I say whatever I put out,
honestly, it's to start with,

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:43.750 align:middle line:90%
and then you make it your own.

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:46.408 align:middle line:90%
I'm not at all attached to--

00:21:46.408 --> 00:21:47.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: This is like a guide--

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:50.655 align:middle line:84%
like a guide plan with
parameters for you to go, OK.

00:21:50.655 --> 00:21:53.130 align:middle line:84%
These are the fundamentals
that we need to operate under

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:55.030 align:middle line:90%
to be able to actually do this.

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:55.830 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: Yeah.

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, you
know, I tell people,

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:00.870 align:middle line:84%
this state of unbounded,
pure consciousness

00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:03.270 align:middle line:90%
is the hub of the wheel of life.

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:05.880 align:middle line:90%
The silent, unbounded, peaceful.

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:08.550 align:middle line:84%
And if there are eight
billion people on this planet,

00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:11.370 align:middle line:84%
there are eight billion
spokes into that hub,

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:12.570 align:middle line:90%
and each one's unique.

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And so whatever
tradition you follow,

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:17.700 align:middle line:84%
you adapt it to
yourself, because you're

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:19.470 align:middle line:90%
a unique, resonant being.

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:22.173 align:middle line:84%
There are no two beings
in the cosmos identical.

00:22:22.173 --> 00:22:23.340 align:middle line:90%
And so you make it your own.

00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:26.850 align:middle line:84%
But the protocols, the
CE5 Contact protocols

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:28.860 align:middle line:84%
have been developed
to be very universal.

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:29.670 align:middle line:90%
Anyone can do it.

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:33.080 align:middle line:84%
If you believe in yourself
and believe it's possible,

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:34.080 align:middle line:90%
you'll be able to do it.

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.420 align:middle line:84%
And if you think about
everything we've accomplished

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:38.400 align:middle line:90%
in our lives, it's like that.

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.170 align:middle line:84%
As a medical doctor,
if I really thought

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:42.540 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't put that
chest tube in in a trauma

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:44.940 align:middle line:90%
case or whatever, I'd glitch.

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:46.770 align:middle line:84%
So you have to
believe you can do it.

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:48.940 align:middle line:84%
You have to believe
it's possible.

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:52.860 align:middle line:84%
And once you affirm to
yourself in positive thinking

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:54.307 align:middle line:84%
that you can do
it, you can do it.

00:22:54.307 --> 00:22:55.140 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Absolutely.

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:55.940 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: Yeah.

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:57.870 align:middle line:84%
But this is where we're
going to get into.

00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:00.000 align:middle line:84%
In this course
we're doing on Gaia,

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.460 align:middle line:84%
I really am going to do
a deep dive also into,

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:06.030 align:middle line:84%
what are the different
phenomena that have--

00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:07.260 align:middle line:90%
how does this appear?

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:10.440 align:middle line:84%
What are the manifestations of
these advanced civilizations?

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:13.230 align:middle line:84%
Because they don't have
to be fully materialized.

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:14.910 align:middle line:90%
They may be partially.

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:19.072 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's very unusual,
the kinds of things that happen,

00:23:19.072 --> 00:23:21.030 align:middle line:84%
because everyone's
expecting something like out

00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:22.500 align:middle line:90%
of a science fiction movie.

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:27.060 align:middle line:84%
But actual contact is much
more beautiful in a way,

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:27.990 align:middle line:90%
but nuanced.

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And you have to understand what
I call the new cosmology where

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:35.580 align:middle line:84%
we bring not only
the cosmos together,

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:39.180 align:middle line:84%
but understanding consciousness,
the worlds of light,

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:43.860 align:middle line:84%
the astral worlds, the interface
between those dimensions

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:47.640 align:middle line:84%
and the material 3D cosmos,
and how an interstellar

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:53.730 align:middle line:84%
civilization is phasing
in the gap between 3D

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:55.680 align:middle line:90%
and conscious fields.

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:56.530 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

00:23:56.530 --> 00:23:59.310 align:middle line:84%
So there is a big
science to learn here.

00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
everyone kind of

00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:06.570 align:middle line:84%
wants to use this as sort
of caricatures of things

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:07.800 align:middle line:90%
that happen in contact.

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:10.890 align:middle line:10%
And the actual experience,
having done this now

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:17.430 align:middle line:10%
for a long time, 47 years
or something, 48, and also

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:20.220 align:middle line:10%
for the last 30 years
I've led contact teams

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:24.450 align:middle line:10%
all over the world, and
thousands and thousands

00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:28.935 align:middle line:10%
of people with thousands
of interactions.

00:24:28.935 --> 00:24:33.390 align:middle line:10%
It's the sort of diversity
of experience that happens.

00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:35.760 align:middle line:10%
It's the full spectrum.

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:41.430 align:middle line:10%
From full 3D, ET
physical beings near us,

00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:43.560 align:middle line:10%
ones that are not
quite in this dimension

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:47.340 align:middle line:10%
but come around the circle
and touch you on the shoulder.

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:48.930 align:middle line:90%
All kinds of phenomenon.

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:50.555 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: Do you think
that some of them

00:24:50.555 --> 00:24:52.170 align:middle line:84%
can even go into
the multi-spectrum?

00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:55.500 align:middle line:84%
Like ultraviolet or gamma
ray frequencies where

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:57.620 align:middle line:90%
the human eyes just can't see?

00:24:57.620 --> 00:24:58.620 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: Great question.

00:24:58.620 --> 00:24:59.430 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:03.480 align:middle line:10%
And this is why the new
cameras with the CCD, you know,

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:09.360 align:middle line:10%
the light-gathering cells, will
pick up an object or a being

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:11.220 align:middle line:10%
that our eyes can't see.

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:14.100 align:middle line:10%
Our eyes see a very
narrow range of energy.

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:15.840 align:middle line:10%
And everything's energy, right?

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:19.110 align:middle line:10%
And beyond that, everything
is consciousness.

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:23.480 align:middle line:10%
All this is that, as it
says in the Bhagavad Gita.

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:26.370 align:middle line:10%
So you know, I think that
people have to understand that.

00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:29.100 align:middle line:84%
Civilizations that
understand that

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:33.690 align:middle line:84%
understand the plasticity, the
moldability of space, time,

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:36.190 align:middle line:90%
matter, et cetera.

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:37.740 align:middle line:90%
So they can be--

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:40.860 align:middle line:84%
these civilizations, all of
them, if they're interstellar,

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:43.620 align:middle line:84%
they all have this
fundamental capability.

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:45.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are
some civilizations

00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:48.540 align:middle line:84%
that are at the level
of where humanity will

00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:51.840 align:middle line:84%
be in 500,000 years, where
everyone on the planet

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:55.230 align:middle line:84%
is in god consciousness,
and their technologies

00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:56.340 align:middle line:90%
reflect that.

00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:59.760 align:middle line:84%
Literally, their
technologies and their craft

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:03.300 align:middle line:84%
are themselves emanating
from that celestial level,

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:06.060 align:middle line:84%
even though they're
from a 3D planet.

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:08.490 align:middle line:84%
But that's really where we're
headed as a civilization.

00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:10.480 align:middle line:84%
It's a beautiful time
to be on this planet.

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:11.280 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Beautiful.

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:11.790 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:12.790 align:middle line:90%
Very beautiful.

00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:15.570 align:middle line:84%
So Dr. Greer, do you feel
that your initial contact

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:17.580 align:middle line:90%
experiences were agenda-driven?

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And do you think that you're
fulfilling that agenda today?

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: You know, I don't
like self-referencing.

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:26.890 align:middle line:90%
Everyone has a role to play.

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:28.870 align:middle line:84%
Why this happened
to me I think might

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:32.980 align:middle line:84%
have been because when I had
the near-death experience,

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:34.930 align:middle line:84%
I had such great
love for the cosmos

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:37.000 align:middle line:90%
that that's where I went.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can argue
how all this--

00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:44.500 align:middle line:84%
this gets into the question of
free will and choice or fate

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:46.480 align:middle line:90%
and pre-determinism.

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.500 align:middle line:84%
I think everyone
has a role to play.

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think that it doesn't
matter if it's a gallon

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:52.270 align:middle line:90%
measure or a thimbleful.

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:56.320 align:middle line:84%
If we all did what
our capacity allowed,

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.690 align:middle line:84%
the world would be
transformed in a fortnight,

00:26:58.690 --> 00:27:01.160 align:middle line:90%
honestly, in a couple weeks.

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:06.220 align:middle line:84%
So I think that is there
sort of a larger agenda that

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:10.570 align:middle line:84%
is part of an, as I see
it, a divine plan that

00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:14.380 align:middle line:84%
involves Earth, these other
civilizations, and the future?

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:15.580 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:16.720 align:middle line:90%
Are all of us part of it?

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:17.560 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:19.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: But it also seems
like you put a lot of action

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:21.820 align:middle line:84%
behind your conscious thought,
whereas a lot of people

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:23.770 align:middle line:84%
will get the thought,
download it, but put

00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:24.743 align:middle line:90%
no action behind it.

00:27:24.743 --> 00:27:26.035 align:middle line:90%
And that could be another key--

00:27:26.035 --> 00:27:27.190 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: So key.

00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:28.570 align:middle line:90%
What you just said is so key.

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:30.580 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has this
ability and everyone

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:34.040 align:middle line:84%
has a thought to do something,
or even an intuition.

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:35.590 align:middle line:84%
But they don't take
that next step.

00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And it takes some faith
or belief in yourself

00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:42.080 align:middle line:84%
to then go from there to
taking an active step.

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:42.880 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Exactly.

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: And that's
why when we started

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:48.940 align:middle line:84%
this whole global movement 30
years ago for close encounters

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:53.050 align:middle line:84%
of the fifth kind, the
whole CE5 Contact protocols,

00:27:53.050 --> 00:27:55.510 align:middle line:84%
it really is dependent
on people doing it.

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And if enough people
do it, it will

00:27:57.430 --> 00:28:01.450 align:middle line:84%
shift all of human consciousness
into this good future and away

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:04.630 align:middle line:84%
from endless war in
space or the space force

00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:06.612 align:middle line:84%
and weapons in space,
and all this stuff

00:28:06.612 --> 00:28:07.820 align:middle line:90%
that we're trying to prevent.

00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:08.170 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Yeah.

00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:09.010 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:28:09.010 --> 00:28:10.630 align:middle line:84%
So Dr. Greer, all
of these experiences

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:12.490 align:middle line:84%
that you've been
explaining-- meditation,

00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:15.220 align:middle line:84%
out-of-body experiences,
astral projection--

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:20.017 align:middle line:84%
are these the gateway to
having the CE5 experience?

00:28:20.017 --> 00:28:21.100 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: I think they are.

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:22.558 align:middle line:84%
I don't think you
have to have them

00:28:22.558 --> 00:28:25.900 align:middle line:84%
before you do close encounters
of the fifth kind or CE5

00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:27.730 align:middle line:90%
contact.

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:32.890 align:middle line:84%
People who understand it
or at least understand

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:35.830 align:middle line:84%
that it's possible are
more likely to have

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:37.430 align:middle line:90%
a successful outcome.

00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:40.330 align:middle line:84%
But in reality,
as I said, anyone

00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:43.720 align:middle line:84%
without a whole-- a large
fund of knowledge around this

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:46.960 align:middle line:84%
or prior experience can
do it, so long as they're

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:50.860 align:middle line:84%
willing to understand
the simplest thing,

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:54.660 align:middle line:90%
and that is you're awake.

00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:56.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm awake.

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:59.550 align:middle line:84%
These civilizations are
conscious, sentient beings.

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:02.390 align:middle line:10%
And as Erwin Schrodinger
said, the father

00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:07.140 align:middle line:10%
of modern quantum theory and
particle wave theory in 1908,

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:10.860 align:middle line:10%
the total number of minds
in the universe is one.

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:12.390 align:middle line:90%
It's a singularity.

00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:15.780 align:middle line:84%
So once you understand the
singularity of consciousness,

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:17.880 align:middle line:90%
then all of this is demystified.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:20.370 align:middle line:84%
Then it makes total
sense, because we're all

00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:23.340 align:middle line:84%
folded and connected to
each other not in a distance

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:25.200 align:middle line:90%
linearly, but instantly.

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And once you understand
that, and you understand

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:30.030 align:middle line:84%
that these extraterrestrial
civilizations not

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:33.870 align:middle line:84%
only understand it but have
to utilize it routinely

00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:37.980 align:middle line:84%
in their scientific and
interstellar communications

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:39.960 align:middle line:84%
and what have you,
then it makes sense

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:41.500 align:middle line:90%
that this would be possible.

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And so for that reason, I
think knowing about this--

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.910 align:middle line:84%
and this is why the
Gaia audience I think

00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:51.120 align:middle line:84%
would be very advanced in
being able to understand

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:52.620 align:middle line:90%
this and begin to practice it.

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:56.350 align:middle line:84%
But as I've said, every
ordinary person can do it.

00:29:56.350 --> 00:30:01.680 align:middle line:10%
And I think the beautiful
message in that is all of us

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:04.560 align:middle line:10%
have the totality of all
these states of consciousness

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:06.180 align:middle line:10%
and dimensions within us.

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And if we just put one
foot after the other

00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:11.580 align:middle line:84%
and begin to
explore, the universe

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:12.900 align:middle line:90%
will open every doorway.

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:13.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Right.

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:14.501 align:middle line:90%
Fantastic.

00:30:14.501 --> 00:30:15.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm looking forward to it.

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:17.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm Billy Carson.

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:19.290 align:middle line:10%
