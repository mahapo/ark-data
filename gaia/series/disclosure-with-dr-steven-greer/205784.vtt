00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Welcome to "Disclosure
with Dr. Steven Greer."

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.950 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we
discuss the synchronicities

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.980 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness that
directed you on your mission.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:27.970 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Dr. Greer.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you, very
glad to be with you.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Greer, you had
some amazing experiences

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.310 align:middle line:84%
and synchronicities when you
found CSETI in the summer

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:37.400 align:middle line:90%
of 1990.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you tell us about that?

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.315 align:middle line:10%
>> I was up in the upstairs of
this large home that I lived

00:00:43.315 --> 00:00:47.000 align:middle line:10%
in Asheville, Biltmore Forest,
next to the Biltmore estate.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.710 align:middle line:84%
And this was a
very unusual event,

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.020 align:middle line:84%
because I'm just up in
the room doing something.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.750 align:middle line:84%
It's the full moon
of January 1990.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.090 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, there is a presence
in my room, my bedroom.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And very benignly, says, pick
up that which you have dropped.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.590 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that that meant all
this work dealing with contact,

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.560 align:middle line:84%
establishing a peaceful
civilization that becomes

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.780 align:middle line:90%
interplanetary into the future.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.070 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going, oh boy.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.420 align:middle line:90%
I knew exactly what it meant.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.200 align:middle line:90%
But I was very resistant to it.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.400 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going, well, I don't
know, what am I going to do,

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.400 align:middle line:90%
what I do with this.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.453 align:middle line:84%
So then on the full
moon of February 1990,

00:01:31.453 --> 00:01:32.870 align:middle line:84%
you know, I'm
looking into it, you

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.840 align:middle line:84%
know, how do I connect
with people on this issue?

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.130 align:middle line:84%
So there was someone in town
that came into Asheville.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.230 align:middle line:84%
I forget who it
was, and was having

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.900 align:middle line:84%
a meeting about extraterrestrial
intelligence and contact

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.700 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.980 align:middle line:90%
So I went to it.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting
sort of discreetly

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.690 align:middle line:84%
in the back, not wanting to draw
any attention to myself at all.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.120 align:middle line:84%
And this person, it was a woman,
looks around everyone and says,

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.180 align:middle line:84%
you, you have a connection
with these extraterrestrials.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.400 align:middle line:84%
You need to pick up what
you've dropped doing.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.960 align:middle line:90%
Almost the same words.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.450 align:middle line:90%
I went, oh, that's interesting.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.830 align:middle line:84%
So that was data
point number two.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.480 align:middle line:84%
Then the full moon of
March 1990, I'm in bed

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.500 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sitting there
and going to sleep

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.980 align:middle line:84%
and I fall into this
deep meditative state.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.090 align:middle line:84%
And I awaken with, very similar
to that event in the Blue Ridge

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:33.080 align:middle line:84%
Mountains, where there was this
sort of bluish craft in front

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.880 align:middle line:90%
of the house.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.490 align:middle line:84%
Wee hours, 3:00,
4:00 in the morning.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.290 align:middle line:90%
And I teleport onto this thing.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.010 align:middle line:90%
And we go out into space.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.730 align:middle line:84%
And it was a beautiful,
beautiful experience.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm having that
unfold, we go past the moon.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.600 align:middle line:84%
Now there's no sign that
says, welcome to the moon,

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.460 align:middle line:90%
but I can tell it was the moon.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.250 align:middle line:90%
And they were going further out.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And as we get past
the moon, I look back

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.290 align:middle line:84%
at the Earth and all
that area of space

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.650 align:middle line:84%
and have this
amazing experience.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.590 align:middle line:84%
When I'm with the ETs
on this, again, it's

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.100 align:middle line:84%
a craft, that is very large, but
it has no walls at that point.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.520 align:middle line:84%
We're out in space
and it's sort of this

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.250 align:middle line:84%
almost as if you're in a
protected bubble that's

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.840 align:middle line:90%
translucent again.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And I look back and the
Earth, I'm introduced to her

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.780 align:middle line:84%
and realize that she is a
conscious living being, Gaia.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And so I have this beautiful
experience with the Earth.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.750 align:middle line:84%
And sense the unbelievable
infinite unconditional

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.000 align:middle line:90%
love from the Earth.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.670 align:middle line:90%
And in fact, was female.

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.590 align:middle line:84%
And I went, oh God, this
is almost like a joke,

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.190 align:middle line:84%
because I hadn't really
studied those mythologies.

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.520 align:middle line:90%
She is conscious.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.780 align:middle line:90%
And not human.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.530 align:middle line:84%
This is not to be
anthropomorphic and project,

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.370 align:middle line:84%
but just to say the Earth was
absolutely a conscious being,

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.720 align:middle line:90%
but not human.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.450 align:middle line:84%
And very loving,
but also very sad.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And she communicated
to me that she

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.550 align:middle line:84%
was very sad because of what
her children were doing to her.

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.860 align:middle line:84%
A clear implication
to the environment.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.160 align:middle line:84%
But that that wouldn't
last for too much longer

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.459 align:middle line:90%
and that we would advance.

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And it was this beautiful,
unbelievable, heart,

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.880 align:middle line:84%
it was like my heart and
consciousness became one

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.250 align:middle line:84%
in this state of
love with the Earth.

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.020 align:middle line:84%
And so I had this beautiful
oneness and meditative

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.920 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.980 align:middle line:84%
So then I expand and I
go into this expanded

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.300 align:middle line:84%
state of consciousness where I
then see every single planet.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And then I heard, I
went from that state

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:52.560 align:middle line:84%
to seeing that each planet was
actually pure consciousness

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.390 align:middle line:90%
emerging from a sea of light.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:00.780 align:middle line:84%
So it's as if the entire solar
system and everything around it

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.880 align:middle line:84%
was this light energy that was
condensing into these planets.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.160 align:middle line:84%
Then I realize that within
that was this pure tone.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.500 align:middle line:84%
Like the thought
essence of the tone.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And I know this sounds
cliche, but I heard

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.350 align:middle line:90%
this, the music of the spheres.

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And I actually, as
I put, Earth was.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.430 align:middle line:90%
[HUMMING]

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm not very musical,
but I could hear.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.300 align:middle line:90%
And they were unique.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.950 align:middle line:90%
Each one was a different tone.

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:30.330 align:middle line:90%
Each one was unique.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that every star,
every planet, the entire cosmos

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.130 align:middle line:84%
had its own unique
tone within it.

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.290 align:middle line:84%
Every plant, every
rock, everything

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.960 align:middle line:84%
had this standing
wave of tonality

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.120 align:middle line:84%
that actually made a sound
within the conscious realm.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:54.630 align:middle line:84%
And then all of that sort of
all blended into one pure note.

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.120 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
was the cosmic sound.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.530 align:middle line:84%
And on that note, I
transcended into sort

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.810 align:middle line:84%
of a pure consciousness
state for quite some time.

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing I
know, I'm back in my room.

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And I go, wow,
that was beautiful.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And so then I go, I say,
this is so beautiful,

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.230 align:middle line:90%
now I know what I must do.

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:19.990 align:middle line:84%
So at that point, I
started the Center

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.390 align:middle line:84%
for the Study of
Extraterrestrial Intelligence,

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:24.940 align:middle line:90%
CSETI, that summer.

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.220 align:middle line:90%
And it was quite an adventure.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Was that another level of
a consciousness experience?

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.750 align:middle line:90%
Or were you in a spacecraft?

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:33.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's both.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of
the problems is,

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:37.330 align:middle line:84%
we're raised to
look at everything

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.690 align:middle line:90%
in a reductionist separate way.

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:42.310 align:middle line:84%
When you're dealing
with civilizations

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.240 align:middle line:84%
that are transdimensional, go
faster than the speed of light,

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.700 align:middle line:84%
all of their technologies
and their craft

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:53.500 align:middle line:84%
can phase in and out of 3D or
multiple higher dimensions,

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.480 align:middle line:84%
including the
consciousness realms

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.010 align:middle line:90%
that we would call astral.

00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:00.910 align:middle line:84%
Most ET craft, when they're
in proximity to the Earth,

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:04.540 align:middle line:84%
are shifted resonantly
beyond the speed

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.750 align:middle line:84%
of light, which is
closely approximating what

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:09.430 align:middle line:90%
we would call astral.

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And the physics of
this is well known.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.900 align:middle line:84%
But in this case,
it was very much

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.630 align:middle line:84%
both with the dominant
experience as consciousness,

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.390 align:middle line:84%
and higher states of
consciousness in particular.

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And the existence of
the being an ET people,

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:27.100 align:middle line:84%
I call them people,
and craft, is

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.870 align:middle line:84%
sort of incidental
to the real purpose,

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:31.090 align:middle line:90%
which is this deeper level.

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:31.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:33.190 align:middle line:84%
So it's like the
ETs and the craft

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:36.130 align:middle line:84%
are like in a
symbiotic relationship.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:39.560 align:middle line:84%
They resonate with each other,
they take you to the craft,

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.670 align:middle line:90%
and the craft responds.

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:41.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, absolutely.

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And the guidance
systems were all

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:44.780 align:middle line:90%
thought-actuated for travel.

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:45.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Incredible.

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:46.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:46.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Incredible.

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:48.910 align:middle line:84%
Was there a particular
extraterrestrial type

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:51.310 align:middle line:84%
on the craft that
you're associating with?

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:52.833 align:middle line:84%
>> I always get
asked this question.

00:07:52.833 --> 00:07:53.750 align:middle line:90%
It's a great question.

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And my experience is that
there are different ones.

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:58.690 align:middle line:90%
And they work together.

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:04.750 align:middle line:84%
This particular one that came,
it was right beside my bed,

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:11.350 align:middle line:84%
was jet black hair, very
unbelievably unusual blue eyes,

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:13.120 align:middle line:90%
very white skin.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:19.030 align:middle line:84%
And other than that, could be
mistaken as a human cousin.

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:23.590 align:middle line:84%
Looked very human in that
sense, but not quite, not quite.

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:25.810 align:middle line:84%
And so there are
different civilizations

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:28.690 align:middle line:90%
with different type of forms.

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:30.220 align:middle line:90%
And everyone hangs up on that.

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:31.810 align:middle line:84%
I go, what difference
does it make?

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:32.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:33.490 align:middle line:90%
>> You know?

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:37.240 align:middle line:84%
My point of view is,
they're conscious sentient,

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:42.490 align:middle line:84%
and they have more in common
with us than they're different.

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And all these civilizations
are working together

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:49.240 align:middle line:84%
in a collective and
to get cleared out

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.628 align:middle line:84%
of your solar system
physically, physically.

00:08:52.628 --> 00:08:53.920 align:middle line:90%
Not talking about other things.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:54.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.950 align:middle line:84%
>> But physically, you have
to have a certain level

00:08:56.950 --> 00:09:00.040 align:middle line:84%
of peaceful intent,
not hostile intent.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.620 align:middle line:84%
>> It kind of seems as
if they're monitoring us

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:06.580 align:middle line:84%
and watching us and waiting
for us to develop and grow

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:09.640 align:middle line:84%
as a species, grow into this
higher level of consciousness

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.188 align:middle line:84%
that they can
integrate with better.

00:09:11.188 --> 00:09:13.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and remember, some
of these civilizations have

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:17.680 align:middle line:84%
a primary task of containment
so that we don't go too far out

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:20.740 align:middle line:84%
in space with weapons
of mass destruction.

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:23.350 align:middle line:84%
Others are concerned with
our nuclear programs,

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:25.930 align:middle line:84%
because when we detonate
a nuclear weapon,

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:28.720 align:middle line:84%
it actually, we'll get into
this in later episodes,

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.670 align:middle line:84%
we know an
electromagnetic pulse,

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:33.250 align:middle line:84%
but there are actually
scalar or faster

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:35.830 align:middle line:84%
than the speed of light pulses
that disrupt their worlds.

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:40.820 align:middle line:84%
That's why during the atomic
bomb projects, the '40s, '50s,

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:43.420 align:middle line:84%
that's why there were
so many ET crafts seen.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:47.020 align:middle line:84%
Because it was not only an
existential threat to Earth,

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.090 align:middle line:84%
it was damaging to
their civilization.

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:54.070 align:middle line:90%
So there are different purposes.

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:55.510 align:middle line:90%
I don't like the word agendas.

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:58.490 align:middle line:84%
It has a nefarious
connotation to it.

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:00.430 align:middle line:84%
But there are
different functions.

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And there are different
purposes of different events

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:05.800 align:middle line:90%
that people report.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And what we have to understand,
is all whole and part

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:14.980 align:middle line:84%
of a long-term purpose to
sort of watch over things

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:17.330 align:middle line:84%
during this dangerous
transition that we're in.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:18.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:21.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Where frankly, our
spirituality and social

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:26.500 align:middle line:84%
development has lagged way below
our technological abilities

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.400 align:middle line:84%
to destroy the planet, and
be a threat to other worlds.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.770 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're in this
sort of transition phase

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:33.880 align:middle line:90%
that's fraught.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.750 align:middle line:84%
And these civilizations
know that.

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:37.420 align:middle line:84%
So that's sort of
the big picture.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:40.060 align:middle line:84%
But there's, many of
these civilizations

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:44.350 align:middle line:84%
are specifically interested in
human contact and development

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:45.430 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:50.500 align:middle line:84%
But also, humans' understanding
the conscious universe

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:53.540 align:middle line:84%
so that we can understand
their way of living.

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:54.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:57.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Their travel, their
communication, their paradigm.

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:58.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.180 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's why the big
science of the next 1,000

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:05.110 align:middle line:84%
years, once we bring out all
the classified anti-gravity

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:08.140 align:middle line:84%
and other technologies that have
been developed already that are

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:12.183 align:middle line:84%
in classified black
projects, those,

00:11:12.183 --> 00:11:14.350 align:middle line:84%
are the big science is the
science of consciousness.

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:16.390 align:middle line:84%
The next 1,000
years is going to be

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:19.420 align:middle line:84%
all about the development of
higher states of consciousness,

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:22.450 align:middle line:84%
but also the applications
of consciousness in science,

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:26.350 align:middle line:84%
in communication, in healing,
all kinds of applications.

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:29.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Real quick, do you think
that some of these civilizations

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:33.000 align:middle line:84%
that are kind of like our
human civilization have risen

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.890 align:middle line:84%
and kind of just fallen maybe by
destroying themselves and this

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:38.050 align:middle line:84%
is why these ETs have
put together this,

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:41.650 align:middle line:84%
or decided to collaborate with
this type of a protocol to help

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:44.290 align:middle line:84%
this from happening, prevent
it from happening again?

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:46.748 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I don't think there's
any question that there have

00:11:46.748 --> 00:11:50.530 align:middle line:84%
been very advanced civilizations
on this planet and on Mars that

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:55.420 align:middle line:84%
have made this mistake and
gone too far in destructive

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:59.380 align:middle line:84%
technologies before they
collectively evolved

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:00.850 align:middle line:90%
spiritually and socially.

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:04.730 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, I'm sure that
has happened on other planets.

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:09.310 align:middle line:84%
So the ones that are here
now know these lessons

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:13.060 align:middle line:84%
and have learned those
lessons and are very concerned

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:15.620 align:middle line:84%
about the fact that we
haven't learned that lesson.

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:16.420 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:18.430 align:middle line:90%
And we should have by now.

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:20.830 align:middle line:90%
So I call this the lost century.

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:24.190 align:middle line:84%
There's a century of
evolution on this planet that

00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:28.910 align:middle line:84%
has been sidelined into
the gutter of endless war

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:33.340 align:middle line:84%
and ignorance and cover-ups, and
the biggest cover-up frankly,

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:36.940 align:middle line:84%
is in the big breakthroughs
in transdimensional physics

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:38.290 align:middle line:90%
in the science of consciousness.

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:39.248 align:middle line:90%
That's the biggest one.

00:12:39.248 --> 00:12:40.780 align:middle line:90%
Bigger than the free energy.

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:44.525 align:middle line:90%
Bigger than the anti-gravity.

00:12:44.525 --> 00:12:46.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Exactly two years after
that first experience you just

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.390 align:middle line:84%
described for us, you had an
experience in Gulf Breeze,

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:49.700 align:middle line:90%
Florida.

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:50.867 align:middle line:90%
Will you tell us about that?

00:12:50.867 --> 00:12:55.600 align:middle line:84%
>> It was a training event for
about 60 people near Pensacola

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.300 align:middle line:90%
on a beach, for a weekend.

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And so we're out there and
we're doing the protocols

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.170 align:middle line:84%
and we go out, and of course,
it's a large group of people

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:09.070 align:middle line:84%
and we're on a parking
area by a beach,

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:10.900 align:middle line:90%
I think it was a state beach.

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And after we'd done
the initial meditation,

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:20.680 align:middle line:84%
we're just up looking and see
what's, we've invited them.

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:24.520 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, there are four ET
crafts that, they don't move,

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.040 align:middle line:84%
and they materialize
in the sky right there.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.715 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
back then in 1992,

00:13:30.715 --> 00:13:32.590 align:middle line:84%
we didn't have really
good very good cameras.

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:34.510 align:middle line:90%
We didn't have night vision.

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:36.340 align:middle line:90%
I think someone had an old Hi8.

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:39.100 align:middle line:84%
And we had this
amazing contact event.

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:40.840 align:middle line:84%
The part that most
people don't know,

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:45.220 align:middle line:84%
is that simultaneously,
the ETs were teleported

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.070 align:middle line:84%
into the parking lot, but
not quite 3D, but in a way

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:50.410 align:middle line:84%
you could see them,
almost like a hologram.

00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And they were setting off
detectors and car lights.

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:56.590 align:middle line:84%
Subsequently, that
event, someone

00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:59.830 align:middle line:84%
got a picture of one of these
and it was on a photograph.

00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And it was on the front
page of the Pensacola paper

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:04.450 align:middle line:90%
the next day.

00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:09.250 align:middle line:84%
That ended up kicking this up
to the intelligence community.

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:11.140 align:middle line:84%
And within a few
days, I was approached

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:14.200 align:middle line:84%
by the head of army
intelligence and people

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.990 align:middle line:84%
from the CIA and
National Security Agency.

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:19.120 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of people don't
know that the entire,

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:22.930 align:middle line:10%
the whole Project Starlight,
which was the code word for us

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:26.440 align:middle line:10%
briefing President Clinton
and the CIA director

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:29.500 align:middle line:10%
and Lawrence Rockefeller
and other people,

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:33.190 align:middle line:10%
that was an outgrowth of a
successful mass witness CE-5

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:35.830 align:middle line:10%
event that made
it into the media.

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And so most people
don't understand

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:43.360 align:middle line:84%
there's a direct line from
the contact, CE-5 contact

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.990 align:middle line:84%
event, and the entire founding
of the global disclosure

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:49.587 align:middle line:90%
movement back in 1992.

00:14:49.587 --> 00:14:51.670 align:middle line:84%
>> That just helped me a
lot about the connection,

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:54.050 align:middle line:84%
because I was wondering
how that happened.

00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:55.300 align:middle line:90%
That makes a lot of sense now.

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:56.967 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and so what
happened, you know,

00:14:56.967 --> 00:15:01.280 align:middle line:84%
I get invited to this conference
going on in Atlanta in April.

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:03.520 align:middle line:90%
This is March of '92.

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.880 align:middle line:10%
And I go there, they
put me at the head table

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:09.880 align:middle line:10%
with General Albert
Stubblebine III,

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:13.787 align:middle line:10%
then head of army intelligence,
and some CIA and NSA people.

00:15:13.787 --> 00:15:15.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, this is
weird, what the hell

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:17.110 align:middle line:90%
am I doing with these guys?

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:19.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's when they
take me into a hotel room

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:23.500 align:middle line:84%
later that night and very
aggressively basically

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:27.280 align:middle line:84%
say, what the hell do
you think you're doing?

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:30.220 align:middle line:84%
Because those
projects understand

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:33.400 align:middle line:84%
the power consciousness
and of mass consciousness.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.370 align:middle line:10%
And that the Rosetta
Stone of contact

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:40.360 align:middle line:10%
has to do with thought,
a consciousness, expanded

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.640 align:middle line:10%
consciousness, remote viewing.

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And these protocols,
they were not happy

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:48.670 align:middle line:84%
that we were doing this
without their permission.

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:51.070 align:middle line:84%
It was a very
interesting conversation

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:55.780 align:middle line:84%
and very threatening in
a way, an implied threat.

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And then about a
month later, we're

00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:02.740 align:middle line:84%
up here in the mountains of
Colorado near Estes Park, St.

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:04.030 align:middle line:90%
Malo's Retreat Center.

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:06.830 align:middle line:84%
And so these people
show up at that.

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:12.400 align:middle line:84%
And one of the, the
general approached me

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:17.530 align:middle line:84%
and offered me personally
$2 billion US dollars.

00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:18.880 align:middle line:90%
But I said no.

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:20.800 align:middle line:10%
And it turned out, it
was a bunch of money

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:23.470 align:middle line:10%
that we had confiscated from
the collapse of the Soviet Union

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:26.080 align:middle line:10%
that was in Eastern
Europe, black project

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.780 align:middle line:10%
money, unacknowledged money.

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:30.820 align:middle line:90%
And that was a serious offer.

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:34.480 align:middle line:84%
So I know what these folks
are capable of doing.

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:37.030 align:middle line:84%
I learned the hard
way in the spring,

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:41.100 align:middle line:84%
this was May of
1992, of how far they

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:46.350 align:middle line:84%
will go to threaten or
bribe or induce or pay off

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:51.940 align:middle line:84%
people who could be disruptive
to the agenda of secrecy.

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:52.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:53.850 align:middle line:90%
Incredible.

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:56.850 align:middle line:84%
Of all the classified
technology and the resources

00:16:56.850 --> 00:17:00.820 align:middle line:84%
that they had, what do you
think they wanted from you?

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:03.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Actually, what the
intelligence community wanted

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:07.609 align:middle line:84%
was to co-opt me and to
control what we were doing.

00:17:07.609 --> 00:17:11.180 align:middle line:10%
I also found out later
at that conference

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:15.763 align:middle line:10%
that a woman who was there,
Countess Angelika Cawdor,

00:17:15.763 --> 00:17:17.180 align:middle line:10%
she pulled me
aside, and she says,

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:22.510 align:middle line:10%
you know, they're actually
very jealous of you

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:24.609 align:middle line:10%
because you're free.

00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:27.440 align:middle line:84%
You're not part of
their little black box.

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.500 align:middle line:84%
They can't get out
of that black box.

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:32.080 align:middle line:90%
They're lifers, but you're free.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And that both made them
jealous, but also angry.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.500 align:middle line:84%
And on top of it,
knew it was dangerous.

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Because looking into the
future, the biggest way

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:45.130 align:middle line:84%
that we can end the
secrecy on this issue

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:49.150 align:middle line:84%
is millions and millions of
people doing CE-5 contact

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:50.980 align:middle line:90%
and bypassing the system.

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:53.860 align:middle line:84%
The power of mass
consciousness and the power

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:57.010 align:middle line:84%
of the people doing
something positive

00:17:57.010 --> 00:17:59.470 align:middle line:84%
completely will
overwhelm that system.

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:00.550 align:middle line:90%
And they knew that.

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:03.310 align:middle line:84%
They knew it, and they knew
that the protocols work.

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:06.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the intelligence
community absolutely

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:08.920 align:middle line:84%
knew it was legitimate,
that the event was real,

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.420 align:middle line:90%
and they were watching this.

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:14.650 align:middle line:84%
So I think people, in
a way, I said, well,

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:16.270 align:middle line:84%
this all this has
done is confirm

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:17.920 align:middle line:90%
that we're on the right path.

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.890 align:middle line:84%
Because if those devils
don't want us to do it,

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:22.870 align:middle line:84%
then it's got to be
the right thing, right?

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:28.930 align:middle line:84%
So you know, it was a very
aggressive frontal attack

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:32.300 align:middle line:84%
on trying to divert
what we were planning.

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:36.497 align:middle line:84%
I think they also want
to keep this subject

00:18:36.497 --> 00:18:37.330 align:middle line:90%
under their control.

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:38.500 align:middle line:90%
They're control freaks.

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:42.280 align:middle line:84%
And by doing what I'm doing,
I'm democratizing the subject

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:44.260 align:middle line:84%
so that hey, anyone
can form a little team,

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.570 align:middle line:84%
go out, make contact, and
you don't need permission

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:49.150 align:middle line:84%
from the head of our
intelligence or anyone

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:50.290 align:middle line:90%
who's on this committee.

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:54.820 align:middle line:84%
There's more power in everyone
knowing this and doing it

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:57.020 align:middle line:84%
than there is in these
classified projects.

00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:59.703 align:middle line:84%
Everyone creates a great
big boogeyman out there.

00:18:59.703 --> 00:19:01.870 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, they only
have the power we give them.

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:02.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>> And so it's time for us to
take back this issue and take

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:10.190 align:middle line:84%
it back for a positive outcome
for our planet into the future.

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:10.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:14.050 align:middle line:84%
So what you're saying really
is, if the people take part

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:17.800 align:middle line:84%
in this on their own,
awaken to unconditional love

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:21.670 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness and follow
these protocols, the government

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:24.460 align:middle line:84%
itself will have to follow,
because the mass consciousness

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:26.740 align:middle line:84%
is already moving
in that direction.

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:29.560 align:middle line:84%
>> The beauty of CE-5 contact,
if there are millions of people

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:34.520 align:middle line:84%
doing it, it's like a denial of
service in a computer system.

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
power of people doing this

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:37.607 align:middle line:90%
is so important.

00:19:37.607 --> 00:19:39.940 align:middle line:10%
It's why we did "The Close
Encounters of the Fifth Kind"

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:44.470 align:middle line:10%
movie right now, since the
government and their cut-outs,

00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:47.470 align:middle line:10%
their agencies
are moving quickly

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:50.290 align:middle line:10%
towards a false disclosure
that will present this

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:53.230 align:middle line:10%
as a national security threat,
the only way we're going

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:56.320 align:middle line:10%
to be able to change that
since the mainstream media is

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:58.720 align:middle line:10%
under the control of the
intelligence community,

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:01.750 align:middle line:10%
is to do it on a mass
grassroots basis this way.

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:02.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:05.410 align:middle line:84%
Another synchronicity
unfolded for you in the UK.

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:06.670 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell us about that?

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:09.940 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're doing the CE-5
protocols on this 1,800 acre

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:11.710 align:middle line:90%
farm near Woodborough Hill.

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:15.700 align:middle line:84%
A craft materializes, it's
about 100 feet in diameter,

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:18.490 align:middle line:84%
in the field about 10
feet above the wheat.

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And starts floating
towards us, and we

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:23.510 align:middle line:84%
have this amazing encounter,
until one person who

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:26.860 align:middle line:84%
was on the team got
kind of freaked out

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:30.460 align:middle line:84%
because the energy being
given off by this object

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:31.570 align:middle line:90%
was gorgeous.

00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:36.040 align:middle line:84%
It created a piloerection
effect where everyone's hair

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:37.690 align:middle line:90%
was standing on end.

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:39.940 align:middle line:84%
The power lines near
us were buzzing.

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:40.990 align:middle line:90%
And she freaked out.

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:44.170 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, we're
inviting them to come closer.

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:46.210 align:middle line:90%
She said, no, don't!

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And so at that point, it
stopped and it backed off.

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.790 align:middle line:84%
And it had been
raining earlier, and it

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:54.670 align:middle line:84%
went up into sort of this
mist, and then looked

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:56.830 align:middle line:84%
like it disappeared,
but then the sky

00:20:56.830 --> 00:21:00.580 align:middle line:84%
opened up above us, which the
ETs can do this, by the way,

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:03.640 align:middle line:84%
and it was this golden
sphere up at a distance

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.360 align:middle line:90%
that she felt comfortable with.

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And so we signaled to it and
connected in consciousness.

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:10.100 align:middle line:90%
Very important lesson here.

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:12.790 align:middle line:84%
I realized that because
like this person

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:15.310 align:middle line:84%
had been a student
of this subject

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:18.910 align:middle line:84%
and had absorbed all the
torture stories of abductions

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:23.050 align:middle line:84%
and so immediately,
that clicked in.

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:25.390 align:middle line:90%
She shut down, and the ET said.

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:26.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm backing off here.

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:29.308 align:middle line:84%
And then another
night, we said, OK.

00:21:29.308 --> 00:21:30.850 align:middle line:84%
well let's go up on
Woodborough Hill.

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:33.010 align:middle line:90%
So 12 of us go up there.

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:35.110 align:middle line:84%
We said, well, what
if, since we're here

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:37.630 align:middle line:84%
surrounded by all these
amazing crop circles,

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:43.870 align:middle line:84%
what if we create in our minds
a certain geometric shape

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:48.580 align:middle line:84%
and connect it to the ETs and
ask them to put it in a field?

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:51.670 align:middle line:84%
So basically, a
CE-5 crop circle.

00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:52.600 align:middle line:90%
So we did.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.970 align:middle line:84%
And we came up and
we decided to use

00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:59.740 align:middle line:84%
that shape; three circles,
equilateral triangle connected

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:01.270 align:middle line:90%
by lines.

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:04.750 align:middle line:84%
Within hours, a
farmer, predawn, was

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:10.890 align:middle line:84%
going to cut a field of wheat
actually, found that in a field

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:12.780 align:middle line:84%
within line sight
of where we were.

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:14.550 align:middle line:10%
And of course, we
found out about it

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:17.010 align:middle line:10%
later that day because
we went to bed and got up

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:19.710 align:middle line:10%
and it was these reports
hitting all over.

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:21.840 align:middle line:10%
And we go over there
and honest to God,

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.360 align:middle line:10%
it was like it'd been lifted
out of our consciousness

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:25.390 align:middle line:10%
and put in that field.

00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:26.265 align:middle line:10%
>> That's incredible.

00:22:26.265 --> 00:22:29.760 align:middle line:10%
>> And so that was
a CE-5 crop circle.

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And so subsequently,
that became our symbol.

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it signifies the
three areas that we focus on.

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:41.970 align:middle line:84%
The top circle of the triangle
is consciousness and CE-5

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:42.840 align:middle line:90%
contact.

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:46.650 align:middle line:84%
The other two are
truthful disclosure

00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:48.080 align:middle line:90%
and the technologies.

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.730 align:middle line:84%
It's the third one, the
sciences and technologies,

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:53.100 align:middle line:84%
that would liberate
the planet from oil

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:56.310 align:middle line:84%
and give us a new civilization
without poverty or pollution.

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:58.450 align:middle line:84%
So those are the three
aspects we work on.

00:22:58.450 --> 00:22:58.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:01.050 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's, but that's
literally how that symbol came

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:01.560 align:middle line:90%
to be.

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:02.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Incredible.

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:05.560 align:middle line:84%
So it's like they, well, we
know that when, you're a doctor,

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:09.330 align:middle line:84%
so when people think
those waves of energy

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:11.280 align:middle line:84%
come out of the brain,
out of the skull,

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:13.410 align:middle line:84%
because I know you can
put a wave cap on somebody

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:17.040 align:middle line:84%
and pick up that energetic
wave and put it on a computer

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:18.590 align:middle line:90%
and look at the brain.

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:20.640 align:middle line:84%
So do you think that the
way that they operate

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:23.430 align:middle line:84%
is that they're actually
scanning these thought

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:25.530 align:middle line:84%
waves of light that are
coming out of our skull

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:27.660 align:middle line:90%
and then just discerning them?

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:29.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, but not the
electromagnetic waves.

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:32.760 align:middle line:84%
The actual conscious
field and thought.

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:35.560 align:middle line:90%
What I call a quanta of thought.

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:37.560 align:middle line:84%
So those can be
actuated, those can

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:40.530 align:middle line:84%
be interfaced with when
it's very coherent and clear

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:42.270 align:middle line:90%
and you're doing it with intent.

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:43.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's really
powerful when you

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:47.040 align:middle line:84%
get the conscious
mind and the heart,

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:49.980 align:middle line:84%
sort of the love space
and the unity space,

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:51.180 align:middle line:90%
resonating together.

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:54.480 align:middle line:84%
Because there are 30,000, 40,000
neurons in the heart, and those

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:57.510 align:middle line:84%
can resonate with the
mind and consciousness.

00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:59.970 align:middle line:84%
That's when it's most
powerful, because it's coming

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:01.770 align:middle line:90%
from heart and consciousness.

00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:03.310 align:middle line:90%
They pick that up very clearly.

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:04.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:04.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Crystal clear.

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:05.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:06.600 align:middle line:90%
Our coherence, that's amazing.

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:07.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:09.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Greer, throughout
this entire interview,

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:13.650 align:middle line:84%
you've referenced several
experiences that you've had

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:15.108 align:middle line:90%
with different ET races.

00:24:15.108 --> 00:24:17.400 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that they're
interacting with us more than

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.300 align:middle line:90%
ever right now?

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:20.490 align:middle line:84%
Or what do you think
they're doing right now?

00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:23.410 align:middle line:84%
Are they interacting or
are they falling back?

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:26.860 align:middle line:84%
>> I actually think they're
trying to interact more,

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:30.520 align:middle line:84%
but it's more and more difficult
given the weapons systems we

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:34.520 align:middle line:84%
have on satellites that
target them and track them.

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:37.360 align:middle line:10%
Which means that in
the '40s, '50s even

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:39.370 align:middle line:10%
when I started this
project, it was

00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:44.320 align:middle line:10%
much safer for them to come
into full 3D than right now,

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:47.950 align:middle line:10%
because there have been
multiple generations of sensors.

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:51.220 align:middle line:84%
They're called neutrino
light detectors,

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:54.370 align:middle line:84%
that are hooked to
electromagnetic weapons

00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:56.950 align:middle line:84%
systems that are scalar,
which means faster

00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:58.900 align:middle line:90%
than the speed of light.

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:01.060 align:middle line:10%
Systems, which means
those experiences

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:03.650 align:middle line:10%
tend to be very quick
and then they're gone.

00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:04.450 align:middle line:10%
But are they gone?

00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:04.780 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:06.988 align:middle line:10%
They've shifted, they're
right there in front of you,

00:25:06.988 --> 00:25:11.020 align:middle line:10%
but they're shifted out of
3D so that they can't be

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:13.105 align:middle line:10%
targeted in a destructive way.

00:25:13.105 --> 00:25:16.000 align:middle line:84%
I know we're getting to a
complex set of discussions

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.630 align:middle line:84%
here, but that's why
people have to understand

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:21.700 align:middle line:90%
the structure of the cosmos.

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And that structure
and understanding

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:25.390 align:middle line:84%
of the cosmos and
all these dimensions,

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:29.890 align:middle line:84%
drives your understanding of
how ET craft and people will

00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:31.360 align:middle line:90%
manifest around you.

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's not always
what you're expecting.

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:38.590 align:middle line:84%
It's always, it can be kind
of your classical 3D thing

00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:40.570 align:middle line:90%
with a craft and an ET.

00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:44.140 align:middle line:84%
But more often than not,
it's the other way, where

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:46.420 align:middle line:90%
it's very transdimensional.

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:48.760 align:middle line:84%
Which also happens to
be safer at this stage,

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:52.030 align:middle line:84%
because until we can
get a stand down order,

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:56.060 align:middle line:84%
then how do you create
a safe space for this?

00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:59.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, it can happen, and it does
happen every time we go out,

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:01.870 align:middle line:84%
but you have to have
an understanding of how

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:03.070 align:middle line:90%
it's going to manifest.

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:07.210 align:middle line:84%
What are the manifestations of
an interstellar civilization

00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:09.190 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't want
anyone to be harmed.

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:11.360 align:middle line:84%
It's like the medical maxim,
above all, do no harm.

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:12.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:14.320 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's what
we have to aspire to.

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:16.737 align:middle line:84%
>> That makes a lot of sense
to me what you're telling me,

00:26:16.737 --> 00:26:18.980 align:middle line:84%
because now it answers for
me a lot of questions that

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:19.780 align:middle line:90%
I've always had.

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:21.230 align:middle line:90%
Why do they move like this?

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:22.922 align:middle line:84%
Why are they
shifting in and out?

00:26:22.922 --> 00:26:26.600 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a way of really
not getting attacked.

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:27.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Makes a lot of sense.

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:31.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And the big, some of the
accidents that are portrayed

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:33.590 align:middle line:90%
as accidents, like Roswell.

00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:34.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:36.473 align:middle line:84%
>> Or some of the others,
those weren't accidents!

00:26:36.473 --> 00:26:37.535 align:middle line:90%
Those were early--

00:26:37.535 --> 00:26:38.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Directive weapons.

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:42.970 align:middle line:84%
>> --electromagnetic directed
energy weapons that targeted

00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:47.530 align:middle line:84%
them, and which were switched on
as a surprise move that caused

00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:49.630 align:middle line:90%
these ET craft to crash.

00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And so there have
been dozens of those,

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:53.410 align:middle line:90%
by the way, not just a couple.

00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that that
creates an entire, that

00:26:57.310 --> 00:27:02.020 align:middle line:84%
informs the strategy that at
this time in space and time,

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:06.130 align:middle line:84%
right now on Earth, that informs
not only what I have to share,

00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:10.030 align:middle line:84%
but also the entire
constellation of understanding

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:13.780 align:middle line:84%
of all the different
manifestations of ET craft

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:15.460 align:middle line:90%
and people that can happen.

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And with full knowledge
that periodically, we

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:22.060 align:middle line:84%
will have a full on 3D
craft, and full on ET beings,

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:27.340 align:middle line:84%
but the way I tell people,
we set up the conditions

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:28.450 align:middle line:90%
and invite them.

00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And then we let them be the
leading partner in this dance,

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:37.070 align:middle line:84%
because I'm sure that they can
monitor the risk matrix better

00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:40.970 align:middle line:84%
than I can even, or
the average person can.

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:43.770 align:middle line:84%
So we sort of then
in the meditation,

00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:46.790 align:middle line:84%
you'll see I always say,
and to appear and visit us

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:49.670 align:middle line:84%
in any way that is safe and
appropriate for this time

00:27:49.670 --> 00:27:50.810 align:middle line:90%
and place.

00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And then the ball's
in their court.

00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:53.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:53.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:55.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Makes sense,
beautiful Dr. Greer,

00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:57.637 align:middle line:84%
you've had a lot of
contact experiences,

00:27:57.637 --> 00:27:59.637 align:middle line:84%
you've had a lot of
synchronicities that led you

00:27:59.637 --> 00:28:00.620 align:middle line:90%
on this mission.

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:02.245 align:middle line:84%
What have you learned
about these signs

00:28:02.245 --> 00:28:05.080 align:middle line:84%
and how to recognize
and listen to them?

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:07.130 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a really
great question.

00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:10.750 align:middle line:84%
I think primarily,
every person when

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:15.530 align:middle line:84%
they begin to look at
their own conscious self,

00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:20.120 align:middle line:84%
you begin to realize there
is no space and time that

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:25.310 align:middle line:84%
restricts your ability to gather
information and know things.

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:29.870 align:middle line:84%
Because the entirety of the
cosmos is folded like a quantum

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:33.410 align:middle line:84%
conscious hologram within
every single person.

00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:36.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, what that
means is, there are

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:39.200 align:middle line:84%
intuitions and
synchronicities that happen.

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And as you become more open to
that and meditate and practice

00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:51.810 align:middle line:84%
meditation regularly, you then
will see that this is possible,

00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:52.610 align:middle line:90%
number one.

00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:53.750 align:middle line:90%
So you know it's possible.

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And then when they do happen,
you immediately recognize them.

00:28:57.390 --> 00:28:59.540 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing, is
that the universe, when

00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:03.350 align:middle line:84%
you move in the direction
that is, the Vedas would say,

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:07.190 align:middle line:84%
Sattvic, the pure life
force and creative force

00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:11.210 align:middle line:84%
of the cosmos, the universe just
opens doors and synchronicities

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:12.180 align:middle line:90%
happen more and more.

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:14.600 align:middle line:10%
But a lot of times, when
you're doing something

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:17.540 align:middle line:10%
that the universe and the
world needs to have done,

00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:21.350 align:middle line:10%
if you keep yourself in that,
the winds of the universe

00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:24.140 align:middle line:10%
are blowing you forward,
moving you forward,

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:25.370 align:middle line:10%
and will light up the path.

00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:26.870 align:middle line:90%
But you have to recognize it.

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:28.520 align:middle line:90%
But also, ask for it.

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:30.750 align:middle line:84%
Intent, so the
power of intention,

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:33.770 align:middle line:84%
the power of positive
intention, and also

00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:35.130 align:middle line:90%
of asking for that help.

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:35.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:40.860 align:middle line:84%
>> And the universe has
a way of organizing it.

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, when those
things start happening,

00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:47.270 align:middle line:84%
you begin to realize that
these synchronicities need

00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:49.760 align:middle line:84%
to be identified, and
that's a way of saying,

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:52.280 align:middle line:84%
walk through this door,
walk through this door,

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:53.240 align:middle line:90%
walk through this door.

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:53.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And you just have to have
faith and walk through it.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:56.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:58.570 align:middle line:10%
>> Thank you, Dr. Greer.

00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:01.480 align:middle line:10%
I'm Billy Carson and thank
you for watching "Disclosure

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.840 align:middle line:10%
with Dr. Steven Greer."

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:08.000 align:middle line:90%
