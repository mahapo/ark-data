00:00:18.365 --> 00:00:19.990 align:middle line:10%
>>BILLY CARSON:
Welcome to "Disclosure"

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.490 align:middle line:10%
with Dr. Steven Greer.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.030 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we look at the
technology of consciousness.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:26.110 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Greer, welcome.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:26.740 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVEN GREER: Thank you.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:27.540 align:middle line:90%
Great being here.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:28.510 align:middle line:90%
I love this subject.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:29.560 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Yes.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.619 align:middle line:84%
Is there a relationship between
technology and consciousness,

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.110 align:middle line:84%
and what can you share
with us about that?

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.580 align:middle line:10%
>>GREER: It's really the core of
the sciences of the next 1,000

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.730 align:middle line:10%
years will be the interface
between the science

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.630 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness and the fact
that technological systems can

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.860 align:middle line:10%
interface with the
conscious field and thought.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.570 align:middle line:84%
And sort of the early work
that's been done on Earth that

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.610 align:middle line:84%
the public knows about-- we'll
talk about classified projects

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:59.410 align:middle line:90%
later--

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.960 align:middle line:84%
are like Dr. John
at Princeton, who

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.440 align:middle line:84%
set up random number generators,
which are these quantum number

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.650 align:middle line:84%
generators picking out--
spitting out zeros and ones.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.330 align:middle line:10%
And you could put
someone in a room

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.390 align:middle line:10%
and put their awareness
on it, no wires,

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.480 align:middle line:10%
and intend for there to
be more ones and zeros.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.170 align:middle line:84%
And it would shift the bell
curve, which would be 50-50.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly, when two
people that loved each other

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.660 align:middle line:84%
reunited, the effect was
much greater, sometimes

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:26.980 align:middle line:90%
10 times greater.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's the power
of people together.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.620 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of these studies
that have been done--

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.050 align:middle line:84%
and there are dozens
and dozens of them--

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.920 align:middle line:84%
over the years have shown that
the conscious field and thought

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.960 align:middle line:84%
can affect subtle
electromagnetic systems.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.900 align:middle line:84%
Even back in-- I believe it
was the late '80s, early '90s,

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.760 align:middle line:84%
the physics journals
had a report

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.280 align:middle line:84%
of the experiment where they
were firing a beam of photons

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.060 align:middle line:90%
down a tube to an opening.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.600 align:middle line:84%
And when the experimenter,
the scientist,

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.320 align:middle line:84%
would think to change
where that opening was,

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.740 align:middle line:84%
the photons pre-cognitively
changed directions.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.410 align:middle line:84%
This was actually in
"Newsweek," "Time."

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.690 align:middle line:84%
It was all reported
in the mainstream.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.750 align:middle line:84%
So these studies have
been building and building

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.970 align:middle line:84%
and building for more than half
a century with technologies

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.240 align:middle line:90%
on Earth in the early stages.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.710 align:middle line:90%
Now, let's extrapolate.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.930 align:middle line:84%
Let's go forward
100,000, a million,

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.220 align:middle line:84%
10 million years, where
a civilization has

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.980 align:middle line:84%
worked in that
area and refined it

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.160 align:middle line:84%
to the point of such precision
that the technologies interface

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.450 align:middle line:84%
with consciousness and
directed thought, intent,

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.380 align:middle line:84%
seamlessly and with great
accuracy of content.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.830 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're talking about
when we talk about interstellar

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.620 align:middle line:90%
transdimensional physics.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, why do I say
"transdimensional"?

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.400 align:middle line:84%
I like the word,
"transdimensional,"

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.730 align:middle line:84%
more than
"interdimensional," because--

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.350 align:middle line:84%
and I'll explain
later the difference

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.680 align:middle line:84%
between interdimensional
beings and extraterrestrials

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.630 align:middle line:90%
that are transdimensional.

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.790 align:middle line:84%
But basically, it means
you're transcending

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.470 align:middle line:84%
various dimensions, and you're
able to move from one dimension

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.640 align:middle line:84%
to another, whether it's the
entire spacecraft or just

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.300 align:middle line:84%
the communication system going
from one point to another.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.390 align:middle line:84%
Human technologies are
beginning to really look

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.790 align:middle line:84%
at this in a very intense
way at universities,

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.790 align:middle line:84%
but interstellar civilizations
came this way before.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.270 align:middle line:84%
And so they have much higher
refined versions of it

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.060 align:middle line:84%
so that you can think
to a distant place,

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.970 align:middle line:84%
and there will be a receiver
there to pick it up.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, obviously, there are
innate telepathic abilities

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.150 align:middle line:84%
that humans have, ETs have,
so I call these augmentation

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.890 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.620 align:middle line:84%
So they enhance naturally
occurring capacities,

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.710 align:middle line:84%
because people have experiences
of precognition, telepathy,

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.990 align:middle line:90%
intuition.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.240 align:middle line:84%
Very advanced
interstellar civilizations

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.360 align:middle line:84%
can replicate that
and augment it

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.705 align:middle line:84%
with technologies that are
interfacing with thought.

00:04:13.705 --> 00:04:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And everyone says, oh,
they're reading minds.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.247 align:middle line:84%
I said, no, it's not
like reading minds.

00:04:17.247 --> 00:04:19.329 align:middle line:90%
It has to be directed intent.

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.399 align:middle line:84%
So we call this,
in the protocols

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:24.790 align:middle line:84%
that we're using for contact,
coherent thought sequencing,

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.270 align:middle line:84%
because you're creating
thought very coherently

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.400 align:middle line:84%
as an individual
or group, and it's

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.660 align:middle line:84%
a sequence that you're doing
and repeatable, if necessary--

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:35.770 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Right.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: --so that
it's very clear,

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.940 align:middle line:84%
like where you are, if you
want to guide the ET vehicles

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.380 align:middle line:90%
or people to where you are.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.750 align:middle line:84%
But in the case of
these civilizations,

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.040 align:middle line:84%
as routinely as we pick up a
cell phone or turn on our TV

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.670 align:middle line:84%
and get a radio
frequency signal,

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.640 align:middle line:84%
those civilizations
can use technologies

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.410 align:middle line:90%
interfacing with their thought.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.990 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to
communicate across a million,

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.320 align:middle line:84%
2 million light years
of space, instead

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.750 align:middle line:84%
of taking 2 million
years, it takes

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.800 align:middle line:84%
no time because of this whole
concept of the entangled

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.800 align:middle line:84%
quantum universe, but
the ultimate point

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.400 align:middle line:84%
of non-locality, of
integration, of wholeness

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.280 align:middle line:90%
is the consciousness field.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's why all these
civilizations are a priori.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.680 align:middle line:84%
They must be proficient
and expert in the science

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.030 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And their technologies
will move--

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.480 align:middle line:84%
they are electromagnetic
and thought-integrated.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.070 align:middle line:84%
So I always tell
people, think of you

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.810 align:middle line:90%
have a quanta of thought.

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:38.610 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Yeah.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: You know, and it
is actually something real.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.390 align:middle line:90%
Thought is real.

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And conscious field with
the thought emerging

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.090 align:middle line:84%
from an individual
in thought can

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.330 align:middle line:84%
be transmitted and
received, augmented.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.890 align:middle line:90%
With these technologies.

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.942 align:middle line:84%
And so that's really
what it is, and it

00:05:55.942 --> 00:05:57.900 align:middle line:84%
makes total sense when
you think about the fact

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.050 align:middle line:84%
that you're not going to be able
to communicate to a home planet

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.620 align:middle line:84%
from one star system to another
using the speed of light.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.910 align:middle line:84%
You have to develop these
transdimensional systems

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.580 align:middle line:84%
that increasingly,
once you pierce--

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.470 align:middle line:84%
I call it the crossing
point of light.

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.370 align:middle line:84%
Once you go through the crossing
point of the speed of light,

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.780 align:middle line:84%
you're in some really
interesting stuff.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, at the CIA,
they call it WSFM.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.210 align:middle line:84%
Sounds like a radio
station-- it actually

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.772 align:middle line:84%
stands for Weird Science
and Frickin' Magic.

00:06:26.772 --> 00:06:28.230 align:middle line:84%
That's literally
what they call it.

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.800 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Wow.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:29.600 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: Yeah.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.340 align:middle line:84%
But this is-- civilizations
have to have it.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And we are going to eventually
evolve into a civilization that

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.630 align:middle line:90%
uses those sort of systems.

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:38.550 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Yeah.

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:41.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: But again, we
have to use them only

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.760 align:middle line:84%
for the human good, for
non-violent reasons,

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.472 align:middle line:90%
for peaceful reasons, et cetera.

00:06:46.472 --> 00:06:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
cynically say, oh, we

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.430 align:middle line:90%
can never get there as humans.

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.360 align:middle line:84%
I say, oh, yeah, we
can, because we must.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.900 align:middle line:84%
If we don't get to that point,
we're going to become extinct.

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: Dr. Greer,
can you explain

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.430 align:middle line:84%
the correlation between
consciousness and technology

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:00.990 align:middle line:90%
and how they go together?

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:03.150 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: Yeah, it
flows two ways.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And in the early
'90s, I wrote a paper

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:09.790 align:middle line:84%
about this that called
it technology-assisted

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:10.590 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:14.550 align:middle line:84%
So there-- imagine you would
have a technological system

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:19.170 align:middle line:84%
that you could connect to that
projects your consciousness

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:21.645 align:middle line:84%
or projects your
thought very accurately.

00:07:21.645 --> 00:07:22.530 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: OK.

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:24.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: Now,
interestingly, I mean,

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.700 align:middle line:84%
classified projects
have worked on these.

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:30.600 align:middle line:84%
In 1956, a man had
developed a headset

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:35.040 align:middle line:84%
that did this, a really souped
up version of remote viewing

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.020 align:middle line:84%
that the CIA remote
viewers weren't read into.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.770 align:middle line:10%
This is the technological
end of it, where--

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:42.300 align:middle line:10%
and this man offered
me a set where

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:43.530 align:middle line:10%
you could hook yourself up.

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:48.480 align:middle line:84%
The headset would enable you to
be able to see a remote place

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.390 align:middle line:90%
or see a remote time.

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:53.970 align:middle line:90%
And it was electronic.

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:58.180 align:middle line:84%
But it was electronics at a
certain frequency that crossed,

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.630 align:middle line:84%
that were transdimensional
that would augment awareness

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:02.430 align:middle line:90%
and thought.

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:04.900 align:middle line:84%
So that would be a
technology-assisted

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:05.700 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:09.390 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you have a
spacecraft, and the ET

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:13.800 align:middle line:84%
wants it to go some place, then
connect to it, either touching

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.310 align:middle line:84%
it or just thinking to
it, and think to what

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:19.380 align:middle line:90%
that star system go there.

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:22.680 align:middle line:84%
So it actually is
directing the technology

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:27.730 align:middle line:84%
from the person's thought
and consciousness.

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:29.100 align:middle line:90%
So it goes both ways.

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:32.460 align:middle line:84%
These technologies can be
applied in both directions

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:36.809 align:middle line:84%
where the technology assist
one's personal consciousness

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:38.820 align:middle line:84%
or where your consciousness
is interfacing

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:43.980 align:middle line:84%
with the technological system
and effecting some outcome.

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.920 align:middle line:90%
And those are routine--

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.510 align:middle line:84%
that's just sort
of the big picture.

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:50.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, the applications
of it are really

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:54.630 align:middle line:84%
amazing, which is why you have
so many unusual manifestations

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:57.960 align:middle line:84%
of ETs, because they
are utilizing science

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:01.380 align:middle line:84%
and technology along with their
innate state of consciousness

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:04.290 align:middle line:84%
to do those things, where you
have the same craft in two

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:06.510 align:middle line:90%
places at the same time--

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:11.160 align:middle line:84%
bilocate, et cetera,
or go from one point,

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.870 align:middle line:90%
dematerialized to another.

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:15.600 align:middle line:84%
That's a technology,
but the closer you

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.170 align:middle line:84%
get to a source
of consciousness,

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:23.400 align:middle line:84%
the more seamless it is and
the more efficient it is.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And civilizations evolved for
millions and millions of years,

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:30.510 align:middle line:84%
frankly, refining those
capabilities both innately

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:33.600 align:middle line:84%
in developing consciousness,
meditative states, higher

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.140 align:middle line:90%
states of consciousness.

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:39.060 align:middle line:84%
And a big principle for
people to understand--

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:42.360 align:middle line:84%
the level of
consciousness of a planet

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.940 align:middle line:84%
determines what
technologies they can even

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.750 align:middle line:90%
apprehend and apply.

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:48.200 align:middle line:90%
So you look at our planet--

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.143 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Yeah.

00:09:49.143 --> 00:09:50.310 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: --very destructive.

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:53.380 align:middle line:84%
Energy sources are
destroying the biosphere.

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:57.030 align:middle line:84%
We burn things, blow
things up, split the atom

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:59.490 align:middle line:84%
with all this radioactive
stuff or a nuclear power

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:02.100 align:middle line:90%
plant, et cetera and so on.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.380 align:middle line:90%
And so-- but that goes--

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.900 align:middle line:84%
the aggregate
consciousness of the planet

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:10.260 align:middle line:84%
is still very much
destructive and war-based

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:11.250 align:middle line:90%
and what have you.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:14.250 align:middle line:84%
When civilizations advance--
and we'll go through these

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:15.640 align:middle line:90%
different levels--

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.300 align:middle line:84%
they actually go
into the ability,

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.310 align:middle line:84%
because of their level
of consciousness,

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:23.190 align:middle line:84%
to apply technologies
that are parallel

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:25.170 align:middle line:90%
to the state of awareness.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's where you get
into some really amazing

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:33.330 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial
manifestations and events

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:37.380 align:middle line:84%
that happen that don't fit the
scientific paradigm that we've

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:38.880 align:middle line:84%
been taught,
because we basically

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:43.470 align:middle line:84%
have been in kindergarten
for 100 years in science.

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And most of the really big
breakthroughs in science

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:47.190 align:middle line:90%
have been withheld.

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And I think this
is a big problem,

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:52.200 align:middle line:84%
because, as I call
this the lost century,

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:56.400 align:middle line:84%
there's a century of lost
knowledge, evolution, but also

00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:02.520 align:middle line:84%
scientific development, because
free energy and anti-gravity,

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:07.100 align:middle line:84%
all that was mastered
by the mid-20th century.

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.690 align:middle line:84%
What's been withheld that
people don't even think about,

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:12.330 align:middle line:84%
talk about are these
advanced technologies

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:17.970 align:middle line:84%
related to consciousness and
biological living systems.

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:20.250 align:middle line:84%
So you have a lot
of technologies

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:24.000 align:middle line:84%
that are extraterrestrial,
where they are a conscious nano

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:24.900 align:middle line:90%
biology.

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:29.940 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is that
the systems, even the craft,

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:33.900 align:middle line:84%
are living and conscious, even
though they're technological.

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:37.620 align:middle line:84%
So there's an integration
of life force and biology

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:40.830 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness
with a machine--

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:42.285 align:middle line:90%
very, very advanced.

00:11:42.285 --> 00:11:44.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: How can we
understand the phenomenon

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:48.403 align:middle line:84%
where the ETs and the UAPs
appear to teleport or bilocate?

00:11:48.403 --> 00:11:50.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: Yeah, well,
this is understanding now

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:54.380 align:middle line:90%
the plasticity of space-time.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.040 align:middle line:84%
So we're always thinking
of space as a line,

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.470 align:middle line:84%
but in reality,
every point in space

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:02.590 align:middle line:84%
is connected to every other
point of space not in a line,

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:06.460 align:middle line:84%
but integrated nonlocally, where
it's within like a hologram.

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:11.030 align:middle line:84%
So if you have an operating
technology at that level,

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:15.370 align:middle line:84%
you can be two places
at once, interestingly,

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:19.240 align:middle line:84%
or go from point A to
B almost instantly.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.250 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to be
an ambassador from Earth

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:23.140 align:middle line:84%
to these civilizations,
you kind of

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:26.950 align:middle line:84%
need to understand the
entry level of this,

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:30.460 align:middle line:84%
because you're going to see some
phenomenon that's very, very

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:35.920 align:middle line:84%
unusual, where an ET being
or a craft can be there,

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.600 align:middle line:84%
and in a nanosecond, it's
right in the field with you.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.400 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Yeah.

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.500 align:middle line:10%
>>GREER: And so-- and it's
not moving in a straight line,

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:45.190 align:middle line:10%
and it's interesting even
some of the famous radar cases

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:50.290 align:middle line:10%
in the Disclosure Project,
like the Japan Airlines case,

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:51.640 align:middle line:10%
that massive craft--

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.430 align:middle line:10%
that was ET shaped
kind of like a walnut--

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:56.860 align:middle line:10%
would be at one point,
and then instantly

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:58.450 align:middle line:10%
would be on the other side.

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't like it moved,
and you saw it move like this,

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:02.128 align:middle line:90%
like you see a jetliner.

00:13:02.128 --> 00:13:03.670 align:middle line:10%
It would just be at
point A, and then

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:07.450 align:middle line:10%
point B. The way that happens
is because they're utilizing

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:13.750 align:middle line:10%
technologies that are connecting
to this nonlocal aspect

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:17.950 align:middle line:10%
of space and other dimensions,
because these other dimensions

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:19.000 align:middle line:10%
aren't linear.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.160 align:middle line:84%
And we're always
thinking that everything

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:25.840 align:middle line:84%
has to obey Newtonian
straight line sort of things,

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:29.110 align:middle line:84%
but we're now in an era
where the technologies are

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:31.720 align:middle line:84%
very well understood-- and
classified projects that

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.350 align:middle line:90%
do this.

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do
with-- just a hint--

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:40.780 align:middle line:84%
very high voltage systems
at certain frequencies

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:42.790 align:middle line:90%
and resonant vibrations.

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And that will then create a
vector, an opening, a portal,

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:49.510 align:middle line:84%
if you will, that goes
beyond linear space-time

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:52.450 align:middle line:84%
into these other dimensions
up to and including,

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:57.670 align:middle line:84%
if you're very advanced, into
the so-called astral thought

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:02.510 align:middle line:84%
forms and pure thought and
the consciousness fields.

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:08.950 align:middle line:84%
So this whole cosmic
understanding, I call this--

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:12.400 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have to
develop this cosmic navigator

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:16.060 align:middle line:84%
in understanding what we're
dealing with, because, really,

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:18.550 align:middle line:84%
the physics that we're
taught is really dealing

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:22.750 align:middle line:84%
with little steps
around the periphery

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:26.200 align:middle line:84%
of the big breakthroughs that
ended up being classified back

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.330 align:middle line:90%
in the '50s, '60s, and forward.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:31.480 align:middle line:84%
So interstellar
civilizations, if they're

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.990 align:middle line:84%
going to go from point A to
B, have to be able to do that.

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And they have to create
an opening in space-time

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.870 align:middle line:84%
in one point, go to another
point in space-time,

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:43.630 align:middle line:84%
but not this way,
because in reality,

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:46.720 align:middle line:84%
this point in space-time
is actually right here

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:51.190 align:middle line:84%
through this other
transdimensional field that

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:55.540 align:middle line:84%
has very specific scientific
laws that govern it.

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:58.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's very different
from the Newtonian ones.

00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:00.170 align:middle line:84%
So there's a very
different-- and it

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:03.850 align:middle line:84%
has to do with the very
high voltage systems.

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:06.880 align:middle line:84%
The real action there has to
do with the magnetic fields,

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.680 align:middle line:84%
but it's understood,
and it's been

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:11.690 align:middle line:84%
well researched and
classified projects as well.

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:12.490 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Yes.

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:14.032 align:middle line:10%
>>GREER: The reason
someone who wants

00:15:14.032 --> 00:15:16.630 align:middle line:10%
to know about this subject
and me, the CE-5 contact

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:19.240 align:middle line:10%
ambassador, the phenomenon
that you're going to see,

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.520 align:middle line:10%
the different things
you're going to experience

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:26.740 align:middle line:10%
are all related to understanding
this transdimensional cosmos

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:29.740 align:middle line:10%
and that that's why
these ET craft don't

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:31.660 align:middle line:10%
have to be full on 3D.

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:34.300 align:middle line:10%
They can be in another
dimension and be partially

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:38.730 align:middle line:10%
in this dimension,
fully in this dimension.

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:41.160 align:middle line:84%
They can affect our
electronic systems

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.890 align:middle line:84%
and communicate
very specifically

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:47.648 align:middle line:84%
by going within space-time
and not a direct line signal.

00:15:47.648 --> 00:15:48.690 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you an example.

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:50.470 align:middle line:84%
We'll be sitting
around with 30 people.

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:53.460 align:middle line:84%
All the people have
different magnetometers

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:55.890 align:middle line:84%
that pick up electronic
signals, but they'll only

00:15:55.890 --> 00:16:00.960 align:middle line:84%
pick one to start communicating
with, or like a police radar

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.220 align:middle line:90%
detector.

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:04.350 align:middle line:84%
You would think that
if a linear beam is

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:06.090 align:middle line:84%
hitting that small
area, they'd all

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:07.770 align:middle line:90%
go off, like on the highway.

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:11.650 align:middle line:84%
No, they'll pick one and start
communicating with the signal.

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:13.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's only
because they're not

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:14.790 align:middle line:90%
doing it in a straight line.

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:16.620 align:middle line:90%
They're doing it from within--

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:20.548 align:middle line:84%
let's just call it infra
space, within space-time

00:16:20.548 --> 00:16:21.840 align:middle line:90%
through these other dimensions.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:25.635 align:middle line:84%
And that explains a lot of the
things that people experience.

00:16:25.635 --> 00:16:26.760 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Right, absolutely.

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:27.560 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:31.230 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain what phase
shifting is and how it works?

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:32.730 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: Yeah, so
often, people will

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:36.930 align:middle line:84%
have a sighting of an
ET craft or a being,

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:42.510 align:middle line:84%
and they will literally be
full on, where you see it 3D.

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:47.250 align:middle line:10%
And then it can shift
phasically and resonantly

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:50.940 align:middle line:10%
so that it's not really
clear, but it's still there.

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:53.910 align:middle line:10%
And it can be everything from--

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:57.270 align:middle line:10%
I liken this to the old
radio stations, where

00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:00.390 align:middle line:10%
you could be on the AM
dial and turn the dial,

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:02.202 align:middle line:10%
and you can hear
New York, and then

00:17:02.202 --> 00:17:03.660 align:middle line:10%
if you're in the
right place, you'd

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:05.400 align:middle line:10%
hear New York and Chicago.

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.200 align:middle line:90%
And they're bleeding together.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:12.240 align:middle line:84%
So these-- you can have
technologies, which ETs do,

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.859 align:middle line:84%
and also classified
projects that

00:17:13.859 --> 00:17:17.790 align:middle line:84%
develop these, where you can
be partially in this dimension

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:19.349 align:middle line:90%
and partially not.

00:17:19.349 --> 00:17:22.200 align:middle line:10%
So when you're doing
this, it's really

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:27.690 align:middle line:10%
on a spectrum, where it's going
from full on in this dimension

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:32.430 align:middle line:10%
to something that's really
not quite there fully,

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:34.560 align:middle line:10%
but you can just
see-- it might look

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:38.212 align:middle line:10%
like a hologram or an
energy field or a sphere.

00:17:38.212 --> 00:17:39.420 align:middle line:10%
And I'll give you an example.

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:42.090 align:middle line:10%
We've had many
experiences where we

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:46.350 align:middle line:10%
will see what looks like a
little sphere or teardrop

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:49.770 align:middle line:10%
object, and the camera
will pick it up,

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:51.090 align:middle line:10%
and you'll see the whole craft.

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:54.750 align:middle line:84%
The naked eye only sees
part of it, so a lot of it

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:59.850 align:middle line:84%
has to do with frequency and
resonant field and vibration,

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:01.600 align:middle line:90%
and then the density.

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.320 align:middle line:84%
And that is all
controlled electronically,

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.880 align:middle line:90%
electromagnetics.

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.340 align:middle line:84%
So these are the very
advanced electromagnetics

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:10.710 align:middle line:84%
that began to be
experimented with literally

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:12.600 align:middle line:90%
in the late 1800s on Earth.

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:14.430 align:middle line:84%
A lot of that was
sort of sanitized out

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:15.990 align:middle line:90%
of the literature.

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:20.910 align:middle line:10%
And even in the late 1920s,
you had T Townsend Brown--

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:25.140 align:middle line:10%
had very high voltage systems
causing levitation effects,

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:26.670 align:middle line:10%
masslessness.

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:28.860 align:middle line:10%
And, really, what
that is is that you're

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:33.150 align:middle line:10%
doing a very high voltage
system at low intake power that

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:38.190 align:middle line:10%
is at a certain
frequency, and the item,

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:42.690 align:middle line:10%
it actually takes on
increasing masslessness

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:45.150 align:middle line:10%
that has to do with
the magnetic field

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:48.360 align:middle line:10%
and the alteration
of the atomic--

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.913 align:middle line:10%
subatomic particles.

00:18:49.913 --> 00:18:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And I won't get
too far into that,

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:52.980 align:middle line:90%
but that's why it levitates.

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:57.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, an enlightened meditator
can meditate or just

00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:00.360 align:middle line:84%
spontaneously have happen
an experience, where

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:03.180 align:middle line:84%
in consciousness,
there is a shift

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:06.570 align:middle line:84%
in that resonant frequency
from the consciousness

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:09.990 align:middle line:84%
through the astral body
to the physical body

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:12.510 align:middle line:84%
that causes you to
be able to levitate.

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:17.320 align:middle line:84%
So there are corollaries
to the human experience

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:19.500 align:middle line:90%
and what are called the--

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:21.630 align:middle line:90%
to these technologies.

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:24.580 align:middle line:84%
And everyone thinks that
this is completely unrelated.

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:25.380 align:middle line:90%
It isn't.

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:28.290 align:middle line:84%
It's just there are
different bodies of knowledge

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:30.090 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to
have to pull together

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:33.570 align:middle line:84%
into a sort of a real
unified understanding of how

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:36.720 align:middle line:90%
the cosmos is woven together.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.100 align:middle line:90%
Here's what's interesting.

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:41.040 align:middle line:84%
Even though consciousness
is omnipresent,

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:44.010 align:middle line:84%
the experience of it
in the relative sphere

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:47.940 align:middle line:84%
of our individuality
is really enhanced

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:51.360 align:middle line:84%
once you go into deeper
meditative states, and then

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:53.130 align:middle line:90%
the lucid dream state.

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:55.260 align:middle line:84%
These are all states
of consciousness

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:58.020 align:middle line:84%
that begin to show
different abilities.

00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:00.990 align:middle line:84%
It's why so many people
have a lucid dream,

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:04.470 align:middle line:84%
and they're flying, and
they see something that

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:06.510 align:middle line:90%
is really there in the future.

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:08.610 align:middle line:84%
This is lucid dreams
of the future.

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:11.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, imagine
having a technology

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:14.010 align:middle line:84%
where you could
do the same thing.

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:15.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's an
interesting story.

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:19.470 align:middle line:84%
Some guys who worked at the
Bell Labs in Murray Hill--

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:24.240 align:middle line:84%
and they had acquired an
extraterrestrial device

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:28.680 align:middle line:84%
that was a spherical device
about the size of a soccer ball

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.750 align:middle line:90%
that was being studied.

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And it was an interstellar
communication system.

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And there was a general
overseeing that project,

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:42.890 align:middle line:84%
and this device suddenly started
communicating to the scientists

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:45.720 align:middle line:90%
telepathically.

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:49.950 align:middle line:84%
The general-- they're studying
this for very bad purposes.

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:51.353 align:middle line:90%
Please destroy me.

00:20:51.353 --> 00:20:52.770 align:middle line:84%
It kept saying,
please destroy me.

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:54.210 align:middle line:90%
This is a true story.

00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:56.050 align:middle line:90%
I mean stranger things are true.

00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:58.590 align:middle line:84%
So they eventually
became convinced

00:20:58.590 --> 00:20:59.950 align:middle line:90%
that this was the case.

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:01.560 align:middle line:84%
So they took this
device and put it

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:04.200 align:middle line:84%
in some kind of
microwave or other.

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.450 align:middle line:84%
It was supposed to study
it and deliberately

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:08.490 align:middle line:90%
melted it and just [BLOWS].

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:11.910 align:middle line:84%
And the very last thing that
came out of this blob of stuff

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:13.787 align:middle line:90%
was, thank you.

00:21:13.787 --> 00:21:14.620 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Incredible.

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:14.910 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: Yeah.

00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:15.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: Can you tell
us a little bit more

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:19.050 align:middle line:84%
how the cities connect to ET
technology and different levels

00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:20.433 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness?

00:21:20.433 --> 00:21:22.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: Yeah, so my own
experience with this,

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:24.510 align:middle line:90%
I became a meditation teacher.

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And I was in this state of--
we were meditating maybe

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:30.520 align:middle line:84%
eight hours a day up
in Livingston Manor

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:31.320 align:middle line:90%
up in New York.

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And one day, I went outside the
building to walk in the field,

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:39.930 align:middle line:84%
and I was just in a state of
joy and bliss and happiness.

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:43.410 align:middle line:90%
And I levitated, so I lifted up.

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:45.983 align:middle line:84%
And then my monkey
mind kicked in going,

00:21:45.983 --> 00:21:46.900 align:middle line:90%
how is this happening?

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:49.860 align:middle line:84%
My intellect kicked
in, and I just went--

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:52.120 align:middle line:84%
but it was this spontaneous
levitation experience.

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:54.810 align:middle line:84%
But what it taught
me was that there

00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:59.520 align:middle line:84%
is a physics of the
cities and that this can

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.710 align:middle line:90%
be studied, and then applied.

00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:03.780 align:middle line:84%
And these extraterrestrial
civilizations

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:07.140 align:middle line:84%
that I'd had had the
contact experience with

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:10.180 align:middle line:84%
have mastered that both
on a personal level,

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:12.400 align:middle line:84%
but also on a
technological level.

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:16.830 align:middle line:84%
So as I said, that begins
to become very much

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:20.670 align:middle line:84%
the center of their world
view, universal view

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:25.680 align:middle line:84%
is that consciousness
becomes the primary science

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:29.670 align:middle line:84%
and all its applications, both
innately through developing

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:32.520 align:middle line:84%
higher states of consciousness,
but also, interestingly,

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:34.500 align:middle line:84%
from all their
technological systems.

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:38.740 align:middle line:84%
All of them become integrated
with the consciousness field,

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:43.440 align:middle line:84%
which is why I say very
clearly, the big science

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.420 align:middle line:84%
of the next 1,000
years is going to be

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:48.840 align:middle line:84%
the science of consciousness
and all its applications.

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: In ancient
India, the ancient text

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.850 align:middle line:84%
talks about Vimanas, these
craft that can fly silently.

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:55.650 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: Yeah.

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:57.025 align:middle line:84%

any correlation

00:22:57.025 --> 00:22:59.233 align:middle line:90%
between Vimanas and the UAPs?

00:22:59.233 --> 00:23:00.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: You know, I
think that in a lot

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:02.820 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient
literature, as well

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:06.960 align:middle line:84%
as caveman drawings and
stuff, you see these objects.

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:09.370 align:middle line:84%
I think there are two
things happening there.

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:11.730 align:middle line:84%
I think there are
ancient peoples who

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:14.490 align:middle line:84%
observed extraterrestrial
vehicles,

00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:17.370 align:middle line:84%
but I think in some
of those cases,

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:20.490 align:middle line:84%
there have been civilizations
on this planet that

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:23.400 align:middle line:84%
have developed and gotten
pretty close or past where

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:28.380 align:middle line:84%
we are, and then hadn't learned
the lesson of not engaging

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:29.410 align:middle line:90%
in warfare.

00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:34.830 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, once you
hit the nuclear and very high

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:38.880 align:middle line:84%
voltage physics,
transdimensional technologies,

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:41.790 align:middle line:84%
if you don't become
a peaceful planet,

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:46.050 align:middle line:84%
those technologies are
civilization-ending.

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:49.410 align:middle line:84%
So that's the big leap
that has to happen,

00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:53.670 align:middle line:84%
and civilizations that
pass through that gate

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:57.390 align:middle line:84%
sociologically, spiritually,
can go on and on indefinitely.

00:23:57.390 --> 00:23:59.760 align:middle line:84%
If they don't,
they are shut down,

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:00.990 align:middle line:90%
because they self-destruct.

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:03.510 align:middle line:84%
The key thing to understand
about the time we're in--

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:07.170 align:middle line:84%
I was describing
this phase transition

00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:09.630 align:middle line:84%
with a super
fluidity and helium.

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:16.320 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly-- and it's
really a great example

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:20.100 align:middle line:84%
of where we are
sociologically in this time

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:21.450 align:middle line:90%
and place on Earth.

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:24.750 align:middle line:84%
And when you reach this
point where you have--

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:28.890 align:middle line:84%
just before there's complete
coherence of all the helium

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:32.910 align:middle line:90%
molecules, they begin to align.

00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:36.780 align:middle line:84%
Literally, they became
coherent atoms of helium.

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:40.770 align:middle line:84%
At about the 1% point--
this is what's key--

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:45.360 align:middle line:84%
at about 1%, you get
this phase transition.

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:48.480 align:middle line:84%
But just before the transition,
everything's chaotic.

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:52.200 align:middle line:84%
The whole container becomes
roiling, boiling, crazy.

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And then it's like
the whole container

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:58.890 align:middle line:84%
becomes what's called
super fluidity, where it

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:00.690 align:middle line:90%
can come in and out and over.

00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:04.580 align:middle line:84%
It takes on all these coherent,
almost magical properties.

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:09.000 align:middle line:84%
So our civilization is building
up to that 1% of coherence.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.060 align:middle line:84%
This is why in the
CE-5 contact protocols,

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:15.960 align:middle line:84%
we talk about if we could
get 1% of the population

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:19.080 align:middle line:84%
meditating, but also
peacefully connecting

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:20.790 align:middle line:90%
to these civilizations.

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:22.650 align:middle line:90%
When we hit that, about 1%--

00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:24.600 align:middle line:84%
it could be less,
if people are very

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:27.870 align:middle line:84%
powerful in their meditation--
the entire civilization will

00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:28.920 align:middle line:90%
shift.

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:31.110 align:middle line:84%
But we're going
through that now,

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:34.650 align:middle line:84%
where you have increasing
consciousness, people

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:38.220 align:middle line:84%
becoming awake, at the
same time, increasing chaos

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:39.450 align:middle line:90%
and violence.

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:41.140 align:middle line:90%
But those go together.

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:44.670 align:middle line:84%
It's how one is this,
the eddy and chaos of one

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:47.070 align:middle line:90%
era transitioning to another.

00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:50.760 align:middle line:84%
And we're people on this
planet right now navigating

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:53.860 align:middle line:90%
through that phase transition.

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:59.490 align:middle line:84%
So we are in a transitory
period between an old cycle

00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:02.960 align:middle line:84%
of a few hundred thousand years
and a new cycle of about half a

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:03.760 align:middle line:90%
million years.

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:04.635 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Interesting.

00:26:04.635 --> 00:26:07.000 align:middle line:84%
So it's like the
resetting of entropy.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.040 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: And these
interstellar civilizations

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.490 align:middle line:90%
absolutely know that.

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And so there's
great huge potential

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:14.930 align:middle line:90%
on Earth going forward.

00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:17.110 align:middle line:84%
But it's also fraught
with some dangers,

00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:20.630 align:middle line:84%
because, at this point,
here's the big problem.

00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:23.050 align:middle line:84%
Our technologies
have gotten way ahead

00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:25.420 align:middle line:84%
of our spiritual and
social development.

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:28.750 align:middle line:84%
And if that-- in that
case, a civilization

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:32.200 align:middle line:84%
is at the risk of some of the
tales of ancient civilizations

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:35.420 align:middle line:84%
on Earth that vanished
and blew themselves up.

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:38.920 align:middle line:84%
That's why we have to develop
higher states of consciousness,

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:41.320 align:middle line:90%
meditative states, and peace.

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:43.300 align:middle line:84%
With the peace,
world peace would

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:45.940 align:middle line:90%
have been fine 100 years ago.

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:47.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have to think
universal peace,

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:51.040 align:middle line:84%
because there are a lot of
interstellar civilizations

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:52.390 align:middle line:90%
watching.

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:55.780 align:middle line:84%
We've done things, such as
atomic weapons and others, that

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:59.920 align:middle line:84%
have created chaos in
their dimensions and worlds

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:01.960 align:middle line:90%
by detonating those bombs.

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.390 align:middle line:84%
It literally releases
a transdimensional

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:07.900 align:middle line:84%
signal that damages
other planets

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:11.650 align:middle line:84%
and the superhighway of
communication and travel

00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:12.800 align:middle line:90%
that's transdimensional.

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:13.600 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Yeah.

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:17.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: So we're at a
point where to go forward,

00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:20.740 align:middle line:84%
it isn't like it's just a nice
philosophical kumbaya thing.

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:27.165 align:middle line:84%
It's a matter of the survival
of our time to become peaceful.

00:27:27.165 --> 00:27:28.540 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean
everyone on Earth

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:30.160 align:middle line:90%
will be in a state of samadhi.

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:33.850 align:middle line:84%
It just means that we're not
flat out murdering everybody

00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:35.830 align:middle line:84%
and going to
endless, endless wars

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:38.500 align:middle line:84%
with increasingly
dangerous technologies.

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:41.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: So you spoke about
the Vimanas of ancient India,

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:44.830 align:middle line:84%
and you talked about the
Vedas and the technology,

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:47.350 align:middle line:84%
how consciousness can
merge with technology,

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:49.360 align:middle line:90%
and ETs have this capability.

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:52.885 align:middle line:84%
Now, here, we are moving
into the nanotechnology era.

00:27:52.885 --> 00:27:55.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, how can those
nanotechnologies

00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:57.880 align:middle line:84%
help us move in the
way of combining

00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:00.652 align:middle line:84%
that with consciousness and
advancing the human race?

00:28:00.652 --> 00:28:02.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: Well,
actually, the people

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:04.330 align:middle line:84%
we've met with who've been
in classified projects

00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:06.190 align:middle line:84%
have already worked
on that, where

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:09.520 align:middle line:84%
they have nano tubules
that are interfacing

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:12.850 align:middle line:84%
with the consciousness field
that create that effect.

00:28:12.850 --> 00:28:17.200 align:middle line:84%
Those are highly classified,
so think of it this way.

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:20.500 align:middle line:84%
We're always looking at only
the electromagnetic part

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:23.920 align:middle line:84%
of this in terms of zero-point
energy, free energy,

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:27.100 align:middle line:84%
anti-gravity,
which is important.

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:31.720 align:middle line:84%
What's equally important is that
there's a biological component,

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:34.600 align:middle line:84%
and the biological
component-- remember,

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:36.550 align:middle line:90%
the life force and biology--

00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:40.780 align:middle line:84%
is actually emanating first
from the consciousness

00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:44.140 align:middle line:84%
field and the
fields of let's call

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:48.880 align:middle line:84%
it the thought body and astral
and the interface between that

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:52.360 align:middle line:84%
and the physical body and
the biological system.

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:55.570 align:middle line:84%
And it isn't that the
brain and the body

00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:57.160 align:middle line:90%
manifest consciousness.

00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:00.130 align:middle line:84%
It's that consciousness
and these other dimensions

00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:04.420 align:middle line:84%
manifest the body, so
we've headed upside down

00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:06.920 align:middle line:84%
in our reductionist
scientific paradigm.

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:10.100 align:middle line:84%
So if we get it correct, and
you begin to understand it,

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:11.920 align:middle line:84%
then you understand
that you can do things

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:15.070 align:middle line:84%
at a deep level
that then empowers

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:19.690 align:middle line:84%
the biological systems, the
technological systems, all

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:22.760 align:middle line:84%
with this element that's
much more advanced,

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:25.060 align:middle line:84%
that's interdimensional,
transdimensional.

00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
you're talking

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:29.380 align:middle line:84%
about with these
nanotechnological

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:30.410 align:middle line:90%
breakthroughs.

00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:34.550 align:middle line:84%
It's also-- it's a merger
of not just nano biology,

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:37.960 align:middle line:84%
but also nanotechnology
and consciousness.

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:41.000 align:middle line:84%
So you have to add the
conscious element to it,

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.680 align:middle line:84%
and that's where it becomes
extraordinarily advanced.

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.870 align:middle line:84%
That's why a number
of the people I've

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:49.930 align:middle line:84%
dealt with who've been at the
retrieval sites of downed ET

00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:53.650 align:middle line:90%
craft have said--

00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:57.250 align:middle line:84%
the way they describe it is the
beings, most usually they're

00:29:57.250 --> 00:30:02.200 align:middle line:84%
dead, but some are alive,
but the craft itself

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.540 align:middle line:90%
is conscious and alive.

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:09.280 align:middle line:84%
And one of our witnesses who was
on the Peruvian-Bolivian border

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:13.690 align:middle line:84%
when it was hit with a directed
energy weapon and crashed,

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:16.900 align:middle line:84%
he said that it was
trying to heal itself,

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:18.983 align:middle line:84%
like a time lapse of
a cut on your skin--

00:30:18.983 --> 00:30:19.900 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Right, right.

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:22.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: --where this
machine was actually

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:27.130 align:middle line:84%
behaving in a biological,
cell-free healing way.

00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:32.450 align:middle line:84%
So you have this merger
of life and nanobiology,

00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:34.670 align:middle line:84%
technology, and
the consciousness

00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:37.000 align:middle line:84%
the occupants of the
craft are actually

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.220 align:middle line:90%
integrated with the craft.

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:43.060 align:middle line:84%
So this is a very full
spectrum technology,

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:47.410 align:middle line:84%
and everyone's expectations is
that the ET craft and beings

00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:49.940 align:middle line:84%
are going to appear the way
it does in a Steven Spielberg

00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:50.740 align:middle line:90%
movie.

00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:54.400 align:middle line:10%
Well, just put that out of your
mind, because the truth of it

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:58.000 align:middle line:10%
is so much more beautiful
and amazing and magical,

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.790 align:middle line:10%
and it's just--
it's astonishing.

00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:06.370 align:middle line:10%
It's never-ending fascination
once you get up close

00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:08.930 align:middle line:10%
and start doing CE-5 contact.

00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:09.730 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Excellent.

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:10.855 align:middle line:90%
I'm looking forward to it.

00:31:10.855 --> 00:31:11.980 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you, Dr. Greer.

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:13.355 align:middle line:84%
This was a great
interview again.

00:31:13.355 --> 00:31:14.295 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: Thank you.

00:31:14.295 --> 00:31:15.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: My name
is Billy Carson.

00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:17.795 align:middle line:10%
Thank you for watching this
episode of "Disclosure"

00:31:17.795 --> 00:31:20.040 align:middle line:10%
with Dr. Steven Greer.

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:23.000 align:middle line:90%
