Greer.

In this final
episode, we discuss

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.410 align:middle line:84%
what is in store for
humanity looking forward.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.940 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Greer, welcome
to Disclosure.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.190 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. STEVEN GREER: Thank you.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.200 align:middle line:90%
Great seeing you.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.867 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: Dr. Greer,
you mentioned a time

00:00:31.867 --> 00:00:33.590 align:middle line:84%
where consciousness
and science actually

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.175 align:middle line:90%
merged together as one.

00:00:35.175 --> 00:00:36.300 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell us about that?

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.675 align:middle line:10%
>>DR. GREER: Yeah,
we're actually

00:00:37.675 --> 00:00:39.320 align:middle line:10%
in the early stages
of this integration

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.750 align:middle line:10%
where the paradigm
of reductionism,

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.270 align:middle line:10%
traditional science,
dividing things into parts,

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.450 align:middle line:10%
understanding how
things work are

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.928 align:middle line:10%
beginning to be integrated with
the science of consciousness.

00:00:51.928 --> 00:00:53.720 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of work
that's been pioneered

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.980 align:middle line:84%
by Dr. John at Princeton and the
Princeton Engineering Anomalies

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.360 align:middle line:84%
Research Lab, the
Peer Lab, and others.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
the big problem has

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.610 align:middle line:84%
been there are massive leaps
forward that have occurred over

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.030 align:middle line:84%
the last 70 years,
and classified

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.370 align:middle line:84%
projects, and particularly,
since the late 1950s

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.640 align:middle line:84%
that unfortunately the public
are not being told about

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.820 align:middle line:84%
and our society is
not benefiting from.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.520 align:middle line:84%
But the basic understanding
of it is there,

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.990 align:middle line:84%
and this is the understanding
that the field of consciousness

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.510 align:middle line:84%
and the non-local
what physicists

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.505 align:middle line:84%
call it entangled
cosmos is very much

00:01:37.505 --> 00:01:41.330 align:middle line:84%
accessible through
consciousness and thought.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.260 align:middle line:10%
And of course, many people like
Dr. Russell Targ, who I know

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.360 align:middle line:10%
has come out from the shadows
talking about the CIA projects

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.210 align:middle line:10%
in remote viewing
and their accuracy.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.700 align:middle line:10%
I knew Ingo Swann years ago,
who is a renowned remote viewer,

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:06.230 align:middle line:10%
and what you find is that that
whole area of routinely using

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.169 align:middle line:10%
consciousness to obtain
information, that's

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:10.820 align:middle line:10%
all coming out more and more.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.800 align:middle line:84%
Although, mainstream
science still

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.130 align:middle line:84%
wants to relegate
it to the fringes.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.950 align:middle line:84%
The good news is that you
have various universities that

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.460 align:middle line:84%
have consciousness study
programs now looking into this,

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.730 align:middle line:84%
and it's becoming more and
more funded and looked at.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.550 align:middle line:84%
But again, they're doing things
from starting at scratch.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.370 align:middle line:84%
If we can get some of this
information and technology

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.540 align:middle line:84%
out classified projects use
for constructive purposes,

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.090 align:middle line:84%
we take a big huge
quantum leap forward,

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.850 align:middle line:84%
and as we go forward
as a civilization,

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.700 align:middle line:84%
this will become a routine
part of our education.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, children will be taught
meditation at an early age,

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.630 align:middle line:84%
what consciousness is,
not what you're aware of.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.290 align:middle line:84%
Everybody confuses like a
'60s awareness building.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.780 align:middle line:84%
No, I'm talking about
what actual awareness

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.600 align:middle line:90%
and consciousness is.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.050 align:middle line:84%
That's very different because
I think we're not really

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.510 align:middle line:84%
teaching our children from K
through 12 or even universities

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.030 align:middle line:84%
anything about that,
and in reality, it

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.050 align:middle line:84%
needs to be taught very early
on so that they can understand

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.890 align:middle line:90%
the cosmos they're living in.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And that would then inform
all the scientific research,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.820 align:middle line:84%
medical research there are a
lot of practical applications

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.260 align:middle line:84%
to this, and that's
something we're not

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.690 align:middle line:84%
prioritizing because
it hasn't gone

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.350 align:middle line:90%
into acceptance large scale.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.250 align:middle line:90%
It will at some point.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.170 align:middle line:84%
But that's the reality of these
civilizations already visiting

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.110 align:middle line:84%
and the classified
projects that have studied

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.520 align:middle line:84%
this for 70 plus years is
that those technologies

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.862 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness studies
have been very well developed.

00:03:51.862 --> 00:03:53.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: I read before
that you mentioned

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.020 align:middle line:84%
that Earth is under some
type of a cosmic quarantine.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And so this quarantine, can
you explain the quarantine,

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.457 align:middle line:84%
and why are we under
quarantine in the first place?

00:04:02.457 --> 00:04:04.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. GREER: I
mentioned it and coined

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.140 align:middle line:90%
that concept back in the 90s.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.030 align:middle line:10%
And really what it
is, is, you know,

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.450 align:middle line:10%
if you want a passport
to other star systems,

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.660 align:middle line:10%
you have to become a level one
civilization, level one, level

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.180 align:middle line:10%
two, which we went through
in the last episode

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.063 align:middle line:10%
because if you're still
a warfaring civilization,

00:04:22.063 --> 00:04:23.480 align:middle line:10%
you're going to
be allowed to have

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.010 align:middle line:10%
a certain amount of alacrity
and freedom and movement

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.110 align:middle line:10%
in your own solar system.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.540 align:middle line:84%
But our solar system
is Earth and a couple

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.850 align:middle line:84%
of few other planets,
you're not going

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.910 align:middle line:84%
to be going out
interstellar bamming around

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.950 align:middle line:84%
because my CE-5 contact teams
have had contact experiences

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.480 align:middle line:84%
with civilizations that have
never had the concept of war

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:52.130 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't
evolve from primates.

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.960 align:middle line:84%
We're 98% identical our genetic
material to a chimpanzee,

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.540 align:middle line:84%
and those do
organize into troops

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.830 align:middle line:84%
and engage in battle
and troops and tribes.

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.960 align:middle line:84%
And humans have this, I
think, as sort of our legacy

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.370 align:middle line:84%
that we have to transcend as
we become so technologically

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:20.000 align:middle line:84%
advanced that proclivity towards
division, otherness, racism,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.370 align:middle line:84%
us-versus-them mentality becomes
an extinction consciousness.

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.010 align:middle line:84%
And so, we can't, you know,
this life here is precious,

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.830 align:middle line:84%
this Earth is precious,
and humanity is precious.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:38.020 align:middle line:84%
But to get to the next phase,
we have to have universal peace.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And so once a civilization
reaches that point where

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.950 align:middle line:84%
they have a
permanent peace, they

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.970 align:middle line:84%
have renounced resolving
to military violence

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.560 align:middle line:84%
for resolving differences, then
the universe opens its arms to.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:59.710 align:middle line:84%
Until such time, it's
truncated, it's limited.

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And I know people
in the military

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:04.870 align:middle line:84%
I've spoken to and at the
Defense Intelligence Agency,

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.180 align:middle line:84%
where we had certain
satellites pointed

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:12.610 align:middle line:84%
out targeting ET assets,
and they just simply

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:13.990 align:middle line:90%
would shut them down.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.040 align:middle line:84%
And it was an interesting
series of conversations.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.280 align:middle line:84%
The problem is the people
running those projects feel

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.720 align:middle line:90%
that they should be omnipotent.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.822 align:middle line:84%
They have this God complex
of Masters of the Universe,

00:06:26.822 --> 00:06:28.780 align:middle line:84%
and they don't like having
their wings clipped,

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.280 align:middle line:84%
and that causes them to
even be more aggressive.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.650 align:middle line:84%
So there's an escalating
tit for tat sort of things

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.630 align:middle line:84%
that have happened that
need to be resolved.

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.120 align:middle line:84%
And it isn't going
to be resolved

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.220 align:middle line:84%
with the level of
consciousness that created it.

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.040 align:middle line:84%
As Einstein said, it has to
be resolved from people who

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.890 align:middle line:90%
have cooler heads, wiser heads.

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:51.790 align:middle line:84%
God forbid that this
whole exoracism comes

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:53.590 align:middle line:90%
into it, you know, where--

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.930 align:middle line:84%
Oh, well, this
civilization's good

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.480 align:middle line:84%
and this whole
species is bad, then

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.970 align:middle line:84%
we're going to align with
this one and fight that one.

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:04.900 align:middle line:84%
Great for a Star Wars
movie, horrible policy

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.760 align:middle line:84%
going forward because there's
no way that survivable.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.410 align:middle line:84%
So these civilizations are
waiting for us to grow up.

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:15.970 align:middle line:84%
I liken this to the phases
of maturation of a human.

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:19.570 align:middle line:84%
You have your
infancy, childhood.

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Humanity right now is in its
rambunctious adolescent phase,

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:29.200 align:middle line:84%
and the hallmark of maturity
of our species as a body

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.360 align:middle line:84%
is universal peace,
not just world peace,

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.450 align:middle line:90%
but peace out there as well.

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:37.730 align:middle line:84%
So that's really the big
undertaking that has to happen,

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:39.040 align:middle line:90%
and then we get cleared.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.840 align:middle line:84%
Everything is possible
at that point.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: If we're trying to
move out past our solar system,

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:46.780 align:middle line:84%
would they just maybe use
their advanced technology

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:50.530 align:middle line:84%
to shut us down, turn off our
power supply on our spacecraft?

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:52.847 align:middle line:84%
What do you think they
would do to hold us back?

00:07:52.847 --> 00:07:54.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. GREER: It's
been made very clear

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:56.590 align:middle line:90%
that there's a red line here.

00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:01.870 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to allow a
group of frankly sociopaths

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:05.020 align:middle line:84%
who have this kind of
amazing power and technology

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.930 align:middle line:84%
to go out and victimize
completely innocent planets,

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:10.990 align:middle line:90%
just isn't going to happen.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And you know it's quite clear
that's not in the cards.

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:16.280 align:middle line:90%
We're going to get there.

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.843 align:middle line:84%
I'm optimistic, but
we're not there yet.

00:08:18.843 --> 00:08:20.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: What do
you think it will

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.105 align:middle line:84%
take to free ourselves
from this quarantine

00:08:22.105 --> 00:08:23.230 align:middle line:90%
that we're under right now?

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:25.972 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. GREER: Well, we have to
become a peaceful civilization.

00:08:25.972 --> 00:08:27.430 align:middle line:84%
So there is why
it's very important

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:32.289 align:middle line:84%
that there be a global decision
to keep all weapons out

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:36.370 align:middle line:84%
of space, to announce that
we're not alone in the universe,

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:40.419 align:middle line:84%
and we need to have
a overt recognized

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:44.890 align:middle line:84%
global diplomatic contact
with these civilizations,

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:49.220 align:middle line:84%
not let it be in the hands of
secret military operations.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:52.030 align:middle line:84%
See, and this is where
it's been a huge mistake.

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:54.400 align:middle line:84%
People I've talked to
who are in the system

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.790 align:middle line:84%
recognize that the
secrecy created

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:03.670 align:middle line:84%
a bubble where things could
happen without any checks

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:06.760 align:middle line:84%
and balances, which
is always dangerous

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.670 align:middle line:84%
and sort of a hermetically
sealed echo chamber.

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:13.790 align:middle line:84%
And from that, all kinds
of mistakes were made.

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
only way to resolve

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:20.890 align:middle line:84%
is have the wise
people on the planet

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:24.250 align:middle line:84%
be ambassadors to
these civilizations.

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:27.280 align:middle line:84%
I had a lucid dream
back in the 70s,

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.100 align:middle line:84%
where I saw this beautiful
event that happened,

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:32.860 align:middle line:84%
and ironically, it looked
like it was at white sands,

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.360 align:middle line:90%
and I was there.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.470 align:middle line:90%
I was older.

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:37.330 align:middle line:84%
There were a lot of
people who were there.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.430 align:middle line:10%
It was being supported
by governments

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:43.690 align:middle line:10%
and the military protectively,
and in broad daylight,

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:46.780 align:middle line:10%
a sort of egg-shaped
seamless craft

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:52.090 align:middle line:10%
lands and an extraterrestrial
elder comes out,

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:53.830 align:middle line:10%
and this is televised
to the world

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:59.920 align:middle line:10%
in a very positive, open,
beautiful moment for humanity.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.360 align:middle line:90%
And it was very clear.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I see that
as a possible future,

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:06.790 align:middle line:84%
we need to get to
where that can happen.

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:09.700 align:middle line:84%
And when we do, instead
of uniting the world

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:12.490 align:middle line:84%
around a military threat,
like Ronald Reagan talked

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:15.910 align:middle line:84%
about the UN, the world becomes
united around another vision

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:18.460 align:middle line:84%
that we can become a
peaceful civilization

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:24.460 align:middle line:84%
with free energy, abundance,
real social justice, and then

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:28.150 align:middle line:84%
in that state of peace,
be welcomed in space.

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:31.920 align:middle line:84%
That, I think, has
been forestalled.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:35.693 align:middle line:84%
I call it the lost century,
but I think we can do it.

00:10:35.693 --> 00:10:37.110 align:middle line:84%
I actually, I think
it's something

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:38.790 align:middle line:90%
that absolutely must happen.

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:40.470 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: That's a
great vision, and I

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:42.095 align:middle line:84%
think that you're
taking a lot of steps

00:10:42.095 --> 00:10:43.920 align:middle line:84%
right now to create
that future a reality.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:47.490 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that all of this
mass consciousness and CE-5

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:50.202 align:middle line:84%
protocol being developed
around the world

00:10:50.202 --> 00:10:51.660 align:middle line:84%
and being done all
around the world

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:53.868 align:middle line:84%
will lead us to a Galactic
Federation acceptance?

00:10:53.868 --> 00:10:55.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. GREER: I think
there's no doubt

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:56.820 align:middle line:84%
that's where we're
going to end up,

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:59.430 align:middle line:84%
and I think I've mentioned this
probably within the next 1,000

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:03.330 align:middle line:84%
years or so, is that human
civilization, Earth will

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:07.350 align:middle line:84%
be integrated into all
the others interstellar,

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:09.870 align:middle line:84%
and that's a huge
number, by the way.

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:14.790 align:middle line:84%
And that exists out there
already for advanced worlds.

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:17.700 align:middle line:84%
The worlds that have hit
level two, three, four,

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:19.290 align:middle line:90%
they're already doing that.

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:20.880 align:middle line:84%
We're coming along,
and there are

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.700 align:middle line:90%
others by the way behind us.

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.650 align:middle line:84%
Now there are planets
that are, maybe,

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:30.550 align:middle line:84%
where we were 200,000 years
ago or 50,000 years ago.

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:33.390 align:middle line:84%
So it's a process
that never ends.

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:37.270 align:middle line:84%
And looking forward, I should
probably tell the story.

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:38.640 align:middle line:10%
It's a little bit--

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:43.297 align:middle line:10%
sounds like the science
fiction, but it's important

00:11:43.297 --> 00:11:44.880 align:middle line:10%
because everyone's
heard of Rendlesham

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.040 align:middle line:10%
Forest, the Bentwaters case.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.710 align:middle line:84%
What people don't know is that
the senior military officers

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:52.140 align:middle line:84%
there that they didn't want
to share publicly here's

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:53.220 align:middle line:90%
what happened.

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:57.120 align:middle line:84%
That black pyramid
that looked like a onyx

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.852 align:middle line:84%
that landed for which
the Ministry of Defense,

00:11:59.852 --> 00:12:01.560 align:middle line:84%
after I was over there
meeting with them,

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:05.040 align:middle line:84%
they eventually released
the reports of the soil

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.613 align:middle line:90%
and what have you.

00:12:06.613 --> 00:12:08.280 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
things that happened.

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:11.250 align:middle line:84%
That was a covert
nuclear weapons base.

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:12.720 align:middle line:90%
People need to understand that.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:16.170 align:middle line:84%
Had that been known, it could
have triggered World War III

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:18.630 align:middle line:84%
during the dark days of
the Cold War, you know,

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:21.840 align:middle line:84%
the 70s, 80s, very,
very dangerous period.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And the ETs that were in
this pyramid floated through,

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:32.730 align:middle line:84%
and they were luminous
tall, white forms--

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:34.620 align:middle line:84%
came through the
side and connected

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:37.650 align:middle line:84%
to the senior officers
and were saying,

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:43.747 align:middle line:84%
we are your descendants from
500,000 years in the future.

00:12:43.747 --> 00:12:45.330 align:middle line:84%
So people say, well,
they were humans.

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:47.250 align:middle line:84%
I said, no, it
was after humanity

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:49.710 align:middle line:84%
had become for
hundreds of thousands

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:51.720 align:middle line:84%
of years interstellar,
and it kept

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:56.460 align:middle line:84%
evolving into that
level seven, eight,

00:12:56.460 --> 00:13:00.000 align:middle line:90%
nine level of conscious beings.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And they were concerned and said
if you stay on the path you're

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:07.410 align:middle line:90%
on now, we won't exist.

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:09.390 align:middle line:90%
Your descendants won't exist.

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:11.850 align:middle line:84%
So these are our children's
children's children

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:14.160 align:middle line:90%
20,000 generations forward.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: Right, so,
are we at a crossroads

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:19.320 align:middle line:84%
between a convergent
timeline where either we're

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:24.390 align:middle line:84%
going to become a warfaring race
that's leading to a destruction

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:26.880 align:middle line:84%
or hopefully leading
to one of these higher

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.890 align:middle line:84%
levels of civilization
you talked about?

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:31.680 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. GREER: Yeah, we're exactly
at that inflection point,

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.980 align:middle line:84%
and we've been there for
about 100 years, actually.

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:39.460 align:middle line:84%
I remember we could have had
world peace in the early 1900s.

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:42.540 align:middle line:84%
We could have had free energy
and Tesla type technologies

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:43.680 align:middle line:90%
by the 20s.

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.770 align:middle line:10%
We could have had
electrogravitics levitation

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:49.440 align:middle line:10%
and very advanced
trans-dimensional systems

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.320 align:middle line:10%
certainly by the
40s, '50s, '60s.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.380 align:middle line:84%
So this is a matter
of choice, and this

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:57.600 align:middle line:84%
is the interplay
between the fact

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:01.050 align:middle line:84%
that there is one era closing,
the era of rise and fall

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:03.130 align:middle line:90%
and division.

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:07.200 align:middle line:84%
We have to learn those
lessons, nail them, learn them

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:10.080 align:middle line:84%
permanently, and
go, OK, that path

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:14.550 align:middle line:84%
we've done as a collective
civilization species.

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:19.770 align:middle line:84%
Now we need to learn this new
lesson of oneness, of unity,

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:21.030 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:25.170 align:middle line:84%
We have to transcend
our divisiveness

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:30.450 align:middle line:84%
and find where we're really one,
and that's a spiritual issue

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:33.030 align:middle line:84%
as much as it is a
social justice one.

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:37.320 align:middle line:10%
But if we just stay
divided into warring camps,

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:41.130 align:middle line:10%
it's like the eye for an eye
leaves the whole world blind.

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:44.130 align:middle line:84%
At a certain point,
I view this really

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:46.560 align:middle line:84%
as a spiritual
problem at its root,

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.240 align:middle line:90%
and the solution is spiritual.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:51.498 align:middle line:84%
Not necessarily religious,
maybe for some people.

00:14:51.498 --> 00:14:53.790 align:middle line:10%
But I think, for the most
part, we have to recognize it

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:56.100 align:middle line:10%
as a transcendent
spiritual crisis,

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:58.590 align:middle line:10%
and there is a
spiritual solution,

00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:00.990 align:middle line:10%
and that has to do
with understanding

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:05.550 align:middle line:10%
the ineffable but very
ever-present oneness we

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:09.280 align:middle line:10%
all share through this conscious
spirit that is the singularity

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.960 align:middle line:10%
that, you know, as
Erwin Schrodinger said,

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:15.840 align:middle line:10%
the father of modern quantum
physics particle wave theory,

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:20.490 align:middle line:10%
"In 1908, the total number of
minds in the universe is one."

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:23.340 align:middle line:84%
So we have to be
deep enough to see

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:26.250 align:middle line:84%
that like the compassion
of the Buddha,

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:31.320 align:middle line:84%
where we see that all beings are
us, we are they, they are us.

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:34.260 align:middle line:84%
So that is this the
motto for what I'm doing

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.450 align:middle line:90%
is one universe, one people.

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:39.240 align:middle line:84%
I view these civilizations
out in space as people,

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.740 align:middle line:84%
they may be very
different looking,

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:43.170 align:middle line:84%
they may be very different
cultures, but they are people.

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:45.610 align:middle line:84%
They're intelligent,
sentient people.

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And I think we need to get to
that level of understanding

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:52.380 align:middle line:84%
and not project the
divisiveness and the racism

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:57.240 align:middle line:84%
and all the tribal warfare of
the last yuga onto the future.

00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:00.390 align:middle line:84%
See, I think we need
to go beyond that.

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the wise
people of the last 100 years

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:05.550 align:middle line:84%
have all called for
that, whether it

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:08.790 align:middle line:84%
be Gandhi or Martin Luther
King, or many figures

00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:10.300 align:middle line:90%
as spiritual leaders.

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think that at
this point, public

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:17.890 align:middle line:84%
has to say we're going
to make this happen.

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And if we do, it's a
collective conscious decision.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.740 align:middle line:90%
So it's a choice.

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:25.470 align:middle line:84%
We're at a fork in
the road here and been

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:28.200 align:middle line:84%
there for about 100 years
looking at a big perspective,

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.490 align:middle line:84%
and we need to make
the right choice.

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:34.920 align:middle line:84%
We need to turn away
from disunity and warfare

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:38.682 align:middle line:84%
and violence and make
a really clear decision

00:16:38.682 --> 00:16:40.140 align:middle line:84%
that we're going
to live peacefully

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:41.560 align:middle line:90%
on Earth and in space.

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:44.550 align:middle line:84%
So there are people who
want to unite the world

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:46.380 align:middle line:90%
against something out there.

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.390 align:middle line:84%
That is not going
forward, my friends.

00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:51.700 align:middle line:84%
That's taken a big leap backward
and leads to extinction.

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:53.760 align:middle line:84%
So we have to make
this decision,

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.670 align:middle line:84%
and we really don't have a
lot of time to do it, frankly.

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:58.200 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Right, exactly.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.720 align:middle line:84%
How do you think
reincarnation plays

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:03.871 align:middle line:84%
into this in terms
of people coming back

00:17:03.871 --> 00:17:04.829 align:middle line:90%
if you believe in that?

00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:07.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. GREER: It is a
very good question,

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:09.930 align:middle line:84%
and it's probably
an hour discussion.

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:11.560 align:middle line:90%
Well, I will give you a hint.

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:12.990 align:middle line:90%
It's not linear.

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:16.450 align:middle line:90%
It's conscious holographic.

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:21.640 align:middle line:84%
So your individuality; you
go on forever until such time

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:25.420 align:middle line:84%
as you choose for your drop to
permanently be with the ocean.

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:28.369 align:middle line:84%
And even then, what remains
of your individuality

00:17:28.369 --> 00:17:29.560 align:middle line:90%
is still there.

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:32.380 align:middle line:84%
It's called Leshavidya
in Sanskrit,

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:34.130 align:middle line:90%
and you can reconstitute it.

00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:36.520 align:middle line:84%
However, you can
experience and have

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:39.410 align:middle line:90%
been other lives from not you.

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:42.640 align:middle line:84%
People confuse what I,
but from a holographic,

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:46.000 align:middle line:84%
quantum, deeper part of
an understanding of who

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.690 align:middle line:84%
and what we are, remember
this great saying, think

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:54.550 align:middle line:84%
is thyself a puny form when
within the universe is folded.

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:57.460 align:middle line:84%
The entirety of
creation in the cosmos

00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:00.850 align:middle line:84%
is folded within
every single person.

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:07.090 align:middle line:84%
That means you can experience
past life, now, future life,

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:08.770 align:middle line:90%
and their collective souls.

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:14.530 align:middle line:84%
So the sort of you're born
here, you do bad things,

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:16.930 align:middle line:84%
you drop dead, you go
into the next world

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:21.340 align:middle line:84%
and get reborn as a dung
beetle or something.

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:23.740 align:middle line:84%
That understanding
is not correct.

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:26.590 align:middle line:84%
There is a very
profound truth to it,

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:28.763 align:middle line:84%
but it's very
holographic conscious.

00:18:28.763 --> 00:18:30.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: Dr. Gregg,
tell us a little bit

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:32.368 align:middle line:84%
about potential futures
or possible futures.

00:18:32.368 --> 00:18:33.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. GREER: Yeah,
and this is really

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:35.290 align:middle line:90%
gets into this whole question.

00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:38.740 align:middle line:84%
Some people will talk about
there are multiple realities

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:40.250 align:middle line:90%
running simultaneously.

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:41.360 align:middle line:90%
And that's true.

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.520 align:middle line:90%
And if you look at--

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:45.460 align:middle line:84%
people ask me sometimes, how
many dimensions are there?

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:48.220 align:middle line:84%
I said the number of dimensions
are how many numbers are there

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:51.370 align:middle line:90%
between zero and infinity.

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:54.850 align:middle line:84%
In reality, the
resonant frequency

00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:59.980 align:middle line:84%
can be adjusted click by
click by click endlessly

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:02.860 align:middle line:90%
from one point to another.

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And in understanding
that, it means

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:11.840 align:middle line:84%
that at this point in space-time
on Earth, there's this reality.

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:15.880 align:middle line:84%
But there are other
slightly different realities

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:18.400 align:middle line:84%
that are simultaneously
occurring,

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:21.380 align:middle line:84%
but those are clicked
away, a bit away.

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:22.630 align:middle line:90%
We don't really perceive them.

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:23.680 align:middle line:90%
We can.

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:28.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's talk about
this planet here now.

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:33.580 align:middle line:84%
That means we can buy
our collective will,

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:39.370 align:middle line:84%
choose different possible
futures or probable ones.

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:41.830 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
not very savory.

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:45.250 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are-- lead
to a planet in the future

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:47.260 align:middle line:90%
of great enlightenment.

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the timeline is
very specific in how much time

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.890 align:middle line:84%
we have until we have to get
a certain number of things

00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:58.710 align:middle line:90%
correct it.

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:03.510 align:middle line:84%
The Earth is not going to
allow us to endlessly destroy

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:06.900 align:middle line:90%
her biosphere, for example.

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:10.830 align:middle line:84%
Our weapon systems' and our
technology's advancing cannot

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:13.980 align:middle line:84%
continue to be endlessly
applied to endless war.

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:17.430 align:middle line:84%
Those are all-- lead
to an extermination,

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:19.860 align:middle line:90%
an extinction-level situation.

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:22.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a lot in
between, and that's

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.900 align:middle line:84%
where there's a
lot of, but there

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:27.510 align:middle line:84%
are certain things that are
absolute requirement going

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:30.730 align:middle line:90%
forward past a few more decades.

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And what that is,
time doesn't exist.

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:36.610 align:middle line:84%
I call it the event horizon,
the delta of change.

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:39.100 align:middle line:84%
That's what time is,
how things change.

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And that can be sped
up or contracted.

00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:44.800 align:middle line:84%
I would suggest we get
on with it, frankly.

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And I think most people in the
planet would benefit from that.

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:52.500 align:middle line:84%
So my hope and my prayer
is that people consciously

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:59.100 align:middle line:84%
see and choose the good future,
the optimal future, and not

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:00.390 align:middle line:90%
the extinction level 1.

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:03.450 align:middle line:84%
Or that we just become
peaceful, but we

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:08.520 align:middle line:84%
stay for hundreds of years
in a rather muddled state as

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:11.400 align:middle line:84%
opposed to pursuing higher
states of consciousness

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:15.690 align:middle line:84%
and the destiny of the golden
era of humanity, that is,

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:18.420 align:middle line:84%
the intention of
this next big cycle,

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:22.770 align:middle line:84%
yuga, which is about
a 500,000 years cycle.

00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:25.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: Dr. Greer, you have
a special vision for humanity

00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:26.490 align:middle line:90%
as we look to the future.

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:28.440 align:middle line:84%
What do you see in
that future for us?

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:31.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. GREER: What I
see is us making it

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:36.130 align:middle line:84%
through this phase transition of
chaos that we're in right now.

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:40.080 align:middle line:84%
And there will be very rapidly
at that point coherence

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:41.490 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:45.150 align:middle line:84%
First sort of a material
geopolitical world

00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:49.080 align:middle line:84%
peace here and on
Earth, rapidly followed

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:53.430 align:middle line:84%
by the pursuit of not only
higher states of consciousness

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:55.560 align:middle line:84%
but the release of
these technologies

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.670 align:middle line:90%
that will transform the world.

00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:01.350 align:middle line:84%
So the world that I have
seen into the future,

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:04.680 align:middle line:84%
I had one wonderful
lucid dream vision.

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:10.050 align:middle line:84%
I was in my 90s, and I was
up in my beloved mountains

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:12.930 align:middle line:90%
of North Carolina or Virginia.

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:17.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm part-- my dad was half
Cherokee Native American,

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:20.670 align:middle line:84%
and I was on this thing,
a device, a personalized

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:23.850 align:middle line:84%
levitation device floating
over these beautiful gorges

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:25.470 align:middle line:84%
and mountains, and
it was pristine.

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:27.092 align:middle line:90%
The whole Earth was pristine.

00:22:27.092 --> 00:22:28.800 align:middle line:84%
There was a very clear
vision, but then I

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:32.550 align:middle line:84%
saw the cities how we
lived in the future,

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:34.800 align:middle line:90%
and the world was pristine.

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.300 align:middle line:90%
There was no pollution.

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:39.090 align:middle line:84%
All defilement of the
Earth had vanished.

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And remember, the
technology we have already

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:46.170 align:middle line:84%
that are classified would enable
us to clean up all the damage

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:50.310 align:middle line:84%
existing now in the oceans,
the land, the air, including

00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:51.540 align:middle line:90%
radioactive.

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:55.920 align:middle line:84%
I've seen systems where you can
put radioactive material in,

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:59.880 align:middle line:84%
it neutralizes it, and the
output is completely cleaned.

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.890 align:middle line:84%
There are some
transmutation of elements

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:04.560 align:middle line:84%
that happen there, too, by
the way, in those systems.

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:07.410 align:middle line:84%
You end up with some silver
and gold and the output that

00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:11.490 align:middle line:84%
wasn't on the input because
these are high magnetized

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:15.060 align:middle line:84%
plasma systems that take
the waste material in,

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:19.230 align:middle line:84%
chemical or radioactive,
and the magnetic force

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:22.740 align:middle line:84%
causes the electron
shell to become a toroid,

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:25.564 align:middle line:90%
and then the nuclei combined.

00:23:25.564 --> 00:23:29.770 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, yeah, and then
it goes from the periodic table

00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:31.990 align:middle line:84%
to different-- but
it also gets rid

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:34.165 align:middle line:90%
of the radioactive isotopes.

00:23:34.165 --> 00:23:37.780 align:middle line:84%
So these are technologies
I have seen personally.

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:39.310 align:middle line:90%
These are extant.

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:40.570 align:middle line:90%
They're on the Earth now.

00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:45.220 align:middle line:84%
So think of those all being
released for peaceful purposes,

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:50.170 align:middle line:84%
not war, not weapons, and
suddenly we have no pollution,

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:51.610 align:middle line:90%
and we have no poverty.

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:54.160 align:middle line:84%
Things can be
materialized eventually.

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And we have a civilization
where the scrounging

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:02.710 align:middle line:84%
to make a subsistence existence
is a thing of the past.

00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:05.500 align:middle line:84%
Most illnesses and disease
are a thing of the past.

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:10.270 align:middle line:84%
You know, human life will extend
to our natural genetic clock

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:13.960 align:middle line:84%
about 120 years,
but epigenetically,

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:17.650 align:middle line:84%
with consciousness and
medicine coming together,

00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:19.300 align:middle line:84%
what happens in
meditative states?

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:23.500 align:middle line:84%
You unlock all these genes they
used to think were junk DNA,

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:27.820 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly, our
bodies are transformed.

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:31.570 align:middle line:84%
We're able to live quite
much, quite a deal longer,

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:34.750 align:middle line:84%
because of the interface
between meditative states

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:39.350 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, the environment,
diet, all of it and stress.

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:43.160 align:middle line:84%
And so, perhaps we live to
be much longer than that.

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And then, on top of it,
you have the ability

00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:49.270 align:middle line:84%
to have societies that
are evolving where

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:53.560 align:middle line:84%
the focus becomes mainly on
the science of consciousness,

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:56.030 align:middle line:84%
developing higher
states of consciousness.

00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:58.570 align:middle line:84%
So you go from, I
call, a material peace

00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:01.840 align:middle line:84%
to the great peace,
the inner peace,

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:03.340 align:middle line:90%
the peace of enlightenment.

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:05.230 align:middle line:84%
But that's a
transitional period,

00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:09.260 align:middle line:84%
and I see that happening
over the next few decades

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:10.480 align:middle line:90%
and hundreds of years.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.480 align:middle line:84%
And then from there,
the stars are the limit,

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:15.160 align:middle line:90%
and the celestial is the--

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:16.600 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there is no limit.

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:20.530 align:middle line:84%
Our civilization will
become very advanced up

00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:23.650 align:middle line:84%
to and through a level
six, seven, eight

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:26.680 align:middle line:84%
that I outlined in the
prior episode, where

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:30.370 align:middle line:84%
everyone on the planet is
literally born eventually

00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:31.210 align:middle line:90%
in enlightenment.

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:32.890 align:middle line:90%
And we'll eventually get there.

00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:36.490 align:middle line:84%
Now that's a while, but
it can happen very quickly

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:38.710 align:middle line:84%
because once you
reach a certain sort

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:44.620 align:middle line:84%
of critical conscious evolution,
it happens very rapidly.

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And physically,
you evolve rapidly.

00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And the good news has
come out in science

00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:52.210 align:middle line:84%
in the last few
years when people

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:55.780 align:middle line:84%
are in a meditative state, and
they begin to actually increase

00:25:55.780 --> 00:26:01.300 align:middle line:84%
their IQ, they increase their
body-mind complex becomes

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:04.690 align:middle line:84%
much more refined
that that state gets

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:07.420 align:middle line:84%
passed on in the next
generation, your children,

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:08.260 align:middle line:90%
immediately.

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And then, as they evolve,
it gets passed there.

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:13.030 align:middle line:84%
So instead of us being
keep going forward

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:16.750 align:middle line:84%
and falling back and forth,
it becomes this ascendant arc

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:20.860 align:middle line:84%
that is not only-- it's
conscious bioevolution where

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:23.500 align:middle line:84%
we're going to become an
extraordinary civilization.

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:25.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: Dr. Greer, this has
been an amazing interview.

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.180 align:middle line:84%
Is there one last thing you
want to leave our viewers

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:30.610 align:middle line:90%
with before we end the series?

00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:32.500 align:middle line:10%
>>DR. GREER: Yes, I
love the experience

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:36.370 align:middle line:10%
that Colonel Corso had in 1956.

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:40.840 align:middle line:10%
I was one year old, and he
had this meeting with an ET

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:44.560 align:middle line:10%
out in the desert that
had landed daytime.

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:47.573 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly, you
know, the craft was solid,

00:26:47.573 --> 00:26:49.240 align:middle line:84%
and then it would
dematerialize and look

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.950 align:middle line:90%
like a heatwave in the desert.

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:52.180 align:middle line:90%
And it went back and forth.

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:55.540 align:middle line:10%
Eventually, the ET
communicated with him.

00:26:55.540 --> 00:27:00.400 align:middle line:10%
And of course, the Colonel was
the brash Air Force Colonel,

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:04.600 align:middle line:10%
he said, and the ET was really
wanting them to shut down

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:07.030 align:middle line:10%
some of the radar systems
that were not just radar

00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:10.180 align:middle line:10%
but were directional
energy weapons.

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And the Colonel said,
what's in it for me?

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And the ET said, a new
world if you can take it.

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:23.470 align:middle line:84%
So, what I tell people
is that, OK, that's what?

00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:26.200 align:middle line:90%
65 years ago now.

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:27.580 align:middle line:90%
I think we need to take it.

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:30.220 align:middle line:84%
I think it's time for
us to say, OK, this

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:32.650 align:middle line:90%
has been possible for decades.

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:34.660 align:middle line:84%
Now we need to
collectively choose it,

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:36.460 align:middle line:90%
and I think if enough people--

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:39.250 align:middle line:84%
and I think it only takes
about 1% like I said,

00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:41.830 align:middle line:90%
that whole consciousness effect.

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:44.740 align:middle line:84%
That if 1% of the
population understands

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:48.430 align:middle line:84%
the power of consciousness,
move together as one,

00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:52.600 align:middle line:84%
become CE-5 Contact
ambassadors to the universe,

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:55.250 align:middle line:84%
work in their communities
to educate folks,

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:58.120 align:middle line:84%
this can happen
very quickly now.

00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And since the subject is
now being talked about quite

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:04.180 align:middle line:84%
openly, we need
to say, OK, here's

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:06.700 align:middle line:84%
what the actual truth is,
but more importantly, here's

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:08.720 align:middle line:90%
what everyone can do about it.

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.940 align:middle line:90%
So it's really a call to action.

00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:13.750 align:middle line:84%
It's not just to have the
intellectual knowledge.

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:16.880 align:middle line:10%
Is actually to move
and walk that walk.

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:19.480 align:middle line:10%
And I think I would ask that
everyone consider what they can

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:23.140 align:middle line:10%
do to walk that walk and
create this beautiful world

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:27.200 align:middle line:10%
of our dreams in which
this ET intimated.

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.540 align:middle line:84%
It's a new world
if you can take it.

00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:31.850 align:middle line:84%
I think we should make
the decision knowing

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:33.620 align:middle line:84%
can we take it, we
want it, and we're

00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:35.970 align:middle line:90%
going to make it happen now.

00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:36.830 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Absolutely.

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:37.820 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Dr. Greer.

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:38.450 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. GREER: Thank you.

00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:39.650 align:middle line:90%
Pleasure being with you.

00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:40.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: I'm Billy Carson.

00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:43.310 align:middle line:84%
This concludes this
season of Disclosure

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:44.690 align:middle line:90%
with Dr. Steven Greer.

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:45.530 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for watching.
