00:00:18.557 --> 00:00:20.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY CARSON:
Welcome to "Disclosure

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.550 align:middle line:90%
with Dr. Steven Greer."

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.160 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we explore
the levels of consciousness,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.350 align:middle line:10%
cosmology, and technology.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:27.340 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Dr. Greer.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.060 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVEN GREER: Thank you.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.170 align:middle line:90%
Glad to be with you again.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:29.740 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Thank you.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.990 align:middle line:84%
You talk about the conscious
holographic universe.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.370 align:middle line:90%
Can you walk us through that?

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.620 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: Yes, I think it's
really important for people

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.310 align:middle line:84%
to understand that right
now, you and I are awake,

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.800 align:middle line:84%
and we're conscious,
and everyone listening.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.520 align:middle line:84%
That conscious mind,
whereby you're awake,

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.090 align:middle line:84%
is actually an infinite
field of awareness.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.310 align:middle line:84%
We're only identifying
it with ourselves,

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.440 align:middle line:84%
but in reality, it's always
infinite and unbounded.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.010 align:middle line:10%
And the reason we end
up not identifying

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.010 align:middle line:10%
with the infinite
unbounded aspect of it

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.599 align:middle line:10%
is that we have
been trained only

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:08.750 align:middle line:10%
to be focused on our own--
what's right in front of us.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.350 align:middle line:84%
So when you go into
meditation, you

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.550 align:middle line:84%
can experience deeper,
quiet consciousness,

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.930 align:middle line:84%
and then, in that state,
you can see remote places.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.420 align:middle line:84%
That's remote viewing
or being a seer.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.230 align:middle line:84%
You can see the future,
and that's precognition.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.310 align:middle line:84%
You can see other realms,
the so-called worlds

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.700 align:middle line:84%
of light-- astral,
celestial, other dimensions,

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.840 align:middle line:90%
higher and lower.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And you can perceive, also, the
very structure of the cosmos,

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.810 align:middle line:84%
where the first emanations
from the field of consciousness

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.220 align:middle line:90%
are beginning to emerge.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And those first emanations
are the tonality of thought.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.610 align:middle line:84%
It's the sound
component of thought.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.650 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, that's
what a mantra is--

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:03.520 align:middle line:90%
chanting.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.250 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at it from a
structure of the cosmos point

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.490 align:middle line:84%
of view, it's that you have
this impulse that emerges,

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.390 align:middle line:84%
that is-- it's self-conscious
and consciousness.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.950 align:middle line:84%
And that first emergence
from the unbounded field

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.590 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness was the
plane of the absolute,

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.130 align:middle line:90%
as the mystics call it.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.470 align:middle line:84%
There's this stimulation,
this initial thought of--

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.440 align:middle line:84%
from the great spirit, and
it's called the primal thought.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And that primal
thought and tonality,

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.560 align:middle line:84%
that then differentiates into
all that exists in the cosmos,

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.820 align:middle line:84%
in creation, not just
the material, 3D, but all

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.650 align:middle line:90%
the worlds of light, the--

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:48.520 align:middle line:90%
all that exists.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.810 align:middle line:84%
So that primal thought
is constantly there.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.940 align:middle line:90%
It's not like it came and went.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.700 align:middle line:90%
It's a continuous presence.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:04.420 align:middle line:84%
That, then, unfolds into the
specific tonality thought

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.750 align:middle line:84%
essence that's conscious
within all things.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.320 align:middle line:84%
So this primal thought
then goes like a fractal

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.760 align:middle line:84%
into an infinite number
of expressed things--

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.730 align:middle line:90%
stars, people, rocks.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.600 align:middle line:90%
Everything has this within it.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:26.140 align:middle line:84%
So standing within every single
point in space, time, or object

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.530 align:middle line:84%
is the unbounded
consciousness, because all this

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.830 align:middle line:84%
is that, this
emanation of tonality,

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.770 align:middle line:84%
primal thought, that
then differentiates

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.380 align:middle line:90%
into that specific object.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.640 align:middle line:84%
From there, you have
the emanation of light,

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.930 align:middle line:84%
so the first emanation of
light from the primal thought

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.940 align:middle line:84%
has been called the
most great light.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.060 align:middle line:84%
But from that most
great light, you then

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.860 align:middle line:84%
have the expression into
the light within all things.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.730 align:middle line:10%
So then, at that point
that this emanation

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.400 align:middle line:10%
of the pure light form
that's undifferentiated then

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.190 align:middle line:10%
becomes the worlds of
light, they're called.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.310 align:middle line:10%
And this can be all the
different dimensions--

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.130 align:middle line:10%
higher, lower,
angelic, celestial,

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.840 align:middle line:10%
to the very highest level.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.540 align:middle line:10%
Now, the highest
level of the expressed

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:22.140 align:middle line:10%
is very, very close to that most
great light primary emanation.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.840 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is
then from there,

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.280 align:middle line:84%
you have a template
that interfaces,

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.260 align:middle line:84%
that creates time,
space, matter, 3D.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.910 align:middle line:84%
So I think for us to understand
these extraterrestrial

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.190 align:middle line:84%
civilizations, we have to
understand a new cosmology.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's talk about
the technologies.

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.660 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to go from
one point in space and time

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.700 align:middle line:84%
to another beyond
the speed of light,

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.220 align:middle line:84%
you're traversing
along, I call it,

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.600 align:middle line:84%
the underbelly of the
cosmos, but you have actually

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:04.430 align:middle line:84%
transdimensionally shifted
into the astral or near astral.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And you know, people think
this is so hard to understand,

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:08.780 align:middle line:90%
but think about it.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.140 align:middle line:84%
Most people have had a
lucid flying dream, where

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.750 align:middle line:90%
they see a place or a future.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.140 align:middle line:90%
But how does that happen?

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.930 align:middle line:84%
It's because the
consciousness within us

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.000 align:middle line:84%
and our deeper, subtle
bodies are not as fixed

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.200 align:middle line:84%
in space and time and intellect
as we normally associate,

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.310 align:middle line:84%
and, therefore, you can see a
distant place, a distant time,

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.230 align:middle line:90%
a future event, a past event.

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:38.210 align:middle line:84%
So that is very much involved
with extraterrestrial

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.880 align:middle line:84%
technologies have
those abilities

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.180 align:middle line:84%
that this cosmos that
I'm talking about

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.450 align:middle line:84%
is actually utilized
more fully--

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.390 align:middle line:84%
let's say a fuller
spectrum is used

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.240 align:middle line:84%
by interstellar civilizations
than we are now on Earth.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.870 align:middle line:90%
So that's really important.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.500 align:middle line:84%
So now, you get into
this whole question

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.970 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial spacecraft
and civilizations and people.

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.490 align:middle line:84%
Yes, they can appear
full 3D, but they

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.480 align:middle line:84%
could be hovering outside
your window in 5D.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.490 align:middle line:10%
What's interesting
about this, I call

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:15.590 align:middle line:10%
this "the gap," this
interface between 3D

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.400 align:middle line:10%
and these other dimensions.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:23.330 align:middle line:10%
And in that gap is a lot going
on of where the material cosmos

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:28.820 align:middle line:10%
and what we call physical
sciences can begin to interface

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:35.450 align:middle line:10%
with these more subtle,
finer refinements, very

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:41.030 align:middle line:10%
fine versions of
electromagnetism

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.250 align:middle line:10%
that are beyond
the speed of light.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And matter into the near
interface, where the astral,

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:54.750 align:middle line:84%
so-called, conscious
light energy becomes form

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:55.550 align:middle line:90%
and matter--

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.460 align:middle line:84%
that is very much
the mastery that

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.860 align:middle line:84%
happens between the
science of consciousness

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:05.510 align:middle line:84%
and all its expressions
and 3D, physical sciences

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:07.520 align:middle line:90%
like we think of today on Earth.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.900 align:middle line:90%
And that's our future.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's why, I say the
science of consciousness being

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:14.270 align:middle line:84%
integrated with physical
understanding instead

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.350 align:middle line:84%
of an either/or is going
to be an integrated--

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:17.150 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Together.

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:17.720 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: --system.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: Do you think that
some of these ET civilizations

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.280 align:middle line:84%
live in other dimensions,
actually live there, and then

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.990 align:middle line:84%
can just faceshift
their frequency

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:27.680 align:middle line:90%
to walk into our dimension?

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.650 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: Well, all-- if
they're from a physical planet

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:34.940 align:middle line:84%
and a physical spacecraft, they
traverse these other dimensions

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.520 align:middle line:84%
and can reside in
those dimensions

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.380 align:middle line:90%
as long as they wish or not.

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:42.410 align:middle line:84%
That's why it isn't just
while during transport.

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:44.270 align:middle line:84%
They can be outside
the building here,

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:47.690 align:middle line:84%
shifted beyond the speed
of light in the near astral

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:50.690 align:middle line:84%
or in the gap or partially
in this dimension

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:52.080 align:middle line:90%
or fully in the astral.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:56.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, as you go through more
advanced civilizations,

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:59.990 align:middle line:84%
the technologies track
the level of consciousness

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:04.737 align:middle line:84%
of the planet as they evolve and
higher states of consciousness.

00:08:04.737 --> 00:08:06.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: Dr. Greer,
you've highlighted

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.800 align:middle line:84%
the hierarchy of the states
of consciousness for beings.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.692 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us a little
bit more about that?

00:08:11.692 --> 00:08:14.150 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: Sure, and I think it's
important to understand it,

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:16.610 align:middle line:84%
because this is the
path all of us are on.

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:20.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I'm going to
describe is, again, a linear--

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.640 align:middle line:84%
sounded like a linear
process, when, in reality,

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.930 align:middle line:84%
various states of consciousness
begin to overlap and unfold,

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:31.190 align:middle line:84%
so certain aspects of it will
be happening all the time.

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:33.950 align:middle line:10%
But the basic ones are everybody
is aware of being awake,

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:35.600 align:middle line:10%
sleeping, dreaming.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.580 align:middle line:10%
And then there's another one.

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:39.830 align:middle line:10%
And the basic one
is in meditation--

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:42.169 align:middle line:10%
our society ignores this--

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:46.250 align:middle line:10%
is being in that transcendent
state of samadhi, where

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:47.900 align:middle line:10%
you're just aware of awareness.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.210 align:middle line:84%
You're not aware of
your thoughts, yourself.

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:56.270 align:middle line:84%
You're in this very peaceful,
unboundedness of being awake.

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.970 align:middle line:84%
So it's the nothingness
of being infinitely awake,

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:02.090 align:middle line:84%
not the nothingness of
being asleep and dark.

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:05.300 align:middle line:84%
So that experience
is something that you

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:08.870 align:middle line:84%
can have spontaneously
or through the practice

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:11.330 align:middle line:84%
regularly of meditation
and understanding that.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.700 align:middle line:84%
By the way, all
meditation techniques

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:17.990 align:middle line:84%
should be designed to
get you to that point

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:20.210 align:middle line:84%
where the meditation
technique stops.

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:22.100 align:middle line:84%
The technique is just
getting you to a place

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:25.310 align:middle line:84%
where you can let go and
where the individuality

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:28.160 align:middle line:84%
of your individual
soul can merge

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.930 align:middle line:90%
with this unbounded field.

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And so from there,
what's interesting,

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:37.100 align:middle line:84%
as you go through the
development of higher

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.860 align:middle line:84%
states of consciousness,
intentionally

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:44.540 align:middle line:84%
engaging in meditation, the
study, and various techniques,

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:47.210 align:middle line:84%
you will, at some
point, experience

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:49.580 align:middle line:84%
cosmic consciousness,
as it's been termed,

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:55.520 align:middle line:84%
which is when you're aware of
that unbounded conscious field,

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.130 align:middle line:84%
even while you're driving,
walking, what have you.

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:03.060 align:middle line:84%
And this develops
slowly for most people,

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.750 align:middle line:84%
but the key hallmark
of it is you're

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:08.510 align:middle line:84%
aware of that unbounded
conscious state

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:11.540 align:middle line:84%
from having been immersed
in it in meditation enough,

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:15.050 align:middle line:84%
even while you're awake
and dreaming and sleeping.

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And so then you open up the
whole richness of dream time,

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:20.600 align:middle line:84%
as Aboriginals in
Australia call it,

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.240 align:middle line:84%
where you have these experiences
even in the dream state,

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.250 align:middle line:84%
which, again, most
people have that

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:28.550 align:middle line:84%
even before they're established
in cosmic consciousness.

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:32.060 align:middle line:84%
So you can have transitory
cosmic consciousness

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.490 align:middle line:84%
experiences that
come and go, but it

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:36.470 align:middle line:84%
being established
all the time is

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:39.500 align:middle line:84%
when you're fully in
that state all the time.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.340 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Right.

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:43.040 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: As that is
established and while it's

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.680 align:middle line:84%
being established,
you spontaneously

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:49.250 align:middle line:84%
begin to develop
more and more ability

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:53.360 align:middle line:84%
to have what's called celestial
perception and the perception

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.900 align:middle line:84%
literally, physically,
and within your mind

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.840 align:middle line:84%
of these resonant
frequencies that

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.110 align:middle line:84%
cross over into astral
all the way to celestial

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:07.400 align:middle line:90%
and, eventually, to the divine.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.890 align:middle line:84%
We call it Godhead or
the God consciousness

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:12.685 align:middle line:90%
state of that being.

00:11:12.685 --> 00:11:14.060 align:middle line:84%
Then there's
another state-- it's

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:16.160 align:middle line:84%
a little more abstract--
where you actually

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:20.390 align:middle line:84%
perceive everything
as pure consciousness.

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And you usually need to have
someone who's experienced

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:25.640 align:middle line:84%
that to sort of say,
yeah, that's what that is,

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.620 align:middle line:90%
because it's incredibly subtle.

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:30.950 align:middle line:84%
But where you actually
see everything as--

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:34.270 align:middle line:84%
so it's unbounded
consciousness within

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:37.060 align:middle line:90%
and unbounded consciousness out.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:38.478 align:middle line:90%
And those become one.

00:11:38.478 --> 00:11:40.270 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's called
unity consciousness.

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:43.930 align:middle line:84%
There's this woven together--
your direct perception

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:45.550 align:middle line:84%
of the world around
you is that it

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:49.420 align:middle line:84%
is at all consciousness,
a very, very

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.070 align:middle line:90%
high state of consciousness.

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:54.550 align:middle line:10%
And then there's a state beyond
that, Brahmin consciousness,

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:55.870 align:middle line:10%
as it's been termed.

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:57.850 align:middle line:10%
And this is more
universal consciousness,

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:00.520 align:middle line:10%
where you, as an individual,
experience the consciousness

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:02.800 align:middle line:10%
of the entire creation.

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.890 align:middle line:10%
And the reason they're important
is that these have corollaries

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:09.670 align:middle line:10%
not only into CE-5 contact
but the kinds of civilizations

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:11.063 align:middle line:10%
we interact with.

00:12:11.063 --> 00:12:13.480 align:middle line:10%
>>BILLY: Dr. Greer, what are
the technological corollaries

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.255 align:middle line:10%
to these cities
that you mentioned?

00:12:15.255 --> 00:12:16.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: Yeah,
and this is really

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:18.910 align:middle line:84%
where the rubber meets
the road in terms of CE-5

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:21.250 align:middle line:90%
contact and this subject.

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:24.250 align:middle line:84%
So everyone's heard about
the CIA remote viewing

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:26.140 align:middle line:90%
projects and all of that.

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:30.850 align:middle line:84%
Those are the low tech ones,
but that actually gets--

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:34.540 align:middle line:84%
when you get a really
developed civilization or some

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:37.090 align:middle line:84%
of the more developed
classified projects,

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:39.610 align:middle line:90%
those capabilities get--

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:44.140 align:middle line:84%
I call it routinized, where
it's made routine scientifically

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:47.260 align:middle line:84%
through technological
systems that interface

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.450 align:middle line:90%
with consciousness and thought.

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:52.420 align:middle line:84%
So this is where you get
into the technology-assisted

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:54.820 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, where
your consciousness can

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:56.950 align:middle line:84%
be assisted in remote
viewing or seeing

00:12:56.950 --> 00:13:00.880 align:middle line:84%
in the past or the future
through a technological system.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:06.820 align:middle line:84%
And ETs have those devices,
because in ET systems,

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:10.780 align:middle line:84%
involve the ability to drop
out of space-time linearity

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:15.370 align:middle line:84%
and be able to see things
past, now, or future.

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:18.340 align:middle line:84%
Caveat-- anything that's
perceived in the future

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.940 align:middle line:90%
is only a probable future.

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:24.180 align:middle line:84%
The recent charlatans are always
going to say on October 15,

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:26.940 align:middle line:84%
XYZ is going to happen
is that by the time they

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:29.310 align:middle line:84%
utter it and see it, it
can change the timeline

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:30.970 align:middle line:84%
or whether it will
happen or not.

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:33.120 align:middle line:84%
So when you're
talking about future,

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.760 align:middle line:84%
except for very big events
that are sort of fixed,

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.090 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about
the probability.

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:41.610 align:middle line:90%
Now, the probability may be 99%.

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:44.700 align:middle line:84%
It's never 100% when you're
talking off the right now

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:46.020 align:middle line:90%
or what's already happened.

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:49.050 align:middle line:84%
Everything that's happened
in the past and happening now

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:53.340 align:middle line:84%
is engraven within the structure
of these other dimensions

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:56.370 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness and
is always going on.

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:59.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, so here's an
example of that.

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:02.400 align:middle line:84%
One of my military advisors
was at the White Oaks Naval

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.400 align:middle line:84%
Facility in Maryland
before it closed,

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.200 align:middle line:90%
and this is back in the '70s.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And they had a device
in naval intelligence,

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:12.810 align:middle line:90%
where it was called--

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:14.370 align:middle line:84%
they could extract
from what they

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:17.940 align:middle line:84%
called the white noise of space
time anything that had ever

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:19.800 align:middle line:90%
happened in any volume of space.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.690 align:middle line:84%
So they could target,
say, the space

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:25.380 align:middle line:84%
where this building is and
see what's going on right now

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:27.480 align:middle line:84%
or what happened
last night or what

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:30.120 align:middle line:84%
happened 1,000 years
ago in this space

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:33.330 align:middle line:84%
or happened a million years
ago with absolute accuracy.

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:37.080 align:middle line:84%
And that was in, I think,
'73, '4, that era, and it

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.250 align:middle line:90%
had been around a while.

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:42.750 align:middle line:84%
But those technologies, imagine
what interstellar civilizations

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:44.250 align:middle line:84%
that have been
going interstellar

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:46.710 align:middle line:84%
for hundreds or thousands
or millions of years--

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:49.690 align:middle line:84%
they have generation
5,000 of this stuff,

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:51.850 align:middle line:90%
so just keep that in mind.

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:54.900 align:middle line:84%
So and then you get into things
like, for example, levitation.

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:57.480 align:middle line:10%
I've talked about the
fact that a city that

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.120 align:middle line:10%
develops and can
happen spontaneously

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.440 align:middle line:10%
is the ability to levitate.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, how is that
really happening?

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:07.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you're in a
certain state of meditation,

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:11.790 align:middle line:84%
and it's sort of also
connected to the heart and joy,

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:13.560 align:middle line:90%
it creates a--

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.830 align:middle line:84%
and the heart has 30,
40,000 neurons, by the way,

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:19.980 align:middle line:84%
and is electromagnetic,
as is the brain, as is

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:24.990 align:middle line:84%
the whole body, you can
alter the angular momentum

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:30.960 align:middle line:84%
and spin of all your molecules
and atoms, so you lift up.

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.550 align:middle line:10%
You click it a
little further, you

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:37.350 align:middle line:10%
will dematerialize and disappear
and appear somewhere else.

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:39.780 align:middle line:84%
This can all be
done by developing

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:42.000 align:middle line:84%
higher states of
consciousness, and everyone's

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.760 align:middle line:84%
read accounts of enlightened
masters who could do this.

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:47.550 align:middle line:84%
Now there's a
corollary to that--

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:49.020 align:middle line:90%
obviously, anti-gravity.

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:53.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're using an
electromagnetic, very high

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:57.240 align:middle line:84%
voltage system to create the
same effect that a very high

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:59.730 align:middle line:90%
consciousness state can affect.

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:02.730 align:middle line:84%
It's all both levitation
of material objects.

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:07.200 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, when you get into
these consciousness-assisted

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:11.820 align:middle line:84%
technologies, you can
actually have consciousness

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:14.520 align:middle line:84%
that is interfacing
with your technologies

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:17.430 align:middle line:84%
so that you teleport
or materialize

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:19.530 align:middle line:90%
or lift things at a distance.

00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:21.240 align:middle line:84%
That can be done
technologically,

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.950 align:middle line:90%
and ETs have that.

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And then you have things
like full on teleportation.

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.875 align:middle line:84%
Now, those experiments
began in the '40s, '50s.

00:16:28.875 --> 00:16:32.520 align:middle line:84%
One of the disclosure witnesses
was at an Air Force base

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:36.420 align:middle line:84%
in '53, where they were
teleporting solid objects

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:38.460 align:middle line:84%
from one part of
the base to another,

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:41.490 align:middle line:84%
and it would go from one
electronic system to another

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:44.430 align:middle line:84%
and go, boom, boom,
and that was '53.

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:47.970 align:middle line:84%
So we know that that can
be done technologically,

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:51.600 align:middle line:84%
but it can also be done, as I
mentioned, through the cities,

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.190 align:middle line:84%
the higher states
of consciousness.

00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:54.780 align:middle line:90%
You see, there's a pattern here.

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:56.970 align:middle line:84%
Almost everything
you've heard about that

00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:59.760 align:middle line:84%
is an innate ability
and consciousness

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:06.450 align:middle line:84%
can be made routine, routinized
through scientific discovery

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:09.060 align:middle line:90%
and has been, frankly.

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:12.569 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing--
dematerialize, rematerialize.

00:17:12.569 --> 00:17:16.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the ET systems
and classified projects,

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:20.579 align:middle line:84%
these transdimensional
interstellar craft

00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:25.230 align:middle line:84%
have to be able to drop out
of 3D materialization, go

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:27.119 align:middle line:84%
through these other
dimensions-- they're

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:29.580 align:middle line:84%
called "transdimensional--"
and appear

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:31.230 align:middle line:90%
at another point in space-time.

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:33.498 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, they can
create their own portals.

00:17:33.498 --> 00:17:35.790 align:middle line:84%
Everyone thinks you have to
have a pre-existing portal.

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:39.600 align:middle line:84%
Actually, CE-5 groups-- we are
creating our own portal right

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:40.620 align:middle line:90%
above what we're doing.

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:42.000 align:middle line:90%
And the same thing with--

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.400 align:middle line:84%
you hear of masters
who can materialize

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.790 align:middle line:90%
a ruby or an object.

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:46.590 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Right.

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:49.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: Well, a little
bit like Star Trek,

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:53.670 align:middle line:84%
ET civilizations, their
manufacturing of their craft

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:58.950 align:middle line:84%
is through these
transdimensional energy fields,

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:02.460 align:middle line:84%
where the reason when you
see an actual ET craft, there

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:03.850 align:middle line:90%
aren't any parts to it.

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:07.260 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the
material in it is so pure

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:08.880 align:middle line:84%
that even in space,
we haven't been

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.900 align:middle line:90%
able to replicate the purity.

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:11.700 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:14.910 align:middle line:90%
It's because it is materialized.

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:20.490 align:middle line:10%
It is brought in from let's call
them elementals of this gap,

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:22.920 align:middle line:10%
from the near astral
to the physical,

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:28.170 align:middle line:10%
and it is then resonantly
infraultrasonically

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:30.660 align:middle line:10%
and resonant fields
brought into 3D.

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.990 align:middle line:10%
So that's an electronic
system but a very refined one,

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:36.180 align:middle line:10%
and that's how they
materialize things.

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:39.810 align:middle line:10%
And then, you have other types
of experiences-- bilocation,

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:41.460 align:middle line:10%
trilocation.

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:46.690 align:middle line:10%
It means that an ET craft can
be in multiple places at once.

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:48.760 align:middle line:10%
Now, enlightened
masters have been

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:52.000 align:middle line:10%
able to bilocate and meet with
more than one of their students

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:52.820 align:middle line:10%
at the same time.

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:53.820 align:middle line:90%
You hear these accounts.

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:56.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's the same
thing in consciousness,

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.380 align:middle line:84%
but then made routine
through electronic systems,

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:01.840 align:middle line:84%
because, in reality,
like the spooky effect

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:05.110 align:middle line:84%
Einstein talked about, you
can have the same particle

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:06.760 align:middle line:90%
in two places at once.

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:09.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can do the same
thing not just with a particle,

00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:10.930 align:middle line:90%
but an entire spacecraft.

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And then you get into things
like remote healing event.

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:16.600 align:middle line:84%
A wonderful doctor,
Larry Dossey,

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.450 align:middle line:84%
did the book, "Recovering the
Soul," about remote prayer

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:21.880 align:middle line:84%
and healing events that
they've been studied.

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And humans can do
that, and as you

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.210 align:middle line:84%
go into higher states
of consciousness

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:28.840 align:middle line:84%
or understand the power of
consciousness and prayer,

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:33.460 align:middle line:84%
you can affect outcomes and
help people heal at a distance.

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:35.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are
electronic corollaries

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:38.680 align:middle line:84%
to that that are using
the consciousness field,

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:43.330 align:middle line:84%
so interstellar civilizations
have that and can

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:45.820 align:middle line:90%
do amazing healing with it.

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:48.490 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY: You speak about the
10 levels of civilizations,

00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:49.870 align:middle line:90%
and can you speak on that?

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:53.100 align:middle line:84%
And also, where are we
going as a civilization?

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:56.460 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: Oh, the latter
part of the question--

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:59.130 align:middle line:84%
we're headed off a cliff if
we don't change directions.

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:02.190 align:middle line:84%
As the Chinese proverb says,
unless we change directions,

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:04.630 align:middle line:84%
we're likely to end
up where we are going,

00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:06.840 align:middle line:84%
and so we need a
course correction.

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.570 align:middle line:84%
The civilizations
that are interstellar,

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:12.800 align:middle line:84%
in order to cross the
threshold where we are,

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:16.530 align:middle line:84%
where we have these fearsome
weapon systems that could

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:19.980 align:middle line:84%
eliminate all life on Earth, and
not just hydrogen and nuclear

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:22.920 align:middle line:84%
bombs, but others that
are classified, so we're--

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:25.730 align:middle line:84%
human civilization's
at a level zero.

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:29.730 align:middle line:84%
We're basically not yet
a real civilization.

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:31.330 align:middle line:90%
We're trying to get there.

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:35.790 align:middle line:84%
But eventually a civilization
has to reach level 1,

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:37.620 align:middle line:90%
or they self-destruct.

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And the hallmark of a
level 1 civilization

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:45.120 align:middle line:84%
is that it's a peaceful,
global civilization where

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:48.630 align:middle line:84%
all their technologies are
life-supporting technologies.

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:51.690 align:middle line:84%
They're not ones where you're
blowing things up, digging

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:54.360 align:middle line:84%
things out of the ground,
burning coal and oil

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:55.830 align:middle line:90%
and chopping down things.

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:58.920 align:middle line:84%
You're using these
advanced technologies,

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:01.800 align:middle line:84%
and you develop a world-- and
this is where we're headed.

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:04.080 align:middle line:84%
We need-- we should have
been there 100 years ago,

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.460 align:middle line:90%
but we're running out of time.

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:08.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, we need to pick
up the pace and do

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:10.140 align:middle line:84%
what I call a time
snap, where we regain

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:13.900 align:middle line:84%
where we should have been 100
years ago in 20 years, 15,

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:14.860 align:middle line:90%
20 years.

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:17.010 align:middle line:84%
So that's a level
1 civilization,

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:19.770 align:middle line:84%
and you imagine, at that
point, there's no pollution.

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:21.360 align:middle line:90%
There's no poverty.

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:24.700 align:middle line:84%
The workweek probably drops
10 to 15 hours a week.

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:25.560 align:middle line:90%
There's abundance.

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:27.840 align:middle line:84%
It's a totally different
economic system,

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:31.620 align:middle line:84%
environmental system, and
justice system, social system,

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:32.582 align:middle line:90%
where people--

00:21:32.582 --> 00:21:34.290 align:middle line:84%
there's just not the
haves and have-nots,

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:36.660 align:middle line:84%
because there's
total abundance due

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:40.890 align:middle line:84%
to these advanced technologies
that create endless abundance.

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:44.370 align:middle line:10%
So at that point,
there's the possibility

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:47.700 align:middle line:10%
of a permanent peace, a level 2.

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:49.350 align:middle line:10%
Now, the thing about
permanent peace

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:52.350 align:middle line:10%
means that you're not just
becoming peaceful and slipping

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:56.160 align:middle line:10%
back, and a permanent
peace requires

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.900 align:middle line:10%
a certain level of
conscious, spiritual,

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:00.480 align:middle line:10%
and social integration.

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:04.470 align:middle line:10%
And this is where you develop
transdimensional technologies

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:07.180 align:middle line:10%
that are only being used
for peaceful purposes

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:12.360 align:middle line:10%
that we've talked about before--
travel, going from point A to B

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:14.472 align:middle line:10%
with anti-grav.

00:22:14.472 --> 00:22:16.590 align:middle line:90%
Here's a beautiful part of that.

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:19.050 align:middle line:84%
Once people are freed
from the shackles

00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:22.380 align:middle line:84%
of the macroeconomic
system we're in,

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:25.080 align:middle line:84%
which, actually, is sort of
like an extension of slavery

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:28.560 align:middle line:84%
industrially, you
have the ability

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:32.710 align:middle line:84%
to have people really pursue
higher states of consciousness.

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:33.510 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:34.440 align:middle line:90%
Because they're freed up.

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:35.273 align:middle line:90%
They're not working.

00:22:35.273 --> 00:22:37.780 align:middle line:84%
You know, both parents
aren't working 40, 50,

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:40.410 align:middle line:84%
60 hours a week, so
there's the ability

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:42.840 align:middle line:84%
to engage in creative
endeavors, pursue

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:45.780 align:middle line:84%
higher states of consciousness,
and really develop

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:47.190 align:middle line:90%
your spirituality.

00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:49.950 align:middle line:90%
It becomes practical to do.

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:52.380 align:middle line:84%
So-- and then,
that will allow you

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:56.370 align:middle line:84%
to evolve and be ready
for clearance for takeoff

00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:58.260 align:middle line:84%
to become an interstellar
civilization.

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:00.930 align:middle line:10%
That's a level 3 civilization.

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:03.540 align:middle line:10%
You are an interstellar
civilization,

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:05.370 align:middle line:10%
because you've been in stable.

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:06.480 align:middle line:10%
You're peaceful.

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:09.990 align:middle line:10%
You're not engaging in
weapon systems in space.

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:12.450 align:middle line:10%
There's widespread
establishment of the science

00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:13.680 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness.

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:19.380 align:middle line:10%
And the integration between
your world and other worlds

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:22.140 align:middle line:10%
begins to happen
overtly, openly.

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And my sense is that probably
in the next 1,000 years,

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:30.330 align:middle line:84%
Earth will be fully integrated
into these other interstellar

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:34.110 align:middle line:84%
civilizations that are at
that level, a 3 or above.

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:36.720 align:middle line:10%
And then a level
4 civilization--

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.330 align:middle line:10%
this gets into
where you're really

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:41.520 align:middle line:10%
developing higher
states of consciousness,

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:45.570 align:middle line:10%
because at a level 4,
you have at least 1%

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:49.770 align:middle line:10%
of the population in
cosmic consciousness, very

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:52.710 align:middle line:10%
high enlightened state-- not
everybody, but at least 1%.

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:55.410 align:middle line:10%
And that creates an effect
on the entire population

00:23:55.410 --> 00:24:00.990 align:middle line:10%
again through this 1%
effect that is non-local.

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:03.240 align:middle line:10%
And these are the
senior ambassadors

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:06.960 align:middle line:10%
that we've had encounters
and meetings with that

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.840 align:middle line:10%
are in an enlightened state
of cosmic consciousness--

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:13.500 align:middle line:10%
like I mentioned, kindness,
Bijou, the healer.

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:16.500 align:middle line:10%
They're all in those very
high states of consciousness.

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:21.060 align:middle line:10%
And contact with other
advanced civilizations

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:22.860 align:middle line:10%
is their primary purpose.

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:26.310 align:middle line:84%
They are literally
ambassadors to the universe.

00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:30.240 align:middle line:84%
It's the CE-5 project,
I have called--

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.580 align:middle line:84%
we're ambassadors
to the universe.

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And they also provide guidance
to emerging civilization

00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:40.080 align:middle line:84%
and kind of oversee
and be sure that they

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:43.980 align:middle line:84%
don't go too far in a direction
that could harm other planets.

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- you see some of the
civilizations that are here are

00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:51.180 align:middle line:84%
at that level where they're
trying to be sure we don't have

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:55.650 align:middle line:84%
too much damage that emerges
from Earth to other places.

00:24:55.650 --> 00:25:00.380 align:middle line:10%
And then level 5 civilization
is getting very rarefied.

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:04.790 align:middle line:10%
Now, this is a civilization
where everyone on the planet

00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:07.070 align:middle line:10%
is in cosmic consciousness.

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:11.180 align:middle line:10%
They're born into enlightenment,
because we don't have time

00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:14.870 align:middle line:10%
to go into the epigenetic
effects of consciousness

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:18.110 align:middle line:10%
on the body and on the
genes and how it's passed on

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:19.950 align:middle line:10%
from one generation to another.

00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:21.530 align:middle line:10%
But I'll just give you a hint.

00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:23.878 align:middle line:84%
When you are in a
meditative state,

00:25:23.878 --> 00:25:25.670 align:middle line:84%
but you're in a very
high meditative state,

00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:30.650 align:middle line:84%
it alters your genetic and
neuroplasticity of your brain,

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:32.880 align:middle line:84%
but that's passed on
in one generation.

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:35.420 align:middle line:84%
So then you have
the entire planet

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:39.840 align:middle line:84%
has become enlightened, truly,
in cosmic consciousness.

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And so this then leads to the
widespread and accelerated

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:46.850 align:middle line:84%
experience of innate
cities and the parallel

00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:49.880 align:middle line:84%
of those being applied
technologically

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:53.040 align:middle line:84%
in almost everything
that planet is doing.

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:55.370 align:middle line:84%
So when you go back to
what I shared a moment ago,

00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:59.090 align:middle line:84%
that becomes just
the way of life.

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And then a level
6 civilization--

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:05.180 align:middle line:84%
this is when many people
experience some of those ET

00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:07.490 align:middle line:84%
beings almost at
a celestial level,

00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:12.050 align:middle line:84%
because that's when at
least 1% of that world

00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:15.120 align:middle line:84%
are in a state of God
consciousness permanently.

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And that affects everything else
and where their technologies

00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:21.860 align:middle line:84%
almost reach a refinement
of the celestial,

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:24.860 align:middle line:84%
but it's technological,
and they're from a planet--

00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:27.950 align:middle line:84%
very, very-- they often
get confused with an angel,

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:30.200 align:middle line:84%
but they all have
a craft with them.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:33.290 align:middle line:10%
So this is where there's
a lot of confusion--

00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:36.500 align:middle line:10%
I call it cosmological
indigestion-- that happens,

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:39.470 align:middle line:10%
because there is
overlap of experiences

00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:41.960 align:middle line:10%
people have with beings
from other dimensions

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:46.970 align:middle line:10%
with these very, very highly
developed civilizations

00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:48.020 align:middle line:10%
that are out there.

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And the physical world that
those planets takes literally

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:54.860 align:middle line:84%
on the quality of
a celestial realm,

00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:58.430 align:middle line:84%
so it can be physical but also
has this celestial quality.

00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:00.080 align:middle line:90%
And their spacecraft do, too.

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:04.690 align:middle line:84%
And then you have, from there,
in this natural progression,

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:08.750 align:middle line:84%
at level 7, everyone on
the planet from birth

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:10.940 align:middle line:90%
is in God consciousness.

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:15.320 align:middle line:84%
Number 7, that's where humans
will be in about 300,000

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:17.030 align:middle line:90%
to 500,000 years.

00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:20.150 align:middle line:84%
By the end of this
Yuga, this cycle,

00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:24.920 align:middle line:84%
this entire planet will be
inhabited by beings like that,

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:29.240 align:middle line:84%
by us having our progeny 20,000
generations in the future.

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:31.490 align:middle line:90%
It's really very beautiful.

00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, that
civilization really

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:36.860 align:middle line:90%
correlates the celestial realm.

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:43.550 align:middle line:84%
They can phase by intent from
3D to celestial, the world

00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:45.950 align:middle line:90%
and the craft, all of it.

00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very exalted
state of civilization.

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And then at a level
8 civilization,

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:57.560 align:middle line:84%
this is where you have all the
technologies are interfacing

00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:59.870 align:middle line:90%
as a celestial level--

00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:01.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean everything
on the planet--

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:04.370 align:middle line:84%
not just the advanced
ambassadors and starships,

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:07.490 align:middle line:84%
but the entire manifestation
of their planet.

00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And really, it's then by
thought everything happens.

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:14.150 align:middle line:84%
You materialize, do everything
just exactly like you've

00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:16.610 align:middle line:84%
heard in these higher
celestial realms,

00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:18.650 align:middle line:84%
but they're in a
planetary system.

00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:20.960 align:middle line:10%
And they can then
choose, by the way,

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:26.240 align:middle line:10%
to be in the universe we
think of or in this higher

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.800 align:middle line:10%
celestial dimension.

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And then, now we're going to
get into some extremely advanced

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:36.920 align:middle line:84%
civilizations, the level
9, where you have about 1%

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:41.300 align:middle line:84%
of that population that are
in Brahmin consciousness,

00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:43.190 align:middle line:90%
universal consciousness.

00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:48.290 align:middle line:84%
The ambassadors of and guardians
of entire emerging worlds

00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:49.790 align:middle line:90%
are from that level.

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:52.370 align:middle line:84%
I call them the
primogenitures of life

00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:54.830 align:middle line:84%
and the protectors of
the development of life

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:56.180 align:middle line:90%
throughout the cosmos.

00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And then level 10, everyone
in that civilization

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:01.360 align:middle line:90%
is in Brahmin consciousness.

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:02.610 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: It's just incredible.

00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:03.485 align:middle line:90%
This is so beautiful.

00:29:03.485 --> 00:29:05.507 align:middle line:84%
>>GREER: Yeah, it's
beautiful where we're going.

00:29:05.507 --> 00:29:06.590 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:07.700 align:middle line:90%
I agree 1,000%.

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:08.060 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: Yep.

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:09.020 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: Thank you, Dr. Greer.

00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:09.870 align:middle line:10%
That was amazing.

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:10.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GREER: Thank you.

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:12.020 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY: I'm Billy Carson.

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:13.550 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
watching "Disclosure

00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:15.820 align:middle line:90%
with Dr. Steven Greer."

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:20.000 align:middle line:90%
