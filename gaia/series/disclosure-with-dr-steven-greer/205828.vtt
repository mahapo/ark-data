BILLY CARSON: Welcome
to "Disclosure"

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.510 align:middle line:10%
with Dr. Steven Greer.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.600 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we discuss
unacknowledged Special Access

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.740 align:middle line:10%
Programs.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.020 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Greer, welcome.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.270 align:middle line:90%
STEVEN GREER: Glad to be here.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:30.170 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.160 align:middle line:84%
BILLY: Dr. Greer, what are
unacknowledged Special Access

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.330 align:middle line:90%
Programs?

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.680 align:middle line:10%
GREER: Yeah, this is
confusing to a lot of people,

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.350 align:middle line:10%
including some of
the senior folks

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.270 align:middle line:10%
in the government I've briefed.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.490 align:middle line:10%
Special Access Projects
are ones that you just

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.010 align:middle line:10%
have to be clear to.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.780 align:middle line:84%
You can have a confidential
secret or top secret clearance,

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.100 align:middle line:90%
but that isn't what matters.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.190 align:middle line:84%
It's what you're clear to
for a Special Access Project.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.580 align:middle line:84%
The unacknowledged ones are
what the pop culture call black.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:58.570 align:middle line:90%
They're off the books.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:59.890 align:middle line:90%
They're off the record.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And they're hermetically
sealed from anyone not in them.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.310 align:middle line:84%
So to give you an example,
one of my military advisors

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.220 align:middle line:84%
had been in an unacknowledged
Special Access Project.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.590 align:middle line:84%
Let's call it USAP for
short, so we don't have

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:12.940 align:middle line:90%
to keep saying the whole term.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:13.450 align:middle line:90%
BILLY: Yeah.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.867 align:middle line:84%
GREER: And the way
that worked, it

00:01:14.867 --> 00:01:16.840 align:middle line:90%
was a $2 or $3 billion project.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.520 align:middle line:90%
It was off books, black money.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.640 align:middle line:84%
There was an admiral
who headed it up.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And the instructions were he was
taken into an underground SCIF,

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.330 align:middle line:84%
Secure Communication
Information Facility,

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.800 align:middle line:84%
and everyone had all their
weapons and electronics taken.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.310 align:middle line:90%
They went underground.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.500 align:middle line:84%
A security officer
was the only one

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.040 align:middle line:84%
with a gun, pulled out the
clip, pulled out a button and--

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.520 align:middle line:84%
a bullet and said, this
bullet has your name on it

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.980 align:middle line:84%
if you tell anyone, including
your CO, about this project.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.360 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't exist except for
the people in this room.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.680 align:middle line:90%
That's how those run.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.330 align:middle line:84%
So that is how they are
structured and maintain

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.580 align:middle line:90%
very, very strict secrecy.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's beyond just a
normal top secret program.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.419 align:middle line:84%
The unacknowledged
Special Access Projects,

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:10.520 align:middle line:84%
which I learned about
in the early '90s,

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.300 align:middle line:84%
are really how you structure
both corporate and government

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.640 align:middle line:84%
programs dealing with
a number of issues.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.940 align:middle line:84%
But the biggest one, the
crown jewel of all the USAPs,

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.700 align:middle line:84%
are extraterrestrial
intelligence, UFOs,

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.070 align:middle line:84%
the technologies
associated with them,

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.760 align:middle line:84%
the energy systems,
propulsion systems.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.560 align:middle line:90%
BILLY: Wow.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.750 align:middle line:84%
Would this be
similar to like when

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.840 align:middle line:84%
you hear these great numbers,
like $4 trillion missing,

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.480 align:middle line:84%
$10 trillion missing
from the budget?

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.310 align:middle line:84%
I remember Donald
Rumsfeld having

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.000 align:middle line:90%
to answer to this one time.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.550 align:middle line:84%
GREER: The reality
of it is we're

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.030 align:middle line:84%
estimating now it's anywhere
from $8 to $20 trillion

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.840 align:middle line:84%
that have gone into
those operations

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.860 align:middle line:90%
over many, many decades.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.190 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it is, of course,
from very creative sources

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.990 align:middle line:90%
of funding.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.448 align:middle line:90%
We can get into that.

00:02:55.448 --> 00:02:57.240 align:middle line:84%
But the structure of
it's what's important.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.080 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't understand
the architecture of secrecy.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.890 align:middle line:84%
For example, I
briefed an admiral

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.800 align:middle line:90%
once who knew about USAPs.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.020 align:middle line:84%
But the USAPs dealing
with the UFO and ET

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.450 align:middle line:90%
issue, he was denied access to.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And when I gave him a document
that had the project code names

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.590 align:middle line:84%
and numbers on them,
he looked into it,

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.960 align:middle line:84%
and was basically told he
didn't have a need to know.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And this guy was the
head of intelligence

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.950 align:middle line:90%
for the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.520 align:middle line:90%
We'll get to this later.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.920 align:middle line:90%
So I think that--

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.160 align:middle line:84%
there's sort of the public and
the media sort of compounds

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.100 align:middle line:84%
this by acting like the
high school civics lesson

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.870 align:middle line:84%
we have, where
there's the president,

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.810 align:middle line:84%
there's the Congress,
there's the Supreme Court.

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.535 align:middle line:84%
The commander in
chief is the president

00:03:40.535 --> 00:03:43.880 align:middle line:84%
and has an all-access
pass to everything.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.060 align:middle line:90%
That's true on most issues.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.790 align:middle line:10%
It is not true on
the UFO and ET issue,

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.660 align:middle line:10%
and has not been
since about 1956

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.650 align:middle line:10%
to '59, when Eisenhower,
President Eisenhower,

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.710 align:middle line:10%
lost control over
these operations.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.310 align:middle line:10%
And that's when this
super top secret program

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.580 align:middle line:10%
started and pretty
much left the president

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.700 align:middle line:10%
and many senior officials
in the government who

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:11.940 align:middle line:10%
should know out of the loop.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:12.740 align:middle line:90%
BILLY: Wow.

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.130 align:middle line:10%
GREER: Another example-- some
directors for the CIA are read

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.450 align:middle line:10%
into or briefed--

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.290 align:middle line:10%
read into means briefed--

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.420 align:middle line:10%
these projects.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.120 align:middle line:10%
For example, George
H.W. Bush was.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.070 align:middle line:10%
The CIA director I
briefed, Woolsey,

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.220 align:middle line:10%
had not been because they didn't
trust him with the information,

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.330 align:middle line:10%
and he hadn't come up
through the system.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.310 align:middle line:10%
That's how those work.

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.160 align:middle line:84%
And I got pulled into
that world from people

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.940 align:middle line:84%
who were in those projects
back around 1992, '93.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.730 align:middle line:84%
>> So if these USAPs don't
fall under regular government

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.390 align:middle line:84%
oversight, then who has
control over these black budget

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:45.950 align:middle line:90%
projects?

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, these projects are
overseen by a committee,

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:51.860 align:middle line:90%
you know, the recent--

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.170 align:middle line:84%
you heard about
the MJ-12 committee

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.570 align:middle line:90%
back in the Truman era.

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.130 align:middle line:84%
There are a number of splinters
from that in the last 70 years.

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.710 align:middle line:84%
The one that's most
currently known

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.860 align:middle line:84%
is Maj-IC the Majority
Intelligence Committee.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, that entity
works with a lot

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.530 align:middle line:84%
of corporate and other folks
and it's transnational.

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.270 align:middle line:84%
The other thing I
need to mention here,

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.420 align:middle line:84%
these are not US
government programs per se.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.150 align:middle line:84%
Go and look at the
globe from space.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.980 align:middle line:84%
There are no boundaries drawn on
it, say, in Russia, China, US.

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.140 align:middle line:84%
The group that runs
these programs is

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:31.700 align:middle line:84%
truly transnational-- transcends
international boundaries.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.000 align:middle line:84%
So people think international,
UN, State Department.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.280 align:middle line:84%
This is kind of more a sub
rosa underneath project.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And they have representation
and operations,

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.980 align:middle line:84%
and most of the
significant countries

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.650 align:middle line:84%
in the world that are advanced
enough technologically,

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.370 align:middle line:84%
financially to be
deemed of significance.

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.520 align:middle line:10%
When I met with Senator John
Warner's chief of staff,

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.250 align:middle line:10%
he, we knew, was a
member of this committee

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.870 align:middle line:10%
with President George H. W.
Bush and CIA director Bush.

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And his chief of
staff said, what

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.360 align:middle line:84%
makes you think the Senator
isn't part of this, just

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.830 align:middle line:90%
flat out, and doesn't know?

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.510 align:middle line:84%
I said, I know that
he does, but he

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:13.177 align:middle line:84%
needs to be on the
right side of history

00:06:13.177 --> 00:06:15.020 align:middle line:84%
because this is a
criminal enterprise.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.650 align:middle line:90%
It is unconstitutional.

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.170 align:middle line:90%
It is illegal.

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:19.190 align:middle line:90%
And we can prove that.

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:23.300 align:middle line:84%
If anyone wants to contest
this, let's take this to court,

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.360 align:middle line:84%
because we will subpoena the
people I have briefed in senior

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.870 align:middle line:84%
positions who absolutely should
have known about these projects

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:30.750 align:middle line:90%
who don't.

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.470 align:middle line:84%
So that's a complete
breakdown of the Constitution.

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:38.580 align:middle line:84%
But there's a very specific
nuance to this particular area,

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.370 align:middle line:84%
and it's specific to
unacknowledged Special Access

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:42.170 align:middle line:90%
Projects.

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:45.380 align:middle line:84%
And the people who actually
control them are not

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.900 align:middle line:84%
just what we would call
government officials,

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.065 align:middle line:90%
they're in government.

00:06:49.065 --> 00:06:49.940 align:middle line:90%
They're in corporate.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.020 align:middle line:90%
They're in finance.

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.270 align:middle line:84%
They're in various
walks of life.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And they work together to
sort of maintain the status

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.360 align:middle line:90%
quo of the way the world runs.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.430 align:middle line:90%
And here's why.

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.550 align:middle line:10%
Back in the '50s when
we hit pay dirt--

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:08.150 align:middle line:10%
reverse engineering, and
studying so-called anti-gravity

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:09.230 align:middle line:10%
systems--

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:12.710 align:middle line:10%
that, by the way, was
mastered in October 1954.

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:14.280 align:middle line:10%
Everybody remember that date--

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.220 align:middle line:10%
October 1954.

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:21.050 align:middle line:84%
So all internal combustion
engines, surface roads, jets,

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:25.970 align:middle line:84%
rockets, public utilities, on
and on, nuclear power plants,

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:29.240 align:middle line:84%
have not been needed
since October 1954.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's hundreds of
trillions of dollars,

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:32.330 align:middle line:90%
literally.

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:36.380 align:middle line:84%
So that's the issue, is that
it's a macroeconomic problem.

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.752 align:middle line:90%
It's a strategic problem.

00:07:38.752 --> 00:07:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot
of powerful interests

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:44.780 align:middle line:84%
who don't want to see
all those assets go

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.220 align:middle line:90%
the way of the dinosaur.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.080 align:middle line:84%
Because when this
knowledge and with it

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.830 align:middle line:84%
the technology comes
out, it's a new world.

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:53.600 align:middle line:84%
It's like the ET said
to Colonel Corso,

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.670 align:middle line:84%
"It's a new world
if you can take it."

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:58.460 align:middle line:84%
So we should have taken it
in the '50s and we didn't.

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:02.510 align:middle line:84%
Now we're facing massive
crises in the environment

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:04.730 align:middle line:84%
and geopolitically
and elsewhere.

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:06.170 align:middle line:90%
But it's fixable.

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:08.210 align:middle line:84%
And I always tell
people, good news

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:10.940 align:middle line:84%
is we have the solutions
to all these problems.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.760 align:middle line:84%
The bad news is, they are
in unacknowledged projects,

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.850 align:middle line:84%
and lethal force has been
used to keep them secret.

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:18.480 align:middle line:90%
BILLY: Wow, incredible.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.280 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.980 align:middle line:84%
I just-- at some point,
we have to realize

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:25.400 align:middle line:84%
that we've got to just
wake up and release these

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.510 align:middle line:90%
to the general population.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:28.250 align:middle line:84%
I guess that's what
your mission here is.

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:29.060 align:middle line:90%
GREER: Yes.

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:33.409 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my main purpose
is creating ambassadors

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:37.530 align:middle line:84%
to the universe in
consciousness, and in fact,

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:39.049 align:middle line:90%
with these civilizations.

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:42.980 align:middle line:84%
But to get there I
realized along the way

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:45.570 align:middle line:84%
I kind of got into
this effort and started

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:46.820 align:middle line:90%
the whole disclosure movement.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:50.120 align:middle line:84%
Because what I realized
was if we make contact

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:54.080 align:middle line:84%
with these civilizations,
but then covert use apps

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:57.080 align:middle line:84%
shoot them down or
do worse things,

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.260 align:middle line:84%
then we have to do
all this together.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:04.370 align:middle line:10%
And excuse the salty
language, but when

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:06.740 align:middle line:10%
I was sitting with Senator
Barry Goldwater, who

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:09.920 align:middle line:10%
was the senior Senator from
Arizona who ran for president

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.830 align:middle line:10%
in 1964, I was at his home.

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:15.350 align:middle line:10%
And Senator
Goldwater said, look,

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:17.870 align:middle line:10%
it was a goddamn mistake
then and a goddamn mistake

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:20.960 align:middle line:10%
now that this was
ever kept secret.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.950 align:middle line:84%
But he told me he was denied
access to these projects.

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:27.170 align:middle line:10%
And when he asked General
Curtis LeMay about it,

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:29.600 align:middle line:10%
who was chief of
Staff of the Air Force

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.508 align:middle line:10%
and a good friend
of his, he said,

00:09:31.508 --> 00:09:33.800 align:middle line:10%
get me into the Blue Room at
Wright Patterson Air Force

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:38.600 align:middle line:10%
base, where all the ET remains
and stuff were kept back then.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.360 align:middle line:84%
Curtis LeMay, General LeMay
turned to him and said,

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.160 align:middle line:84%
Barry, I can't even get
into that area anymore.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And if you ever ask
me about this again,

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:50.450 align:middle line:84%
I will personally see that
you are court-martialed out

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:51.830 align:middle line:90%
of the Air Force reserves.

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:54.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm sitting in Senator
Goldwater's living room,

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.620 align:middle line:84%
and he's retired from
the Senate, in his '80s.

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:57.870 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going, was he serious?

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:00.050 align:middle line:84%
He said, he was serious
as a heart attack.

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:03.800 align:middle line:84%
And so in my meetings with
all these sort of people

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.930 align:middle line:84%
all over the world,
what I found is

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:08.750 align:middle line:84%
that the sort of
conspiracy theories

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:11.180 align:middle line:84%
of who is in and who's
out and how this runs

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.070 align:middle line:90%
is always inaccurate.

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:15.470 align:middle line:84%
And what I've tried to do
is bring some clarity to it.

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:17.480 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not
helpful to paint

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.940 align:middle line:84%
the whole government
or the whole CIA

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.250 align:middle line:84%
or the whole Pentagon
with that brush.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:25.280 align:middle line:90%
It's got to be more detailed.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:28.070 align:middle line:84%
People need to have a more
complete understanding

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:30.260 align:middle line:90%
of how these projects operate.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.810 align:middle line:84%
BILLY: So Dr. Greer,
do other countries

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:35.780 align:middle line:84%
operate on the same exact
premise like what you just

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:36.840 align:middle line:90%
described?

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.980 align:middle line:84%
GREER: Yes, I mean, the
system of USAPs is replicated,

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:43.040 align:middle line:90%
as I said, transnationally.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.690 align:middle line:90%
It's not just a US effort.

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:48.080 align:middle line:84%
The center of gravity for
it is the United States

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:52.700 align:middle line:84%
because of our military power,
economic power, technology.

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:55.820 align:middle line:84%
But there are corollaries
and associates

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.530 align:middle line:84%
of this operation in
all the other countries,

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:02.600 align:middle line:84%
including China, Russia, Great
Britain, Australia, all around.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.060 align:middle line:84%
So in other countries,
occasionally you'll

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:07.490 align:middle line:90%
see an effort, like in France.

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:09.620 align:middle line:84%
The government of France,
the Ministry of Defense,

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:13.070 align:middle line:84%
wanted to learn to make
peaceful contact with the ETs.

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:14.750 align:middle line:90%
And they were going forward--

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:15.830 align:middle line:90%
Admiral Moran.

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And it was an admiral and an
MD and also a PhD in physics

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:23.780 align:middle line:84%
set this up under
President Sarkozy.

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:26.090 align:middle line:84%
We went over there,
did a CE5 event.

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:27.200 align:middle line:90%
Amazing what happened.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.340 align:middle line:90%
Unbelievable.

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:32.150 align:middle line:84%
But when the process
of that was going on,

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:35.570 align:middle line:84%
their ambassador from
France to the United States,

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.370 align:middle line:84%
was approached by an
intelligence operative

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:40.973 align:middle line:84%
and threatened and told
point blank, don't do this.

00:11:40.973 --> 00:11:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we're
going to do it in France.

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:44.150 align:middle line:90%
It's none of your business.

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:46.812 align:middle line:84%
And they said, yes, but don't
get anywhere near a US asset

00:11:46.812 --> 00:11:48.020 align:middle line:90%
or you're going to regret it.

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And it was this back and
forth and back and forth.

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:53.720 align:middle line:84%
So even though that was
coming from a top admiral

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.420 align:middle line:84%
in the Ministry of
Defense of France,

00:11:56.420 --> 00:12:01.040 align:middle line:84%
he was not read into the
unacknowledged operations

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.910 align:middle line:90%
even in his own country.

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:04.533 align:middle line:90%
So that's one of the problems.

00:12:04.533 --> 00:12:06.200 align:middle line:84%
The same is true in
America, by the way.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:10.370 align:middle line:84%
The generals, admirals I
met with in this country,

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:12.380 align:middle line:84%
if I met with them, it's
usually because they've

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:15.358 align:middle line:84%
made an inquiry through
channels on this

00:12:15.358 --> 00:12:17.900 align:middle line:84%
and have been basically told,
we're not telling you anything,

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:18.895 align:middle line:90%
or lied to.

00:12:18.895 --> 00:12:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And most of them
are smart enough

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:21.320 align:middle line:90%
to know they're being lied to.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:21.950 align:middle line:90%
BILLY: Right, right.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:23.840 align:middle line:84%
So they haven't fully
been briefed and to say--

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.010 align:middle line:84%
GREER: They haven't
been briefed at all.

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:25.410 align:middle line:90%
BILLY: Haven't been briefed.

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:25.970 align:middle line:90%
GREER: Not at all.

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:26.990 align:middle line:90%
Not fully-- forget it.

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:29.150 align:middle line:84%
They can't get-- they were not
even shown where the washroom

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:29.510 align:middle line:90%
is--

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:30.070 align:middle line:90%
BILLY: Wow, incredible.

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:31.070 align:middle line:90%
GREER: --in these USAPs.

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:33.167 align:middle line:84%
BILLY: And so the other
countries are basically--

00:12:33.167 --> 00:12:35.000 align:middle line:84%
sometimes are they in
collusion, or are they

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.650 align:middle line:90%
all operating individually?

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:39.890 align:middle line:84%
GREER: No, they all were
cooperative on this issue.

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:44.420 align:middle line:84%
So interestingly, back in
the early days, there was a--

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:45.765 align:middle line:90%
they had a tap on my phone.

00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:47.015 align:middle line:90%
It was when you had landlines.

00:12:47.015 --> 00:12:48.110 align:middle line:90%
Remember the old days?

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:48.910 align:middle line:90%
BILLY: Oh, yeah.

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:52.970 align:middle line:84%
GREER: And I picked up my
phone, and they made a mistake

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:55.220 align:middle line:84%
and left the hookup
to the satellite,

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.290 align:middle line:84%
and I could hear
the control room.

00:12:57.290 --> 00:13:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And I listened for a minute
and heard everyone speak,

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:03.330 align:middle line:84%
and it was like a United
Nations of different people.

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:06.830 align:middle line:90%
And finally I said, who is this?

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And a woman came on, very
thick foreign accent.

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:11.810 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't tell-- could
have been Middle Eastern.

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:12.980 align:middle line:90%
And said, oh, my God.

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:13.790 align:middle line:90%
It's Mr. Greer.

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:14.590 align:middle line:90%
And I was so mad.

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:16.880 align:middle line:90%
I said, Dr. Greer to you.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:20.090 align:middle line:84%
But I was irritated
then because I didn't

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:23.000 align:middle line:90%
like being surveyed that way.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.430 align:middle line:10%
But-- and it's like
Karl Wolfe, our witness,

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:29.510 align:middle line:10%
disclosure witness, was
at Langley Air Force base

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:33.410 align:middle line:10%
when we were downloading
the digital images in 1968

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:34.250 align:middle line:10%
from the moon.

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And he saw all the-- there
were old structures and newer

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:40.400 align:middle line:84%
structures already
there before we landed.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.028 align:middle line:84%
And when he saw that,
he knew he wasn't

00:13:42.028 --> 00:13:43.070 align:middle line:90%
supposed to be seeing it.

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:46.520 align:middle line:84%
It was a top secret-- but
he said the area literally

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.350 align:middle line:90%
was like a UN of people.

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:49.850 align:middle line:84%
There were people
there from China--

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:51.260 align:middle line:90%
now, this is in the '60s--

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.420 align:middle line:84%
Russia, other
countries, and they're

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:57.380 align:middle line:84%
all working in this
highly classified SCIF--

00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:00.320 align:middle line:84%
again, Secure Communication
Information Facility--

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.900 align:middle line:84%
where they were downloading
the early digital pictures

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:06.200 align:middle line:84%
as the lunar orbiter took
pictures around the moon.

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And those were filtered
before they went

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:09.860 align:middle line:90%
to the mainstream NASA people.

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:14.900 align:middle line:84%
The problem gets to be,
how did that develop?

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:16.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, it developed
in the '50s and '60s.

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:17.690 align:middle line:90%
BILLY: Incredible.

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:18.930 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely incredible.

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:21.050 align:middle line:84%
So Dr., let's unpack this
just a little bit more,

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:22.633 align:middle line:84%
because I think a
lot of people really

00:14:22.633 --> 00:14:25.400 align:middle line:84%
want to know the underlying
basis of how this actually

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:26.770 align:middle line:90%
works.

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:27.570 align:middle line:90%
GREER: OK.

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:31.530 align:middle line:84%
So I think if you want
to visualize it this way,

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:36.930 align:middle line:84%
it's a very classified,
unacknowledged operation that

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:40.680 align:middle line:84%
has cells and affiliates
in various countries,

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:44.370 align:middle line:84%
within other countries,
corporations, intelligence

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:46.620 align:middle line:90%
services, and governments.

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:50.820 align:middle line:84%
But again, just like in America,
there's not a need to know,

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:52.800 align:middle line:84%
in the opinion of
the committee running

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:56.430 align:middle line:84%
this, for all presidents
to know or to know fully

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:59.140 align:middle line:84%
what's happening, or
senators or oversight.

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:01.690 align:middle line:90%
So it's run the same way.

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:05.320 align:middle line:84%
It just-- you take that and
replicate it around the globe.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.110 align:middle line:84%
It's just that not
every country--

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:10.400 align:middle line:84%
for example, there are
developing world countries

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.150 align:middle line:84%
where there would not
be a large presence.

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:13.650 align:middle line:90%
But there are some, like Brazil.

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:18.100 align:middle line:84%
There's a very big facility in
Brazil that's related to this.

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:21.450 align:middle line:84%
So I think that there
are these operations that

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:23.370 align:middle line:90%
are in various places--

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:27.000 align:middle line:84%
it's coordinated by an
international group.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.280 align:middle line:90%
And that group is global.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:32.130 align:middle line:84%
But again, the center of
gravity is in the United States.

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:35.130 align:middle line:84%
So there would be elements
of this operating even

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:36.570 align:middle line:90%
in China and Russia.

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:38.970 align:middle line:84%
But that's not where the
center of control is.

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:40.890 align:middle line:90%
They are representative in it.

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:44.430 align:middle line:84%
But it's where the big
powerhouse of technology,

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:48.240 align:middle line:84%
reverse engineering has
happened that's really critical,

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.490 align:middle line:90%
and that is the United States.

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:53.550 align:middle line:84%
My understanding from people
who worked with Eisenhower

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:56.340 align:middle line:84%
that I've spoken with who were
in the White House with him,

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:59.820 align:middle line:84%
is that he lost control
of it because he wanted

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:04.470 align:middle line:84%
to have a rapprochement, a
sort of a peaceful relationship

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:09.030 align:middle line:84%
with the ETs in the whole
nuclear Cold War craziness,

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:11.220 align:middle line:84%
and go forward as
a civilization.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:14.190 align:middle line:84%
The people who benefit
mightily from the status

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:17.310 align:middle line:84%
quo of the petrodollar
system, the oil

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:19.170 align:middle line:90%
system, and the weapons--

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:22.170 align:middle line:84%
the military industrial
complex, as Eisen called it,

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:23.700 align:middle line:90%
didn't want that to happen.

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.200 align:middle line:90%
So all that evolved.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.100 align:middle line:90%
And now we're at--

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:28.920 align:middle line:84%
what, we're at
70-some years past--

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:32.760 align:middle line:84%
or 60-plus years past where
this got totally out of control.

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And that was why Eisenhower
made that famous speech when

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:38.530 align:middle line:84%
he left office, the day
he left office in 1961.

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:39.330 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

of government,

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:45.060 align:middle line:84%

[END PLAYBACK]

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And this sort of secrecy-- and
he was talking about extreme

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:53.740 align:middle line:90%
secrecy--

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:56.190 align:middle line:84%
could be a threat to
democracy and our way of life.

00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:57.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, remember, this
is a Republican

00:16:57.870 --> 00:17:00.810 align:middle line:84%
and a five-star general
and a World War II hero.

00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:03.330 align:middle line:10%
And I also remind
people Senator Inouye,

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:07.200 align:middle line:10%
who said there exists a secret
government with its own Air

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:12.780 align:middle line:10%
Force, its own Navy, its own
funding mechanism, that is free

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:14.970 align:middle line:10%
from the law and
above the law itself.

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:16.890 align:middle line:10%
I'm paraphrasing, but
you can-- you'll see it.

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:18.910 align:middle line:10%
It's pretty much exactly that.

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:20.670 align:middle line:90%
And he was correct.

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:24.880 align:middle line:84%
BILLY: Sounds much like the JFK
speech about secret societies.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:25.680 align:middle line:90%
GREER: Yes.

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:25.920 align:middle line:90%
BILLY: Yeah.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:26.550 align:middle line:90%
GREER: Yeah.

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:27.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:30.450 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
interest in these programs

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:33.240 align:middle line:84%
and representation from
other, let's call them

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.880 align:middle line:84%
non-governmental
covert programs,

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:36.990 align:middle line:90%
and including corporate.

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:39.540 align:middle line:84%
There's a very
large representation

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:43.590 align:middle line:84%
in this in certain elements
of finance and banking,

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:46.170 align:middle line:90%
as well as technology.

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:48.300 align:middle line:84%
You look at the
aerospace industry.

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.000 align:middle line:84%
You know, Boeing
has jets you fly on,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.750 align:middle line:84%
but they have an unacknowledged
engineering research division.

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:57.810 align:middle line:84%
Lockheed Skunk
Works-- same thing.

00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:00.240 align:middle line:84%
They're the things you know
about, like the old U2 spy

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.370 align:middle line:84%
plane and things with
jets, and then there

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:03.930 align:middle line:90%
the classified technologies.

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:04.740 align:middle line:90%
And it's a hybrid.

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:06.198 align:middle line:84%
One thing I want
to say-- it's sort

00:18:06.198 --> 00:18:11.040 align:middle line:84%
of a hybrid between governmental
and corporate and private

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.180 align:middle line:90%
interests.

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:15.480 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly,
if you approach it--

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:18.030 align:middle line:90%
say, you're an investigator.

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:21.570 align:middle line:84%
You're approaching it from a
governmental point of view,

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:23.860 align:middle line:84%
a corporate entity will
say, this is proprietary.

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:24.660 align:middle line:90%
BILLY: Right.

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:25.460 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:30.240 align:middle line:84%
GREER: If you approach it
from a private point of view,

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:34.020 align:middle line:84%
that angle, it's a top
secret, unacknowledged project

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:35.500 align:middle line:90%
you don't have access to.

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:38.850 align:middle line:84%
So it's sort of hermetically
sealed off, like a silo,

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:40.080 align:middle line:90%
from other operations.

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, every once in
a while, there's

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.650 align:middle line:90%
someone that I meet who--

00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:45.030 align:middle line:90%
and this is recent--

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:47.100 align:middle line:84%
a man who is in the
technology management

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:51.000 align:middle line:84%
office of the sub-basement
in the Pentagon from 2002

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.790 align:middle line:84%
until 2012, who had baseline
clearance across 16 of these

00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:58.950 align:middle line:84%
unacknowledged Special
Access Projects.

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And so he's provided
me an enormous amount

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:04.930 align:middle line:84%
of intelligence and information
on more current operations

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:05.730 align:middle line:90%
that I have.

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:07.320 align:middle line:84%
BILLY: Dr. Greer,
a lot of witnesses

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:09.210 align:middle line:84%
have come forward
to speak to you,

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:12.990 align:middle line:84%
and there's one particular
witness that you call GA.

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:15.340 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us a little
bit more about that?

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:16.140 align:middle line:90%
GREER: Yes.

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:18.840 align:middle line:84%
This gentleman approached
me, and I referred to him

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:21.630 align:middle line:84%
a moment ago, who was in the
technology management office,

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:26.280 align:middle line:84%
and some of the most amazing
information we've received.

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:28.020 align:middle line:84%
I've met with him
personally, and he

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:32.520 align:middle line:84%
wrote me and sent me his badges,
proof of who and where he was.

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:34.350 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly,
it was a man who

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:36.690 align:middle line:84%
spent his career
in the military,

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:40.200 align:middle line:84%
retired, never had heard of an
unacknowledged Special Access

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:44.100 align:middle line:84%
Project, then got
recruited as a civilian.

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:47.640 align:middle line:84%
And when he was taken
into that civilian role,

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:50.130 align:middle line:84%
he was read into these
projects because he

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:52.770 align:middle line:84%
was part of the criminal
investigative division,

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:57.750 align:middle line:84%
and had to do a investigation
into a security breach.

00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:59.190 align:middle line:90%
And there was a general--

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:04.140 align:middle line:84%
three-star-- who took an
unauthorized girlfriend

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:09.270 align:middle line:84%
into a SCIF near Fort
Sill in Lawton, Oklahoma.

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:12.570 align:middle line:84%
And there's an
underground base there,

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:15.060 align:middle line:84%
what's called a DUMB, Deep
Underground Military Base

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:19.860 align:middle line:84%
facility, where they were
studying the cloaking mechanism

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:21.670 align:middle line:90%
of an ET craft there.

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:25.320 align:middle line:84%
This woman was an executive
with Booz Allen Hamilton,

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:29.130 align:middle line:84%
and wanted to get the contract
to further that research,

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:31.870 align:middle line:84%
but she wasn't
cleared to that level.

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And so the general
took his paramour in,

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.680 align:middle line:90%
and it became a big problem.

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:42.090 align:middle line:84%
Because in his
romantic association,

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:45.120 align:middle line:84%
she sort of convinced
him to take her in so

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:47.760 align:middle line:84%
that her company could get
a leg up on the contract

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.740 align:middle line:90%
and bid on this.

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:52.740 align:middle line:84%
What happened in the
course of his investigation

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:56.280 align:middle line:84%
is that he had to get
read into a whole lot

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:58.080 align:middle line:90%
of different places.

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:01.470 align:middle line:84%
And that ended up being
baseline clearance,

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:04.950 align:middle line:84%
they call it, across 16 of these
unacknowledged Special Access

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:05.760 align:middle line:90%
Projects.

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.530 align:middle line:84%
So that took him to
other facilities.

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:09.600 align:middle line:84%
For example, there
was a craft that

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.180 align:middle line:84%
was downed by our
electronic weapons systems

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:16.230 align:middle line:84%
outside Seoul in the
mountains of Korea.

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:18.570 align:middle line:84%
That craft was so huge,
they had to dig out

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:21.540 align:middle line:84%
a whole huge hollowed
out area of a mountain

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:23.310 align:middle line:90%
to create its own SCIF.

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's still there
with this craft in it.

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And then probably the
most disturbing thing

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:32.130 align:middle line:84%
he told me, which is something
I already knew about,

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:34.170 align:middle line:84%
but he gave me more
details, and he

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:37.860 align:middle line:84%
was in the theater of
operations for the invasion

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:40.370 align:middle line:90%
and war with Iraq.

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And there was a satellite system
that they could switch on,

00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:50.270 align:middle line:84%
and it would basically target a
volume of airspace above Iraq.

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:54.670 align:middle line:84%
And we would clear all of
our allied helicopters,

00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:57.700 align:middle line:84%
jets out of the area,
switch the system on,

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:00.970 align:middle line:84%
and every one of Saddam
Hussein's jets and helicopters

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:04.120 align:middle line:84%
would drop to the ground,
completely disabled.

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:06.610 align:middle line:84%
That was when we first
went into the Iraq war

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:08.050 align:middle line:90%
in the early 2000s.

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:12.220 align:middle line:84%
He was there more recently
before he left that command

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:16.990 align:middle line:84%
at the Marshall Space Flight
Center in Huntsville, Alabama,

00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:20.150 align:middle line:84%
where there was another
major generation of those.

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:21.220 align:middle line:90%
And so this is dangerous.

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:24.370 align:middle line:84%
Because you have unacknowledged
Special Access Projects

00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:26.920 align:middle line:84%
that could hit the
button on something

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:29.620 align:middle line:84%
and cause all kinds
of havoc and things

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:32.000 align:middle line:84%
that would be made
to look alien.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:32.800 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:34.592 align:middle line:84%
So this is the key
thing he was telling me.

00:22:34.592 --> 00:22:37.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, I have dozens of people who
have been in these interagency

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:42.190 align:middle line:84%
committees or across these USAPs
who told me about what this is.

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's been an operational
plan since the '60s.

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:48.490 align:middle line:84%
BILLY: So Dr. Greer, talking
about the secrecy now,

00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:52.000 align:middle line:84%
you had mentioned a rogue
group in the Pentagon.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.600 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us a little
bit more about that?

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.220 align:middle line:84%
GREER: Yes, well
that's-- of course,

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:59.400 align:middle line:84%
the unacknowledged Special
Access Projects are all rogue

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:00.750 align:middle line:90%
and they're all illegal.

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:04.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, people say, what's the
foundation of you saying this?

00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:08.370 align:middle line:84%
I've taken many meetings with
senior military officials.

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:10.560 align:middle line:10%
One of them was
Admiral Tom Wilson.

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.690 align:middle line:10%
I did do a briefing
at the Pentagon.

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:17.610 align:middle line:10%
It was a stand-up formal
briefing in the admiral's

00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:20.280 align:middle line:10%
office and conference area.

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:21.990 align:middle line:84%
And he was the head
of intelligence,

00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:23.400 align:middle line:90%
Joint Chiefs of Staff.

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:26.530 align:middle line:84%
So this is not just
any old admiral.

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:28.290 align:middle line:84%
And there were--
but this is someone

00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:30.330 align:middle line:84%
who would have been the
head of intelligence

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:32.280 align:middle line:84%
and putting intelligence
briefings together

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:34.500 align:middle line:84%
for the Joint Chiefs of
Staff for the Pentagon.

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:39.430 align:middle line:10%
He received from us a
document, a briefing document.

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:42.600 align:middle line:10%
And one of the documents, the
first document on the top,

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:45.270 align:middle line:10%
is a National Reconnaissance
Office document

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:48.300 align:middle line:10%
that is not declassified,
but I got a copy of it,

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:50.880 align:middle line:10%
and it lists the project
code names and numbers.

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:54.060 align:middle line:10%
Based on that, he
recognized, he thought, one

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:56.730 align:middle line:10%
and contacted them, and
then contacted some offices

00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:58.260 align:middle line:10%
in the Pentagon.

00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:00.957 align:middle line:84%
And basically what
he was told was,

00:24:00.957 --> 00:24:02.790 align:middle line:84%
you don't have a need
to know, and we're not

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:04.050 align:middle line:90%
going to tell you.

00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And he persisted, and he was
threatened with being demoted--

00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:09.480 align:middle line:90%
a star taken off his lapel.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:13.930 align:middle line:84%
But the admiral was
very laser-focused.

00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:17.790 align:middle line:84%
At the end of it I said,
we really need your help.

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:22.493 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, who else has
run into this wall of secrecy

00:24:22.493 --> 00:24:23.910 align:middle line:84%
and been threatened
the way I was?

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:26.790 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, the CIA
director, the President,

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:27.920 align:middle line:90%
the Secretary of Defense.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:28.720 align:middle line:90%
He said, the--

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:30.090 align:middle line:90%
I said, yes.

00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:34.320 align:middle line:10%
Gordon Cooper, who was
a famous astronaut who

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:38.550 align:middle line:10%
had one of these craft land
out at Edwards back in '56

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:40.530 align:middle line:10%
and got film footage
from his crew

00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:42.750 align:middle line:10%
and flew it back on
a general's plane,

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:45.480 align:middle line:10%
was asked by Secretary
of Defense Cohen.

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:47.410 align:middle line:90%
Now, how do I know this?

00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:51.360 align:middle line:84%
Because Gordon Cooper and
I presented to a think tank

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.710 align:middle line:84%
together, and he pulled
me aside, and he says,

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:55.830 align:middle line:84%
look, the Secretary
of Defense asked

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:58.830 align:middle line:84%
me to give him all the
actionable intelligence--

00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:01.350 align:middle line:84%
every little granular
detail about that event

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:04.540 align:middle line:90%
so he could find that evidence.

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:05.590 align:middle line:90%
And so he did.

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:07.610 align:middle line:84%
And the Secretary of
Defense got back to him--

00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Cohen-- Secretary
of Defense Cohen--

00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:11.507 align:middle line:84%
said, this thing
has disappeared.

00:25:11.507 --> 00:25:12.590 align:middle line:90%
I don't have access to it.

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:14.740 align:middle line:84%
It's in a project I
have no access to--

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:16.240 align:middle line:90%
Secretary of Defense.

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:19.690 align:middle line:84%
So I said this to
the admiral, Wilson.

00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:21.040 align:middle line:90%
And he says, oh, my God.

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well-- he
says, and what can I do?

00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:25.520 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, we need you
to help lead up-- he says,

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:26.740 align:middle line:90%
I can't.

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:31.330 align:middle line:84%
And the admiral said,
what I've learned

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:34.510 align:middle line:84%
since I got this initial
information from you

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:38.050 align:middle line:84%
is that the best thing I know
about is a B2 stealth bomber.

00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And these unacknowledged Special
Access Projects have things

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:42.040 align:middle line:90%
that can do circles around it.

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:43.602 align:middle line:90%
He did like this.

00:25:43.602 --> 00:25:44.560 align:middle line:90%
He says, I'm outgunned.

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:46.540 align:middle line:90%
It's point, set, match.

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:47.770 align:middle line:90%
But that's what happened.

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:52.083 align:middle line:84%
And you multiply that
times dozens and dozens

00:25:52.083 --> 00:25:54.250 align:middle line:84%
of times that I've been in
meetings like that-- when

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:58.410 align:middle line:84%
I met years ago with
General Odom, head

00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:00.160 align:middle line:84%
of the-- director of
the National Security

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:03.100 align:middle line:84%
Agency, his right-hand guy,
he described something to me

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:04.270 align:middle line:90%
called a DDT.

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:05.900 align:middle line:84%
And everybody thinks,
oh, pesticides.

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:06.700 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:10.720 align:middle line:84%
It stands for, you set up a
decoy and distract the public,

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.010 align:middle line:90%
and then you trash it.

00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:14.700 align:middle line:84%
He says, we run DDTs all
the time on this subject.

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:15.500 align:middle line:90%
BILLY: Wow.

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:16.300 align:middle line:90%
GREER: Yeah.

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:19.600 align:middle line:84%
So almost everything out there
in the public space on the UFO

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:21.413 align:middle line:90%
subject is a DDT.

00:26:21.413 --> 00:26:23.080 align:middle line:84%
BILLY: And so with
all of this going on,

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:24.413 align:middle line:90%
what can we take away from this?

00:26:24.413 --> 00:26:26.740 align:middle line:84%
How does this negativity
that they put out there,

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:29.480 align:middle line:84%
or how did these DDTs
or this disinformation,

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:32.630 align:middle line:84%
how does it affect us, and
how can it make us better?

00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:34.610 align:middle line:90%
What can we learn from this?

00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:37.070 align:middle line:84%
GREER: Well, these operations
serve two purposes,

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:41.590 align:middle line:84%
and this is sort of the
key of counterintelligence

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:44.080 align:middle line:90%
and putting out disinformation.

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And that is, you want
to do two things,

00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:48.400 align:middle line:84%
and this is what
they're doing, that they

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.800 align:middle line:84%
want to put out enough
information that it seems

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:55.840 align:middle line:84%
plausible, and then surround
it with unbelievable amounts

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:59.530 align:middle line:84%
of false information
or a false narrative.

00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:03.340 align:middle line:10%
But, of course, when they
began to release information,

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:07.420 align:middle line:10%
like the Tic Tac, it turned
out, of course, that was--

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:09.250 align:middle line:10%
that's one of the
Lockheed Skunk Works

00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:11.160 align:middle line:10%
objects, not extraterrestrial.

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:12.535 align:middle line:10%
We know how those
are engineered,

00:27:12.535 --> 00:27:15.040 align:middle line:10%
it's based on an ET object.

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:17.020 align:middle line:10%
But that was released.

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:18.790 align:middle line:84%
And, of course,
because they said so

00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:20.860 align:middle line:84%
and they're in the
intelligence community,

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:23.290 align:middle line:90%
the media covered it.

00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:27.460 align:middle line:84%
Disclosure Project has much more
amazing dispositive evidence

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:29.290 align:middle line:84%
than that, but they
won't cover what

00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:31.960 align:middle line:84%
we're doing because
we're going to say, yes,

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:33.760 align:middle line:90%
that one is extraterrestrial.

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:36.550 align:middle line:84%
That one is from the
Lockheed Skunk Works.

00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:39.237 align:middle line:84%
And if that gets disclosed,
it's the end of oil.

00:27:39.237 --> 00:27:40.570 align:middle line:90%
It's the end of the petrodollar.

00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:41.830 align:middle line:90%
It's a lot.

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:46.120 align:middle line:84%
So they sanitize out
anyone who actually--

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.960 align:middle line:84%
frankly, if they're
going to tell the truth,

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:49.960 align:middle line:84%
they're not going to be
in the mainstream media.

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:53.290 align:middle line:84%
What really happens is that
the intelligence community

00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:56.500 align:middle line:84%
will open the doors to certain
information coming out,

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:59.290 align:middle line:84%
but then attach to
it the narrative.

00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And the narrative in
that case is, it's

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:02.980 align:middle line:90%
a national security threat--

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:08.180 align:middle line:84%
or if they're swarming our
destroyers or what have you.

00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:10.390 align:middle line:10%
And the reason for
that long-term--

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:13.060 align:middle line:10%
it's been a 70-year
defense strategy

00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:16.720 align:middle line:10%
plan that people on
my team have seen,

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:20.560 align:middle line:10%
and that is what Wernher Von
Braun said to Carol Rosin

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:24.370 align:middle line:10%
before he died, that they would
play this last card, which

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:28.780 align:middle line:10%
would be an alien threat to try
to unite the world militarily--

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:31.180 align:middle line:10%
instead of in
peace, in conflict.

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:34.900 align:middle line:84%
And now, we predicted
this in the '90s.

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:38.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're seeing it actually
unfold before our very eyes

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:39.230 align:middle line:90%
in the media.

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:42.640 align:middle line:84%
So I think these DDT
operations happen all the time.

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:47.260 align:middle line:84%
Most of the people who are
going to be giving information

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:51.400 align:middle line:84%
to the media have looking
through a glass very dimly,

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:55.272 align:middle line:84%
or are operatives who have
been on the payroll to say,

00:28:55.272 --> 00:28:56.480 align:middle line:90%
we don't know what these are.

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:58.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, you'll notice, for
example, they'll say,

00:28:58.540 --> 00:28:59.860 align:middle line:90%
we don't know what these are.

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:02.950 align:middle line:84%
They came up with
this new term, UAP.

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:04.570 align:middle line:84%
They always make
up a new acronym

00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:07.740 align:middle line:90%
that's a lie, basically.

00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:09.090 align:middle line:90%
But they do know what they are.

00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:11.500 align:middle line:90%
They know there are two types.

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And I have a letter from the
head of the Lockheed Skunk

00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:19.080 align:middle line:84%
Works that we can show,
signed by him, dated 1986.

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:22.670 align:middle line:10%
A man-- a friend of
his wrote and said,

00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:28.230 align:middle line:10%
are these UFOs ours,
manmade, or extraterrestrial?

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And Ben Rich writes
back, they're both.

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.840 align:middle line:10%
So that's been
known for decades,

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:36.120 align:middle line:10%
since the '40s and '50s.

00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:38.200 align:middle line:10%
And yet, you have these
people saying, gosh,

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:39.367 align:middle line:10%
we don't know what they are.

00:29:39.367 --> 00:29:40.770 align:middle line:84%
We need more money
to study them.

00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:41.070 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:42.870 align:middle line:84%
We've already spent
trillions studying it.

00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:45.010 align:middle line:84%
So that's all a
dog and pony show.

00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
takeaway for the public

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:50.040 align:middle line:90%
really is, be very skeptical.

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:51.840 align:middle line:10%
Be cautious.

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:54.480 align:middle line:10%
I'm trying the best
we can as an unfunded

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:58.990 align:middle line:10%
volunteer effort to
do the best we can.

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:01.320 align:middle line:84%
But over the years,
I've had over 980

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:04.260 align:middle line:84%
of these top secret
witnesses come to me.

00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:07.170 align:middle line:84%
So we have a lot of
information archived.

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:08.550 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately,
the things you're

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:11.580 align:middle line:84%
going to see pushed onto the
internet, pushed onto the tech

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:16.890 align:middle line:84%
platforms, pushed through the
media, are going to be curated

00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:19.170 align:middle line:84%
and cherry picked
to have that effect.

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:22.410 align:middle line:84%
It will be part information,
part disinformation,

00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:25.120 align:middle line:84%
and with this spin of it
always being a threat.

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:25.920 align:middle line:90%
BILLY: Right.

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:26.280 align:middle line:90%
GREER: Yeah.

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:27.420 align:middle line:90%
BILLY: Generate the fear.

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:28.830 align:middle line:90%
GREER: And that's the big plan.

00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:31.893 align:middle line:84%
That's the big picture
from standing way out.

00:30:31.893 --> 00:30:33.310 align:middle line:84%
BILLY: Makes a lot
of sense to me.

00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:37.560 align:middle line:84%
GREER: And then you just fill
in the dots as it comes out.

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:40.430 align:middle line:84%
Once you know the template,
you can get the picture.

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:41.610 align:middle line:90%
BILLY: Exactly.

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:43.020 align:middle line:90%
Amazing.

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:43.980 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Dr. Greer.

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:45.230 align:middle line:90%
GREER: Thank you.

00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:46.230 align:middle line:90%
BILLY: I'm Billy Carson.

00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:48.355 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for watching
"Disclosure" with Dr. Steven

00:30:48.355 --> 00:30:49.200 align:middle line:90%
Greer.

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:52.550 align:middle line:90%
