>>ERICH VON DANIKEN:
We have all heard

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.010 align:middle line:84%
of the myths and the
legends of our history,

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.326 align:middle line:90%
but is there another story?

00:00:13.326 --> 00:00:15.741 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:15.741 --> 00:00:23.470 align:middle line:90%


00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.670 align:middle line:10%
Mixed creatures, that's a
phenomenon, but a phenomenon

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.210 align:middle line:10%
which once was reality.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.710 align:middle line:90%
What is a mixed creature?

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.770 align:middle line:84%
Everyone at least knows
one mixed creature,

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.010 align:middle line:84%
that Sphinx before
the Great Pyramid.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.330 align:middle line:84%
This is a figure composed
of the head of a human,

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.340 align:middle line:84%
they say the head
of the pharaoh,

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.280 align:middle line:84%
and the body of a
lion, a mixture.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.400 align:middle line:84%
In mythology they tell us
well, it's symbolically.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.250 align:middle line:84%
Because the head of the pharaoh
symbolizes the intelligence

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.540 align:middle line:84%
and the lion body symbolizes
the force, the power of it.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.135 align:middle line:84%
But I'm completely of
a different opinion.

00:01:04.135 --> 00:01:08.040 align:middle line:90%


00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.740 align:middle line:84%
I know that these mixed
creatures in the past, they did

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.540 align:middle line:90%
exist.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.250 align:middle line:90%


00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.210 align:middle line:84%
In every big museum in the
East and in the Far East

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.820 align:middle line:90%
you'll find mixed creatures.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And Egypt is full
of mixed creatures.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.190 align:middle line:10%
About 450 BC there was the
Greek historian Herodotus.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.700 align:middle line:10%
He was in Egypt.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.440 align:middle line:84%
And he writes, in the
Second Book of History

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.220 align:middle line:84%
he writes, that
he was in Thebes.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.260 align:middle line:10%
Thebes is today's
Luxor on the Nile.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And the high priest
showed him 241 statues,

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.130 align:middle line:90%
one next to the other.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And the high priest
gave to every statue

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.600 align:middle line:90%
a short introduction.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And at the end the high
priest said these 241 statues

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.600 align:middle line:90%
represent 11,340 years.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.169 align:middle line:10%
At that time the gods were here.

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:12.230 align:middle line:84%
Since that time, the gods
did not return again.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.470 align:middle line:84%
And the priest clearly said
the gods from the firmament

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.580 align:middle line:90%
were here.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.074 align:middle line:84%
He's talking about
roughly 14,000 years.

00:02:20.074 --> 00:02:22.240 align:middle line:84%
Because Herodotus makes his
statement two and a half

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.590 align:middle line:90%
thousand years from now.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.820 align:middle line:84%
So to his 11,000 years we have
to add two and half thousand,

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.732 align:middle line:90%
roughly 14,000 years.

00:02:30.732 --> 00:02:35.370 align:middle line:84%
Now Herodotus also writes
about mixed creatures.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.130 align:middle line:10%
By the way, many of
the old historians,

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.100 align:middle line:10%
Diodorus Siculus writes
about mixed creatures.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.790 align:middle line:84%
Strabo writes about
mixed creatures.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.730 align:middle line:10%
Then we have an
old Egyptian writer

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.310 align:middle line:10%
and his name was Manetho.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.340 align:middle line:84%
Now Manetho's writings
practically do not

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.440 align:middle line:90%
exist anymore, only a few pages.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.900 align:middle line:84%
But 2,000 years ago,
they were existing.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.460 align:middle line:84%
Then we had the
father of the church.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.260 align:middle line:90%
His name was Eusebius.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And Eusebius took out
of Manetho's writing.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And in a full page he says
when the gods were here,

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.680 align:middle line:84%
the gods from heaven, they
created mixed creatures.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And he comes up and tells
what sort of mixed creature.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.590 align:middle line:84%
Not only the sphinx, the head of
a human and the body of a lion.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.580 align:middle line:84%
He says that they made mixed
creatures with the upper part

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.990 align:middle line:84%
of the body was human and the
lower part was a horse, which

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.640 align:middle line:90%
means the centaur.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.550 align:middle line:10%
All these things,
Eusebius quoting Manetho,

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.520 align:middle line:10%
said the gods made all this.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.140 align:middle line:10%
And of course, I have asked
myself why for my goodness

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.630 align:middle line:10%
should extraterrestrials
make mixed creatures?

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:46.900 align:middle line:90%
What's the idea?

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.780 align:middle line:90%
It makes no sense.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.430 align:middle line:90%
Oh yes, it makes sense.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Six, five, all the
engines up and running.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.070 align:middle line:84%
Three, two, one,
zero and liftoff.

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Liftoff.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.170 align:middle line:90%
Liftoff.

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.440 align:middle line:84%
>>ERICH: You know, when
an intelligent society is

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.880 align:middle line:84%
able to make space travel, they
will of course not only visit

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.080 align:middle line:90%
one planet.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.720 align:middle line:84%
There are other
planets out there.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.100 align:middle line:84%
There are planets
maybe are closer

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.170 align:middle line:90%
to the sun than the Earth.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.310 align:middle line:84%
Other planets are far
away from the sun.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.360 align:middle line:84%
That means it is
hotter or colder.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.790 align:middle line:84%
Some planets may be
bigger than the Earth.

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.660 align:middle line:84%
That means you need more
gravity to survive there,

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.180 align:middle line:90%
stronger muscles.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.870 align:middle line:90%
Other planets are small.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.290 align:middle line:84%
Like on our moon you can
jump an 8 or 10 meter jump.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.760 align:middle line:90%
So there are different planets.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.110 align:middle line:84%
Now for different planets
you need different animals,

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.250 align:middle line:90%
different creatures.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.360 align:middle line:84%
Now the extraterrestrials,
they simply saw on our planet

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.055 align:middle line:90%
for example, a crocodile.

00:04:48.055 --> 00:04:51.220 align:middle line:84%
This crocodile on the
Nile was lying there

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.600 align:middle line:90%
and it was very hot.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.750 align:middle line:84%
But the hot did not harm
the skin of the crocodile.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And they realize,
for example, a lion.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.080 align:middle line:84%
The lion was attacking
gazelle, which is power.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.630 align:middle line:84%
Now they said, why don't we
mix this heat-resisting skin

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.270 align:middle line:84%
of the one animal
with the power,

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.350 align:middle line:84%
the muscles of the other
animal for another planet?

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.430 align:middle line:90%
So they made mixed creatures.

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.190 align:middle line:90%


00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.260 align:middle line:84%
Now if you make mixed creatures,
you can only do it by genetics.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.980 align:middle line:90%


00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.110 align:middle line:84%
Now our forefathers
from thousands of years

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.230 align:middle line:84%
ago, they knew nothing
about genetics.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.200 align:middle line:84%
So if you can prove
that mixed creatures did

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.490 align:middle line:84%
exist you know exactly that
there is high genetic knowledge

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:39.450 align:middle line:90%
behind it.

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And only the gods,
the extraterrestrials

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:42.170 align:middle line:90%
had this knowledge.

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:43.586 align:middle line:84%
And of course in
the meantime, you

00:05:43.586 --> 00:05:45.461 align:middle line:84%
can prove that there
were mixed creatures.

00:05:45.461 --> 00:05:49.390 align:middle line:90%


00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:54.080 align:middle line:84%
Our so-called gods were
the first genetic engineers

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.920 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.770 align:middle line:90%


00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:02.250 align:middle line:84%
They had the capabilities to
perform genetic experiments.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.770 align:middle line:84%
They could perform
genetic mutations.

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And thus they created
these mixed creatures.

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:15.790 align:middle line:90%


00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:18.520 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
our forefathers

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.610 align:middle line:84%
were terrified by
these mixed creatures.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.940 align:middle line:84%
Which is why today we
see them represented

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:29.170 align:middle line:84%
as symbols of fear and
considered myths and fantasy.

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:35.160 align:middle line:90%


00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.930 align:middle line:84%
The so-called gods,
the extraterrestrials,

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.930 align:middle line:84%
they behaved themselves
like ethnologists would do.

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.810 align:middle line:84%
They studied a few tribes, they
learned a little something,

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:45.420 align:middle line:84%
and one day they
disappeared again.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:48.270 align:middle line:84%
When they disappeared,
some of the mixed creatures

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.220 align:middle line:90%
were still there, still alive.

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:54.150 align:middle line:84%
Now the humans were afraid
of the mixed creatures.

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.730 align:middle line:84%
They were not allowed to
kill the mixed creatures,

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:01.080 align:middle line:84%
so they waited until the mixed
creatures died out by itself.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.290 align:middle line:84%
So you ask why are there
no mixed creatures today?

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.060 align:middle line:90%
They simply died out.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:10.850 align:middle line:84%
Roughly 200 years ago, a
young Frenchman came to Egypt.

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:14.120 align:middle line:10%
His name was Auguste Mariette.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:18.230 align:middle line:10%
And exactly at that
time, another Frenchmen

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:21.740 align:middle line:10%
learned how to translate
the hieroglyphics.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.550 align:middle line:84%
So Auguste Mariette was
able to read hieroglyphics.

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:29.270 align:middle line:84%
And he read that
in these old texts

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:32.810 align:middle line:84%
they always mentioned
mixed creatures.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:36.020 align:middle line:84%
But they never found
a mixed creature.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.590 align:middle line:84%
For example, in old Egypt,
according to the old tradition,

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:43.160 align:middle line:84%
there was a sacred
bull called Apis.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And the Apis bull
was a mixed creature.

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:49.160 align:middle line:84%
He was not a normal bull
like the usual bull.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:54.110 align:middle line:84%
He was not created by
a sexual come together.

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:56.330 align:middle line:90%
He was made by the gods.

00:07:56.330 --> 00:08:00.110 align:middle line:84%
So Auguste Mariette, he knew
all this from the old writings,

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:04.100 align:middle line:84%
but he never found one
of these Apis mummies.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.220 align:middle line:84%
Because in Old Egypt,
you have to understand,

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:10.790 align:middle line:84%
they mummified
everything, every animal.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:13.910 align:middle line:84%
We normal beings, we
think the old Egyptians

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.990 align:middle line:90%
they mummified the pharaohs.

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:17.990 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:20.450 align:middle line:84%
Every living creature
was mummified.

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:24.290 align:middle line:84%
We found mummified dogs,
mummified crocodiles,

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:28.460 align:middle line:84%
mummified fishes, even mummified
scorpions, little animals.

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.500 align:middle line:90%
They mummified everything.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.530 align:middle line:10%
Why have they done so?

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:35.630 align:middle line:84%
They believe every
living creature

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:38.150 align:middle line:90%
would be reborn in the future.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:42.169 align:middle line:84%
But they could only be reborn
if the body is preserved.

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:45.670 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they
preserved everything

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:47.370 align:middle line:90%
in form of mummification.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:49.670 align:middle line:84%
Now come back to this
Auguste Mariette.

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:52.130 align:middle line:84%
He knew the old
story, and he found

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:55.520 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of mummies of all
kinds of animals in Egypt,

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.000 align:middle line:84%
but not a mixed
creature, not the Apis.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.660 align:middle line:84%
One evening, he wrote this by
himself, he was a little drunk

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.300 align:middle line:84%
and the next morning
he was out in Saqqara.

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:09.380 align:middle line:84%
Saqqara in Egypt is this place
where the step pyramid exists.

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And he simply falls over
a stone on the ground.

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:18.400 align:middle line:84%
When he's standing up and pushed
the dust away from his clothes

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.000 align:middle line:84%
and from the stone he
could read the word "Apis."

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.330 align:middle line:90%
He said, Apis?

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:24.930 align:middle line:84%
That was one of these
mixed creatures.

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:27.590 align:middle line:84%
Are there maybe
Apis creatures here?

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:29.480 align:middle line:84%
Now at that time,
Auguste Mariette was not

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.730 align:middle line:84%
working like an
archaeologist would do today,

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:33.510 align:middle line:90%
you know very careful.

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And so no, he simply
used dynamite.

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:41.570 align:middle line:84%
He made some holes in the
Egyptian ground near Saqqara.

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:45.920 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden a big hole
appeared and he fell down.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And when his people
gave him some torches,

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:52.280 align:middle line:84%
he realized he was standing
before a gigantic, really

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:57.940 align:middle line:84%
gigantic sarcophagus, absolutely
weighing about over 100 ton.

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:00.050 align:middle line:90%
The lid alone 40 ton.

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:02.630 align:middle line:90%
And he was fascinated.

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:06.890 align:middle line:84%
There must be mixed creatures,
because such gigantic thing

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:09.320 align:middle line:84%
you only make for mixed
creatures, for example,

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.490 align:middle line:90%
for the Apis bull.

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And he was looking
for the Apis bull.

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:15.230 align:middle line:84%
So they opened the
first sarcophagus.

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:17.260 align:middle line:84%
There was absolutely
nothing in there.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:18.650 align:middle line:90%
It was completely clean.

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:20.870 align:middle line:84%
The same thing with the
second and the third.

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:23.960 align:middle line:84%
But later they found
other sarcophaguses,

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.430 align:middle line:84%
because there was some
tunnels down there

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:28.970 align:middle line:90%
which were filled with bitumen.

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:30.740 align:middle line:84%
Bitumen is this
stinky mass, you know,

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:34.010 align:middle line:90%
which you use to make streets.

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:38.330 align:middle line:84%
So they put out this bitumen
from the sarcophaguses

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:40.970 align:middle line:84%
and they saw that
in the bitumen there

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:44.090 align:middle line:90%
were different broken bones.

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:48.680 align:middle line:84%
They analyzed the bones and they
realized these bones are not

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.270 align:middle line:90%
from one creature.

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:54.140 align:middle line:84%
The bones are composed
of different creatures.

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:55.940 align:middle line:90%
I said, how is this possible?

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:59.660 align:middle line:84%
The old Egyptians, they
preserved every body

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:01.820 align:middle line:84%
because without
preserving it, it

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:04.520 align:middle line:84%
could not be reborn
in the next life.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:08.810 align:middle line:84%
So it was absolutely a
sin to destroy bones.

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:13.790 align:middle line:84%
Why should somebody destroy the
bones of different creatures

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:16.220 align:middle line:84%
and then put it in a
gigantic sarcophagus

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:20.180 align:middle line:84%
and then cover the
sarcophagus with bitumen?

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.370 align:middle line:90%
Now I have a story.

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:26.120 align:middle line:84%
The sarcophaguses, the
stone came from Aswan.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:30.290 align:middle line:84%
Aswan is about 1,000
kilometers away from Saqqara.

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:34.280 align:middle line:84%
That means in practice, they had
to transport these heavy loads

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:38.000 align:middle line:84%
down with some canoes
or ships down the Nile.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.560 align:middle line:84%
And they had to go away
from the Nile four times,

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.600 align:middle line:84%
because there were
cataracts there.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.760 align:middle line:90%
Finally, they arrive at Saqqara.

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:50.900 align:middle line:84%
Some people chiseled
out the ground tunnels.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:53.390 align:middle line:84%
And then right and
left from the tunnels

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:55.220 align:middle line:90%
they have some of these niches.

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:58.460 align:middle line:84%
Now the other people, the other
group are polishing the stones

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:02.030 align:middle line:84%
and polishing the sarcophagus,
absolutely sensational.

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:05.360 align:middle line:84%
Now they put these
empty sarcophaguses down

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:08.120 align:middle line:84%
in the tunnels and
down in the niches.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.120 align:middle line:84%
Why have they done
such a gigantic work?

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:16.770 align:middle line:84%
It's an incredible labor just
for putting mixed figures

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:18.780 align:middle line:90%
bones, broken bones in it.

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.940 align:middle line:90%
It makes no sense.

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:24.690 align:middle line:10%
Soon as you look at
it from modern term,

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:26.400 align:middle line:10%
there were mixed creatures.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:30.730 align:middle line:10%
The Apis was a mixed
creature like the minotaurs

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:32.550 align:middle line:10%
or the centaur, et cetera.

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:34.680 align:middle line:84%
The mixed creatures
were made by the gods.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.510 align:middle line:84%
The gods were the
extraterrestrials.

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:38.760 align:middle line:84%
They had the
genetical knowledge.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:42.270 align:middle line:84%
Now the gods ordered
to the humans,

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:45.000 align:middle line:84%
you are not allowed
to chase, to kill

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.490 align:middle line:84%
some of these mixed
creatures, because they

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:49.360 align:middle line:90%
want to observe them.

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.270 align:middle line:90%
The gods disappeared one day.

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.220 align:middle line:84%
The mixed creatures
were still there.

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:55.890 align:middle line:84%
Now the humans were still
afraid of the mixed creatures.

00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:58.110 align:middle line:84%
They waited until
the mixed creatures

00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:00.720 align:middle line:90%
died in a natural way.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.190 align:middle line:90%
Now they were dead.

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And now they made
gigantic sarcophaguses,

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:08.160 align:middle line:84%
the stones from Aswan,
underground tunnels.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.940 align:middle line:84%
They broke the bones
of the mixed creatures.

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:15.660 align:middle line:84%
They put it into these gigantic
sarcophaguses, covered it

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:17.640 align:middle line:90%
with bitumen, liquid bitumen.

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:20.160 align:middle line:84%
Bitumen, when it's hot,
it stinks terribly.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.210 align:middle line:90%
You can use it.

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:23.730 align:middle line:90%
And put a lid of 40 tons of it.

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:28.020 align:middle line:84%
It was not the reborn,
it was the contrary.

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:32.880 align:middle line:84%
These monsters should
never be reborn again.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.220 align:middle line:84%
That's why the
gigantic sarcophagus.

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:39.570 align:middle line:84%
So today, if we
simply take one bone,

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:42.780 align:middle line:84%
our geneticists are so
fantastic in their knowledge

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:46.500 align:middle line:84%
they could very easily
prove that this is not

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:49.380 align:middle line:90%
the normal DNA of a creature.

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:52.290 align:middle line:84%
It was easy to prove
that it is the product

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:53.670 align:middle line:90%
of a genetical design.

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:55.150 align:middle line:90%
It's mixed creatures.

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:58.890 align:middle line:84%
The problem is just no
geneticist will do the job.

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:02.280 align:middle line:84%
I know one of the geneticist who
said Eric, I will do the job.

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.874 align:middle line:84%
But once, when he come
to the result, here

00:14:04.874 --> 00:14:06.540 align:middle line:84%
we have the product
of a mixed creature,

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:08.460 align:middle line:90%
he could never go to public.

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:09.480 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.070 align:middle line:90%
The time is not ripe.

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:13.920 align:middle line:84%
His colleagues would
block him, he said.

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:15.150 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing here?

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:16.470 align:middle line:90%
This is impossible in our time.

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:18.011 align:middle line:84%
You cannot come with
mixed creatures.

00:14:18.011 --> 00:14:19.680 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you have
mixed creatures,

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.840 align:middle line:84%
you prove extraterrestrials,
because only

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:25.630 align:middle line:84%
the extraterrestrials had
the knowledge in genetics.

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:27.766 align:middle line:90%
And so the story ends.

00:14:27.766 --> 00:14:30.206 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:30.206 --> 00:14:43.900 align:middle line:90%


00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:48.970 align:middle line:84%
Soon as we prove that there were
mixed creatures in antiquity,

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:52.750 align:middle line:84%
then we know that mixed
creatures can never happen

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:55.630 align:middle line:90%
by natural sexual intercourse.

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:58.810 align:middle line:84%
If, for example, a human would
be so primitive and had sex,

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:02.180 align:middle line:84%
let's say, with an ape, there
would never be a result.

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:04.390 align:middle line:84%
Because the chromosomes
of the humans

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:07.490 align:middle line:84%
and the chromosomes of the
ape are completely different.

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:09.580 align:middle line:84%
So there is no mixed
creature coming out

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:11.210 align:middle line:90%
of the womb of a female ape.

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:12.010 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing.

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:15.130 align:middle line:84%
So soon as you prove
mixed creatures,

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:20.470 align:middle line:84%
you know for sure there must
be genetical design behind it.

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:23.020 align:middle line:90%
Who had the genetical design?

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:24.550 align:middle line:90%
Our Egyptian forefathers?

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:25.780 align:middle line:90%
Forget it.

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:27.370 align:middle line:90%
Only the extraterrestrials.

00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:29.730 align:middle line:84%
And then comes together
with the old writings.

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:33.750 align:middle line:84%
Manetho, Eusebius, they
tell us the god made it.

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And then comes the question,
why should the gods

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.660 align:middle line:90%
have made mixed creatures?

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:40.960 align:middle line:84%
Because they use mixed
creatures on different planets

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.190 align:middle line:90%
with different conditions.

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:44.550 align:middle line:90%
It all makes perfect sense.

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:46.510 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:56.710 align:middle line:90%


00:15:56.710 --> 00:16:00.710 align:middle line:84%
In old Sumer there
were tablets found.

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:05.120 align:middle line:84%
And on these tablets you see
beings which in archeology they

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:09.720 align:middle line:84%
called winged gods
or winged geniuses.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.030 align:middle line:90%
And they are working.

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:12.680 align:middle line:84%
They are working in
what archeologists

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:16.640 align:middle line:84%
say it's the living tree
or the tree of life.

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.950 align:middle line:84%
If we look with
today's eyes, we see

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:22.010 align:middle line:84%
it has nothing to do with
the tree, tree of life.

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:24.080 align:middle line:90%
It's simply DNA.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:29.550 align:middle line:84%
Because you're always in DNA you
have four bases to connect DNA.

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:30.950 align:middle line:90%
And you see the four bases.

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:34.270 align:middle line:84%
They are changing out
one DNA base with another

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:35.900 align:middle line:90%
and they create mixtures.

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And there are proofs which
we can definitely prove.

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:42.560 align:middle line:84%
For example, in the
British Museum is a stone,

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:45.950 align:middle line:84%
a black stone called
Salmanazar II.

00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:48.500 align:middle line:84%
Salmanazar II was
a Sumerian king.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:52.850 align:middle line:84%
And there you see, no
doubt, you see animals

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:55.100 align:middle line:90%
which are hold on chains.

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And behind them
are the guardians.

00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And the guardians
hold these chains.

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:00.770 align:middle line:90%
So these animals were alive.

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:04.099 align:middle line:84%
But you see it on the
picture it's mixed creatures.

00:17:04.099 --> 00:17:06.430 align:middle line:84%
It's not an animal
which does exist.

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And there is a text, a
Sumarian cuneiform text down.

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And it says some mixed creatures
were captured and brought

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:15.380 align:middle line:90%
to the king.

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:17.846 align:middle line:84%
So you can prove
the mixed creatures.

00:17:17.846 --> 00:17:21.190 align:middle line:90%


00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:23.900 align:middle line:10%
This is important,
because it provides

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:26.790 align:middle line:10%
a certain theoretical
justification

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:28.460 align:middle line:10%
to much of the larger story.

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:36.378 align:middle line:90%


00:17:36.378 --> 00:17:40.770 align:middle line:84%
When Herodotus was up there
in Egypt around 450 BC,

00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:44.410 align:middle line:84%
he was also in Thebes,
which is today's Luxor.

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:50.330 align:middle line:90%


00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And there are two
temples, the Luxor Temple

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:55.250 align:middle line:90%
and the Karnak Temple.

00:17:55.250 --> 00:18:00.230 align:middle line:84%
Between them is a difference
of 3.8 kilometers.

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:05.410 align:middle line:84%
And Herodotus tells us they
walked this whole lane.

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:11.110 align:middle line:84%
Right and left there will
always mixed creatures,

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:14.750 align:middle line:90%
mixed creatures in stone.

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:15.980 align:middle line:90%
Must be hundreds of them.

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:27.590 align:middle line:90%


00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:32.870 align:middle line:84%
Today we only have a few left
of this avenida, this fantastic

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:36.050 align:middle line:84%
street between the two
temples flanked right

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:37.782 align:middle line:90%
and left with mixed creatures.

00:18:37.782 --> 00:18:40.440 align:middle line:90%


00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:43.670 align:middle line:84%
Today, everything is
possible by genetics.

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:46.910 align:middle line:84%
Every impossibility
is possible today.

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:49.190 align:middle line:84%
You know, some two
or three years ago

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:53.720 align:middle line:84%
to make or to create a mixed
creature would be something

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.430 align:middle line:90%
very, very complicated.

00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:57.030 align:middle line:90%
And it is not allowed.

00:18:57.030 --> 00:19:00.200 align:middle line:84%
It is forbidden because
it's morally and ethically

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.760 align:middle line:84%
not allowed to create
mixed creatures.

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:07.100 align:middle line:84%
But today, every geneticist
knows how you can do it.

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:15.460 align:middle line:90%


00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:17.830 align:middle line:84%
If somebody would
be perverse enough

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:20.740 align:middle line:84%
to create the mixed creatures,
no problems to do it.

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:23.695 align:middle line:84%
But it is not allowed in
none of the states by law,

00:19:23.695 --> 00:19:24.730 align:middle line:90%
so they cannot do it.

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:37.070 align:middle line:90%


00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:38.810 align:middle line:90%
