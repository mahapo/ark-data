00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.970 align:middle line:84%
>> We have all heard of
the myths and legends

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.460 align:middle line:84%
of our history, but is
there another story?

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.862 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:15.862 --> 00:00:29.980 align:middle line:90%


00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.140 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, we had
several visits of the ETs.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.980 align:middle line:10%
The first visit is
an unknown time--

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.250 align:middle line:10%
might be one
million of years ago

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.240 align:middle line:10%
or two millions of
years in the past.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.980 align:middle line:90%
Really, nobody knows.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.770 align:middle line:84%
But then again, in
prehistoric time,

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.910 align:middle line:84%
which means roughly
6,000 to 7,000 BC,

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.250 align:middle line:84%
we have been visited
again, because we

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.070 align:middle line:84%
find traces of these
visitors, which

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.560 align:middle line:90%
we can date back to that time.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And another, a third visit,
was roughly in Biblical times--

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.930 align:middle line:84%
that means 2,500 BC,
something like this.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.010 align:middle line:84%
2000 BC-- Biblical time
and Egyptian time, and so.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.060 align:middle line:84%
So we have been
visited at least three

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.340 align:middle line:90%
time, if not even four times.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.798 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:18.798 --> 00:01:35.600 align:middle line:90%


00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.250 align:middle line:84%
In Egypt, we have a
very, very old culture.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.910 align:middle line:90%
Egypt starts roughly 3,000 BC.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, in ancient Egypt,
there was a historian.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.750 align:middle line:10%
His name was
Manetho, and Manetho

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.350 align:middle line:10%
gives a list of the
earliest gods, which

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.360 align:middle line:10%
descended from the sky.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.940 align:middle line:10%
And he even gives
dating, and these datings

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.040 align:middle line:10%
go back at least 4,000
BC, if not earlier.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.840 align:middle line:84%
And you find traces
of these gods.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.450 align:middle line:84%
For example, on the Nile is a
place, a temple called Abydos.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, we know Abydos was
constructed by the pharaoh

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.870 align:middle line:90%
with the name of Seti--

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.630 align:middle line:84%
Seti the First, which
was roughly 1,300 BC.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.390 align:middle line:10%
But the temple of Seti is
constructed on an older temple,

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.370 align:middle line:10%
and the technology
of the older temple

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.000 align:middle line:10%
is much more-- at once
it's much more fantastic

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.570 align:middle line:10%
than the later of Seti.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:39.360 align:middle line:90%


00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.650 align:middle line:90%
You see, normally, humans learn.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.710 align:middle line:84%
They learn softly
how to move stones--

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.210 align:middle line:84%
small stones, larger stones,
how to cut stones, et cetera.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:54.310 align:middle line:84%
So the evolution of technology
starts with small blocks.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.150 align:middle line:84%
Later in evolution, you
learn how to move big blocks.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the temple
of Seti the First,

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.100 align:middle line:84%
you clearly can prove
it's the opposite.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.980 align:middle line:84%
The highest technology with
the biggest blocks of all

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.730 align:middle line:84%
are the lowest
one in the ground.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:22.390 align:middle line:90%


00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.480 align:middle line:84%
And later on, Sethos,
1300 BC, he constructed

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.080 align:middle line:84%
with small stones his temple
on the already existing

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.470 align:middle line:84%
gigantic stones from
prehistoric time.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.880 align:middle line:90%


00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.510 align:middle line:84%
There are more examples
of this worldwide.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.850 align:middle line:84%
For example, in
South America, we

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.070 align:middle line:84%
have a place called
Machu Picchu.

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.530 align:middle line:90%
Everyone knows Machu Picchu.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.150 align:middle line:84%
Machu Picchu is a
gigantic tourist place.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.620 align:middle line:10%
And Machu Picchu is called
in archeology the lost city

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.370 align:middle line:10%
of the Incas or the
secret city of the Incas.

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And we know for sure when the
Spanish conquerors arrived

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.970 align:middle line:84%
there, the Incas went
back to Manchu Picchu,

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.700 align:middle line:84%
because the Spaniards
could not find the city.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.590 align:middle line:84%
It was hidden somewhere
in the jungle.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.320 align:middle line:84%
But when you see Manchu
Picchu, again, you

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.480 align:middle line:90%
can differentiate two cultures.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.850 align:middle line:84%
There is a prehistoric
culture, which

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.350 align:middle line:84%
is much bigger, more
gigantic than the later ones

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:23.460 align:middle line:90%
of the Inca.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.200 align:middle line:90%
We know how the Inca work.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.560 align:middle line:84%
We know their stones,
how they cut it, exactly.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.490 align:middle line:84%
But the older civilization
is the most fantastic one,

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.210 align:middle line:84%
and we have no dates
who made this one.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.740 align:middle line:84%
There are more examples
in this direction.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.110 align:middle line:90%
For example, Cusco.

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.010 align:middle line:84%
Cusco is a city in Peru, and
Cusco is known to tourists,

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.520 align:middle line:84%
and all the tourists are
shown the wall of Cusco.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.470 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
wall of Saksaywaman.

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:51.510 align:middle line:90%
It's an Inca wall.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.940 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:02.310 align:middle line:90%


00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.400 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as you turn
your back to the Inca wall,

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.170 align:middle line:84%
and you just move a few hundred
meters, you scrape into rocks.

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:14.490 align:middle line:84%
And you see all these rocks are
cut artificially, absolutely

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:15.540 align:middle line:90%
precise.

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.010 align:middle line:84%
You stand before
gigantic blocks,

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.370 align:middle line:90%
which are standing upside down.

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.380 align:middle line:84%
For example, you
have staircases;

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.410 align:middle line:84%
stairs and the block
is on the head.

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.080 align:middle line:84%
So the staircases are coming
down from the ceiling.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.890 align:middle line:90%


00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:33.870 align:middle line:90%
It was a technology--

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.580 align:middle line:84%
prehistoric technology, which
definitely came from the gods.

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.470 align:middle line:90%
How can we prove this?

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.930 align:middle line:84%
Soon as you go back
in prehistoric time,

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.480 align:middle line:84%
the technology of our
forefathers was more primitive.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.460 align:middle line:84%
They were not able to move
the blocks, to cut the blocks,

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.100 align:middle line:84%
to polish the blocks,
to transport the blocks,

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.520 align:middle line:84%
so there must have been
a higher technology

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.170 align:middle line:84%
before our humans began
with their technology,

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:00.870 align:middle line:84%
and this you can
prove by pictures.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.720 align:middle line:90%


00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.110 align:middle line:84%
You see, in the
highlands of Bolivia

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.240 align:middle line:84%
and in the highlands
of Peru, we definitely

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.570 align:middle line:84%
show blocks which have
a weight of 800 tons.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.420 align:middle line:84%
There is no way to
transport such a block,

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.100 align:middle line:84%
not even in the
highlands, because you

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.870 align:middle line:90%
are 4,000 meters high.

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.050 align:middle line:84%
There is no wood
for wooden rollers.

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.270 align:middle line:84%
You cannot do it in
any possible way.

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.400 align:middle line:84%
There were no ropes, but
the blocks definitely

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.850 align:middle line:90%
were transported.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:33.020 align:middle line:90%
Imagine-- 800 tons!

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.980 align:middle line:90%
So with what technology?

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:38.990 align:middle line:84%
We today, we would not
move 800 tons in one block.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:48.090 align:middle line:90%


00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:51.490 align:middle line:84%
When in the Bible there were
so many descriptions and so

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:52.290 align:middle line:90%
many visits--

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Moses is one
of the eyewitnesses.

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:59.630 align:middle line:10%
He was talking
together with his God,

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:01.560 align:middle line:10%
and this God was an
extraterrestrial,

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.410 align:middle line:10%
because he was not human.

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:06.090 align:middle line:84%
You see, in the
whole Bible, Moses

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:10.380 align:middle line:84%
asks his God different times
if he could see his face.

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:14.070 align:middle line:84%
Moses wants to see the face of
the Lord, and the Lord said,

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:16.020 align:middle line:90%
you can never see my face.

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.750 align:middle line:84%
Those humans who see
my face will die.

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:22.694 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:22.694 --> 00:07:33.060 align:middle line:90%


00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:35.850 align:middle line:84%
The same thing you have in
the "Epic of Gilgamesh."

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:38.160 align:middle line:84%
Gilgamesh is from
the Sumerian part.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.670 align:middle line:84%
There again,
Gilgamesh asks to see

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:44.730 align:middle line:84%
the face of God who
descended from the sky,

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:46.140 align:middle line:90%
and the same answer--

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:48.720 align:middle line:84%
humans who see the
face of God will

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.680 align:middle line:84%
die, because they have
different bacteria,

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.680 align:middle line:84%
they have different
viruses than we.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.940 align:middle line:84%
Soon as you shake hands--
and they look different.

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:58.470 align:middle line:90%
If you touch them, you die.

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:02.410 align:middle line:90%


00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:03.730 align:middle line:90%
It makes no sense.

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:07.190 align:middle line:84%
Then we have to find
a definition of God.

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:10.100 align:middle line:84%
Personally, I'm a
deep believer in God.

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:11.840 align:middle line:90%
I never lost my God.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.870 align:middle line:84%
I still pray every
evening to God.

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:17.450 align:middle line:90%
But for me, God is the universe.

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:19.970 align:middle line:84%
God is the waves
of the universe.

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:21.740 align:middle line:90%
God is everything.

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:26.180 align:middle line:84%
I cannot imagine a God which
uses a vehicle to move around

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:31.140 align:middle line:84%
from point A to point B. God
is all over at the same time,

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:34.039 align:middle line:90%
and my God is out of time.

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:36.020 align:middle line:84%
He does not need
to make experiences

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:39.200 align:middle line:84%
and then he has to wait what
the result of the experience is.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.480 align:middle line:90%
He knows the answer at once.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:44.179 align:middle line:84%
Of course, God
makes no mistakes.

00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:46.940 align:middle line:10%
In the Bible, for example,
in the first Book of Moses,

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:50.300 align:middle line:10%
after the creation
of Adam and Eve,

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.990 align:middle line:10%
God said, "and God
saw it was good."

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:56.750 align:middle line:84%
Later on, it was
not good anymore,

00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:00.740 align:middle line:84%
and he decided to destroy whole
humanity by the great flood.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:04.710 align:middle line:84%
So God is not a being
who makes mistakes.

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And these extraterrestrials,
they made mistakes.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.060 align:middle line:84%
God is not a being who
needs a vehicle with fire,

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:13.560 align:middle line:90%
smoke, trembling loud noises.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.220 align:middle line:84%
But the God of the
Bible, he used a vehicle.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.710 align:middle line:84%
He moved around with
smoke, fire, trembling,

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:22.070 align:middle line:84%
loud noises, et cetera,
described many times by Moses,

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:26.030 align:middle line:84%
but especially we had that
before by the prophet Ezekiel.

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:31.250 align:middle line:84%
He describes the wheels,
the wings, the legs,

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:34.660 align:middle line:84%
even the noise which the vehicle
makes when he comes down.

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:37.910 align:middle line:84%
He even describes the
sand who blows up.

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:40.790 align:middle line:84%
That means it was a
practical vehicle.

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:45.320 align:middle line:84%
But God-- the real, omnipotent
God, the spirit of the universe

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:48.980 align:middle line:84%
does not need these things who
makes noise, sand is blown up,

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:50.920 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.980 align:middle line:84%
Why did these
extraterrestrials arrive here?

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.770 align:middle line:90%
It's a long, long, long story.

00:09:56.770 --> 00:10:01.510 align:middle line:84%
I think the main reason was
to spread out intelligence.

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:06.130 align:middle line:84%
You see, somewhere in the
universe, it had to start.

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:10.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, we say somewhere the
first intelligent form of life

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:11.530 align:middle line:90%
started.

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:12.960 align:middle line:90%
Now we ask, how?

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.590 align:middle line:90%
How did it start there?

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:16.580 align:middle line:90%
We have no answer.

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:19.960 align:middle line:84%
Just take a compass
and make a circle--

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.290 align:middle line:90%
a perfect circle.

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:23.920 align:middle line:84%
And then I give the circle
to you, to the audience,

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:27.460 align:middle line:84%
and I ask you, where
did the circle start?

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.620 align:middle line:84%
Your logic says,
well, Mr. von Daniken,

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:32.020 align:middle line:84%
must have a starting
point of the circle,

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:33.760 align:middle line:84%
but you cannot
answer the question,

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.970 align:middle line:84%
because the circle
itself is closed.

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:42.280 align:middle line:84%
So we have no answer for where
did it start and when in time.

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:46.960 align:middle line:84%
We just know somewhere
it must have started.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.240 align:middle line:84%
The first intelligent
form of life

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:54.000 align:middle line:84%
had an interest to spread
out their own form of life

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.620 align:middle line:84%
in a certain part
of the Milky Way.

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:59.800 align:middle line:84%
By doing this, you do
not need space ships,

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.210 align:middle line:90%
not in the beginning.

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:04.750 align:middle line:84%
You simply infect a
section of the Milky Way

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:06.520 align:middle line:90%
with your own form of life.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:12.270 align:middle line:90%


00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:16.380 align:middle line:84%
Our body contains billions and
trillions and trillions of DNA.

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:19.380 align:middle line:84%
Just shake your hand, and a
few of the skin goes away,

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:21.280 align:middle line:90%
and in the skin you have DNA.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:26.530 align:middle line:84%
So you infect a section of
your Milky Way with DNA.

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:31.120 align:middle line:84%
And you know, of course,
that this DNA is--

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.840 align:middle line:84%
say that the source
of life, it will

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.960 align:middle line:84%
fall into the suns
because of the gravity.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:40.590 align:middle line:84%
It will fall into big
planets, but part of it

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:43.070 align:middle line:84%
will fall, because
of the gravity,

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:46.740 align:middle line:84%
to planets which are
similar than the one who

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:47.690 align:middle line:90%
started all this.

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:51.450 align:middle line:90%


00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:53.940 align:middle line:84%
We on Earth, we always
believed that the Earth

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:56.080 align:middle line:90%
has a unique situation.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.610 align:middle line:90%
We are unique in the universe.

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:00.070 align:middle line:84%
Our planet Earth is not
too close to the sun,

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:01.010 align:middle line:90%
so it's not too hot.

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:02.270 align:middle line:90%
It's not too far away.

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:03.210 align:middle line:90%
It's not too cold.

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:04.390 align:middle line:90%
We have water.

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.840 align:middle line:84%
So the situation of
our planet is unique.

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:12.310 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime, we
learned that this is wrong.

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:14.410 align:middle line:84%
At least at the moment
I'm talking here,

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:21.320 align:middle line:84%
we've found more than 4,000
so-called exoplanets, planets

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:25.230 align:middle line:84%
out of our solar system, and a
percentage of it is Earth-like.

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:28.612 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:28.612 --> 00:12:53.980 align:middle line:90%


00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:57.990 align:middle line:10%
A few months ago, NASA
said, in the meantime,

00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:01.220 align:middle line:10%
we have to calculate
only in our Milky Way--

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:04.180 align:middle line:10%
not in the whole universe,
only in our Milky Way--

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:09.380 align:middle line:10%
with about 4.5 billion
of Earth-like planets.

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:12.770 align:middle line:90%
So they spread out their DNA.

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:15.900 align:middle line:84%
Part of it will land
on a similar planet

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:19.195 align:middle line:84%
than the one who started with
it, and now evolution starts.

00:13:19.195 --> 00:13:22.436 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:22.436 --> 00:14:25.550 align:middle line:90%


00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:28.460 align:middle line:84%
Evolution did not
start on this planet.

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:32.370 align:middle line:84%
When I was a student, I
learned in Switzerland

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:35.090 align:middle line:90%
that it all started on Earth.

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:37.880 align:middle line:84%
The atoms came together
and formed molecules,

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.230 align:middle line:84%
and the molecules formed
together bigger molecules,

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:41.630 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:44.830 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime, modern
science says, no.

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:47.980 align:middle line:84%
The starting point
came from outside.

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:51.890 align:middle line:84%
Evolution, yes, on this planet,
but the information of life

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:53.930 align:middle line:90%
has came from outside.

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:58.500 align:middle line:84%
And this, again, is mentioned
in many of the old holy books,

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.940 align:middle line:90%
including our Bible.

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:05.420 align:middle line:84%
And the gods created humans
according to their own image.

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.670 align:middle line:90%
I say the gods--

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:10.850 align:middle line:84%
every critic will say in
the Bible is only one god,

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:13.280 align:middle line:84%
and God made humans
after his own image.

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:14.510 align:middle line:90%
It's not true.

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:17.300 align:middle line:84%
Soon as you read
Hebrew, you know

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:21.140 align:middle line:84%
that the word in old
Hebrew for God is Elohim.

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:22.940 align:middle line:90%
Now, Elohim is a plural.

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:25.250 align:middle line:84%
It does not exist
in the singular.

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:27.740 align:middle line:84%
The correct translations
of the "and the gods

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:30.005 align:middle line:84%
created humans according
their own image--"

00:15:30.005 --> 00:15:32.990 align:middle line:84%
as soon as you see
this way, you realize

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:35.750 align:middle line:90%
we are the offspring of them.

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:39.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, I have been asked why have
these extraterrestrials arrived

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:40.490 align:middle line:90%
here?

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:45.050 align:middle line:84%
They knew, of course,
exactly on which planets

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:47.360 align:middle line:90%
their seed was growing.

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.820 align:middle line:84%
They came here not
by coincidence.

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.420 align:middle line:90%
They have their astronomy.

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:54.080 align:middle line:84%
They know there are solar
systems which planets are

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:56.120 align:middle line:90%
similar than our own planet.

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.680 align:middle line:90%
It was not coincidence.

00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.930 align:middle line:90%
You see, then they came here.

00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:05.300 align:middle line:84%
They realized, as expected,
there was many forms of life,

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:08.390 align:middle line:84%
and among them was the most
advanced form of life--

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:09.450 align:middle line:90%
our forefather.

00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:13.940 align:middle line:84%
They simply took one copy, one
exemplary of it and one cell--

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:14.860 align:middle line:90%
that's enough.

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:20.420 align:middle line:84%
You change the DNA in the
cell, then this changed DNA,

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:23.840 align:middle line:84%
you put into a liquid of
[? nutrition. ?] The cell will

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.490 align:middle line:90%
multiply, will grow.

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:28.790 align:middle line:84%
You put this in the womb of
a female of the same species.

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:31.160 align:middle line:84%
The female will give
birth to a child.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.430 align:middle line:84%
The child has, of course,
the evolution of the family.

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:37.590 align:middle line:84%
So all the skeleton,
all this is perfect.

00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:39.080 align:middle line:90%
We belong to the family.

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.750 align:middle line:84%
But because of this
artificial mutation,

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:45.200 align:middle line:84%
this child has some qualities
which the rest of the family

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.970 align:middle line:90%
tree has none.

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:49.310 align:middle line:10%
Soon as you want to have
a new population out

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:52.160 align:middle line:10%
of the same tree, you
need at least two--

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.430 align:middle line:10%
female and male,
and then you'll land

00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:56.750 align:middle line:10%
in the story of Adam and Eve.

00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:59.240 align:middle line:84%
The gods created humans
according their own image.

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.400 align:middle line:90%


00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.750 align:middle line:90%
The proof is in us.

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:08.569 align:middle line:84%
We are composed of
trillions of DNA,

00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:10.839 align:middle line:90%
and that the proof is in us.

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:15.250 align:middle line:84%
Our genetics-- we'll find out
sooner or later that we humans,

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:19.210 align:middle line:84%
we are not only the
product of evolution.

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:25.810 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere, at sometime, somebody
made an artificial mutation.

00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:27.260 align:middle line:90%
So the proof is in us.

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.880 align:middle line:84%
You have ruins, temples,
gigantic blocks which

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.250 align:middle line:84%
the humans at their
time-- prehistoric time--

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:36.130 align:middle line:84%
could not have moved
and chiseled, et cetera.

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:37.120 align:middle line:90%
That's one thing.

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:40.990 align:middle line:84%
You have the holy writings,
and our writings clearly

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:43.180 align:middle line:84%
speak a language of
the extraterrestrials,

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:45.880 align:middle line:84%
because these extraterrestrials
were teachers.

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:49.040 align:middle line:84%
For example, they teach them
in astronomy, in mathematics.

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:50.860 align:middle line:90%
So this is not natural.

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:52.360 align:middle line:90%
Somebody was a teacher.

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And then we are the
offspring of them.

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.400 align:middle line:90%
We have the same feeling.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.720 align:middle line:90%
We have the same genes.

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.430 align:middle line:90%
It's in us.

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:03.490 align:middle line:84%
Critics often say to me,
but Erich von Daniken,

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:07.210 align:middle line:84%
you say these extraterrestrials,
they look similar to us.

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:09.550 align:middle line:84%
You say they even
think similar to us.

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:10.930 align:middle line:90%
This is ridiculous.

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:15.010 align:middle line:84%
Billions of different forms of
life exist, and not like us.

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:16.780 align:middle line:90%
The question is wrong.

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:21.070 align:middle line:84%
The extraterrestrials are not
by coincidence similar to us,

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:24.910 align:middle line:84%
but we are similar to them
because we are the product

00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:27.620 align:middle line:90%
of it, which is not the same.

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:31.070 align:middle line:84%
That's why I was never afraid
of the extraterrestrials who

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:32.480 align:middle line:90%
return in these days.

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:36.890 align:middle line:90%


00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:43.040 align:middle line:84%
Puma Punku lies in today's
Bolivia, 4,000 meters high.

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:46.490 align:middle line:84%
And there we find the
remains of some buildings

00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:50.750 align:middle line:84%
which nobody can understand,
because they were gigantic--

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:52.440 align:middle line:90%
prehistoric time.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it was
something like a base camp

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.970 align:middle line:84%
which the extraterrestrials
made in their own protection

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:02.390 align:middle line:84%
for their machinery, for
their technologies, et cetera.

00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:05.771 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:05.771 --> 00:19:14.470 align:middle line:90%


00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:19.070 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion it was humans
who transported the blocks.

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:22.720 align:middle line:84%
But the knowledge behind it,
the planning, the engineering

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:26.680 align:middle line:84%
planning comes from the ETs,
because the humans were not

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:29.860 align:middle line:84%
able for this
engineering and planning.

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:32.180 align:middle line:84%
So we could prove
this, and it is all

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:34.210 align:middle line:90%
orientated astronomically.

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:37.660 align:middle line:84%
The world is full with
temples of pyramids,

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:41.500 align:middle line:84%
and they are all
orientated astronomically.

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:43.990 align:middle line:84%
We were talking in
an earlier series

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:49.750 align:middle line:84%
about this strange
geometrical grid in Greece.

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:52.660 align:middle line:90%
Now, every old Greek city--

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:56.320 align:middle line:84%
and I mean old, dating
from prehistoric time--

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:59.350 align:middle line:84%
all of them are [INAUDIBLE]
or Pythagoras or Plato.

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:02.800 align:middle line:90%
It means more than 500 BC.

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:05.350 align:middle line:84%
Every of these old places
are linked together

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:08.950 align:middle line:84%
in the geometrical way,
always in the same distance

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:10.510 align:middle line:90%
and in the same angles.

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:13.090 align:middle line:84%
You can definitely
prove this today.

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:16.330 align:middle line:84%
We have the possibility
to measure these things,

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:19.250 align:middle line:84%
to measure the exact
angles and the distances.

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:23.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, it definitely does not
date from prehistoric people.

00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:25.930 align:middle line:84%
They had no idea
of high geometry,

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:28.610 align:middle line:84%
of Pythagorean triangle
and of all these things,

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:32.920 align:middle line:84%
so we have to prove in
nature we can find it.

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:37.840 align:middle line:84%
Again, in French Brittany,
10,000 of big stones

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:43.180 align:middle line:84%
called menhirs standing in line,
but not in line by coincidence.

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:47.470 align:middle line:84%
Again, these line form
Pythagorean triangle.

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:49.090 align:middle line:90%
Always the same distance--

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:53.500 align:middle line:84%
2,860 meters in one line,
or exactly the half of it.

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:56.560 align:middle line:84%
All these things
are not coincidence,

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:59.240 align:middle line:84%
and they all come
from prehistoric time.

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:03.610 align:middle line:84%
So if it was not our prehistoric
forefathers, who else?

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:06.060 align:middle line:90%
Who had the knowledge?

00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:09.240 align:middle line:84%
The same thing you find in
Australia, in the Kimberley

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:11.620 align:middle line:90%
ranges made by the Aborigines.

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:15.370 align:middle line:84%
They all represent that their
gods, the descending gods,

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:16.670 align:middle line:90%
in a similar way--

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:21.190 align:middle line:84%
always with helmets or rays
coming out of their helmets.

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:24.592 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:24.592 --> 00:21:39.200 align:middle line:90%


00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:42.650 align:middle line:84%
This phenomenon is worldwide,
and you can easy prove it.

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:45.020 align:middle line:84%
Here in the United
States in Arizona,

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:47.300 align:middle line:84%
we had the tribe
of the Hopi Indian.

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:50.510 align:middle line:84%
But before the Hopi Indian
made their Kachina dolls,

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:55.040 align:middle line:84%
they made cave paintings
and scratches on the wall.

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.170 align:middle line:10%
There are thousands of
them, and many of them

00:21:57.170 --> 00:22:00.800 align:middle line:10%
show, again, the gods
with helmets, halos.

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:04.100 align:middle line:84%
Some of these gods are
called the star blowers.

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:07.580 align:middle line:84%
They knew that these beings
were coming down from the stars.

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:09.920 align:middle line:84%
So you find this
in every continent.

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:12.980 align:middle line:84%
Some 10,000 years ago,
our prehistoric ancestors

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:15.530 align:middle line:90%
had no contact together.

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:17.480 align:middle line:10%
No one from the Sahara--

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:20.440 align:middle line:10%
today's Sahara Desert,
today's Algeria--

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:23.990 align:middle line:10%
there is a gigantic drawing
six meters high of one

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:26.100 align:middle line:10%
of these gods, and
if you look at it,

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:28.030 align:middle line:10%
it looks really
like an astronaut

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:30.420 align:middle line:10%
in a complicated suit in there.

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:33.080 align:middle line:10%
He's covered
completely his body,

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:36.980 align:middle line:10%
with his suit protecting against
our air and our bacteria.

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:40.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, no one in prehistoric
time from the Sahara

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:44.982 align:middle line:84%
went to Australia, or from
Peru Nazca went to Valcamonica,

00:22:44.982 --> 00:22:46.190 align:middle line:90%
at the border of Switzerland.

00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:50.510 align:middle line:84%
So they all had the same
idea, because they all

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:53.030 align:middle line:90%
saw the same thing--

00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:56.360 align:middle line:84%
the big beings coming
down there with helmets,

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:59.940 align:middle line:84%
halos, rings around their
head, around their body.

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:02.690 align:middle line:84%
Now in Japan-- and
Japan is far away--

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:08.090 align:middle line:84%
they made in prehistoric times
figures they call the dogus.

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:11.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can put the dogus
together with the Kachinas,

00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:12.500 align:middle line:90%
but they had no contact.

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:18.940 align:middle line:90%


00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:21.020 align:middle line:84%
You've found them
in South America

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:24.040 align:middle line:84%
or in Central America, for
example, in Villahermosa.

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:27.130 align:middle line:84%
Villahermosa is in
Mexico, and there you

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:29.620 align:middle line:84%
find the park called
the Olmec Park.

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:33.680 align:middle line:84%
Again, you find gigantic
beings with helmets--

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:38.050 align:middle line:84%
really big structures, some
weighing three of four tons.

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:40.120 align:middle line:90%
This phenomenon is worldwide.

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:42.460 align:middle line:84%
I was in the Museum
of Guatemala City.

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:45.280 align:middle line:84%
There again, you find the
gods with their helmets.

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:46.690 align:middle line:90%
It repeats all the time.

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And they had some
something on their nose,

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:52.480 align:middle line:90%
like a filter to filter the air.

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:55.900 align:middle line:90%
The phenomenon is worldwide.

00:23:55.900 --> 00:24:00.820 align:middle line:84%
There are in old Indian texts
descriptions of the ETs.

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:04.940 align:middle line:84%
One of the humans asked these
ETs, where do you come from?

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:08.370 align:middle line:84%
And he always
pointed to the sky.

00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:11.120 align:middle line:84%
In different questions,
where do you come from?

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.330 align:middle line:90%
They always pointed to the sky.

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:17.130 align:middle line:84%
None of them said, for example,
we came from another continent

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:19.810 align:middle line:84%
or we are visitors
from Atlantis.

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:21.670 align:middle line:90%
That was never the answer.

00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:25.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, what race they had,
what color they had--

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:27.310 align:middle line:90%
we don't know.

00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:29.650 align:middle line:10%
There was no colored
photograph at that time.

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:32.950 align:middle line:84%
At least we have none of
them, so you cannot answer

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:36.220 align:middle line:84%
the question what did different
races and types and colors

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:37.810 align:middle line:90%
of skin come from?

00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:39.250 align:middle line:90%
I have no answer, either.

00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:41.210 align:middle line:84%
Maybe in the mother
spaceship there

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:44.620 align:middle line:84%
were already different
races, and different races

00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:46.220 align:middle line:90%
visited the Earth.

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:48.400 align:middle line:84%
The answer-- the future has
to bring out the answer.

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.360 align:middle line:84%
The genetics will
bring the solutions.

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:53.825 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:53.825 --> 00:24:58.280 align:middle line:90%


00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:01.470 align:middle line:84%
We all are grown
up in a religion.

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:03.290 align:middle line:90%
Now, most of us--

00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:05.600 align:middle line:84%
the Christian, the
Jewish society,

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:07.160 align:middle line:90%
or the Muslim society--

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:09.170 align:middle line:90%
has the same back.

00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:13.450 align:middle line:84%
You see, for the Muslim society
and the Jewish society, Moses,

00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:14.270 align:middle line:90%
Salomon--

00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:17.510 align:middle line:84%
all these figures
exist, and this is

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:19.970 align:middle line:90%
all part of extraterrestrials.

00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:22.070 align:middle line:84%
The God in the
ancient testament--

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:25.780 align:middle line:84%
the God which talked to
Moses was not a god--

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:29.900 align:middle line:84%
was not an omnipotent,
timeless, spiritual being.

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:31.310 align:middle line:90%
It had a body.

00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:34.610 align:middle line:84%
It used engines,
machinery, et cetera.

00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:36.980 align:middle line:84%
So all the religions
of today, they're

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:40.910 align:middle line:84%
based on a misunderstanding;
on an error.

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:44.060 align:middle line:84%
In the Bible we find
the King Solomon.

00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:47.480 align:middle line:84%
King Solomon had
flying machines.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:51.110 align:middle line:84%
These flying machines
were clearly and in detail

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:55.610 align:middle line:84%
described in a large book
called "Kebra Nagast."

00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:59.810 align:middle line:84%
"Kebra Nagast" is the holy
book of the Ethiopian kings,

00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:03.710 align:middle line:84%
and there they say that
King Solomon had several

00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:05.660 align:middle line:90%
of these flying machines.

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:10.460 align:middle line:84%
He was visiting the Queen of
Sheba all the time by air.

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:14.210 align:middle line:84%
So our today's religion,
we adore Solomon.

00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:17.990 align:middle line:84%
We said Salomon is wise because
the Lord gave him his wiseness.

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:20.840 align:middle line:90%
In reality, it was technology.

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:26.060 align:middle line:84%
So today's religion's based
on a misunderstanding.

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:29.720 align:middle line:10%
We have words in our
today's religion of angels.

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:32.120 align:middle line:90%
The angels descend from the sky.

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And the normal people think
angel is a wonderful being.

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:37.490 align:middle line:90%
Angel is a messenger.

00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:39.120 align:middle line:90%
Angel is helpful.

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:42.770 align:middle line:84%
We represent angels, again,
like in the cave paintings

00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:45.860 align:middle line:84%
with helmets, halos,
and, of course, wings.

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:49.310 align:middle line:84%
But these angels
had sex with humans.

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:52.610 align:middle line:84%
If angels would have
been spiritual beings,

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:54.680 align:middle line:84%
they would never
have sex with humans.

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:58.080 align:middle line:84%
These angels described
by the prophet of Enoch

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:01.460 align:middle line:84%
have had a mutiny on
board of their spaceship.

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:03.590 align:middle line:84%
They were against the
highest, because they

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:05.810 align:middle line:90%
want to have sex with humans.

00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:08.810 align:middle line:84%
Or you just read the second
book of the kings of the Bible.

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:11.210 align:middle line:84%
There you see that
an angel coming down

00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:19.010 align:middle line:84%
from the sky destroyed--
killed 185,000 Assyrians, just

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:20.180 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:24.410 align:middle line:84%
There was no fight man
against man, spear or arrows--

00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:26.810 align:middle line:90%
nothing of fighting machines.

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:35.000 align:middle line:84%
An angel from heaven comes down
and destroys 185,000 Assyrians,

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.176 align:middle line:90%
just like this.

00:27:36.176 --> 00:27:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And this is written
in the Bible.

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:39.860 align:middle line:84%
Read the second
book of the kings.

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:43.010 align:middle line:84%
Now in Egypt, again, we
have a temple in Edfu.

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:46.550 align:middle line:84%
Edfu has a temple wall with
wonderful inscriptions.

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And there again, you
read the same story,

00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:51.940 align:middle line:84%
which we find in the second
book of the kings in the Bible.

00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:55.640 align:middle line:84%
Just that in Edfu it said
the pharaoh who was living

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:58.490 align:middle line:84%
there was attacked
by some enemies,

00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:00.680 align:middle line:84%
because they don't want
to give him money anymore.

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:02.310 align:middle line:90%
But he had a friend--

00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:03.530 align:middle line:90%
a friend in heaven.

00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:06.650 align:middle line:84%
His name was Hor-Hut,
a winged disc.

00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:09.350 align:middle line:84%
So he asked Hor-Hut
for help, and Hor-Hut

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:11.900 align:middle line:84%
came down with his
flying machines,

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:14.180 align:middle line:84%
with his winged
disks, and killed

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:16.400 align:middle line:90%
all the enemies of the pharaoh.

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And in the Edfu inscription
it says they did not hear him

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:23.450 align:middle line:90%
or saw him, he was so fast.

00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:27.830 align:middle line:84%
Hor-Hut arrived with a speed
so high they could not see him.

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:29.990 align:middle line:84%
They did not hear him,
but he killed them

00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:35.030 align:middle line:84%
all, which mean he must have
had over the speed of sound.

00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:36.590 align:middle line:90%
It's technology.

00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:38.960 align:middle line:90%
It's not just dreams or wishes.

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:41.570 align:middle line:84%
We have an international
organization

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:45.500 align:middle line:84%
who deals with my
subject of research,

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:49.040 align:middle line:90%
and every society has a logo.

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:52.100 align:middle line:84%
So this thing is the
logo of our society,

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:54.500 align:middle line:90%
and what does it come from?

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:57.420 align:middle line:84%
In South America is
a country, Colombia.

00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:00.670 align:middle line:84%
And in Colombia--
the Tierradentro.

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:03.280 align:middle line:90%
Tierradentro means caves.

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:07.230 align:middle line:84%
Inside the Earth there
were tombs found,

00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:12.080 align:middle line:84%
and one of these tombs obviously
belonged to a very rich Indian,

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:14.210 align:middle line:84%
because he had
different pieces of gold

00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:17.030 align:middle line:84%
in there, colored
feathers, and so on.

00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:22.340 align:middle line:84%
And he wore this object around
his neck, and it was pure gold.

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:25.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, archaeologists
suggest that well, it

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:27.470 align:middle line:90%
must be a sort of insect.

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:28.490 align:middle line:90%
I cannot agree this.

00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:31.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it must have
been very important

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:35.690 align:middle line:84%
for the rich chief of tribe,
otherwise he would not wear it

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:37.344 align:middle line:90%
around his neck in gold.

00:29:37.344 --> 00:29:38.510 align:middle line:90%
So it's something different.

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:39.950 align:middle line:90%
He worshipped it.

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:44.870 align:middle line:84%
That's why we used it as
the logo of our society.

00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:49.220 align:middle line:84%
By the way, this thing has been
reconstructed in a bigger form,

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:50.840 align:middle line:90%
and it definitely flies.

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:53.740 align:middle line:84%
It has absolutely the
aerodynamical conditions.

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:57.205 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:29:57.205 --> 00:30:01.660 align:middle line:90%


00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:08.230 align:middle line:84%
Humans always copied what
they saw from the gods.

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:09.430 align:middle line:90%
In our time--

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:12.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean in the Second World
War, American soldiers

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:18.730 align:middle line:84%
were fighting in the
Pacific Ocean against Japan.

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And they visited
several little islands,

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:23.950 align:middle line:84%
and the natives had
never seen aircrafts.

00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:27.100 align:middle line:84%
The Americans landed
with propellant aircraft,

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:32.190 align:middle line:84%
and they give gifts to
the natives-- for example,

00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:34.150 align:middle line:84%
a piece of chocolate,
or whatever.

00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:37.270 align:middle line:84%
And the natives, later when
the Americans disappeared,

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:40.390 align:middle line:84%
they started to
copy the aircraft,

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:43.190 align:middle line:84%
although they did not
know what this is.

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:46.690 align:middle line:84%
They had no idea that in
the aircraft is an engine.

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:49.090 align:middle line:84%
They did not know what
the propellant is for.

00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:52.060 align:middle line:84%
They simply-- what they
saw with their eyes,

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:55.360 align:middle line:90%
they copied in wood and straw.

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:58.825 align:middle line:84%
We call this cargo
cult. Cargo cults

00:30:58.825 --> 00:31:01.250 align:middle line:90%
are always imitating cults.

00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:03.550 align:middle line:90%
So natives see something--

00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:05.920 align:middle line:84%
we have examples
they saw watches.

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:09.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, they copied watches
made out of wood and straw.

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:11.980 align:middle line:90%
Or they saw radio antennas.

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:15.380 align:middle line:84%
They copied antennas
made out of wood--

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:18.430 align:middle line:84%
of course, with no result.
But they simply imitated

00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:19.880 align:middle line:90%
what they saw.

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:22.390 align:middle line:84%
So I suggest with this
object we have here,

00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:26.380 align:middle line:84%
it's cargo cult. Someone
saw a flying object.

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:28.510 align:middle line:84%
It was very, very
important to him.

00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:31.780 align:middle line:84%
It belonged to the god,
so he made a copy of it.

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:35.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the rich
chief of the Indian tribe

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:36.130 align:middle line:90%
carried around his neck.

00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:41.230 align:middle line:90%


00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:45.970 align:middle line:84%
We have to learn that there
is one God of the universe,

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:50.810 align:middle line:84%
and this God of the universe
is timeless; is fantastic.

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:54.280 align:middle line:84%
We cannot even describe the
real God of the universe.

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
to differentiate

00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:59.950 align:middle line:84%
between so-called gods
which are not God.

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:03.160 align:middle line:84%
So with every respect
we should pray

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:07.330 align:middle line:84%
and praise the real,
omnipotent God,

00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:10.620 align:middle line:84%
which is a wave
spirituality, et cetera.

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:14.140 align:middle line:84%
And we should learn
the gods in antiquity;

00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:17.320 align:middle line:84%
the gods in mythology;
the gods in the holy books

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:21.550 align:middle line:90%
were extraterrestrials.

00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:23.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm Erich von Daniken.

00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:27.790 align:middle line:84%

Beyond the Legends.
