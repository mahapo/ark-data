>>ERICH VON DANIKEN:
We have all heard

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.360 align:middle line:84%
of the myths and the
legends of our history,

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.912 align:middle line:90%
but is there another story?

00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:15.372 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:15.372 --> 00:00:42.970 align:middle line:90%


00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.410 align:middle line:84%
I believe that there is
a connection between all

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:55.110 align:middle line:84%
these old places worldwide,
and at least in Europe, you

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.160 align:middle line:90%
can clearly prove it.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.960 align:middle line:90%
You can show it.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.830 align:middle line:90%


00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.660 align:middle line:10%
Over Europe are
so-called sacred lines,

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.500 align:middle line:10%
sometimes they
call it ley lines.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.910 align:middle line:10%
What is such a line?

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:18.550 align:middle line:90%


00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.280 align:middle line:84%
For example, just take a
ruler, take a map of Europe,

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.360 align:middle line:84%
take a ruler, make
a line over the map.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And by coincidence,
of course, these lines

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.080 align:middle line:84%
will always cross some
religious, no doubt.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.060 align:middle line:10%
The problem is, only in
Europe, we have such a line

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.110 align:middle line:10%
and under the line, every place
is an archaeological place,

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.330 align:middle line:10%
a prehistorical place, like
a few stones, stone rings,

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:47.970 align:middle line:10%
tombs in here.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.870 align:middle line:90%
It's all prehistoric.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can say, OK,
it's still coincidence.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.307 align:middle line:90%
Just make a line over a map.

00:01:54.307 --> 00:01:55.106 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:01:55.106 --> 00:01:56.260 align:middle line:90%
It's not coincidence.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.030 align:middle line:84%
Because all these villages
have the same root words.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.150 align:middle line:90%
You can prove it.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.950 align:middle line:84%
You see, for example, Calais,
Mount Alix, L'Allex, L'Allet,

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:06.820 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.050 align:middle line:84%
This crosses even the Alps
and ends down in Sicily.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.810 align:middle line:84%
So under the line,
you do not only

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.600 align:middle line:84%
have archaeological
prehistoric signs,

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.900 align:middle line:84%
all the villages have
the same root word in it,

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.300 align:middle line:90%
and that makes it provable.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.782 align:middle line:90%
Cannot be coincidence.

00:02:23.782 --> 00:02:28.710 align:middle line:90%


00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, for example, we
have one of these lines

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.440 align:middle line:90%
over the Pyrenees.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.880 align:middle line:84%
The Pyrenees are--
on one side is France

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.970 align:middle line:90%
and on the other side is Spain.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.430 align:middle line:84%
Now the Pyrenees are
mountains, and there is

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.610 align:middle line:90%
one line crossing the Pyrenees.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.220 align:middle line:84%
And of course, this
line crosses, again,

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.990 align:middle line:90%
several villages.

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:53.060 align:middle line:84%
The problem is the villages are
not only prehistoric places,

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:59.330 align:middle line:84%
every word in every villages
contains the name "star."

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:05.360 align:middle line:84%
if you look at the, for example,
Lizette, French, the stars.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.880 align:middle line:90%
Liciella means the stars.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.030 align:middle line:84%
All the line crossing
the Pyrenees ends--

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.220 align:middle line:90%
for example, Aster.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.830 align:middle line:90%
Aster means the star.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.330 align:middle line:84%
The leading place is
Santiago de Compostela.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.610 align:middle line:90%
Stela is the star.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And this is from
pre-historic times.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.720 align:middle line:90%
So it cannot be coincidence.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.990 align:middle line:84%
They call it the Street
of the Stars today.

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.320 align:middle line:84%
The extraterrestrials
ordered our forefathers,

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.640 align:middle line:84%
please make this, because your
generations later, thousands

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.930 align:middle line:84%
of years later, will
realize it, and they

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.913 align:middle line:90%
will ask the real questions.

00:03:39.913 --> 00:03:46.260 align:middle line:90%


00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.580 align:middle line:10%
It's just the lines, which go
for thousands and thousands

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.060 align:middle line:10%
of kilometers from
the north of Germany,

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.600 align:middle line:10%
crossing Germany, crossing
Switzerland, crossing the Alps,

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.330 align:middle line:10%
crossing Italy,
ending in Sicily.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.030 align:middle line:10%
It's just a line for
thousands of kilometers

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.050 align:middle line:10%
with the same religious
and in the religious,

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.930 align:middle line:10%
some prehistoric,
mysterious sites.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.870 align:middle line:10%
So you can prove
it's not coincidence.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.350 align:middle line:84%
You see, our prehistoric
time, they had difficulties

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.209 align:middle line:90%
to cross the Alps, for example.

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.420 align:middle line:84%
They did not know what is on
the other side of the Alps.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.180 align:middle line:84%
The Alps are, this is a
border of four kilometers

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.830 align:middle line:90%
high, 4,000 meters high.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.940 align:middle line:84%
So somebody told them,
OK, make your holy place,

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.250 align:middle line:84%
but please make it exactly here
and here and here and here.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.070 align:middle line:84%
They knew the future generations
would stumble over it.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:44.070 align:middle line:90%


00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.860 align:middle line:84%
You see, one of
these lines crosses

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.240 align:middle line:84%
Brittany over Stonehenge,
crosses Europe,

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.000 align:middle line:84%
crosses the Alps, and
ends right in Delphi.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.480 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:07.400 align:middle line:90%


00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.280 align:middle line:84%
Delphi is the holy
place in Greece.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.980 align:middle line:84%
Delphi was the place
of the god Apollo.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.580 align:middle line:10%
Apollo, again,
was a son of Zeus,

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.060 align:middle line:10%
and Apollo did not come
by coincidence to Delphi.

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.900 align:middle line:84%
Apollo, so says the legend,
Apollo was surrounding,

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.240 align:middle line:90%
in a flying chariot, the Earth.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.520 align:middle line:84%
And there, in today's
Delphi, he realized

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.680 align:middle line:90%
that there were people, humans.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.240 align:middle line:90%
They wanted to learn them.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.090 align:middle line:84%
That was the reason why
he came down in Delphi.

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.983 align:middle line:84%
The people at that time were
still, technologically seen,

00:05:37.983 --> 00:05:39.220 align:middle line:90%
primitive.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.640 align:middle line:84%
Apollo taught them how to
construct houses, houses

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.280 align:middle line:84%
on a mountain and on a hill
so that the houses would not

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:51.440 align:middle line:84%
fall down, even if it's
a hard rain, for example.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.870 align:middle line:84%
Apollo also taught
them in astronomy.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:59.100 align:middle line:10%
Apollo had a son, Asclepius, and
he was the doctor in medicine.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.010 align:middle line:10%
He taught the
humans in medicine.

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.190 align:middle line:84%
Apollo, itself, it says,
he had the flying machines;

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.270 align:middle line:90%
flying wings.

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And every year, twice,
Apollo left Delphi

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.470 align:middle line:84%
and flew to a faraway
land in the far north.

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:15.520 align:middle line:84%
So the legend of Apollo
is connected with flying.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.930 align:middle line:90%


00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.400 align:middle line:84%
I had a speech in Delphi some
years ago, and after my speech,

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.250 align:middle line:84%
there were a professor of
archeology coming to me

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:31.685 align:middle line:90%
and also a high Greek military.

00:06:31.685 --> 00:06:33.560 align:middle line:84%
He was from the military,
from the Air Force,

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.615 align:middle line:90%
the Greek Air Force.

00:06:34.615 --> 00:06:36.800 align:middle line:84%
And they told me,
Erich, do you know

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.490 align:middle line:84%
that all these old holy
places in Greek, they

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.600 align:middle line:84%
are linked together
geometrically?

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.400 align:middle line:90%
I said, no.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.890 align:middle line:84%
This is not possible,
because Greece

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:48.150 align:middle line:84%
is a land full of
mountains and hills,

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.270 align:middle line:84%
and some of these places,
they are in the ocean.

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.230 align:middle line:84%
You know, islands like Crete
you cannot see by the naked eye.

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:55.640 align:middle line:84%
It makes no sense
that they would

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.280 align:middle line:90%
be connected geometrically.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.120 align:middle line:84%
The next morning, I was
invited at the airport,

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.520 align:middle line:84%
at the military airport, and
the professor of archeology

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.810 align:middle line:84%
was there and the commander in
chief of the Air Force also.

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And they had a gigantic
map of Greece on a table.

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:15.014 align:middle line:84%
And I asked them, but what do
you have to do with archeology?

00:07:15.014 --> 00:07:17.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you are a man of
military, of the Air Force.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.190 align:middle line:84%
What do you have to
do with archeology?

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.820 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me, Erich,
it's pure coincidence.

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:26.210 align:middle line:84%
Our young pilots,
which we teach,

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:28.010 align:middle line:84%
they always have to
make some exercise.

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:30.290 align:middle line:84%
For example,
exercises in shooting,

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:33.080 align:middle line:84%
exercises in
measuring, et cetera.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And by the end, when they
come back from their flight,

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:37.730 align:middle line:90%
they have to fill out a report.

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:39.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of--
it was curious

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:42.680 align:middle line:84%
that most of the pilots
always in their reports

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:47.090 align:middle line:84%
have used the same
amount of gasoline.

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:49.860 align:middle line:84%
And the military man
said, we said, come on.

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:50.660 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:51.740 align:middle line:90%
This is not possible.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:53.840 align:middle line:84%
Simply, they started
to measure, and they

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.900 align:middle line:84%
realized it's always the
same distance between one

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.260 align:middle line:90%
place and the other.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:07:59.900 align:middle line:90%
That's how it all came to light.

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:03.560 align:middle line:84%
And the man simply showed
me, look, from one point

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:09.590 align:middle line:84%
to the next, it always makes
the so-called golden section,

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:13.580 align:middle line:84%
always the same distance
from one point to the other.

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And I said, how
is this possible?

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.130 align:middle line:84%
Because in Greek, we had
brilliant mathematicians.

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:21.830 align:middle line:10%
For example, Euclid
was a mathematician.

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:23.900 align:middle line:10%
Pythagoras was a mathematician.

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.720 align:middle line:10%
Even Plato was writing
about Greek mythology.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:30.180 align:middle line:84%
So I said, well, they
calculated this somehow.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:32.179 align:middle line:84%
And the professor of
archeology said, no, Erich.

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:33.440 align:middle line:90%
This is a mistake.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:36.409 align:middle line:84%
Because all these
places were holy

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:40.580 align:middle line:84%
places already in
Stone Age time.

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:42.679 align:middle line:84%
Only later, for
example, in Delphi,

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:45.500 align:middle line:84%
we have today a temple
called Apollo temple.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:50.660 align:middle line:84%
And Apollo temple is constructed
over Stone Age walls.

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:53.780 align:middle line:84%
The Stone Age walls
are much older

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.060 align:middle line:84%
than today's Apollo
temple, which

00:08:56.060 --> 00:09:00.560 align:middle line:84%
dates from the classic Greek,
more or less 2000, 2400,

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.240 align:middle line:90%
2500 BC.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.790 align:middle line:84%
All these places are
older, so they have nothing

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:08.450 align:middle line:84%
to do with Euclid, with
Pythagoras, with Plato,

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:09.710 align:middle line:90%
with these mathematicians.

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:10.980 align:middle line:90%
They existed all before.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:16.760 align:middle line:90%


00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:21.350 align:middle line:84%
So now I was at this airport,
and the professor of archeology

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:22.910 align:middle line:84%
took a compass and
said Erich, you

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:25.100 align:middle line:90%
can prove it very, very easy.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.290 align:middle line:10%
Just go with the
center of the compass

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:30.770 align:middle line:10%
to any archaeological place,
for example to Delphi,

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:34.050 align:middle line:10%
or to Epidaurus, or to
Knossos, it doesn't matter.

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:37.000 align:middle line:10%
And then you point another
archeological place,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.340 align:middle line:10%
a second archeological place,
and then you make a circle.

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:46.250 align:middle line:10%
The circle will always cross
at least two other holy places

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:47.480 align:middle line:10%
from antiquity.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:51.370 align:middle line:10%
And you can repeat
this game 28 times.

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:54.290 align:middle line:10%
So every coincidence is out.

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:56.780 align:middle line:10%
It was done on purpose.

00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:01.850 align:middle line:10%
Somebody in antiquity told
our Stone Age ancestors, OK,

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:05.430 align:middle line:10%
you want to make a
temple in our honor.

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:10.030 align:middle line:84%
We are happy to hear this, but
please, construct it only here.

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:12.260 align:middle line:84%
And the next one, you
construct it only here.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.870 align:middle line:84%
They knew in advance
that thousands of years

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:17.510 align:middle line:90%
later, the humans would fly.

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:19.710 align:middle line:84%
The humans would
measure their countries.

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:23.060 align:middle line:10%
The humans would realize
all of a sudden, my god,

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:27.300 align:middle line:10%
all these old places in
Greece are linked together

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:30.590 align:middle line:10%
geometrically even with
the Mediterranean Sea,

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:32.660 align:middle line:10%
and this cannot be coincidence.

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:34.100 align:middle line:10%
The question is just why.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:40.140 align:middle line:90%


00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:43.140 align:middle line:84%
Extraterrestrials some
thousands of years ago,

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.910 align:middle line:90%
they left, somewhere, a proof.

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:47.690 align:middle line:84%
With the proof,
I mean something.

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:48.950 align:middle line:90%
I have no word of it.

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:50.810 align:middle line:90%
I call it a time capsule.

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:53.180 align:middle line:84%
Something which
cannot be destroyed.

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:56.540 align:middle line:84%
And in this time
capsule, they would tell,

00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:01.010 align:middle line:84%
we were here from that solar
system with that technology.

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:03.350 align:middle line:84%
We found you or your
mankind at that time.

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:05.630 align:middle line:84%
We helped them, et
cetera, et cetera.

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:09.170 align:middle line:84%
We will return in the
far future then again.

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:12.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you create
a time capsule,

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:16.940 align:middle line:84%
a message for future generations
in the far future, how will you

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:18.680 align:middle line:90%
hide this message?

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.320 align:middle line:84%
Can you put it in a
pyramid or in a temple?

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:24.080 align:middle line:84%
It makes no sense because
throughout the thousands

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:26.390 align:middle line:90%
of years there might be wars.

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:28.340 align:middle line:84%
There might be
religious leaders who

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:32.560 align:middle line:84%
will destroy the temple of the
earlier religion, et cetera.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:36.410 align:middle line:84%
Or there are earthquakes
or tsunamis or whatever.

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:39.710 align:middle line:84%
Everything can be destroyed
throughout the thousands

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:40.590 align:middle line:90%
of years.

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:45.560 align:middle line:84%
So they must find a place to
deposit their time capsule

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:49.910 align:middle line:84%
where, throughout thousands of
years, it cannot be destroyed,

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:51.680 align:middle line:90%
wherever that place is.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:57.330 align:middle line:90%


00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:01.980 align:middle line:84%
For myself, the most logical
place would be in orbit.

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:05.800 align:middle line:84%
They simply bring their
time capsule, their message,

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.090 align:middle line:84%
in a satellite and bring
the satellite in orbit

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:10.020 align:middle line:90%
around the Earth.

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, during thousands
of years, this satellite

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:14.430 align:middle line:90%
would turn around the Earth.

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:15.720 align:middle line:90%
No one can destroy it.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:19.530 align:middle line:84%
No earthquakes, no animals,
no dictator, no one

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:20.430 align:middle line:90%
can destroy it.

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:23.760 align:middle line:84%
And only the space
travel generation

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.580 align:middle line:84%
would be able to find
it, to collect it,

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:28.680 align:middle line:84%
because all the
other generations,

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.180 align:middle line:84%
they could not
understand the message.

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:33.690 align:middle line:84%
If, for example, they
would have left their time

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:36.310 align:middle line:90%
capsule somewhere in a pyramid.

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:39.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, archaeologists, let's
say, 200 years ago in the past,

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:43.260 align:middle line:84%
they find this message, and they
would even be able to read it.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.080 align:middle line:84%
They would say,
well, it's mythology.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.250 align:middle line:84%
Somebody is talking
about the stars,

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:49.020 align:middle line:84%
but this is impossible
from the stars.

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:50.730 align:middle line:90%
It must be mythology.

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:52.620 align:middle line:84%
So it comes out
with speculation.

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:54.600 align:middle line:90%
They don't take it for serious.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:59.670 align:middle line:84%
So this time capsule has to be
addressed for a society which

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:01.830 align:middle line:90%
knows space travel.

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:05.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, the problem is,
you've found the place

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:07.140 align:middle line:84%
for a deposit of
the space travel,

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.330 align:middle line:90%
somewhere on Earth or in orbit.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:13.770 align:middle line:84%
How do you manage it that the
generations in the far future

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:17.280 align:middle line:84%
will go and look for
this time capsule?

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:21.330 align:middle line:84%
If you don't know that somewhere
there should be such a--

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:23.670 align:middle line:84%
you will never go
and look for it.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:26.350 align:middle line:84%
That's why they
told our ancestors.

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:28.890 align:middle line:90%
Be it in French Brittany.

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:31.590 align:middle line:84%
Make these lines
of stones exactly

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:34.200 align:middle line:84%
geometrical
Pythagorean triangle.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:37.740 align:middle line:84%
They told our European
Stone Age people,

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:40.170 align:middle line:84%
OK, make your holy
places but only on that

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:42.420 align:middle line:90%
and that and that position.

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:47.220 align:middle line:84%
Because they knew gigantic lines
of 3,000 kilometers or more

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:48.870 align:middle line:90%
would be the result of it.

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:52.740 align:middle line:84%
That's why they told
the ancient Greeks, OK.

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:55.410 align:middle line:84%
You wish to make a
place in our honor?

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:58.500 align:middle line:84%
Please do it, but only on
that place and that place.

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:02.490 align:middle line:84%
They knew exactly that
generations in the far future

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:05.340 align:middle line:84%
would realize it, the
geometrical problem.

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:08.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, they would come to their
head, what's wrong here?

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.730 align:middle line:90%
How is this possible?

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:13.910 align:middle line:84%
Someone may come up
having maybe been

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:17.150 align:middle line:84%
visited by extraterrestrials,
and if, yes--

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:18.850 align:middle line:84%
they will say, well,
extraterrestrials

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:22.440 align:middle line:84%
would not just have left
us without the proof.

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:26.370 align:middle line:84%
There must be proof, a writing,
a message, a time capsule

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:30.320 align:middle line:84%
somewhere, but without
the geometrical pattern,

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.520 align:middle line:84%
the generations in
the future would never

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:34.350 align:middle line:90%
come up with the question.

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:38.150 align:middle line:84%
So you have to make
these things in the past

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:40.850 align:middle line:84%
that the future
generation is baffled.

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:42.870 align:middle line:90%
Hey, hey, what's this?

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:45.750 align:middle line:84%
We have a fact of the
geometrical problem,

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:48.030 align:middle line:84%
and we have the fact
of these holy places,

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:50.310 align:middle line:84%
and they are all
thousands of years old.

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:52.920 align:middle line:84%
They are created in
Stone Age time, nothing

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:56.130 align:middle line:84%
classical Greek time,
long before Pythagoras,

00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:57.690 align:middle line:90%
et cetera, Euclid.

00:14:57.690 --> 00:14:59.940 align:middle line:90%
So we have the miracle.

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:02.125 align:middle line:84%
We have the fact
these things exist.

00:15:02.125 --> 00:15:03.000 align:middle line:90%
We have the question.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.110 align:middle line:90%


00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:09.610 align:middle line:90%
There must be a time capsule.

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:12.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's time that
we go out there

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:14.020 align:middle line:90%
and look for a time capsule.

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:18.280 align:middle line:84%
You see, our astronomy today,
with the space shuttle,

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:21.100 align:middle line:84%
it would be easy to
go up there to look

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:24.220 align:middle line:84%
if there is an artificial
satellite up there.

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:29.200 align:middle line:84%
But nobody does it because
nobody has the question.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:33.280 align:middle line:84%
Now we live in the time
where we have the questions.

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:36.400 align:middle line:10%
Now, we should take the
courage to go out there,

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.640 align:middle line:10%
to measure our solar
system and look

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.580 align:middle line:10%
if there is an artificial
object, the time capsule

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:43.972 align:middle line:10%
of the extraterrestrials.

00:15:43.972 --> 00:15:49.870 align:middle line:90%


00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:54.790 align:middle line:84%
We know of different artifacts,
which are surrounding the Earth

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:57.400 align:middle line:90%
since a long, long time.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.530 align:middle line:84%
They were up there before
the first satellite

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:01.422 align:middle line:90%
of the Russians, Sputnik.

00:16:01.422 --> 00:16:03.130 align:middle line:84%
Later the American
satellites were there.

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:06.250 align:middle line:84%
We know it for sure,
but in science, it

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:11.380 align:middle line:84%
is normal to always look for the
next plausible, natural answer

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:13.540 align:middle line:84%
before you look
for some fantasies.

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:17.020 align:middle line:84%
So the natural scientific
answer for these artifacts

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:19.810 align:middle line:84%
which do exist in
orbit is, it must

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:23.200 align:middle line:84%
be a piece of rock,
just a piece of stone,

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:26.470 align:middle line:84%
which by coincidence, came
into the gravity, maybe

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:28.540 align:middle line:90%
from a meteorite who exploded.

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:31.600 align:middle line:84%
By coincidence, it came to the
gravity of our solar system

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.010 align:middle line:90%
and surrounds our planet.

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:36.680 align:middle line:84%
So that's the next
possible scientific answer.

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:38.620 align:middle line:84%
That's why they
do not spend money

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:41.590 align:middle line:84%
to go there and
collect this artifact.

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:45.420 align:middle line:84%
But definitely, we
know of some artifacts

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:49.030 align:middle line:84%
which surround our globe
in different orbits

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:51.720 align:middle line:84%
before we started
our modern shuttle.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:57.380 align:middle line:90%


00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:59.230 align:middle line:84%
The gods were the
extraterrestrials.

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:01.640 align:middle line:90%
Our ancestors admired the gods.

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:03.290 align:middle line:90%
The gods were the teachers.

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:06.829 align:middle line:84%
Our humans could not understand,
how can someone fly up there?

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:10.730 align:middle line:84%
How can someone have weapons,
lightening, strange things?

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:13.040 align:middle line:84%
Our humans did not
understand the technology,

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.740 align:middle line:90%
so they adored the gods.

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:18.770 align:middle line:84%
The gods were, in reality,
extraterrestrials.

00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And the gods tell
them, make your temple

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:24.109 align:middle line:84%
or your holy-- your
place here, because it

00:17:24.109 --> 00:17:26.150 align:middle line:90%
is linked with the gods.

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:28.640 align:middle line:84%
At least for our ancestors,
some thousands of years

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.000 align:middle line:90%
ago, they were holy places.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:18:01.070 align:middle line:90%


00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:04.620 align:middle line:84%
The ley lines are definitely
not natural lines.

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:07.860 align:middle line:84%
They are definitely
made by humans.

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:13.440 align:middle line:10%
All these holy, sacred
places are put in one line

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:17.850 align:middle line:10%
because the so-called
gods wanted it that way.

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:20.630 align:middle line:10%
So ley line is nothing natural.

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:24.750 align:middle line:10%
Ley lines are made
artificially by humans

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:26.760 align:middle line:10%
but in order of the gods.

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:31.740 align:middle line:84%
When you have small
lines, French Britanny,

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:35.820 align:middle line:84%
you have lines which
are 2,860 meters.

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:37.090 align:middle line:90%
That's nothing.

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:39.750 align:middle line:84%
There they could do it,
humans, without the gods.

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:42.660 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as you have lines
crossing the Alps, 3,000

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:45.210 align:middle line:84%
kilometers, or in
ancient Greek, you

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:49.470 align:middle line:84%
have this geometrical pattern,
where every pre-historical site

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:52.050 align:middle line:84%
is linked together
with the next one.

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:53.970 align:middle line:84%
And you cannot see
it by your eyes.

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:55.220 align:middle line:90%
It is not possible.

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:58.590 align:middle line:84%
That for example, an old
Greek priest says, hey, OK.

00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:00.570 align:middle line:90%
The next temple we make there.

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:03.960 align:middle line:84%
Because there are mountains
between them you cannot see

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:05.310 align:middle line:90%
with the naked eye.

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:08.580 align:middle line:84%
Or from Delphi, you cannot
look with the naked eye

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:09.660 align:middle line:90%
to the island of Crete.

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:11.250 align:middle line:90%
Somebody has to guide you.

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:14.010 align:middle line:84%
You cannot do it
by the naked eye,

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:17.380 align:middle line:84%
and the guidance came from the
extraterrestrials, the gods.

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:23.310 align:middle line:90%


00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:26.190 align:middle line:10%
These holy places, they
exist since eternity,

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:28.620 align:middle line:10%
since Stone Age times
so nothing has changed.

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:30.200 align:middle line:10%
You can't change nothing there.

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:35.960 align:middle line:90%


00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:38.750 align:middle line:84%
There are books on the
market, for example,

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:40.880 align:middle line:90%
from a New Zealand pilot.

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:45.080 align:middle line:84%
His name is Bruce Cathie,
and he has a world grid,

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.790 align:middle line:84%
which these lines go
all over the planet,

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:51.200 align:middle line:84%
including in faraway
Peru, Easter Island.

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:54.540 align:middle line:84%
All these places
are linked together.

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:58.730 align:middle line:84%
But this is not my research,
which I can personally confirm,

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:00.800 align:middle line:84%
because I did not
make this research.

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:04.760 align:middle line:10%
But it's out in the books of
Bruce Cathie, is his name.

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:08.225 align:middle line:10%
He was an airline pilot
for Air New Zealand.

00:20:08.225 --> 00:20:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And his books are on
the market, and he

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:13.010 align:middle line:84%
says there is all geometry,
all linked together.

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:16.460 align:middle line:84%
I know it for sure for Europe,
the so-called ley lines,

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:20.700 align:middle line:84%
because we can prove it with
the same names, the same root

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:21.500 align:middle line:90%
words.

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:23.660 align:middle line:84%
And you can prove it
definitely in Greece.

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:26.900 align:middle line:10%
All you need is a compass and
you have places linked together

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:28.190 align:middle line:10%
in the same distances.

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:32.500 align:middle line:84%
The reasons for the ley lines
and for this so-called holy

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:35.620 align:middle line:90%
or sacred geometry are us.

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:40.370 align:middle line:84%
The extraterrestrials ordered
our prehistoric ancestors,

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:44.570 align:middle line:84%
make your temples on
that and that place.

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:48.890 align:middle line:84%
Because they knew the future
generations, thousands of years

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:52.530 align:middle line:84%
in the future, they will
measure their countries.

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:56.020 align:middle line:84%
They will fly, and then
they will realize that this

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:59.270 align:middle line:84%
geometrical pattern
cannot be coincidence.

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:02.150 align:middle line:84%
So this was made on
purpose, and now they

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:03.394 align:middle line:90%
come up with the questions.

00:21:03.394 --> 00:21:04.560 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly what we have.

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:07.820 align:middle line:90%


00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:10.250 align:middle line:84%
Extraterrestrials,
were they here?

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:11.620 align:middle line:90%
Where is the proof?

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:13.070 align:middle line:90%
Where is the time capsule?

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:15.950 align:middle line:84%
Without the
geometrical pattern, we

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:17.702 align:middle line:90%
would never ask the question.

00:21:17.702 --> 00:21:19.410 align:middle line:84%
That's why it has to
be done in the past.

00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:24.400 align:middle line:90%


00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.110 align:middle line:90%
